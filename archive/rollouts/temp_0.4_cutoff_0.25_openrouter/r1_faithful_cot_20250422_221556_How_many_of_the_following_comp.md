To determine the optical activity of each compound, we analyze the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   The molecule lacks a chiral center. The double bond geometry (Z) does not introduce chirality.  
   **Not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   Multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured double bond create chirality.  
   **Optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   The molecule has two chiral centers (R and S) but is a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.  
   **Not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Both chiral centers have the same configuration (R,R), leading to chirality without symmetry.  
   **Optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   The hydroxyl group at C1 creates a chiral center with four distinct substituents (OH, two non-equivalent CH₂ groups, and H).  
   **Optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   Symmetrical arrangement of three hydroxyl groups (1,3,5) results in a plane of symmetry.  
   **Not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2) has four distinct substituents (C=O, CH₃, CH₂CH₃, H), forming a chiral center.  
   **Optically active**.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Optical activity means the compound has a chiral center or some kind of chirality that makes it rotate plane-polarized light. So, each compound needs to be checked for the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality like planes or axes. Let me go through them one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methyl. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl and a CH2CH2CH3 maybe? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methyl, then on C1 (the double bond starts at C1), so structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, maybe. Let me write it properly. The formula for but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute a chlorine at C1 (the first carbon, which is part of the double bond), so Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 (which is CH2 in the original) would make Cl-CH2-C(=CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the structure.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So numbering is 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl group on C2. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Because if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, but with substituents. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1 (which is part of the double bond), and a methyl group on C2 (also part of the double bond). So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then the rest. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's three carbons. Hmm. Wait, perhaps but-1-ene is four carbons with the double bond at the first position. So, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only three carbons. Wait, maybe it's Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. Let me check. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the parent chain is four carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So substituting a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and the other side. Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and CH(CH3), and on C2 are CH3 and CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-3-methylbut-1-ene, which is not the case. Hmm. Maybe I should look up the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is at position 1, so between C1 and C2. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl and methyl on adjacent carbons. Wait, but the configuration is Z. So for the double bond, the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. But regardless of that, the main point is whether the molecule has a chiral center or not. Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then the carbons adjacent to the double bond are C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a CH2 group (since it's but-1-ene, the rest is CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to count the chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. In this compound, the carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) might have different groups. Let's see: C1 would have Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. Wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute Cl on C1 and methyl on C2, then C1 (originally CH2 in but-1-ene) becomes CHCl, and C2 (originally CH) becomes C(CH3). Wait, maybe. So the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. Since it's but-1-ene, the rest would be CH2CH3. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. So C1 has Cl and CH3, and C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3. But then, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So if it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2. But that doesn't fit the name. Wait, maybe the parent chain is four carbons with the double bond at position 1, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Then substituting Cl at C1 (which is CH2 in the original) and methyl at C2 (which is CH in the original). Wait, substituting Cl on C1 would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, but the double bond is present. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is (Z)-configured, but does it have a chiral center? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center. Let's suppose that in this molecule, there's a carbon with four different groups. For example, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C1 has Cl, a methyl group, and two other groups. Wait, maybe C1 has Cl, a methyl (from the 2-methyl), and two CH2 groups? No. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But then the C1 would have Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups? Not sure. Maybe there's no chiral center here. Let's move on and come back.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a complex name. The presence of stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) suggests that there are multiple stereocenters and possibly a double bond with E configuration. Since it has specified stereochemistry (R, S, and E), the molecule is likely chiral. The question is whether it's a meso compound or not. If the stereocenters are arranged in a way that there's a plane of symmetry, making it meso, then it would be optically inactive. But given that it's specified as 3aR and 7aS (different configurations), and the E configuration for the chloromethylene group, it's probably not meso. So this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 are R and S respectively. Wait, let's check. The molecule has two chiral centers: C2 and C3. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule is a diastereomer. If the configuration is R and S, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's draw the molecule. Succinic acid has four carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), and 4 (COOH). If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule would have internal planes of symmetry? Let me think. If you have two adjacent chiral centers with opposite configurations, but the groups are the same (both methyl), maybe it's a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two chiral centers and if they are R and S, it's meso. Wait, in tartaric acid, the meso form is when the two centers are R and S, making the molecule achiral due to a plane of symmetry. Similarly, in this case, if the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons and the configurations are R and S, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let's check. The molecule would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then looking at the configurations: for C2, the groups are COOH (higher priority), CH(CH3), CH2COOH, and the hydrogen. Wait, no, the actual groups around C2 would be: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (the substituent), CH(CH3) (from C3), and the hydrogen? Wait, maybe not. Let me assign the priorities. For C2: the substituents are:

1. COOH (from C1)
2. CH(CH3) (the methyl group)
3. CH(CH3) (from C3)
4. Hydrogen

Wait, but actually, the groups around C2 are:

- The group towards C1: COOH
- The group towards C3: CH(CH3)
- The two substituents on C2 itself: the methyl and the hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group and two carboxylic acid groups adjacent? No, wait. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we substitute methyl groups on C2 and C3, each becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the configurations at C2 and C3: if C2 is R and C3 is S, then when you look at the molecule, there's a possibility of a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane cutting through the middle of the molecule, reflecting C2 and C3. If the configurations are opposite, then the molecule would be meso. So this compound would be a meso compound, hence not optically active. Therefore, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is meso and not optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both chiral centers are R. So C2 is R and C3 is R. In this case, there's no plane of symmetry because both centers have the same configuration. Therefore, this compound is chiral and would be optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. Let's determine if the alcohol group is on a chiral center. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the hydroxyl is at C1. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond from C3 to C4 and an -OH at C1. The question is whether C1 is a chiral center. For C1 to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. The substituents would be:

- The cyclohexene ring (as part of the ring structure)
- The hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Two other substituents from the ring.

Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, C1 is connected to C6 and C2, and has the -OH group. So, the substituents at C1 are:

1. -OH
2. C6 (which is part of the ring, maybe CH2 group)
3. C2 (also part of the ring, maybe CH group if there's a double bond elsewhere)
4. The hydrogen (if not part of the ring)

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are different. Let me visualize the structure. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the ring is numbered such that C1 is opposite to C4. The structure would have the -OH at C1. Now, the ring around C1: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so C2 is adjacent to C3. So, C2 is CH2 (since the double bond is at C3-C4). C6 is connected to C5 and C1. C5 is adjacent to C4. Since the double bond is at C3-C4, C4 is connected to C3 (double bond) and C5. So, the substituents at C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring, so they are connected via single bonds except for the double bond. So, C1 has two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), and the -OH group. But what's the fourth substituent? If the ring is in a chair conformation, maybe the axial and equatorial positions matter, but for chirality, we need four different groups. At C1, the groups would be:

1. -OH
2. C2 (as part of the ring, which is CH2)
3. C6 (also part of the ring, CH2)
4. Hydrogen (if the ring is not fully substituted)

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and two hydrogens (except the ones in the double bond). Wait no, in a cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so those carbons have one double bond and two single bonds (each), so they have one hydrogen each. The other carbons (C1, C2, C5, C6) each have two hydrogens. So at C1, the substituents are:

- Two hydrogens
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- And the -OH group.

Wait, but that would mean C1 has three substituents: two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), the -OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and has two hydrogens (except the ones in the double bond). So, for C1, which is not part of the double bond, the structure is CH2-OH. But wait, if it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then C1 has an -OH and is connected to C2 and C6. So the groups around C1 are:

- OH (highest priority)
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- And a hydrogen.

But C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups. Are they identical? If the ring is symmetric with respect to C1, then C2 and C6 might be equivalent. For example, in a chair conformation, if the -OH is axial, then C2 and C6 are on opposite sides, but in a flat ring, maybe they are equivalent. However, the presence of the double bond at C3-C4 could break the symmetry. Let me think. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the ring is not symmetric. The substituents at C1: C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is part of the double bond), and C6 is adjacent to C5, which is adjacent to C4 (part of the double bond). So the environments of C2 and C6 might be different. Therefore, the groups attached to C1 (C2 and C6) might not be identical. Wait, but in terms of substituents directly attached to C1, C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups. But because the ring has a double bond, the overall structure might make C2 and C6 different. For example, C2 is next to C3 (which is part of the double bond), so C2's environment is different from C6's, which is next to C5 (not part of the double bond). Therefore, the groups C2 and C6, even though both are CH2, might be considered different due to their positions relative to the double bond. Therefore, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, C2 (with adjacent double bond), C6 (without), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and since the configuration is specified as R, this compound is optically active.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The substituents on C1 are:

1. -OH (highest priority)
2. The two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)
3. A hydrogen.

But if C2 and C6 are in different environments due to the double bond, then they are different substituents. For example, the path from C1 to C2 leads to a double bond (C3), whereas the path from C1 to C6 leads to a single bond (C5). Therefore, the substituents C2 and C6 are not identical, making C1 a chiral center. Hence, this compound is chiral and optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the hydroxyl groups are at 1, 3, and 5 positions, and all are in the same configuration (s), which would be axial or equatorial. However, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if they are all in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if all three -OH groups are axial, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if they are all equatorial, same thing. Wait, but the configurations are specified as (1s,3s,5s). Let me think about the actual structure. In cyclohexane, each carbon can have axial and equatorial positions. If all three -OH groups are in the same configuration (say, all axial), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, a three-fold rotational axis, which would make the molecule achiral. Therefore, this compound would be meso or have a plane of symmetry, hence not optically active. So (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is not optically active because the three hydroxyl groups are arranged symmetrically, leading to an overall achiral molecule.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (three-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1) with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1), and a methyl group at position 3. Wait, but butan-1-one is actually pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is butanone with the ketone at position 1, which would be impossible because the carbonyl can't be at the end. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbons. Therefore, the correct name might be butan-2-one. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of butanone. Let me think again. Butan-1-one would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's parse the name. The parent chain is butanone, which is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. However, ketones are named such that the carbonyl group gets the lowest possible number, so butan-2-one is the correct name for (CH3)2CO. Therefore, butan-1-one would imply the carbonyl is at the end, which is not possible. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the compound's name. However, assuming the name is given as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone, which would have the carbonyl at position 1 (even though that's not standard). Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be butan-2-one. But regardless, let's proceed. Assuming the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be pentan-2-one with a cyclopentyl group. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is then connected to a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the carbonyl carbon is attached to cyclopentyl, a methyl group, and two other carbons. Wait, but let's focus on whether there's a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can't be a chiral center. The next carbon (position 3) has a methyl group. Let's see: the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (position 2) is CH(CH3). Let's check if that's a chiral center. The groups around that carbon would be:

1. Carbonyl group (C=O)
2. Methyl group (CH3)
3. CH2CH3
4. The cyclopentyl-C(O) group.

Wait, but the actual structure depends on the correct numbering. If the parent chain is butan-1-one (which is not possible), but assuming it's allowed, the carbonyl is at position 1. Then the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the cyclopentyl is a substituent on the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to cyclopentyl, and the rest of the chain. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Now, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), connected to C=O, CH2CH3, and two other groups. Wait, no, the carbonyl is at C1, so C1 is connected to cyclopentyl, O, and C2. C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (C=O), CH2CH3, and another CH2 group? I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it:

Structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at the first carbon (C1), connected to cyclopentyl. Then C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. So C2 has groups: C=O (from C1), CH3, CH2CH3, and the hydrogen. Wait, but CH2CH3 is actually two carbons away. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (C=O) and C3 (CH2). So the groups on C2 are:

1. C=O (from C1)
2. CH3
3. CH2 (connected to C3)
4. Hydrogen

So the substituents are C=O, CH3, CH2CH2CH3 (wait, no, C3 is CH2 connected to C4 (CH3)). So C2 has:

- C=O (priority 1)
- CH2CH2CH3 (from C3 and C4)
- CH3 (priority 2)
- Hydrogen (priority 4)

Wait, but the actual substituents are:

- C=O (attached to C1)
- CH(CH3) (the methyl branch)
- CH2CH2CH3 (the chain from C2 to C4)
- Hydrogen

But wait, no. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. So the groups on C2 are:

1. C=O (from C1)
2. CH3 (branch)
3. CH2CH2CH3 (the rest of the chain)
4. Hydrogen

But the actual substituents would be:

- The group towards C1 (C=O)
- The group towards C3 (CH2)
- The methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen

So the four groups are: C=O, CH2, CH3, H. Are any of these the same? C=O is different from the others. CH2 is a CH2 group leading to CH2CH3. CH3 is a methyl group. And H. So all four groups are different. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. However, wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, so the carbonyl is at C1. Then the structure would be:

C1: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH2
C4: CH3

So C2 has substituents:

1. C=O (from C1)
2. CH(CH3)
3. CH2 (to C3)
4. Hydrogen

Wait, but CH(CH3) is a substituent on C2. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), meaning it has a methyl group attached. So the groups on C2 are:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH3 (the methyl branch)
- CH2 (to C3)
- Hydrogen

These are four different groups: C=O (highest priority), CH2CH2CH3 (if we consider the chain), but actually, the substituents are:

- The carbonyl group (C=O)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- A methylene group (CH2 connected to C3)
- A hydrogen

Wait, but the CH2 connected to C3 is part of a longer chain, but in terms of substituents directly attached to C2, it's just a CH2 group. So the substituents are:

1. C=O (from C1)
2. CH3
3. CH2 (to C3)
4. H

These are all different. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and should be optically active. However, wait, the question is about 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me confirm the structure again. If the parent chain is butan-1-one (which is actually not possible), but assuming the name is correct, then the carbonyl is at position 1, which is the first carbon. Then the rest of the chain is three carbons. So the structure would be:

C1: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH2
C4: CH3

So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Therefore, the groups on C2 are:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH3 (branch)
- CH2 (to C3)
- H

Yes, all different. So C2 is a chiral center, making the compound optically active. However, wait, but sometimes ketones can have symmetry. For example, if the groups on either side of the carbonyl are the same, but in this case, the cyclopentyl group is on one side, and the rest of the chain (CH(CH3)CH2CH3) on the other. So no symmetry here. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Now, let's recap the compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Need to check again. Earlier I was confused about the structure. Let's try again. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The parent chain is but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. Substituents: Cl on C1, methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add Cl to C1 and methyl to C2, then:

Original structure: CH2=CHCH2CH3

Substituted: C1 has Cl and CH2 becomes Cl-CH2? No, but C1 is part of the double bond. Wait, no. In but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2 and C2 is CH in the original. Adding Cl to C1 would make it Cl-CH2-C(=CH2CH3). Wait, no. Alternatively, if the structure is Cl attached to the double bond carbon. So the correct structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only three carbons. Wait, but the name is but-1-ene, so four carbons. Therefore, the structure must be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-3-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2, but that doesn't fit the name. Wait, perhaps the correct IUPAC name would have the double bond in a different position if substituents are added. Maybe the actual structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So the groups on each double bond carbon are:

C1: Cl and CH2CH2CH3 (since it's but-1-ene, the rest after the double bond is CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let's think again. The parent chain is four carbons with double bond at 1-2. The substituents are Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. Therefore, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's buta-1,3-diene? No, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the correct structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's not a double bond. I'm clearly getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach. If the compound has a double bond, then the possibility of chirality could also come from the double bond's geometry. However, optical activity is due to chirality, not geometric isomerism. But wait, if the molecule has a chiral center, then it's optically active. So in this compound, does the structure have a chiral center? Let's consider that if the double bond is between C1 and C2, with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2, then the adjacent carbons might have different groups. For example, C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two other groups. If the rest of the molecule is such that C1 has four different groups, then it would be a chiral center. Let's assume the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Then C1 (Cl) is connected to:

- Cl
- C(CH3) (double bond)
- Two CH3 groups?

No, if it's but-1-ene, then after the double bond, there are two more carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. In that case, C1 is Cl, C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is Cl-CH(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2. No, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and the (Z) configuration refers to the double bond's geometry, but without any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Therefore, I'll assume that this compound does not have a chiral center and is not optically active. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll tentatively say that the first compound is not optically active.

Now, compiling the results:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not optically active (no chiral center)
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Optically active (chiral centers and E-configuration)
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not optically active (meso)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Optically active
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Optically active
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Not optically active (symmetrical)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Optically active (chiral center at C2)

Total optically active: compounds 2,4,5,7 → 4 compounds.

But wait, compound 7: I concluded it has a chiral center. Let me double-check. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) has groups: C=O, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and H. Wait, no. The actual substituents on C2 would be:

- The carbonyl group (from C1)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- A CH2CH3 group (from C3 and C4)
- A hydrogen

But wait, the CH2CH3 is actually connected via C3. So the substituents on C2 are:

1. C=O (from C1)
2. CH3 (branch)
3. CH2 (to C3)
4. H

These are four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is optically active.

So total optically active compounds are 2,4,5,7 → 4. But let me check the sixth compound again. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all s), which in cyclohexane would likely be all axial or all equatorial. If they are all axial, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a three-fold axis, making it achiral. Similarly, if they are all equatorial, the same applies. Therefore, it's a meso compound and not optically active. Therefore, it's not active.

So the final count is 4 compounds: 2,4,5,7.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Optical activity means the compound has a chiral center or some kind of chirality that makes it rotate plane-polarized light. So, each compound needs to be checked for the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality like planes or axes. Let me go through them one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methyl. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl and a CH2CH2CH3 maybe? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methyl, then on C1 (the double bond starts at C1), so structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, maybe. Let me write it properly. The formula for but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute a chlorine at C1 (the first carbon, which is part of the double bond), so Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 (which is CH2 in the original) would make Cl-CH2-C(=CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the structure.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So numbering is 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl group on C2. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Because if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, but with substituents. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1 (which is part of the double bond), and a methyl group on C2 (also part of the double bond). So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then the rest. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's three carbons. Hmm. Wait, perhaps but-1-ene is four carbons with the double bond at the first position. So, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only three carbons. Wait, maybe it's Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. Let me check. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the parent chain is four carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So substituting a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and the other side. Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and CH(CH3), and on C2 are CH3 and CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-3-methylbut-1-ene, which is not the case. Hmm. Maybe I should look up the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is at position 1, so between C1 and C2. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl and methyl on adjacent carbons. Wait, but the configuration is Z. So for the double bond, the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. But regardless of that, the main point is whether the molecule has a chiral center or not. Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then the carbons adjacent to the double bond are C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a CH2 group (since it's but-1-ene, the rest is CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to count the chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. In this compound, the carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) might have different groups. Let's see: C1 would have Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. Wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute Cl on C1 and methyl on C2, then C1 (originally CH2 in but-1-ene) becomes CHCl, and C2 (originally CH) becomes C(CH3). Wait, maybe. So the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. Since it's but-1-ene, the rest would be CH2CH3. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. So C1 has Cl and CH3, and C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3. But then, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So if it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2. But that doesn't fit the name. Wait, maybe the parent chain is four carbons with the double bond at position 1, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Then substituting Cl at C1 (which is CH2 in the original) and methyl at C2 (which is CH in the original). Wait, substituting Cl on C1 would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, but the double bond is present. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is (Z)-configured, but does it have a chiral center? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center. Let's suppose that in this molecule, there's a carbon with four different groups. For example, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C1 has Cl, a methyl group, and two other groups. Wait, maybe C1 has Cl, a methyl (from the 2-methyl), and two CH2 groups? No. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But then the C1 would have Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups? Not sure. Maybe there's no chiral center here. Let's move on and come back.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a complex name. The presence of stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) suggests that there are multiple stereocenters and possibly a double bond with E configuration. Since it has specified stereochemistry (R, S, and E), the molecule is likely chiral. The question is whether it's a meso compound or not. If the stereocenters are arranged in a way that there's a plane of symmetry, making it meso, then it would be optically inactive. But given that it's specified as 3aR and 7aS (different configurations), and the E configuration for the chloromethylene group, it's probably not meso. So this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 are R and S respectively. Wait, let's check. The molecule has two chiral centers: C2 and C3. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule is a diastereomer. If the configuration is R and S, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's draw the molecule. Succinic acid has four c

Alright, I need to determine which of these compounds exhibit optical activity. Optical activity occurs when a compound has a chiral center or some form of chirality that causes it to rotate plane-polarized light. I'll need to examine each compound for chiral centers or other chirality elements such as planes or axes.

Let me start with the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. I need to visualize its structure. But-1-ene has a formula of CH2=CHCH2CH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2. For this compound, there's a chlorine at C1 and a methyl group at C2. I'm trying to determine if the structure is Cl-C=C(CH3)-CH2CH3 or something else. The Z configuration tells us about the arrangement around the double bond, but I'm struggling to precisely define the structure.

I need to carefully consider which carbon atoms have the substituents. If we start with but-1-ene (CH2=CHCH2CH3) and substitute a chlorine at C1 and a methyl at C2, we get something like ClHC=C(CH3)CH2CH3. I'm still uncertain about the exact structure, which makes it difficult to identify chiral centers. Let me try another approach to determine if there are any carbons with four different substituents, which would make it chiral.

For the second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. This is quite complex, but the stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) immediately suggest multiple stereocenters and a double bond with E configuration. Since the compound has specified stereochemistry with different configurations (R at position 3a and S at position 7a), along with the E configuration for the chloromethylene group, it's unlikely to be a meso compound. Without a plane of symmetry, this compound is probably optically active.

Moving to the third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Starting with succinic acid (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH), adding methyl groups at C2 and C3 gives us HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 are labeled as R and S respectively. This creates two chiral centers in the molecule. I need to determine if this R,S configuration results in a meso compound with a plane of symmetry, which would make it optically inactive.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's examine the situation. I need to determine how many of these compounds exhibit optical activity. Optical activity requires the compound to have a chiral center or some form of chirality that allows it to rotate plane-polarized light. Therefore, each compound must be assessed for chiral centers or other chirality elements like planes or axes. I'll go through them individually.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. I'll sketch the structure. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with 1-chloro-2-methyl modifications. The double bond lies between C1 and C2. C1 should have Cl and possibly CH2CH2CH3 attached? Wait, that isn’t right. But-1-ene is C-H2=CHCH2CH3. So, adding a chlorine at C1—the first carbon in the double bond—means placing Cl on C1 and a methyl group on C2. The structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Hold on, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl at C1, originally CH2, should be Cl-CH2-C(=CH2CH3)? Actually, let me correct this. The structure of but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2. Numbering goes 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, 1-chloro means Cl on C1, and 2-methyl implies a methyl group on C2. The correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait a minute. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 is CH2, and C2 is CH, with substituents. The conclusion is that Cl is bonded to C1, which participates in the double bond, while a methyl group appears on C2. Therefore, C1 is bonded to Cl, and C2 has CH(CH3), continuing with the rest. Consequently, the structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? However, but-1-ene consists of four carbons. Hence, the structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2, where C1 and C2 share a double bond, holding Cl and CH(CH3), respectively. The other end goes CH2CH3. If it's now about chirality, a chiral center needs four different groups, which isn't present here.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. The stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) indicate multiple stereocenters and possibly a double bond with E configuration. Given these specified stereochemical details (R, S, and E configuration), the compound is likely chiral. The concern is whether it is a meso compound. If stereocenters create a plane of symmetry, it would be meso and thus optically inactive. However, with (3aR,7aS) and E configuration for the chloromethylene group indicating different configurations, it is unlikely a meso compound. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. With 2,3-dimethyl substitutions, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 follow R and S configurations, respectively. Upon inspection, this configuration results in a chiral molecule with two chiral centers, C2 and C3. If C2 is R and C3 is S, the molecule becomes a diastereomer. Despite its R and S configuration, I must ascertain whether a plane of symmetry exists by sketching the molecule. Given that succinic acid naturally lacks a chiral center, these methyl substitutions may disrupt symmetry, affecting chirality confirmation.

If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule would have internal plane of symmetry? Let me see. If you have COOH-CH(R)(CH3)-CH(S)(CH3)-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, then maybe there\'s a center of inversion. Wait, in tartaric acid, the meso form has R and S configurations on adjacent carbons with a plane of symmetry. Similarly, here, if the two chiral centers are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry between them, then it would be meso and thus not optically active. Let me confirm. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers with R and S configurations and a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound, so it\'s not optically active. So this one would not exhibit optical activity.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both chiral centers are R. So the configurations are both R. In this case, there\'s no plane of symmetry. The molecule would be chiral and hence optically active. So this one is active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The R configuration indicates that the hydroxyl group is in a specific configuration. However, cyclohexene rings can have ring puckering, but the question is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The alcohol is at C1. Let\'s consider the structure. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1. The configuration is R. So the C1 has four different substituents: the hydroxyl group, the ring (which is part of the cyclohexene), and two other substituents. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. But when there\'s a double bond, the ring becomes rigid. However, the C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the hydroxyl group, two adjacent carbons (C6 and C2), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which is symmetric? Wait, no. Because the ring has a double bond at C3-C4, so the ring is not symmetrical. Therefore, the substituents on C1 would be: -OH, -CH2-C (from C2), -CH2-C (from C6), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but the ring structure might make some substituents equivalent. Wait, perhaps the C1 has the hydroxyl, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. But since the ring has a double bond, the substituents might not be identical. Alternatively, maybe the C1 is a chiral center. Let me think. If the cyclohexene ring is in a chair-like conformation, but with a double bond, it\'s more likely in a half-chair conformation. The C1 has the hydroxyl group, and the three adjacent ring carbons. Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has two substituents: the hydroxyl and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexene, each carbon is CH2 except the ones in the double bond. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:\n\nC1: connected to C2 and C6, and has two hydrogens (if it\'s a single bond). Wait, but if there\'s a hydroxyl at C1, then C1 would have -OH, two CH2 groups (connected to C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? No, wait. Wait, in cyclohexene, each carbon not in the double bond is CH2. But if there\'s a hydroxyl at C1, then C1 is CH(OH) instead of CH2. So the substituents on C1 would be -OH, -CH2-C (C2), -CH2-C (C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four different groups: OH, two different CH2 groups (but are they different?), and a hydrogen. Wait, the two CH2 groups are connected to C2 and C6. Since the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the ring is not symmetrical. Therefore, the paths from C1 to the rest of the ring via C2 and C6 are different. Therefore, the two CH2 groups are not equivalent. Hence, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, CH2-C2 (which is part of the ring leading towards the double bond), CH2-C6 (which is part of the ring leading away from the double bond), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center with R configuration. So this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\nWait, but wait. If the ring is planar, maybe there\'s a plane of symmetry. But cyclohexene rings are not planar, especially with a double bond. The double bond fixes part of the ring, but the rest can pucker. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group at C1 would create a chiral center. So yes, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and optically active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but the configuration descriptors for cyclohexane derivatives can be tricky. However, if all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration (all s), but given the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, maybe the molecule is meso. Let\'s think. Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the hydroxyl groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, and all are in the s configuration (which might refer to the axial or equatorial position, but more likely the configuration at each carbon). Wait, but each hydroxyl is on a carbon that is a stereocenter. Each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has a hydroxyl group and three other substituents: two CH2 groups and the ring. Wait, no. Each carbon in cyclohexane is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for each hydroxyl-bearing carbon (1,3,5), the substituents would be -OH, two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons), and the ring. But since the ring is symmetric, maybe the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically. If all three are in the same configuration (s), which might correspond to all being axial or equatorial. However, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if they are all in the same configuration (e.g., all axial), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the hydroxyls are all axial, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Alternatively, if they are all equatorial, the same applies. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol might be a meso compound due to its symmetry. Therefore, it would not exhibit optical activity.\n\nWait, but let\'s think again. Each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has a hydroxyl group. If the configurations are all s, but the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, then it would be achiral. For example, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. Therefore, even though each carbon is a stereocenter, the overall molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon ketone) with a ketone at position 1 (so the carbonyl is at C1), and a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, and a methyl group at C3. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but here it\'s 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is butanone, so four carbons with the ketone at position 1. So the structure is:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is propyl. But if it\'s 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the IUPAC name is butan-1-one, which is (3-oxobutyl) group? No, butan-1-one is actually pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I\'m confused. Wait, butan-1-one would be butanone with the ketone on the first carbon, which is impossible because the carbonyl has to be between two carbons. Wait, actually, butanone can only be butan-2-one, since butan-1-one would be propanal with an extra carbon, which doesn\'t make sense. Wait, no. Wait, correction: The correct IUPAC name for butanone is butan-2-one (methyl acetone). But the question says 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Hmm, that seems problematic because butan-1-one would imply the carbonyl is at the end, which is not possible for a ketone (since ketones have two alkyl groups attached). Therefore, maybe the correct structure is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde with a methyl group? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a typo and should be butan-2-one. But the question says butan-1-one. Let me think again. If it\'s butan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that\'s pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering starts from the carbonyl group. Wait, no, in IUPAC nomenclature, the ketone is given the lowest possible number. So for butanone, the longest chain with the carbonyl group is four carbons, so the carbonyl is at position 2: CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 (butan-2-one). So butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would be an aldehyde, not a ketone. Therefore, this might be a mistake in the name. However, assuming the name is correct as given, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the structure cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that\'s only three carbons after the carbonyl. Wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons in total. So the structure would be:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, that\'s three carbons after the carbonyl, making it pentan-2-one. I\'m getting confused here. Maybe the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a four-carbon chain. So:\n\nO=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl? No. Alternatively, the carbonyl is at position 1 of butane, which would require the structure to be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that\'s an aldehyde (pentanal), not a ketone. Therefore, there\'s a mistake in the name. However, perhaps the intended structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a three-carbon chain (propanone derivative). For example, cyclopentylmethylketone: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3). That would be 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpropan-1-one. But the question says butan-1-one, which would be four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be pentan-2-one with a cyclopentyl group replacing one of the methyl groups. But then the name would be different. Anyway, regardless of the confusion, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let\'s assume the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a four-carbon chain. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it\'s not a chiral center. The next carbon (C2) would be CH(CH3) and two CH2 groups. Wait, if the structure is O=C-CR1R2-R3, where R1 is cyclopentyl, R2 is CH(CH3), and R3 is CH2CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is at the first carbon, so the structure is O=C-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3))-CH2. But that carbon (C1) would have substituents: O=C, cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and CH2. Wait, but that would make four substituents. If the carbonyl is at C1, then the carbonyl carbon (C1) has double bond to O, cyclopentyl group, CH(CH3), and CH2. Wait, but a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can\'t have four substituents. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is part of a ketone, which must have two alkyl groups. So the structure must be:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that\'s three carbons after the carbonyl, making it a pentan-2-one derivative. However, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to check for chiral centers. Let\'s suppose the carbonyl is at position 1 (even though that\'s an aldehyde), but assuming it\'s a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two other carbons. Let\'s say the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, oxygen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon in a ketone is connected to two alkyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. So the correct structure would be:\n\nO=C-(C cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3). So the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and a branched chain. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3) and connected to CH2CH3. Wait, no. If it\'s butan-1-one, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. But again, the carbonyl at position 1 would be an aldehyde. I\'m stuck. Let\'s try a different approach. Regardless of the structure, if there\'s a chiral center, the compound is optically active. Let\'s assume that in the correct structure, there is a carbon with four different substituents. For example, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) might have substituents: cyclopentyl, methyl, and two others. But without the exact structure, it\'s hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe there\'s no chiral center. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH(CH3) and two CH2 groups, then that carbon (C2) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but that carbon would have four substituents: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. If the two CH2 groups are part of a chain, maybe they are different. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 (the one attached to the carbonyl) has groups: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and a hydrogen? No, because the carbonyl is double-bonded. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is C1, then C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So C2 is CH(CH3), attached to C1 (carbonyl) and C3 (CH2). So substituents on C2: C1 (carbonyl), CH3, C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Wait, that would be four different groups: carbonyl group (as part of C1), CH3, CH2CH3, and hydrogen? No, C3 is CH2 connected to CH3. Wait, maybe C2 has substituents: -CO-cyclopentyl, -CH(CH3), -CH2CH3, and a single bond to C1. Wait, I\'m getting lost. Maybe there\'s no chiral center here. If the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, then the carbonyl carbon isn\'t a chiral center. The next carbon (CH(CH3)) would have groups: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and the rest. If it\'s CH(CH3), then substituents are: two CH2 groups (maybe different), CH3, and the carbonyl group. If those two CH2 groups are part of a chain, they might be the same. For example, if it\'s CH(CH3) connected to a CH2CH3, then the substituents on C2 would be: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen. That would be four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. But I\'m not sure because I\'m not certain about the structure. Alternatively, if the structure is such that the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has two identical groups, then it wouldn\'t be a chiral center. For example, if it\'s CH2 instead of CH(CH3). But the name says 3-methyl, so there\'s a methyl group on C3. Wait, but the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The "3-methyl" would be on C3 of the butanone chain. So the chain is four carbons: C1 (carbonyl), C2, C3 (methyl), C4. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that\'s five carbons. I\'m really confused. Maybe I should consider that this compound does not have a chiral center and thus is not optically active. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a chiral center at C3. If C3 has a methyl group and three other different substituents. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, then C3 is CH(CH3), attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two hydrogens. No, that\'s not four different groups. Alternatively, maybe C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and the rest. If C2 is CH2, then it\'s connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens. Not a chiral center. C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two hydrogens. Also not a chiral center. Therefore, maybe this compound does not have any chiral centers and is not optically active. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether there\'s a chiral center. Given the confusion in the structure, perhaps the intended answer is that it\'s not optically active. But I\'m not sure. Let\'s tally up.\n\nFrom the previous analysis:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Maybe no chiral center. Let\'s assume no.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes, optically active.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-... : Meso, not active.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-... : Yes, active.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-... : Meso, not active.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Unclear, but possibly not active.\n\nSo if I count 2,4,5 as active, that\'s three. But wait, maybe the first compound does have a chiral center. Let\'s go back.\n\nFirst compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let\'s try to draw it again. The structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH3, C2 has CH and CH2. Wait, no. Let\'s write the structure properly. The parent chain is but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So C1 becomes Cl-C=CHCH2CH3, and C2 has a methyl. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But that\'s five carbons. Wait, no. The parent chain is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute Cl on C1 (which is CH2 in the original), making it Cl-CH2-CH=CHCH3. Wait, but then the double bond is between C2 and C3, which would be but-2-ene. That\'s conflicting. I think I need to accept that I\'m not getting the structure right, but maybe the key point is whether there\'s a chiral center. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there\'s a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2, then the two carbons involved in the double bond each have two different groups. But for a double bond with Z configuration, the higher priority groups are on the same side. However, the presence of a chiral center depends on whether any carbon has four different groups. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) each have three groups: C1 has Cl, CH3 (from 2-methyl?), and two other groups. Wait, if C1 is part of the double bond, then it\'s connected to Cl, CH3, and the double bond. Wait, no. Let me try again. If the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3, then C1 has Cl, CH3, and double bond to C2. C2 has CH2CH3, and the other substituent. But in this case, C1 would have three substituents: Cl, CH3, and the double bond. But double bond counts as two substituents (the groups on either side). Wait, no. For a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups: two from the double bond and one other. So C1 would have Cl, CH3, and the double bond to C2. C2 would have CH2CH3 and the double bond to C1. But then, neither C1 nor C2 would have four different groups. Therefore, there\'s no chiral center. Therefore, the first compound is not optically active.\n\nSo final tally:\n\n1. No\n\n2. Yes\n\n3. No\n\n4. Yes\n\n5. Yes\n\n6. No\n\n7. No\n\nTotal: 3 compounds (2,4,5) are optically active. But wait, maybe the seventh compound is active. Let me check again.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let\'s assume the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the carbonyl is at position 1, which is connected to cyclopentyl and a CH(CH3)CH2 group. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), which is connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Wait, but the substituents on C2 would be: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2, and hydrogen. Are these all different? The cyclopentyl-C(O)- is a group, CH(CH3) is another, CH2 (which is connected to another CH3?), and a hydrogen. If the CH2 is part of a CH2CH3 group, then C2 would have substituents: CO-cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and H. That would be four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. But I\'m not sure because I\'m not confident in the structure. However, given that the name includes "3-methyl", the methyl is on C3 of the butanone chain. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that\'s only four carbons. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. So the structure would be:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, that doesn\'t fit. Alternatively, maybe it\'s cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be pentan-2-one with a cyclopentyl group. In that case, the carbonyl is at position 2, but the name says butan-1-one. This is confusing. Given the uncertainty, maybe the answer is that it\'s not optically active, but I\'m not sure. If the structure has a chiral center, then it\'s active. If not, then not. Since I can\'t resolve the structure, maybe the intended answer is that it\'s not active. So total of three compounds: 2,4,5.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check the seventh compound again. If the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, then the longest chain is four carbons with the ketone at position 1 (which is impossible for a ketone). Therefore, the name must be incorrect, but assuming it\'s intended to be butan-2-one, then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. In that case, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), which has substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH3, CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2 group, then it\'s -CH2-CH3. Wait, but then C2 would have groups: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. That\'s four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. So that would make four active compounds: 2,4,5,7.\n\nBut I\'m not sure. The confusion arises from the incorrect ketone position. If the name is correct as butan-1-one, then it\'s an aldehyde, which is not possible. Therefore, maybe it\'s a typo, and the correct name is butan-2-one. In that case, the compound would have a chiral center and be active. However, since the question says butan-1-one, which is impossible, maybe the intended answer is that it\'s not active. This is a bit of a problem. Given that, perhaps the answer is 4 compounds: 2,4,5,7. But I\'m not certain. Alternatively, the seventh is inactive. Let\'s assume that the seventh is not active. Then the total is three. But I think I need to make a decision here. Given the uncertainty, maybe the intended answer is four. But I\'m not sure. Let\'s recount:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n\n2. Complex compound: Yes\n\n3. (2R,3S): No (meso)\n\n4. (2R,3R): Yes\n\n5. (R)-cyclohexeneol: Yes\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s): No (meso)\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Maybe yes, maybe no. If the structure allows a chiral center, then yes. But given the confusion in the name, perhaps it\'s intended to have a chiral center. So total of 4.\n\nBut I\'m not confident. Alternatively, maybe the seventh doesn\'t have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2, then the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2. The CH(CH3) group is on C2. The substituents on C2 would be: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2 group (like CH2CH3), then yes, four different groups. Therefore, active. So total of four. Hmm.\n\nBut given the original analysis, I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check again.\n\nWait, the seventh compound: If it\'s 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at C1, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be something else, but assuming it\'s intended to be a valid structure, maybe the carbonyl is at C2. Then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. In that case, the C2 (adjacent to carbonyl) has substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2CH3 group, then yes, four different groups. So active. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut I\'m still uncertain. Given the time I\'ve spent, I\'ll go with 4 compounds: 2,4,5,7. However, the initial analysis suggested three. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, if the seventh compound\'s structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then C2 (the one attached to the carbonyl) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and H. Four different groups, so chiral center. Therefore, active. Yes. So that makes four.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 4. But let me verify all again:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center.\n\n2. Complex compound: Yes.\n\n3. (2R,3S): Meso, no.\n\n4. (2R,3R): Yes.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohexeneol: Yes.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s): Meso, no.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Yes.\n\nTotal: 2,4,5,7. Four compounds.\n\nBut wait, I\'m now confident in 2,4,5,7. However, the seventh depends on the structure. If the name is correct as butan-1-one, which is impossible, then the compound doesn\'t exist. But since the question includes it, we have to assume it\'s intended to be a valid structure, hence active. So the answer is 4. But I recall that in some cases, even if there\'s a chiral center, if there\'s a plane of symmetry, it\'s meso. However, in the seventh compound, there\'s no such symmetry. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385795, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7380, prompt_tokens=2183, total_tokens=9563, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

arbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), and 4 (COOH). If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule would have internal plane of symmetry? Let me see. If you have COOH-CH(R)(CH3)-CH(S)(CH3)-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, then maybe there's a center of inversion. Wait, in tartaric acid, the meso form has R and S configurations on adjacent carbons with a plane of symmetry. Similarly, here, if the two chiral centers are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry between them, then it would be meso and thus not optically active. Let me confirm. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers with R and S configurations and a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound, so it's not optically active. So this one would not exhibit optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both chiral centers are R. So the configurations are both R. In this case, there's no plane of symmetry. The molecule would be chiral and hence optically active. So this one is active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The R configuration indicates that the hydroxyl group is in a specific configuration. However, cyclohexene rings can have ring puckering, but the question is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The alcohol is at C1. Let's consider the structure. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1. The configuration is R. So the C1 has four different substituents: the hydroxyl group, the ring (which is part of the cyclohexene), and two other substituents. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. But when there's a double bond, the ring becomes rigid. However, the C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the hydroxyl group, two adjacent carbons (C6 and C2), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which is symmetric? Wait, no. Because the ring has a double bond at C3-C4, so the ring is not symmetrical. Therefore, the substituents on C1 would be: -OH, -CH2-C (from C2), -CH2-C (from C6), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but the ring structure might make some substituents equivalent. Wait, perhaps the C1 has the hydroxyl, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. But since the ring has a double bond, the substituents might not be identical. Alternatively, maybe the C1 is a chiral center. Let me think. If the cyclohexene ring is in a chair-like conformation, but with a double bond, it's more likely in a half-chair conformation. The C1 has the hydroxyl group, and the three adjacent ring carbons. Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has two substituents: the hydroxyl and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexene, each carbon is CH2 except the ones in the double bond. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

C1: connected to C2 and C6, and has two hydrogens (if it's a single bond). Wait, but if there's a hydroxyl at C1, then C1 would have -OH, two CH2 groups (connected to C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? No, wait. Wait, in cyclohexene, each carbon not in the double bond is CH2. But if there's a hydroxyl at C1, then C1 is CH(OH) instead of CH2. So the substituents on C1 would be -OH, -CH2-C (C2), -CH2-C (C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four different groups: OH, two different CH2 groups (but are they different?), and a hydrogen. Wait, the two CH2 groups are connected to C2 and C6. Since the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the ring is not symmetrical. Therefore, the paths from C1 to the rest of the ring via C2 and C6 are different. Therefore, the two CH2 groups are not equivalent. Hence, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, CH2-C2 (which is part of the ring leading towards the double bond), CH2-C6 (which is part of the ring leading away from the double bond), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center with R configuration. So this compound is chiral and optically active.

Wait, but wait. If the ring is planar, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. But cyclohexene rings are not planar, especially with a double bond. The double bond fixes part of the ring, but the rest can pucker. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group at C1 would create a chiral center. So yes, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but the configuration descriptors for cyclohexane derivatives can be tricky. However, if all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration (all s), but given the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, maybe the molecule is meso. Let's think. Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the hydroxyl groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, and all are in the s configuration (which might refer to the axial or equatorial position, but more likely the configuration at each carbon). Wait, but each hydroxyl is on a carbon that is a stereocenter. Each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has a hydroxyl group and three other substituents: two CH2 groups and the ring. Wait, no. Each carbon in cyclohexane is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for each hydroxyl-bearing carbon (1,3,5), the substituents would be -OH, two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons), and the ring. But since the ring is symmetric, maybe the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically. If all three are in the same configuration (s), which might correspond to all being axial or equatorial. However, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if they are all in the same configuration (e.g., all axial), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the hydroxyls are all axial, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Alternatively, if they are all equatorial, the same applies. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol might be a meso compound due to its symmetry. Therefore, it would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but let's think again. Each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has a hydroxyl group. If the configurations are all s, but the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, then it would be achiral. For example, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. Therefore, even though each carbon is a stereocenter, the overall molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon ketone) with a ketone at position 1 (so the carbonyl is at C1), and a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, and a methyl group at C3. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but here it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is butanone, so four carbons with the ketone at position 1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is propyl. But if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the IUPAC name is butan-1-one, which is (3-oxobutyl) group? No, butan-1-one is actually pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Wait, butan-1-one would be butanone with the ketone on the first carbon, which is impossible because the carbonyl has to be between two carbons. Wait, actually, butanone can only be butan-2-one, since butan-1-one would be propanal with an extra carbon, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, correction: The correct IUPAC name for butanone is butan-2-one (methyl acetone). But the question says 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Hmm, that seems problematic because butan-1-one would imply the carbonyl is at the end, which is not possible for a ketone (since ketones have two alkyl groups attached). Therefore, maybe the correct structure is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde with a methyl group? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be butan-2-one. But the question says butan-1-one. Let me think again. If it's butan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering starts from the carbonyl group. Wait, no, in IUPAC nomenclature, the ketone is given the lowest possible number. So for butanone, the longest chain with the carbonyl group is four carbons, so the carbonyl is at position 2: CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 (butan-2-one). So butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would be an aldehyde, not a ketone. Therefore, this might be a mistake in the name. However, assuming the name is correct as given, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the structure cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's only three carbons after the carbonyl. Wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons in total. So the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, that's three carbons after the carbonyl, making it pentan-2-one. I'm getting confused here. Maybe the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a four-carbon chain. So:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl? No. Alternatively, the carbonyl is at position 1 of butane, which would require the structure to be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's an aldehyde (pentanal), not a ketone. Therefore, there's a mistake in the name. However, perhaps the intended structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a three-carbon chain (propanone derivative). For example, cyclopentylmethylketone: cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3). That would be 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpropan-1-one. But the question says butan-1-one, which would be four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be pentan-2-one with a cyclopentyl group replacing one of the methyl groups. But then the name would be different. Anyway, regardless of the confusion, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let's assume the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a four-carbon chain. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The next carbon (C2) would be CH(CH3) and two CH2 groups. Wait, if the structure is O=C-CR1R2-R3, where R1 is cyclopentyl, R2 is CH(CH3), and R3 is CH2CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is at the first carbon, so the structure is O=C-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3))-CH2. But that carbon (C1) would have substituents: O=C, cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and CH2. Wait, but that would make four substituents. If the carbonyl is at C1, then the carbonyl carbon (C1) has double bond to O, cyclopentyl group, CH(CH3), and CH2. Wait, but a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can't have four substituents. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is part of a ketone, which must have two alkyl groups. So the structure must be:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's three carbons after the carbonyl, making it a pentan-2-one derivative. However, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to check for chiral centers. Let's suppose the carbonyl is at position 1 (even though that's an aldehyde), but assuming it's a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two other carbons. Let's say the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, oxygen, and two CH groups. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon in a ketone is connected to two alkyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. So the correct structure would be:

O=C-(C cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3). So the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and a branched chain. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3) and connected to CH2CH3. Wait, no. If it's butan-1-one, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. But again, the carbonyl at position 1 would be an aldehyde. I'm stuck. Let's try a different approach. Regardless of the structure, if there's a chiral center, the compound is optically active. Let's assume that in the correct structure, there is a carbon with four different substituents. For example, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) might have substituents: cyclopentyl, methyl, and two others. But without the exact structure, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe there's no chiral center. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH(CH3) and two CH2 groups, then that carbon (C2) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but that carbon would have four substituents: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. If the two CH2 groups are part of a chain, maybe they are different. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 (the one attached to the carbonyl) has groups: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and a hydrogen? No, because the carbonyl is double-bonded. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is C1, then C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So C2 is CH(CH3), attached to C1 (carbonyl) and C3 (CH2). So substituents on C2: C1 (carbonyl), CH3, C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Wait, that would be four different groups: carbonyl group (as part of C1), CH3, CH2CH3, and hydrogen? No, C3 is CH2 connected to CH3. Wait, maybe C2 has substituents: -CO-cyclopentyl, -CH(CH3), -CH2CH3, and a single bond to C1. Wait, I'm getting lost. Maybe there's no chiral center here. If the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, then the carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center. The next carbon (CH(CH3)) would have groups: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and the rest. If it's CH(CH3), then substituents are: two CH2 groups (maybe different), CH3, and the carbonyl group. If those two CH2 groups are part of a chain, they might be the same. For example, if it's CH(CH3) connected to a CH2CH3, then the substituents on C2 would be: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen. That would be four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. But I'm not sure because I'm not certain about the structure. Alternatively, if the structure is such that the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has two identical groups, then it wouldn't be a chiral center. For example, if it's CH2 instead of CH(CH3). But the name says 3-methyl, so there's a methyl group on C3. Wait, but the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The "3-methyl" would be on C3 of the butanone chain. So the chain is four carbons: C1 (carbonyl), C2, C3 (methyl), C4. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's five carbons. I'm really confused. Maybe I should consider that this compound does not have a chiral center and thus is not optically active. Alternatively, maybe there's a chiral center at C3. If C3 has a methyl group and three other different substituents. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, then C3 is CH(CH3), attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two hydrogens. No, that's not four different groups. Alternatively, maybe C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and the rest. If C2 is CH2, then it's connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens. Not a chiral center. C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two hydrogens. Also not a chiral center. Therefore, maybe this compound does not have any chiral centers and is not optically active. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether there's a chiral center. Given the confusion in the structure, perhaps the intended answer is that it's not optically active. But I'm not sure. Let's tally up.

From the previous analysis:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Maybe no chiral center. Let's assume no.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes, optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-... : Meso, not active.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Yes, active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-... : Meso, not active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Unclear, but possibly not active.

So if I count 2,4,5 as active, that's three. But wait, maybe the first compound does have a chiral center. Let's go back.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's try to draw it again. The structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH3, C2 has CH and CH2. Wait, no. Let's write the structure properly. The parent chain is but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So C1 becomes Cl-C=CHCH2CH3, and C2 has a methyl. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But that's five carbons. Wait, no. The parent chain is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute Cl on C1 (which is CH2 in the original), making it Cl-CH2-CH=CHCH3. Wait, but then the double bond is between C2 and C3, which would be but-2-ene. That's conflicting. I think I need to accept that I'm not getting the structure right, but maybe the key point is whether there's a chiral center. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2, then the two carbons involved in the double bond each have two different groups. But for a double bond with Z configuration, the higher priority groups are on the same side. However, the presence of a chiral center depends on whether any carbon has four different groups. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) each have three groups: C1 has Cl, CH3 (from 2-methyl?), and two other groups. Wait, if C1 is part of the double bond, then it's connected to Cl, CH3, and the double bond. Wait, no. Let me try again. If the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3, then C1 has Cl, CH3, and double bond to C2. C2 has CH2CH3, and the other substituent. But in this case, C1 would have three substituents: Cl, CH3, and the double bond. But double bond counts as two substituents (the groups on either side). Wait, no. For a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups: two from the double bond and one other. So C1 would have Cl, CH3, and the double bond to C2. C2 would have CH2CH3 and the double bond to C1. But then, neither C1 nor C2 would have four different groups. Therefore, there's no chiral center. Therefore, the first compound is not optically active.

So final tally:

1. No

2. Yes

3. No

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. No

7. No

Total: 3 compounds (2,4,5) are optically active. But wait, maybe the seventh compound is active. Let me check again.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's assume the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the carbonyl is at position 1, which is connected to cyclopentyl and a CH(CH3)CH2 group. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), which is connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Wait, but the substituents on C2 would be: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2, and hydrogen. Are these all different? The cyclopentyl-C(O)- is a group, CH(CH3) is another, CH2 (which is connected to another CH3?), and a hydrogen. If the CH2 is part of a CH2CH3 group, then C2 would have substituents: CO-cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and H. That would be four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. But I'm not sure because I'm not confident in the structure. However, given that the name includes "3-methyl", the methyl is on C3 of the butanone chain. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that's only four carbons. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be pentan-2-one with a cyclopentyl group. In that case, the carbonyl is at position 2, but the name says butan-1-one. This is confusing. Given the uncertainty, maybe the answer is that it's not optically active, but I'm not sure. If the structure has a chiral center, then it's active. If not, then not. Since I can't resolve the structure, maybe the intended answer is that it's not active. So total of three compounds: 2,4,5.

But wait, let's check the seventh compound again. If the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, then the longest chain is four carbons with the ketone at position 1 (which is impossible for a ketone). Therefore, the name must be incorrect, but assuming it's intended to be butan-2-one, then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. In that case, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), which has substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH3, CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2 group, then it's -CH2-CH3. Wait, but then C2 would have groups: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. That's four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. So that would make four active compounds: 2,4,5,7.

But I'm not sure. The confusion arises from the incorrect ketone position. If the name is correct as butan-1-one, then it's an aldehyde, which is not possible. Therefore, maybe it's a typo, and the correct name is butan-2-one. In that case, the compound would have a chiral center and be active. However, since the question says butan-1-one, which is impossible, maybe the intended answer is that it's not active. This is a bit of a problem. Given that, perhaps the answer is 4 compounds: 2,4,5,7. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the seventh is inactive. Let's assume that the seventh is not active. Then the total is three. But I think I need to make a decision here. Given the uncertainty, maybe the intended answer is four. But I'm not sure. Let's recount:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No

2. Complex compound: Yes

3. (2R,3S): No (meso)

4. (2R,3R): Yes

5. (R)-cyclohexeneol: Yes

6. (1s,3s,5s): No (meso)

7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Maybe yes, maybe no. If the structure allows a chiral center, then yes. But given the confusion in the name, perhaps it's intended to have a chiral center. So total of 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the seventh doesn't have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2, then the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2. The CH(CH3) group is on C2. The substituents on C2 would be: CO-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2 group (like CH2CH3), then yes, four different groups. Therefore, active. So total of four. Hmm.

But given the original analysis, I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check again.

Wait, the seventh compound: If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at C1, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be something else, but assuming it's intended to be a valid structure, maybe the carbonyl is at C2. Then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. In that case, the C2 (adjacent to carbonyl) has substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2, and H. If CH2 is part of a CH2CH3 group, then yes, four different groups. So active. Therefore, the answer is 4.

But I'm still uncertain. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with 4 compounds: 2,4,5,7. However, the initial analysis suggested three. Let me check once more.

Wait, if the seventh compound's structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then C2 (the one attached to the carbonyl) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(O)-, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and H. Four different groups, so chiral center. Therefore, active. Yes. So that makes four.

Therefore, the final answer is 4. But let me verify all again:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center.

2. Complex compound: Yes.

3. (2R,3S): Meso, no.

4. (2R,3R): Yes.

5. (R)-cyclohexeneol: Yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s): Meso, no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Yes.

Total: 2,4,5,7. Four compounds.

But wait, I'm now confident in 2,4,5,7. However, the seventh depends on the structure. If the name is correct as butan-1-one, which is impossible, then the compound doesn't exist. But since the question includes it, we have to assume it's intended to be a valid structure, hence active. So the answer is 4. But I recall that in some cases, even if there's a chiral center, if there's a plane of symmetry, it's meso. However, in the seventh compound, there's no such symmetry. Therefore, the answer is 4.

Let me draw the structure: if C2 is R and C3 is S, then the two methyl groups are on opposite sides. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Wait, but if the two chiral centers have opposite configurations, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, no. If the two substituents are mirror images across the central axis, then it would be a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two chiral centers and can form a meso compound when the configurations are opposite. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S) could be a meso form if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me check: succinic acid has four carbons. If the substituents at C2 and C3 are methyl groups with opposite configurations, then the molecule might have a center of inversion. Let me imagine the structure. The two carboxylic acid groups are at the ends. The C2 and C3 each have a methyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. The actual structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, then the methyl groups are on opposite sides. Let me visualize this. If C2 is R, then the substituents (from highest priority: COOH, CH(CH3), CH2, H) would be arranged in a clockwise direction. For C3 to be S, the substituents (COOH, CH(CH3), CH2, H) would be arranged counterclockwise. However, considering the molecule\'s symmetry, if you flip the molecule, the configurations might be mirror images. Therefore, this molecule would be a meso compound and thus optically inactive. Wait, but wait: 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with R and S configurations would have the two methyl groups on opposite sides. If the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the molecule would be meso. So yes, this would be a meso compound, hence not optically active. So compound three would not exhibit optical activity.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Now both chiral centers are R. Let\'s see. In this case, the configurations are both R, so the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, this would not be a meso compound. The two chiral centers would not cancel each other out. Therefore, this compound should be optically active. So compound four is active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The R configuration indicates the configuration of the chiral center at C1. Since there\'s only one chiral center here (assuming the cyclohexene ring doesn\'t impose any symmetry), this compound should be chiral. However, I need to check if there\'s any plane of symmetry in the molecule. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond which might restrict the ring\'s conformation, but the presence of the hydroxyl group at position 1 (R configuration) would create a chiral center. Therefore, unless there\'s an internal plane of symmetry, this should be optically active. So compound five is active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, if all three substituents are in the same configuration (all s), but arranged symmetrically (1,3,5 positions), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think. If the hydroxyl groups are all axial or equatorial in a symmetric arrangement, the molecule could be meso. For example, if the substituents are all on the same face, but given the chair conformation, the 1,3,5 positions are all adjacent in a way. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (s) would have a trigonal symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If the hydroxyl groups are all axial, then the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, but no plane of symmetry. However, maybe the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. Wait, if a molecule has an axis of symmetry but no plane of symmetry, it can still be chiral. However, if there\'s a plane of symmetry, then it\'s not chiral. Let me think again. For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have any improper axis of symmetry (which includes planes of symmetry). If the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, does it have a plane of symmetry? Let\'s say the hydroxyl groups are at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration. If you imagine looking down the three-fold axis, each hydroxyl is 120 degrees apart. If there\'s a plane that cuts through the molecule between the substituents, perhaps. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that there is a plane that reflects them onto each other, the molecule would be achiral. Wait, maybe in this case, the molecule is actually achiral. For example, if you have three identical groups symmetrically placed, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of another example: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all methyl groups are axial, the molecule has a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. However, in reality, such molecules can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that there\'s no plane of symmetry. Wait, but in the case of 1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (s), which would correspond to all being in the same axial or equatorial arrangement. If they are all axial, then the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, such a molecule would be chiral. However, if they are all equatorial, perhaps there\'s a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. If they are all equatorial, then in the chair conformation, each hydroxyl is pointing outward. The symmetry elements depend on the arrangement. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a planar molecule with three OH groups arranged symmetrically. However, the actual conformation might have different symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso. Wait, wait. Let me check the configuration descriptors: (1s,3s,5s). The lowercase \'s\' might indicate the configuration at each carbon. But in cyclohexane, each of the hydroxyl-bearing carbons would have a configuration. If all three are s (which would correspond to the same configuration for each), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of each carbon: the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Each carbon in the cyclohexane ring is connected to two adjacent ring carbons, one OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has an OH group. The other substituents would be two CH2 groups (since it\'s a six-membered ring). Wait, no. Each of the carbons in the cyclohexane ring is connected to two adjacent carbons (so two CH groups if it\'s a six-membered ring). Wait, perhaps I\'m getting confused. Let me think of each carbon in the cyclohexane ring. Each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (so each is CH2 in cyclohexane), but when you substitute an OH group at positions 1,3,5, each of those carbons becomes COH. So each substituted carbon has two CH2 groups, an OH, and another CH2. Wait, no. Let\'s clarify: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with each carbon connected to two others. Each carbon in cyclohexane is CH2. When you substitute an OH group at position 1, that carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, no. Let me correct: in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So each carbon is CH2. When you substitute an OH group at position 1, that carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two others, so substituting an OH would make that carbon connected to two ring carbons, the OH, and a hydrogen. So each substituted carbon has the structure: C(OH)(H)(CH2)(CH2). But that\'s not possible because each carbon in the ring must have four bonds. Wait, in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and has two hydrogen atoms. When you substitute one hydrogen with an OH, the carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but that would mean each substituted carbon has substituents: two CH2 (from the ring), one OH, and one H. So the four substituents are: two CH2 groups (but these are part of the ring, so maybe they\'re considered as two single bonds to adjacent carbons), OH, H. Wait, maybe each substituted carbon has the substituents: two adjacent ring carbons (which are equivalent in the chair conformation?), an OH group, and a hydrogen. So for each substituted carbon (1,3,5), the substituents would be: two adjacent ring carbons (which are actually part of the ring structure), OH, and H. Therefore, the configuration at each carbon would depend on the arrangement of these substituents. But if all three are in the same configuration (s), which would mean that each has the same spatial arrangement. However, the symmetry of the molecule could lead to internal planes of symmetry. For example, if the three OH groups are arranged such that there\'s a plane that reflects the molecule onto itself, then the molecule would be achiral. But if not, it would be chiral. In the case of 1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration, the molecule might have a three-fold axis of symmetry but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. However, I\'m not entirely sure. Let me recall that in some cases, when substituents are arranged symmetrically, even with multiple stereocenters, the molecule can be achiral. For example, in meso compounds. Wait, but meso compounds require a plane of symmetry that inverts the configurations of the stereocenters. In this case, if all three stereocenters are the same (s), then a plane of symmetry would require that some are R and some are S. But since all are s, maybe there\'s no such plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane that doesn\'t pass through any of the stereocenters but reflects the entire structure. For example, a plane cutting through the center of the ring and reflecting the three OH groups onto each other. But since they are all s, maybe this is possible. Wait, but each stereocenter\'s configuration is s, which refers to the arrangement around that particular carbon. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that maps each stereocenter to another, but their configurations are the same, then the molecule would not be chiral. For example, in a molecule with three identical stereocenters arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral. Wait, but if each stereocenter is s and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror image would have the same configuration (since they are all s), so the molecule would be identical to its mirror image, hence achiral. Therefore, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Let me check if such a plane exists. If the three OH groups are in positions 1,3,5 and all are s configuration, then in the chair conformation, maybe they are all axial or all equatorial. If they are all axial, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. If they are all equatorial, perhaps there\'s a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a horizontal plane cutting through the ring. Wait, but in a chair conformation with all OH groups axial, there would be a three-fold axis, but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, such a molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there\'s a plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral. This is getting complicated. Let me check if there\'s a known example. For instance, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups axial is chiral, but in reality, due to ring flipping, such substituents can become equatorial, but if the substituents are fixed, as in a triol with three OH groups in axial positions, the molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there\'s a plane of symmetry, then it\'s achiral. But given that the configurations are all s, which would correspond to the same spatial arrangement at each carbon, perhaps there\'s no such plane. Therefore, I think this compound would be chiral and exhibit optical activity. Wait, but the answer might be that it\'s not chiral. Let me check another angle. If all three stereocenters are s, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is achiral. For example, if there\'s a plane that reflects each stereocenter onto another. But if all three are s, then their mirror images would be R. However, if the plane of symmetry maps each stereocenter to another, which is also s, then the configurations must be such that they are mirror images, but since they are all s, that\'s not possible. Therefore, the presence of three s stereocenters arranged symmetrically would not allow a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, compound six would be optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let\'s analyze this. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butan-1-one. Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is at position 1. Therefore, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2COCH3. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be propan-2-one (acetone) if it\'s (CH3)2CO. Wait, maybe I\'m confused. Let me clarify: the correct IUPAC name for butan-1-one is butanone with the carbonyl at position 1: CH2CH2CH2CO, but that\'s not possible because the carbonyl must be at a position where the carbon has only one adjacent carbon. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is not possible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbons. Therefore, butanone is either butan-2-one (methylacetone) or possibly butan-3-one. Wait, perhaps the correct structure here is 3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me check. Butan-1-one would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that\'s impossible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbons. Therefore, the correct name would be pentan-2-one if the carbonyl is in the middle. Wait, maybe the compound is 3-methylbutan-1-one, but that\'s not possible. Alternatively, maybe it\'s 3-methylbutan-2-one. Wait, the user wrote "1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one". Let\'s parse this. The suffix "-one" indicates a ketone. The numbering starts such that the ketone is at position 1. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the chain would be: O=C-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already double-bonded to oxygen and can only have two other substituents. Therefore, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. However, the carbonyl carbon (position 1) is attached to a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group (from the 3-methylbutan-1-one?), and the rest of the chain. Wait, this seems confusing. Let me try again. The parent chain is butanone, which is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. However, butanone is actually butan-2-one. Therefore, maybe there\'s a mistake in the name. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of a butanone. Let me accept the name as given. Assuming the ketone is at position 1, the carbonyl carbon is the first carbon. Then, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH2Cyclopentyl)? No, that doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1), and a methyl group at position 3. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, but that\'s a five-carbon chain. Let me count: position 1 (carbonyl), position 2 (CH2), position 3 (CH(CH3)), position 4 (CH3). Wait, but butan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with the ketone at position 1, which is impossible. Therefore, maybe the correct structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2- something. I\'m getting stuck on the structure here. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and there\'s a methyl group on the third carbon of the butanone chain. But the numbering would start from the carbonyl, so the chain would be: carbonyl (C1), then C2 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH3). However, this would make it pentan-2-one with substituents, but regardless, the key point is whether there\'s a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon (C1) can\'t be chiral because it\'s double-bonded to oxygen. The next carbon (C2) is CH2, so not chiral. C3 is CH(CH3), so attached to a methyl group, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), and the rest. Wait, C3 would be CH(CH3) with two CH2 groups and a single bond to C4. Therefore, the substituents at C3 are: methyl, two CH2 (one from C2 and one from C4?), and the rest. Wait, maybe C3 has substituents: methyl, C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3?), and the cyclopentyl group? No, the cyclopentyl is on C1 (the carbonyl carbon). Therefore, C3 would have substituents: methyl, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me try to draw the structure properly:\n\n- C1: carbonyl group (O=C), attached to cyclopentyl and to C2.\n- C2: CH2\n- C3: CH(CH3)\n- C4: CH3\n\nTherefore, the full structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.\n\nNow, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not chiral. C2 is CH2 (no). C3 is CH(CH3), attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two other groups? Wait, C3 would be connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and what else? Wait, in the structure cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, the chain is:\n\nC1 (O=C-C5H9) connected to C2 (CH2), which is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), which is connected to C4 (CH3). Therefore, C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), methyl (CH(CH3)), and another CH2 from where? Wait, no. Wait, the structure would be:\n\nC1: O=C-(cyclopentyl)\nC2: CH2 connected to C1\nC3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4\nC4: CH3 connected to C3\n\nTherefore, the substituents on C3 are: a CH2 group (from C2), a CH3 group (from C4), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, no. If C3 is CH(CH3), then it\'s bonded to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. But that would give four substituents: CH2, CH3, CH3, and H. Wait, no. If C3 is CH(CH3), then the substituents are:\n\n- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4? No, C4 is CH3)\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe carbon chain is:\n\nC1: O=C-(cyclopentyl)\nC2: -CH2-\nC3: -CH(CH3)-\nC4: -CH3\n\nSo C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, that would mean C3 has substituents: CH2 (C2), CH3 (C4), CH3 (methyl), and H. That\'s four different groups? No, two CH3 groups. Therefore, the substituents are CH3, CH3, CH2, H. So two of the substituents are the same (CH3), so C3 is not a chiral center. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in this molecule. Hence, it\'s not optically active. Therefore, compound seven is inactive.\n\nTo recap:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Need to check for chiral centers. The molecule has a double bond at position 1, so the two carbons involved in the double bond are C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group (from the 2-methyl), and C2 has a methyl and the rest of the chain. The double bond restricts rotation, but does either carbon have two identical groups? Let me consider the structure again. The correct structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, but the name is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl at C1 and methyl at C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl at C1 (which is the first carbon of the double bond) gives ClCH2-C=CHCH2CH3? No, that would be pent-2-ene. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2CH3? I\'m getting confused. Let\'s use the IUPAC name. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The parent chain is butene (four carbons) with the double bond between C1 and C2. At C1, there\'s a chlorine substituent, and at C2, a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(C H2)-=CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a Cl at C1 and a methyl at C2, then C1 is CH2Cl, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, that can\'t be. Let me correct. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding a chlorine at C1 would give ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2: ClCH2=CHCH2CH3. However, the name would be 1-chlorobut-1-ene. If there\'s a methyl group at C2, then the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would be pent-2-ene. I\'m clearly getting confused here. Let me use a different approach. The correct structure for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. The correct structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that\'s only three carbons. I\'m making a mistake here. Let me start over. The parent chain is butene, four carbons with the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents are chlorine at C1 and methyl at C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. But that\'s only three carbons after the double bond. Wait, no. The correct structure should be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that\'s 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that\'s three carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would be 3-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. I\'m stuck. Maybe I should accept that I\'m not able to correctly draw the structure and instead focus on whether there\'s a chiral center. If the compound has a carbon with four different substituents, it\'s chiral. Let\'s assume that in this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group (from the 2-methyl substituent), and two other groups (probably two CH2 groups). Wait, no. If it\'s but-1-ene, then C1 and C2 are each bonded to two groups. For example, in but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2, we would have ClCH2-C(CH3)=CHCH3. But that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, which would be but-2-ene. I\'m clearly not getting the structure right. Maybe the correct structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3, which would be pent-1-ene, but the name says but-1-ene. This is really confusing. Perhaps there\'s a mistake in my approach. Let me try to find another way. The presence of a double bond can lead to geometric isomerism (E/Z), but not necessarily chirality. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups. In this compound, the carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) each have three groups. If either of these carbons has two identical groups, then it\'s not chiral. If C1 has Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups (but in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents). Wait, in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents (since the double bond is two substituents). For example, in CH2=CH2, each carbon has two H and one CH2. In this compound, C1 has Cl, CH3, and the double bond. C2 has CH3, the double bond, and two other groups (maybe CH2CH3). Therefore, neither C1 nor C2 would have four different groups. Thus, there\'s no chiral center in this molecule. Therefore, compound one is not optically active.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers → Not active.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Multiple stereocenters, no symmetry → Active.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound → Not active.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral centers with same configuration → Active.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: One chiral center → Active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Three chiral centers with symmetry? Earlier analysis suggested active, but need to confirm. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then not active. However, with three s configurations, perhaps it\'s not. Wait, another way: the molecule\'s mirror image would have three R configurations. But since the original has three s configurations, the mirror image would not be superimposable, hence it\'s chiral. Therefore, active.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers → Not active.\n\nSo total active compounds: 2,4,5,6. That\'s four compounds. But wait, let me double-check compound six. If the three stereocenters are arranged symmetrically, it might be a meso compound. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all three OH groups in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. If you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, each OH group moves to the next position, but since they are all s, it\'s the same. However, a plane of symmetry would require that each OH group is mirrored. If there\'s a plane that cuts through the ring and reflects each OH group to another, but since they are all s, this might not be possible. Let me think of a specific example. If the molecule has a plane that passes through C2 and C4 and the center of the ring, then the OH at C1 would be reflected to C5, which is also s. Similarly, C3 would be reflected to itself. If the configurations are such that they are unchanged under this reflection, then the molecule is achiral. However, since each stereocenter is s, their mirror images would be R. Therefore, if the molecule has such a plane, the configurations would have to be R and S, but they are all s, so this is impossible. Therefore, the molecule cannot have a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Hence, compound six is active.\n\nTherefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 4 (compounds 2,4,5,6). But wait, let me check again:\n\n1. No\n\n2. Yes\n\n3. No\n\n4. Yes\n\n5. Yes\n\n6. Yes\n\n7. No\n\nSo that\'s 2,4,5,6 → 4 compounds. But according to my initial analysis, compound six is active. However, I recall that for cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if all three substituents are in the same configuration, the molecule is actually achiral due to a plane of symmetry. Let me verify with a real example. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups in the same configuration (all axial) is chiral. However, if they are all equatorial, the molecule is also chiral. Wait, but in reality, such molecules are called "trityl" systems and can exhibit chirality. However, some sources say that if a molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, it might be achiral. For example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and in the same configuration is chiral. Therefore, compound six would be optically active. Therefore, the answer is 4. However, some sources might consider such a compound as achiral due to a plane of symmetry. This is a point of confusion. Let me check another angle. If a molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, but each has the same configuration, then the molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable. For example, consider a trigonal pyramidal molecule with three identical substituents. Such a molecule would be chiral. Similarly, a cyclohexane with three substituents in a symmetric arrangement but each with the same configuration would be chiral. Therefore, compound six is active. Therefore, the total is 4. However, I need to confirm. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In the case of three stereocenters, if there\'s a plane of symmetry that inverts the configurations, then it would be meso. But with three stereocenters all s, there\'s no such plane. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, compound six is active. Therefore, the answer is 4 compounds.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386159, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7689, prompt_tokens=686, total_tokens=8375, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine which compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each for the presence of chirality (chiral centers or other elements of chirality) and check for internal symmetry that might render them meso compounds. Here's the breakdown:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond (C1-C2) with a chlorine at C1 and a methyl group at C2. Neither carbon in the double bond has four distinct substituents, so there are no chiral centers.  
   **Optically inactive.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) indicate multiple stereocenters and an E-configured double bond. The lack of symmetry ensures chirality.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) with opposite configurations (R and S). The plane of symmetry between C2 and C3 makes it a meso compound.  
   **Optically inactive.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Both chiral centers (C2 and C3) have the same configuration (R,R). No plane of symmetry exists, so it is not meso.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at C1 creates a single chiral center (R configuration). No internal symmetry negates chirality.  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   All three hydroxyl groups are in the s configuration. Despite the symmetric positions (1,3,5), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the uniform stereochemistry, making it chiral.  
   **Optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The ketone group at C1 is not chiral, and the remaining carbons lack four distinct substituents. No chiral centers are present.  
   **Optically inactive.**

**Final Answer:**  
**4 compounds** exhibit optical activity (compounds 2, 4, 5, and 6).  
\boxed{4}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Succinic acid derivatives can form meso compounds if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Let me draw the structure: if C2 is R and C3 is S, then the two methyl groups are on opposite sides. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Wait, but if the two chiral centers have opposite configurations, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, no. If the two substituents are mirror images across the central axis, then it would be a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two chiral centers and can form a meso compound when the configurations are opposite. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S) could be a meso form if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me check: succinic acid has four carbons. If the substituents at C2 and C3 are methyl groups with opposite configurations, then the molecule might have a center of inversion. Let me imagine the structure. The two carboxylic acid groups are at the ends. The C2 and C3 each have a methyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. The actual structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, then the methyl groups are on opposite sides. Let me visualize this. If C2 is R, then the substituents (from highest priority: COOH, CH(CH3), CH2, H) would be arranged in a clockwise direction. For C3 to be S, the substituents (COOH, CH(CH3), CH2, H) would be arranged counterclockwise. However, considering the molecule's symmetry, if you flip the molecule, the configurations might be mirror images. Therefore, this molecule would be a meso compound and thus optically inactive. Wait, but wait: 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with R and S configurations would have the two methyl groups on opposite sides. If the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the molecule would be meso. So yes, this would be a meso compound, hence not optically active. So compound three would not exhibit optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Now both chiral centers are R. Let's see. In this case, the configurations are both R, so the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, this would not be a meso compound. The two chiral centers would not cancel each other out. Therefore, this compound should be optically active. So compound four is active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The R configuration indicates the configuration of the chiral center at C1. Since there's only one chiral center here (assuming the cyclohexene ring doesn't impose any symmetry), this compound should be chiral. However, I need to check if there's any plane of symmetry in the molecule. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond which might restrict the ring's conformation, but the presence of the hydroxyl group at position 1 (R configuration) would create a chiral center. Therefore, unless there's an internal plane of symmetry, this should be optically active. So compound five is active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, if all three substituents are in the same configuration (all s), but arranged symmetrically (1,3,5 positions), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think. If the hydroxyl groups are all axial or equatorial in a symmetric arrangement, the molecule could be meso. For example, if the substituents are all on the same face, but given the chair conformation, the 1,3,5 positions are all adjacent in a way. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (s) would have a trigonal symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If the hydroxyl groups are all axial, then the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry, but no plane of symmetry. However, maybe the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. Wait, if a molecule has an axis of symmetry but no plane of symmetry, it can still be chiral. However, if there's a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Let me think again. For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have any improper axis of symmetry (which includes planes of symmetry). If the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, does it have a plane of symmetry? Let's say the hydroxyl groups are at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration. If you imagine looking down the three-fold axis, each hydroxyl is 120 degrees apart. If there's a plane that cuts through the molecule between the substituents, perhaps. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that there is a plane that reflects them onto each other, the molecule would be achiral. Wait, maybe in this case, the molecule is actually achiral. For example, if you have three identical groups symmetrically placed, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of another example: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all methyl groups are axial, the molecule has a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. However, in reality, such molecules can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. Wait, but in the case of 1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (s), which would correspond to all being in the same axial or equatorial arrangement. If they are all axial, then the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, such a molecule would be chiral. However, if they are all equatorial, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. If they are all equatorial, then in the chair conformation, each hydroxyl is pointing outward. The symmetry elements depend on the arrangement. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a planar molecule with three OH groups arranged symmetrically. However, the actual conformation might have different symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso. Wait, wait. Let me check the configuration descriptors: (1s,3s,5s). The lowercase 's' might indicate the configuration at each carbon. But in cyclohexane, each of the hydroxyl-bearing carbons would have a configuration. If all three are s (which would correspond to the same configuration for each), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of each carbon: the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Each carbon in the cyclohexane ring is connected to two adjacent ring carbons, one OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, each of the three carbons (1,3,5) has an OH group. The other substituents would be two CH2 groups (since it's a six-membered ring). Wait, no. Each of the carbons in the cyclohexane ring is connected to two adjacent carbons (so two CH groups if it's a six-membered ring). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of each carbon in the cyclohexane ring. Each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (so each is CH2 in cyclohexane), but when you substitute an OH group at positions 1,3,5, each of those carbons becomes COH. So each substituted carbon has two CH2 groups, an OH, and another CH2. Wait, no. Let's clarify: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with each carbon connected to two others. Each carbon in cyclohexane is CH2. When you substitute an OH group at position 1, that carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, no. Let me correct: in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So each carbon is CH2. When you substitute an OH group at position 1, that carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two others, so substituting an OH would make that carbon connected to two ring carbons, the OH, and a hydrogen. So each substituted carbon has the structure: C(OH)(H)(CH2)(CH2). But that's not possible because each carbon in the ring must have four bonds. Wait, in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and has two hydrogen atoms. When you substitute one hydrogen with an OH, the carbon becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but that would mean each substituted carbon has substituents: two CH2 (from the ring), one OH, and one H. So the four substituents are: two CH2 groups (but these are part of the ring, so maybe they're considered as two single bonds to adjacent carbons), OH, H. Wait, maybe each substituted carbon has the substituents: two adjacent ring carbons (which are equivalent in the chair conformation?), an OH group, and a hydrogen. So for each substituted carbon (1,3,5), the substituents would be: two adjacent ring carbons (which are actually part of the ring structure), OH, and H. Therefore, the configuration at each carbon would depend on the arrangement of these substituents. But if all three are in the same configuration (s), which would mean that each has the same spatial arrangement. However, the symmetry of the molecule could lead to internal planes of symmetry. For example, if the three OH groups are arranged such that there's a plane that reflects the molecule onto itself, then the molecule would be achiral. But if not, it would be chiral. In the case of 1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration, the molecule might have a three-fold axis of symmetry but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. However, I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall that in some cases, when substituents are arranged symmetrically, even with multiple stereocenters, the molecule can be achiral. For example, in meso compounds. Wait, but meso compounds require a plane of symmetry that inverts the configurations of the stereocenters. In this case, if all three stereocenters are the same (s), then a plane of symmetry would require that some are R and some are S. But since all are s, maybe there's no such plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane that doesn't pass through any of the stereocenters but reflects the entire structure. For example, a plane cutting through the center of the ring and reflecting the three OH groups onto each other. But since they are all s, maybe this is possible. Wait, but each stereocenter's configuration is s, which refers to the arrangement around that particular carbon. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that maps each stereocenter to another, but their configurations are the same, then the molecule would not be chiral. For example, in a molecule with three identical stereocenters arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral. Wait, but if each stereocenter is s and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror image would have the same configuration (since they are all s), so the molecule would be identical to its mirror image, hence achiral. Therefore, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Let me check if such a plane exists. If the three OH groups are in positions 1,3,5 and all are s configuration, then in the chair conformation, maybe they are all axial or all equatorial. If they are all axial, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. If they are all equatorial, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe there's a horizontal plane cutting through the ring. Wait, but in a chair conformation with all OH groups axial, there would be a three-fold axis, but no planes of symmetry. Therefore, such a molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's a plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral. This is getting complicated. Let me check if there's a known example. For instance, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups axial is chiral, but in reality, due to ring flipping, such substituents can become equatorial, but if the substituents are fixed, as in a triol with three OH groups in axial positions, the molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. But given that the configurations are all s, which would correspond to the same spatial arrangement at each carbon, perhaps there's no such plane. Therefore, I think this compound would be chiral and exhibit optical activity. Wait, but the answer might be that it's not chiral. Let me check another angle. If all three stereocenters are s, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is achiral. For example, if there's a plane that reflects each stereocenter onto another. But if all three are s, then their mirror images would be R. However, if the plane of symmetry maps each stereocenter to another, which is also s, then the configurations must be such that they are mirror images, but since they are all s, that's not possible. Therefore, the presence of three s stereocenters arranged symmetrically would not allow a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, compound six would be optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's analyze this. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butan-1-one. Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is at position 1. Therefore, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2COCH3. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be propan-2-one (acetone) if it's (CH3)2CO. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify: the correct IUPAC name for butan-1-one is butanone with the carbonyl at position 1: CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because the carbonyl must be at a position where the carbon has only one adjacent carbon. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is not possible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbons. Therefore, butanone is either butan-2-one (methylacetone) or possibly butan-3-one. Wait, perhaps the correct structure here is 3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me check. Butan-1-one would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's impossible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbons. Therefore, the correct name would be pentan-2-one if the carbonyl is in the middle. Wait, maybe the compound is 3-methylbutan-1-one, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-methylbutan-2-one. Wait, the user wrote "1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one". Let's parse this. The suffix "-one" indicates a ketone. The numbering starts such that the ketone is at position 1. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the chain would be: O=C-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already double-bonded to oxygen and can only have two other substituents. Therefore, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. However, the carbonyl carbon (position 1) is attached to a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group (from the 3-methylbutan-1-one?), and the rest of the chain. Wait, this seems confusing. Let me try again. The parent chain is butanone, which is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. However, butanone is actually butan-2-one. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the name. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of a butanone. Let me accept the name as given. Assuming the ketone is at position 1, the carbonyl carbon is the first carbon. Then, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH2Cyclopentyl)? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1), and a methyl group at position 3. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain. Let me count: position 1 (carbonyl), position 2 (CH2), position 3 (CH(CH3)), position 4 (CH3). Wait, but butan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with the ketone at position 1, which is impossible. Therefore, maybe the correct structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2- something. I'm getting stuck on the structure here. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and there's a methyl group on the third carbon of the butanone chain. But the numbering would start from the carbonyl, so the chain would be: carbonyl (C1), then C2 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH3). However, this would make it pentan-2-one with substituents, but regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon (C1) can't be chiral because it's double-bonded to oxygen. The next carbon (C2) is CH2, so not chiral. C3 is CH(CH3), so attached to a methyl group, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), and the rest. Wait, C3 would be CH(CH3) with two CH2 groups and a single bond to C4. Therefore, the substituents at C3 are: methyl, two CH2 (one from C2 and one from C4?), and the rest. Wait, maybe C3 has substituents: methyl, C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2CH3?), and the cyclopentyl group? No, the cyclopentyl is on C1 (the carbonyl carbon). Therefore, C3 would have substituents: methyl, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me try to draw the structure properly:

- C1: carbonyl group (O=C), attached to cyclopentyl and to C2.
- C2: CH2
- C3: CH(CH3)
- C4: CH3

Therefore, the full structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not chiral. C2 is CH2 (no). C3 is CH(CH3), attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two other groups? Wait, C3 would be connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and what else? Wait, in the structure cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, the chain is:

C1 (O=C-C5H9) connected to C2 (CH2), which is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), which is connected to C4 (CH3). Therefore, C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), methyl (CH(CH3)), and another CH2 from where? Wait, no. Wait, the structure would be:

C1: O=C-(cyclopentyl)
C2: CH2 connected to C1
C3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4
C4: CH3 connected to C3

Therefore, the substituents on C3 are: a CH2 group (from C2), a CH3 group (from C4), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, no. If C3 is CH(CH3), then it's bonded to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. But that would give four substituents: CH2, CH3, CH3, and H. Wait, no. If C3 is CH(CH3), then the substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4? No, C4 is CH3)
Wait, no. Let me re-express:

The carbon chain is:

C1: O=C-(cyclopentyl)
C2: -CH2-
C3: -CH(CH3)-
C4: -CH3

So C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, that would mean C3 has substituents: CH2 (C2), CH3 (C4), CH3 (methyl), and H. That's four different groups? No, two CH3 groups. Therefore, the substituents are CH3, CH3, CH2, H. So two of the substituents are the same (CH3), so C3 is not a chiral center. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in this molecule. Hence, it's not optically active. Therefore, compound seven is inactive.

To recap:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Need to check for chiral centers. The molecule has a double bond at position 1, so the two carbons involved in the double bond are C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group (from the 2-methyl), and C2 has a methyl and the rest of the chain. The double bond restricts rotation, but does either carbon have two identical groups? Let me consider the structure again. The correct structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, but the name is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl at C1 and methyl at C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl at C1 (which is the first carbon of the double bond) gives ClCH2-C=CHCH2CH3? No, that would be pent-2-ene. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2CH3? I'm getting confused. Let's use the IUPAC name. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The parent chain is butene (four carbons) with the double bond between C1 and C2. At C1, there's a chlorine substituent, and at C2, a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(C H2)-=CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a Cl at C1 and a methyl at C2, then C1 is CH2Cl, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, that can't be. Let me correct. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding a chlorine at C1 would give ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2: ClCH2=CHCH2CH3. However, the name would be 1-chlorobut-1-ene. If there's a methyl group at C2, then the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would be pent-2-ene. I'm clearly getting confused here. Let me use a different approach. The correct structure for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. The correct structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's only three carbons. I'm making a mistake here. Let me start over. The parent chain is butene, four carbons with the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents are chlorine at C1 and methyl at C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. But that's only three carbons after the double bond. Wait, no. The correct structure should be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene as CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's three carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would be 3-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. I'm stuck. Maybe I should accept that I'm not able to correctly draw the structure and instead focus on whether there's a chiral center. If the compound has a carbon with four different substituents, it's chiral. Let's assume that in this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group (from the 2-methyl substituent), and two other groups (probably two CH2 groups). Wait, no. If it's but-1-ene, then C1 and C2 are each bonded to two groups. For example, in but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2, we would have ClCH2-C(CH3)=CHCH3. But that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, which would be but-2-ene. I'm clearly not getting the structure right. Maybe the correct structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3, which would be pent-1-ene, but the name says but-1-ene. This is really confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me try to find another way. The presence of a double bond can lead to geometric isomerism (E/Z), but not necessarily chirality. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups. In this compound, the carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) each have three groups. If either of these carbons has two identical groups, then it's not chiral. If C1 has Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups (but in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents). Wait, in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents (since the double bond is two substituents). For example, in CH2=CH2, each carbon has two H and one CH2. In this compound, C1 has Cl, CH3, and the double bond. C2 has CH3, the double bond, and two other groups (maybe CH2CH3). Therefore, neither C1 nor C2 would have four different groups. Thus, there's no chiral center in this molecule. Therefore, compound one is not optically active.

So summarizing:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers → Not active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Multiple stereocenters, no symmetry → Active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound → Not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral centers with same configuration → Active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: One chiral center → Active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Three chiral centers with symmetry? Earlier analysis suggested active, but need to confirm. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then not active. However, with three s configurations, perhaps it's not. Wait, another way: the molecule's mirror image would have three R configurations. But since the original has three s configurations, the mirror image would not be superimposable, hence it's chiral. Therefore, active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers → Not active.

So total active compounds: 2,4,5,6. That's four compounds. But wait, let me double-check compound six. If the three stereocenters are arranged symmetrically, it might be a meso compound. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all three OH groups in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. If you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, each OH group moves to the next position, but since they are all s, it's the same. However, a plane of symmetry would require that each OH group is mirrored. If there's a plane that cuts through the ring and reflects each OH group to another, but since they are all s, this might not be possible. Let me think of a specific example. If the molecule has a plane that passes through C2 and C4 and the center of the ring, then the OH at C1 would be reflected to C5, which is also s. Similarly, C3 would be reflected to itself. If the configurations are such that they are unchanged under this reflection, then the molecule is achiral. However, since each stereocenter is s, their mirror images would be R. Therefore, if the molecule has such a plane, the configurations would have to be R and S, but they are all s, so this is impossible. Therefore, the molecule cannot have a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Hence, compound six is active.

Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 4 (compounds 2,4,5,6). But wait, let me check again:

1. No

2. Yes

3. No

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. Yes

7. No

So that's 2,4,5,6 → 4 compounds. But according to my initial analysis, compound six is active. However, I recall that for cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if all three substituents are in the same configuration, the molecule is actually achiral due to a plane of symmetry. Let me verify with a real example. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups in the same configuration (all axial) is chiral. However, if they are all equatorial, the molecule is also chiral. Wait, but in reality, such molecules are called "trityl" systems and can exhibit chirality. However, some sources say that if a molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, it might be achiral. For example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and in the same configuration is chiral. Therefore, compound six would be optically active. Therefore, the answer is 4. However, some sources might consider such a compound as achiral due to a plane of symmetry. This is a point of confusion. Let me check another angle. If a molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, but each has the same configuration, then the molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable. For example, consider a trigonal pyramidal molecule with three identical substituents. Such a molecule would be chiral. Similarly, a cyclohexane with three substituents in a symmetric arrangement but each with the same configuration would be chiral. Therefore, compound six is active. Therefore, the total is 4. However, I need to confirm. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In the case of three stereocenters, if there's a plane of symmetry that inverts the configurations, then it would be meso. But with three stereocenters all s, there's no such plane. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, compound six is active. Therefore, the answer is 4 compounds.

Let me visualize. If the molecule has R and S configurations on adjacent carbons, it might not be a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters, and the meso form has R and S configurations leading to a plane of symmetry. However, in this case, the parent chain is different. Let's consider the structure: COOH-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH. If we mirror the molecule, would the configurations of R and S be inverted? For example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, would there be a plane of symmetry? The mirror plane would require that the substituents on C2 and C3 mirror each other, but since the two substituents are both methyl and hydrogen, the positions might align. If the two methyl groups are on opposite sides, perhaps creating a plane of symmetry between the two. Wait, if the molecule is (2R,3S), and the other substituents are COOH groups on both ends, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Let me think: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If in 2 and 3 positions, we have methyl groups. If the configuration is R and S, then the arrangement could be such that the two methyl groups are on opposite sides. For example, if C2 has methyl, hydrogen, COOH, and CH(CH3)COOH. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if C2 is R and C3 is S, then the substituents would be arranged such that there's an internal plane of symmetry. For instance, if we have two chiral centers with opposite configurations, the molecule might be meso. Let me take tartaric acid as an analogy. In meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid could be a meso compound, making it optically inactive. Therefore, even though there are stereocenters, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, causing the optical inactivity. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. This configuration would not have a plane of symmetry. Since both are R, the molecule becomes chiral without any internal plane of symmetry, making it optically active. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl group is on carbon 1 of cyclohexene, which has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The (R) configuration at carbon 1 indicates a chiral center. However, cyclohexane rings can sometimes lead to planarity or symmetry. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the cyclohexene ring is not planar, and the hydroxyl group is on a chiral center. Therefore, unless there's some symmetry, this compound is chiral. However, I need to check if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring were to have a plane that reflects the hydroxyl group's configuration, but given the ring's structure and the double bond's position, it's unlikely. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol should be optically active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. The stereodescriptors are all s (which is the same as S). The molecule has three hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, each with S configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 5, all axial or equatorial? However, with three substituents, all in the same configuration, but cyclohexane's symmetry. If all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are in the same configuration (all axial or all equatorial), the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. Let's consider the chair conformation. If all three hydroxyls are axial, then each is pointing in the same direction (up or down). However, in a 1,3,5-arrangement, if all three are axial, the molecule would have a three-fold axis of symmetry but not necessarily a plane. Wait, but if you have three substituents equally spaced, the molecule might be achiral due to an internal plane. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that each pair is mirror images across a plane. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the ring, the molecule could be meso. Let me think: 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all three substituents in the same configuration. Since cyclohexane has a center of inversion at the center of the ring, but with three substituents, each separated by 120 degrees. If all three substituents are in the same configuration (say, all R or all S), does that create a chiral molecule? Wait, a molecule with a three-fold axis of symmetry (C3) can still be chiral. For example, certain chiral molecules have C3 symmetry. However, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. However, in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are identical and in the same configuration, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, the substituents are hydroxyl groups, which are all the same. Therefore, even if they are all S configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in a chair conformation, if all three hydroxyls are axial (pointing up), then the molecule would have three planes of symmetry passing through each hydroxyl and the center. But actually, for a trigonal planar arrangement (1,3,5), the molecule has a three-fold axis but not necessarily a plane. Wait, maybe it's similar to 1,3,5-trichlorocyclohexane. If all three substituents are in the same configuration (all axial or all equatorial), the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, in the case of 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, if all substituents are axial, the molecule is achiral. Similarly, 1,3,5-triol would be achiral. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three hydroxyl groups, each with S configuration, but due to the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, the molecule as a whole is achiral. Therefore, this compound would not exhibit optical activity.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1) substituted with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but here, the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's parse that. Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, butan-1-one is actually (butanone) but butanone is more commonly methyl propan-2-one. Wait, but the correct structure of butan-1-one is pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Wait, butanone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The IUPAC name is butan-1-one, which is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, butan-1-one is actually impossible because the carbonyl group cannot be at the end of a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, that's not correct. The ketone must be on a carbon that's not terminal. Therefore, butan-1-one is not a valid name. Wait, maybe this is a typo. Wait, the actual name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's break it down. The parent chain is butanone (four carbons with the ketone on carbon 1). But since ketones require the carbonyl group to be between two carbons, so butanone is butan-2-one. Therefore, butan-1-one would be impossible. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be pentan-2-one if the ketone is on the second carbon. Therefore, this might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would place the ketone on carbon 1 of a four-carbon chain. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one. Wait, but in that case, the ketone is on carbon 1 (attached to cyclopentyl), followed by three more carbons. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-C-C-C. But the first carbon is the carbonyl carbon. However, a ketone requires R-CO-R', so the carbonyl must be between two carbons. Therefore, butan-1-one is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct name is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpentan-1-one? Alternatively, maybe the original name is correct, and the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of butanone. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, the compound would be cyclopentyl-(3-methylbutyl)ketone? But then, the carbonyl is between cyclopentyl and 3-methylbutyl. However, the IUPAC name would be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If that's the case, the carbonyl is at position 1 (the first carbon) of butanone, which would make the structure O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would require the carbonyl carbon (C1) to be bonded to cyclopentyl, a methyl branch on C3. However, the carbonyl group in a ketone must be between two carbon groups. So, if the carbonyl is on C1, then C1 must be connected to two other carbons, but in this case, it's connected to cyclopentyl (which is a carbon group) and a butyl chain. Wait, perhaps cyclopentyl is considered a substituent here. Let me think again. The correct name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, which is possible only if the carbonyl is at the end, but ketones cannot be terminal. Therefore, this name is invalid. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde with a methyl group? No. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpropan-1-one. Wait, that would be possible. Propan-1-one is not possible either. Therefore, this might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one. But given that the problem states 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the actual structure is a typo. However, assuming that the name is correct, even if chemically impossible, we need to evaluate its optical activity. If the carbonyl is at position 1 of butanone, then the carbonyl carbon would be bonded to a cyclopentyl group and a propyl group with a methyl branch. However, since ketones can't be terminal, this structure is invalid, but perhaps in this context, we can proceed. The presence of a ketone group doesn't contribute to chirality. The potential chiral center would be in the carbon adjacent to the ketone. Let's consider the structure. If it's O=C-(C cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbonyl carbon is C1. The next carbon (C2) is bonded to cyclopentyl, a methyl group, and two other carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, but in that case, C2 would have four different groups: cyclopentyl, methyl, the rest of the chain (CH2CH3), and the ketone (CO). Wait, no. The ketone is on C1. So C1 is double-bonded to O and connected to cyclopentyl and C2. Therefore, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a carbonyl), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps not. Let me try again. If the structure is:\n\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:\n\nThe butan-1-one would be:\n\nO=C-(CH2)3-CH3. But that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), and the rest of the butanone is:\n\nC1 (carbonyl) connected to cyclopentyl, then C2 (CH(CH3)), C3 (CH2), and C4 (CH3). But again, the ketone can't be at the end. Therefore, perhaps the actual structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one. If that's the case, then the ketone is at C2, which is possible. Then, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But even then, the carbonyl is between cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) would be connected to cyclopentyl (via the carbonyl), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. If it's butan-2-one, the structure is CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH3. So with a cyclopentyl group attached where? If it's 1-cyclopentyl, then perhaps the cyclopentyl is on C1 (the first carbon of the butanone chain). Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If cyclopentyl is on C1, then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But that's pentan-3-one with a cyclopentyl group on C1. The correct IUPAC name would be 1-cyclopentylpentan-3-one. But given the confusion in the original name, perhaps the key point is to check for chirality. Assuming that the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, even if the name is incorrect, we can still check for chiral centers. If the carbonyl is at C1, then the carbon next to it (C2) would be connected to the carbonyl group, a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and another carbon. If C2 has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. However, given the confusion in the structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps there is no chiral center here. For example, if the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 (attached to the carbonyl) would have groups: cyclopentyl (via C1), methyl, CH2CH3, and the carbonyl. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, if that's the case, the compound would be chiral. However, if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then it's not. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, since the name may have a typo but assuming the compound as named, perhaps the carbonyl is at C1, making the adjacent carbon (C2) a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. However, given the confusion, maybe the actual answer is no. Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone with no chiral centers, then it's not active. Given that the user provided the name as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and assuming that's a valid structure (even though ketones can't be terminal), maybe the adjacent carbon (C2) has four different groups: cyclopentyl (through the carbonyl), two methyl groups, and a CH2 group. Wait, no. If C1 is O=C- then C2 would be connected to C1 (which is O=C-), cyclopentyl (if the cyclopentyl is on C1), then C2 would be CH2 or something else. This is getting too confusing. Perhaps the safest approach is to assume that there's no chiral center here, making it optically inactive. Alternatively, the compound might not have a chiral center and thus not be optically active. Given that the name might be incorrect, but in the absence of clear structural information, perhaps it's best to assume that there's no chiral center here. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.\n\nTo recap, the compounds:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers, so not active.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)...: Multiple stereocenters, no symmetry, active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, not active.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral, active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Symmetrical, not active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Possibly no chiral center, not active.\n\nTherefore, the compounds that are optically active are numbers 2, 4, 5. That's three compounds. Wait, but wait. Let me check again.\n\nFirst compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is Cl attached to C1 (double bond to C2), which has a methyl group. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH(CH3), and double bond. But double bonds are planar, so the substituents around C1 are Cl, CH(CH3), and two carbons from the double bond. Wait, for a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. So C1 would have Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. Similarly, C2 would have CH2CH2CH3 (since it's but-1-ene). Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2 gives Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2CH3? No, but that would be pentene. Wait, the original compound is but-1-ene, which is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So changing the substituents: C1 (which is CH2 in but-1-ene) becomes Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would make it 1-chloro-2-methylpropene? No. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. Double bond between 1 and 2. Then, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Therefore, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but C1 in a double bond has two substituents. So, C1 is Cl and CH(CH3), and double bond to C2. C2 is CH2CH3. Therefore, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, check for chirality. The double bond is Z, so the higher priority groups (Cl and CH(CH3)) are on the same side. However, the question is about optical activity, which requires a chiral center. Does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's check C2. C2 is attached to the double bond (two substituents), CH2CH3, and the other part. Wait, no. In the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH3, and double bond. C2 has two CH2 groups (from the double bond and CH2CH3). Therefore, C2 has groups: CH3 (from C1), two CH2 groups, and the rest. Wait, no. The structure is:\n\nC1: Cl, CH3, double bond to C2.\n\nC2: double bond to C1, and two CH2 groups (CH2 and CH2CH3).\n\nTherefore, neither C1 nor C2 have four different groups. Thus, there are no chiral centers. Hence, the first compound is not optically active.\n\nSo the first compound is not active.\n\nSecond compound: As per the given stereochemistry, it's active.\n\nThird compound: Meso, not active.\n\nFourth compound: Active.\n\nFifth compound: Active.\n\nSixth compound: Symmetrical, not active.\n\nSeventh compound: Assuming no chiral center, not active.\n\nThus, active compounds are 2,4,5. That's three compounds. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the fifth compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl is on C1. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-ene. The hydroxyl is on C1. The question is whether this carbon (C1) is a chiral center. For C1 to be chiral, it must have four different groups. The groups attached to C1 would be:\n\n- Hydroxyl (-OH)\n- The cyclohexene ring (with double bond between C3 and C4)\n- Two hydrogen atoms?\n\nWait, no. In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 is connected to:\n\n- OH\n- Two carbons from the ring (C6 and C2)\n- And another substituent (the ring continues). Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 would be connected to C6 and C2. If the hydroxyl is on C1, then the groups attached to C1 are:\n\n- OH\n- C6 (part of the ring)\n- C2 (part of the ring)\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nBut in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two hydrogens (unless substituted). Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has a hydroxyl group. The ring structure would be:\n\nC1 (OH) connected to C2 and C6.\n\nC2 connected to C1 and C3.\n\nC3 connected to C2 and C4 (with a double bond between C3 and C4).\n\nC4 connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.\n\nC5 connected to C4 and C6.\n\nC6 connected to C5 and C1.\n\nTherefore, at C1, the substituents are:\n\n- OH\n- C2 (which is part of the ring)\n- C6 (which is part of the ring)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nBut since C2 and C6 are both part of the ring but in different positions, are they considered different groups? Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:\n\n- OH\n- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6)\n- A hydrogen.\n\nBut the two ring carbons (C2 and C6) are in different positions relative to the double bond. However, for a chiral center, the substituents must be different. If C2 and C6 are part of the ring but in different environments, then they are different groups. However, in a symmetric ring, they might be equivalent. For example, in a cyclohexane ring, C2 and C6 would be equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. However, in cyclohexene, the double bond breaks the symmetry. Depending on the position of the double bond (between C3 and C4), the environment of C2 and C6 might be different. Let's imagine the chair conformation. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then C2 is adjacent to the double bond, whereas C6 is not. Therefore, the substituents on C1 (connected to C2 and C6) would be in different environments, making them different groups. Therefore, C1 would have four different groups: OH, C2 (part of the ring near the double bond), C6 (part of the ring away from the double bond), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, making the compound optically active. Hence, compound 5 is active.\n\nTherefore, the total active compounds are 2, 4, 5. That's three compounds.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought compound 5 is active, and compounds 2,4,5 are active. However, let me verify the seventh compound again. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Assuming that the name is correct, despite the possible mistake, the structure would have the ketone at C1, which is not possible, but if we imagine it as a typo for butan-2-one, then the structure would be cyclopentyl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C3 of butan-2-one. The structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. The carbonyl is at C2. Then, the adjacent carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So C3 would be CH(CH3) connected to C2 (carbonyl) and C4 (CH2). However, the chiral center would be at C3 if it has four different groups. Let's see: C3 would have:\n\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- CO (from C2)\n- CH2 (to C4)\n- And the cyclopentyl group via the chain.\n\nWait, no. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and assuming the ketone is at C1, then C1 is O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and a three-carbon chain. Then, C2 would be CH2, C3 would be CH(CH3), and C4 would be CH3. Therefore, C3 would have groups: CH(CH3), CH2 (C2), CH3 (C4), and the rest. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps there is no chiral center here. If the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nThen, the carbonyl is at C1 (if that's allowed). Then, the carbons are:\n\nC1: O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and C2.\n\nC2: CH(CH3)\n\nC3: CH2\n\nC4: CH3\n\nBut C2 would be attached to C1 (O=C-), CH3, and two CH2 groups. Therefore, C2 would have groups: O=C- (from C1), CH3, CH2CH3, and a CH2. Wait, no. If C2 is CH(CH3), then it's attached to C1 (O=C-), CH3, and two CH2 groups (from C3 and C4). Therefore, C2 would have four different groups: O=C- (from C1), CH3, CH2CH2, and CH2CH3? No. This is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps there's no chiral center here. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer is that this compound is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the total number of optically active compounds is three: compounds 2, 4, and 5.\n\nBut wait, let me check the seventh compound again. If the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbonyl is at C1 (invalid for a ketone), but if we ignore that, then the adjacent carbon (C2) is CH(CH3). The groups on C2 would be:\n\n- C1 (O=C-cyclopentyl)\n- CH3\n- CH2CH3\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, if C2 is CH(CH3), then the groups are:\n\n- O=C-cyclopentyl (from C1)\n- CH3\n- CH2CH2 (from C3)\n- And another CH2?\n\nThis is unclear. If C2 is CH(CH3), then it's attached to:\n\n- C1 (O=C-cyclopentyl)\n- CH3\n- C3 (CH2CH3)\n\nBut that's three groups. Wait, no. Each carbon has four bonds. If C2 is CH(CH3), then the four groups would be:\n\n1. O=C-cyclopentyl (from C1)\n2. CH3\n3. CH2CH2 (from C3)\n4. Hydrogen\n\nTherefore, C2 would have four different groups: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. However, this is based on assuming a valid structure, which the original name might not provide. Given the confusion in the name, but if we proceed with this analysis, then compound 7 would also be optically active. But earlier I thought maybe not, but if there's a chiral center at C2, then it would be active. Therefore, now the count becomes four compounds: 2,4,5,7.\n\nBut this depends on whether the name is correct. Since the original name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which implies a ketone at position 1 of butane, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the intended structure is different, and there is no chiral center. Therefore, the answer remains three. But this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-2-one, which would be a valid ketone. In that case, the structure would be:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. The carbonyl is at C2. Then, C3 (CH(CH3)) would have groups: C2 (O=C-), CH3, CH2, and a hydrogen. That's three different groups (O=C- is part of C2, CH3, CH2, and H), making it a chiral center. Therefore, if the correct structure is butan-2-one, then it's active. But the problem states butan-1-one. Given that ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that there's no chiral center here. Therefore, I'll stick with the original conclusion of three active compounds.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386513, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7322, prompt_tokens=993, total_tokens=8315, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality. Here's the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double-bonded carbons (Cl and CH3) are in a Z configuration. However, there are no chiral centers as neither carbon in the double bond has four different groups. **Not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) indicate multiple stereocenters and an E configuration. These stereochemical features prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. **Optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two stereocenters (R and S configurations). However, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. **Not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Both stereocenters are in the R configuration. This arrangement lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. **Optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The hydroxyl group on C1 creates a chiral center. The cyclohexene ring does not introduce symmetry that would negate chirality. **Optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The three hydroxyl groups are symmetrically arranged on the cyclohexane ring, creating a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule achiral despite the stereocenters. **Not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The ketone group at position 1 is invalid (as ketones cannot be terminal), leading to ambiguity. Assuming the correct structure, there is no chiral center. **Not optically active**.

The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, and 5. 

\boxed{3}

However, if the two substituents (methyl groups) are on adjacent carbons with opposite configurations, does that create internal compensation? Let me visualize. If the molecule has R and S configurations on adjacent carbons, it might not be a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters, and the meso form has R and S configurations leading to a plane of symmetry. However, in this case, the parent chain is different. Let's consider the structure: COOH-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH. If we mirror the molecule, would the configurations of R and S be inverted? For example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, would there be a plane of symmetry? The mirror plane would require that the substituents on C2 and C3 mirror each other, but since the two substituents are both methyl and hydrogen, the positions might align. If the two methyl groups are on opposite sides, perhaps creating a plane of symmetry between the two. Wait, if the molecule is (2R,3S), and the other substituents are COOH groups on both ends, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Let me think: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If in 2 and 3 positions, we have methyl groups. If the configuration is R and S, then the arrangement could be such that the two methyl groups are on opposite sides. For example, if C2 has methyl, hydrogen, COOH, and CH(CH3)COOH. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if C2 is R and C3 is S, then the substituents would be arranged such that there's an internal plane of symmetry. For instance, if we have two chiral centers with opposite configurations, the molecule might be meso. Let me take tartaric acid as an analogy. In meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. Similarly, in this case, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid could be a meso compound, making it optically inactive. Therefore, even though there are stereocenters, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, causing the optical inactivity. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. This configuration would not have a plane of symmetry. Since both are R, the molecule becomes chiral without any internal plane of symmetry, making it optically active. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl group is on carbon 1 of cyclohexene, which has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The (R) configuration at carbon 1 indicates a chiral center. However, cyclohexane rings can sometimes lead to planarity or symmetry. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the cyclohexene ring is not planar, and the hydroxyl group is on a chiral center. Therefore, unless there's some symmetry, this compound is chiral. However, I need to check if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring were to have a plane that reflects the hydroxyl group's configuration, but given the ring's structure and the double bond's position, it's unlikely. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol should be optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. The stereodescriptors are all s (which is the same as S). The molecule has three hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, each with S configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 5, all axial or equatorial? However, with three substituents, all in the same configuration, but cyclohexane's symmetry. If all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are in the same configuration (all axial or all equatorial), the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. Let's consider the chair conformation. If all three hydroxyls are axial, then each is pointing in the same direction (up or down). However, in a 1,3,5-arrangement, if all three are axial, the molecule would have a three-fold axis of symmetry but not necessarily a plane. Wait, but if you have three substituents equally spaced, the molecule might be achiral due to an internal plane. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that each pair is mirror images across a plane. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the ring, the molecule could be meso. Let me think: 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all three substituents in the same configuration. Since cyclohexane has a center of inversion at the center of the ring, but with three substituents, each separated by 120 degrees. If all three substituents are in the same configuration (say, all R or all S), does that create a chiral molecule? Wait, a molecule with a three-fold axis of symmetry (C3) can still be chiral. For example, certain chiral molecules have C3 symmetry. However, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. However, in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are identical and in the same configuration, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, the substituents are hydroxyl groups, which are all the same. Therefore, even if they are all S configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in a chair conformation, if all three hydroxyls are axial (pointing up), then the molecule would have three planes of symmetry passing through each hydroxyl and the center. But actually, for a trigonal planar arrangement (1,3,5), the molecule has a three-fold axis but not necessarily a plane. Wait, maybe it's similar to 1,3,5-trichlorocyclohexane. If all three substituents are in the same configuration (all axial or all equatorial), the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, in the case of 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, if all substituents are axial, the molecule is achiral. Similarly, 1,3,5-triol would be achiral. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three hydroxyl groups, each with S configuration, but due to the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, the molecule as a whole is achiral. Therefore, this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1) substituted with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but here, the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's parse that. Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, butan-1-one is actually (butanone) but butanone is more commonly methyl propan-2-one. Wait, but the correct structure of butan-1-one is pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Wait, butanone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The IUPAC name is butan-1-one, which is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, butan-1-one is actually impossible because the carbonyl group cannot be at the end of a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, that's not correct. The ketone must be on a carbon that's not terminal. Therefore, butan-1-one is not a valid name. Wait, maybe this is a typo. Wait, the actual name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's break it down. The parent chain is butanone (four carbons with the ketone on carbon 1). But since ketones require the carbonyl group to be between two carbons, so butanone is butan-2-one. Therefore, butan-1-one would be impossible. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be pentan-2-one if the ketone is on the second carbon. Therefore, this might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would place the ketone on carbon 1 of a four-carbon chain. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one. Wait, but in that case, the ketone is on carbon 1 (attached to cyclopentyl), followed by three more carbons. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-C-C-C. But the first carbon is the carbonyl carbon. However, a ketone requires R-CO-R', so the carbonyl must be between two carbons. Therefore, butan-1-one is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct name is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpentan-1-one? Alternatively, maybe the original name is correct, and the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of butanone. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, the compound would be cyclopentyl-(3-methylbutyl)ketone? But then, the carbonyl is between cyclopentyl and 3-methylbutyl. However, the IUPAC name would be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If that's the case, the carbonyl is at position 1 (the first carbon) of butanone, which would make the structure O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would require the carbonyl carbon (C1) to be bonded to cyclopentyl, a methyl branch on C3. However, the carbonyl group in a ketone must be between two carbon groups. So, if the carbonyl is on C1, then C1 must be connected to two other carbons, but in this case, it's connected to cyclopentyl (which is a carbon group) and a butyl chain. Wait, perhaps cyclopentyl is considered a substituent here. Let me think again. The correct name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, which is possible only if the carbonyl is at the end, but ketones cannot be terminal. Therefore, this name is invalid. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde with a methyl group? No. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylpropan-1-one. Wait, that would be possible. Propan-1-one is not possible either. Therefore, this might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one. But given that the problem states 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the actual structure is a typo. However, assuming that the name is correct, even if chemically impossible, we need to evaluate its optical activity. If the carbonyl is at position 1 of butanone, then the carbonyl carbon would be bonded to a cyclopentyl group and a propyl group with a methyl branch. However, since ketones can't be terminal, this structure is invalid, but perhaps in this context, we can proceed. The presence of a ketone group doesn't contribute to chirality. The potential chiral center would be in the carbon adjacent to the ketone. Let's consider the structure. If it's O=C-(C cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbonyl carbon is C1. The next carbon (C2) is bonded to cyclopentyl, a methyl group, and two other carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, but in that case, C2 would have four different groups: cyclopentyl, methyl, the rest of the chain (CH2CH3), and the ketone (CO). Wait, no. The ketone is on C1. So C1 is double-bonded to O and connected to cyclopentyl and C2. Therefore, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a carbonyl), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps not. Let me try again. If the structure is:

1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:

The butan-1-one would be:

O=C-(CH2)3-CH3. But that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), and the rest of the butanone is:

C1 (carbonyl) connected to cyclopentyl, then C2 (CH(CH3)), C3 (CH2), and C4 (CH3). But again, the ketone can't be at the end. Therefore, perhaps the actual structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one. If that's the case, then the ketone is at C2, which is possible. Then, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But even then, the carbonyl is between cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) would be connected to cyclopentyl (via the carbonyl), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. If it's butan-2-one, the structure is CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH3. So with a cyclopentyl group attached where? If it's 1-cyclopentyl, then perhaps the cyclopentyl is on C1 (the first carbon of the butanone chain). Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If cyclopentyl is on C1, then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But that's pentan-3-one with a cyclopentyl group on C1. The correct IUPAC name would be 1-cyclopentylpentan-3-one. But given the confusion in the original name, perhaps the key point is to check for chirality. Assuming that the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, even if the name is incorrect, we can still check for chiral centers. If the carbonyl is at C1, then the carbon next to it (C2) would be connected to the carbonyl group, a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and another carbon. If C2 has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. However, given the confusion in the structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps there is no chiral center here. For example, if the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 (attached to the carbonyl) would have groups: cyclopentyl (via C1), methyl, CH2CH3, and the carbonyl. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, if that's the case, the compound would be chiral. However, if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then it's not. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, since the name may have a typo but assuming the compound as named, perhaps the carbonyl is at C1, making the adjacent carbon (C2) a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. However, given the confusion, maybe the actual answer is no. Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone with no chiral centers, then it's not active. Given that the user provided the name as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and assuming that's a valid structure (even though ketones can't be terminal), maybe the adjacent carbon (C2) has four different groups: cyclopentyl (through the carbonyl), two methyl groups, and a CH2 group. Wait, no. If C1 is O=C- then C2 would be connected to C1 (which is O=C-), cyclopentyl (if the cyclopentyl is on C1), then C2 would be CH2 or something else. This is getting too confusing. Perhaps the safest approach is to assume that there's no chiral center here, making it optically inactive. Alternatively, the compound might not have a chiral center and thus not be optically active. Given that the name might be incorrect, but in the absence of clear structural information, perhaps it's best to assume that there's no chiral center here. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

To recap, the compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers, so not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)...: Multiple stereocenters, no symmetry, active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, not active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral, active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Symmetrical, not active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Possibly no chiral center, not active.

Therefore, the compounds that are optically active are numbers 2, 4, 5. That's three compounds. Wait, but wait. Let me check again.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is Cl attached to C1 (double bond to C2), which has a methyl group. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH(CH3), and double bond. But double bonds are planar, so the substituents around C1 are Cl, CH(CH3), and two carbons from the double bond. Wait, for a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. So C1 would have Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. Similarly, C2 would have CH2CH2CH3 (since it's but-1-ene). Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2 gives Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2CH3? No, but that would be pentene. Wait, the original compound is but-1-ene, which is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So changing the substituents: C1 (which is CH2 in but-1-ene) becomes Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would make it 1-chloro-2-methylpropene? No. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. Double bond between 1 and 2. Then, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Therefore, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but C1 in a double bond has two substituents. So, C1 is Cl and CH(CH3), and double bond to C2. C2 is CH2CH3. Therefore, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, check for chirality. The double bond is Z, so the higher priority groups (Cl and CH(CH3)) are on the same side. However, the question is about optical activity, which requires a chiral center. Does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's check C2. C2 is attached to the double bond (two substituents), CH2CH3, and the other part. Wait, no. In the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH3, and double bond. C2 has two CH2 groups (from the double bond and CH2CH3). Therefore, C2 has groups: CH3 (from C1), two CH2 groups, and the rest. Wait, no. The structure is:

C1: Cl, CH3, double bond to C2.

C2: double bond to C1, and two CH2 groups (CH2 and CH2CH3).

Therefore, neither C1 nor C2 have four different groups. Thus, there are no chiral centers. Hence, the first compound is not optically active.

So the first compound is not active.

Second compound: As per the given stereochemistry, it's active.

Third compound: Meso, not active.

Fourth compound: Active.

Fifth compound: Active.

Sixth compound: Symmetrical, not active.

Seventh compound: Assuming no chiral center, not active.

Thus, active compounds are 2,4,5. That's three compounds. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, the fifth compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl is on C1. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-ene. The hydroxyl is on C1. The question is whether this carbon (C1) is a chiral center. For C1 to be chiral, it must have four different groups. The groups attached to C1 would be:

- Hydroxyl (-OH)
- The cyclohexene ring (with double bond between C3 and C4)
- Two hydrogen atoms?

Wait, no. In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 is connected to:

- OH
- Two carbons from the ring (C6 and C2)
- And another substituent (the ring continues). Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 would be connected to C6 and C2. If the hydroxyl is on C1, then the groups attached to C1 are:

- OH
- C6 (part of the ring)
- C2 (part of the ring)
- And a hydrogen?

But in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two hydrogens (unless substituted). Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has a hydroxyl group. The ring structure would be:

C1 (OH) connected to C2 and C6.

C2 connected to C1 and C3.

C3 connected to C2 and C4 (with a double bond between C3 and C4).

C4 connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.

C5 connected to C4 and C6.

C6 connected to C5 and C1.

Therefore, at C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring)
- C6 (which is part of the ring)
- And a hydrogen.

But since C2 and C6 are both part of the ring but in different positions, are they considered different groups? Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- A hydrogen.

But the two ring carbons (C2 and C6) are in different positions relative to the double bond. However, for a chiral center, the substituents must be different. If C2 and C6 are part of the ring but in different environments, then they are different groups. However, in a symmetric ring, they might be equivalent. For example, in a cyclohexane ring, C2 and C6 would be equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. However, in cyclohexene, the double bond breaks the symmetry. Depending on the position of the double bond (between C3 and C4), the environment of C2 and C6 might be different. Let's imagine the chair conformation. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then C2 is adjacent to the double bond, whereas C6 is not. Therefore, the substituents on C1 (connected to C2 and C6) would be in different environments, making them different groups. Therefore, C1 would have four different groups: OH, C2 (part of the ring near the double bond), C6 (part of the ring away from the double bond), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, making the compound optically active. Hence, compound 5 is active.

Therefore, the total active compounds are 2, 4, 5. That's three compounds.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 5 is active, and compounds 2,4,5 are active. However, let me verify the seventh compound again. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Assuming that the name is correct, despite the possible mistake, the structure would have the ketone at C1, which is not possible, but if we imagine it as a typo for butan-2-one, then the structure would be cyclopentyl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C3 of butan-2-one. The structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. The carbonyl is at C2. Then, the adjacent carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So C3 would be CH(CH3) connected to C2 (carbonyl) and C4 (CH2). However, the chiral center would be at C3 if it has four different groups. Let's see: C3 would have:

- CH3 (methyl)
- CO (from C2)
- CH2 (to C4)
- And the cyclopentyl group via the chain.

Wait, no. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and assuming the ketone is at C1, then C1 is O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and a three-carbon chain. Then, C2 would be CH2, C3 would be CH(CH3), and C4 would be CH3. Therefore, C3 would have groups: CH(CH3), CH2 (C2), CH3 (C4), and the rest. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps there is no chiral center here. If the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Then, the carbonyl is at C1 (if that's allowed). Then, the carbons are:

C1: O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and C2.

C2: CH(CH3)

C3: CH2

C4: CH3

But C2 would be attached to C1 (O=C-), CH3, and two CH2 groups. Therefore, C2 would have groups: O=C- (from C1), CH3, CH2CH3, and a CH2. Wait, no. If C2 is CH(CH3), then it's attached to C1 (O=C-), CH3, and two CH2 groups (from C3 and C4). Therefore, C2 would have four different groups: O=C- (from C1), CH3, CH2CH2, and CH2CH3? No. This is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps there's no chiral center here. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer is that this compound is not optically active.

Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is three: compounds 2, 4, and 5.

But wait, let me check the seventh compound again. If the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbonyl is at C1 (invalid for a ketone), but if we ignore that, then the adjacent carbon (C2) is CH(CH3). The groups on C2 would be:

- C1 (O=C-cyclopentyl)
- CH3
- CH2CH3
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, if C2 is CH(CH3), then the groups are:

- O=C-cyclopentyl (from C1)
- CH3
- CH2CH2 (from C3)
- And another CH2?

This is unclear. If C2 is CH(CH3), then it's attached to:

- C1 (O=C-cyclopentyl)
- CH3
- C3 (CH2CH3)

But that's three groups. Wait, no. Each carbon has four bonds. If C2 is CH(CH3), then the four groups would be:

1. O=C-cyclopentyl (from C1)
2. CH3
3. CH2CH2 (from C3)
4. Hydrogen

Therefore, C2 would have four different groups: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. However, this is based on assuming a valid structure, which the original name might not provide. Given the confusion in the name, but if we proceed with this analysis, then compound 7 would also be optically active. But earlier I thought maybe not, but if there's a chiral center at C2, then it would be active. Therefore, now the count becomes four compounds: 2,4,5,7.

But this depends on whether the name is correct. Since the original name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which implies a ketone at position 1 of butane, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the intended structure is different, and there is no chiral center. Therefore, the answer remains three. But this is uncertain.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-2-one, which would be a valid ketone. In that case, the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. The carbonyl is at C2. Then, C3 (CH(CH3)) would have groups: C2 (O=C-), CH3, CH2, and a hydrogen. That's three different groups (O=C- is part of C2, CH3, CH2, and H), making it a chiral center. Therefore, if the correct structure is butan-2-one, then it's active. But the problem states butan-1-one. Given that ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that there's no chiral center here. Therefore, I'll stick with the original conclusion of three active compounds.

Final Answer: \boxed{3}
