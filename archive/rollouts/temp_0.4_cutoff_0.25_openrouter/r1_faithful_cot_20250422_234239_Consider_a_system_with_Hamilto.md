# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are determined by analyzing the properties of the Pauli matrices and the structure of the operator. 

1. **Pauli Matrices and Dot Product**: The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). The Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) each have eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

2. **Hermitian Nature**: Since \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is Hermitian (as a real linear combination of Hermitian matrices), its eigenvalues are real.

3. **Trace and Determinant**:
   - The trace of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is zero (each Pauli matrix is traceless), so the sum of its eigenvalues is zero.
   - The determinant of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is \( -1 \) (calculated using spherical coordinates for \( \vec{n} \)), so the product of its eigenvalues is \( -1 \).

4. **Eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \)**: Solving these conditions gives eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \).

5. **Scaling by \( \varepsilon \)**: The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales these eigenvalues by \( \varepsilon \), resulting in eigenvalues \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

**Final Answer**: The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \boxed{\pm \varepsilon} \).

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Hmm, eigenvalues of Pauli matrices... I remember that Pauli matrices are related to spin-1/2 systems. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1/2, but here they're multiplied by ε and a unit vector. Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So maybe when you take the combination σ · n, which is like a projection of the spin in the direction of n, the eigenvalues would be related to that projection.

Let me recall. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator in the direction of a unit vector n is S · n = (ħ/2) σ · n. The eigenvalues of S · n are ±ħ/2. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by diagonalizing the matrix. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The dot product σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. Let me write this matrix explicitly.

Let me denote the components of n as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), since it's a unit vector in spherical coordinates. Then σ · n would be:
σ_x sinθ cosφ + σ_y sinθ sinφ + σ_z cosθ.

Substituting the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So σ · n becomes:

[[ cosθ, sinθ (cosφ - i sinφ) ],
 [ sinθ (cosφ + i sinφ), -cosθ ]]

Simplifying the off-diagonal terms. Remember that e^{iφ} = cosφ + i sinφ, so cosφ - i sinφ = e^{-iφ}. Therefore, the matrix becomes:

[[ cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ} ],
 [ sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ ]]

So H = ε times this matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix H - λ I is:

[[ ε cosθ - λ, ε sinθ e^{-iφ} ],
 [ ε sinθ e^{iφ}, -ε cosθ - λ ]]

The determinant is (ε cosθ - λ)(-ε cosθ - λ) - (ε sinθ e^{-iφ})(ε sinθ e^{iφ})

Calculating the determinant:

First term: (ε cosθ - λ)(-ε cosθ - λ) = - (ε cosθ)^2 - λ (-ε cosθ) + λ (ε cosθ) + λ^2 = - (ε cosθ)^2 + λ^2

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

Multiply out (a - b)(-a - b) where a = ε cosθ and b = λ:

= -a² - a b + a b + b² = -a² + b²

So yes, the first term is - (ε cosθ)^2 + λ²

Second term: - (ε sinθ e^{-iφ})(ε sinθ e^{iφ}) = - ε² sin²θ (e^{-iφ} e^{iφ}) = - ε² sin²θ (1) = - ε² sin²θ

Therefore, determinant is (-ε² cos²θ + λ²) - ε² sin²θ = λ² - ε² (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² - ε²

Setting determinant equal to zero:

λ² - ε² = 0 => λ² = ε² => λ = ± ε

So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Wait, so regardless of the direction n, the eigenvalues are always ±ε? That seems surprising. But let me check with a specific case. Suppose n is along the z-axis. Then θ = 0, so the matrix H becomes ε σ_z, which is diagonal with entries ε and -ε. So eigenvalues ε and -ε. Similarly, if n is along x-axis, then θ = π/2, φ = 0, so the matrix becomes ε σ_x, which has eigenvalues ε and -ε. Similarly for σ_y. So indeed, regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues are ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues are always ±ε.

But wait, in the general case for spin-1/2, the operator S · n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But here, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Since σ matrices have eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε. So that's consistent. So the answer is ±ε.

But maybe I should verify with another approach. For any unit vector n, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian matrix (since Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real), so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. The trace of σ · n is Tr(σ · n) = Tr(σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, since each Pauli matrix is traceless. Therefore, the sum of eigenvalues is 0. The determinant of σ · n is... For a 2x2 matrix, determinant is product of eigenvalues. Let's compute determinant of σ · n. The determinant of the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ}], [sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ]] is (-cos²θ - sin²θ) = - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1. So determinant is -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues must multiply to -1. Since the trace is 0, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, so H = ε σ · n has eigenvalues ±ε. Yep, that confirms it. So the answer is ±ε. So regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. That makes sense because the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator in direction n, and the energy levels are split by ±ε. So the eigenvalues are indeed ±ε.

I need to determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices are connected to spin-1/2 systems. I initially thought each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues of ±1/2, but I'm now recalling that they actually have eigenvalues of ±1, as evident in σ_z having eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when considering σ · n, which represents the projection of spin in the n direction, the eigenvalues should reflect this projection.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator in the direction of unit vector n is given by S · n = (ħ/2) σ · n, with eigenvalues of ±ħ/2. In my case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. If σ · n has eigenvalues of ±1, then H would have eigenvalues of ±ε, though I should verify this.

Alright, I need to determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \sigma \cdot n \), where \(\sigma\) represents the Pauli matrices and \( n \) is a unit vector. Hmm, eigenvalues of Pauli matrices... I recall that Pauli matrices are associated with spin-1/2 systems. Each Pauli matrix typically has eigenvalues of \(\pm 1/2\), but here they are scaled by \(\varepsilon\) and a unit vector. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves actually have eigenvalues of \(\pm 1\), correct? Because, for instance, \(\sigma_z\) has eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Therefore, when you consider the combination \(\sigma \cdot n\), which represents a projection of the spin in the direction of \( n \), the eigenvalues should relate to that projection.

Let me think. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator in the direction of a unit vector \( n \) is given by \( S \cdot n = (\hbar/2) \sigma \cdot n \). The eigenvalues of \( S \cdot n \) are \(\pm \hbar/2\). However, here the Hamiltonian is \( H = \varepsilon \sigma \cdot n \). If \( \sigma \cdot n \) has eigenvalues of \(\pm 1\), then \( H \) would have eigenvalues of \(\pm \varepsilon\). I should verify this, though.

On the other hand, I might consider diagonalizing the matrix instead. The Pauli matrices consist of \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\). The dot product \(\sigma \cdot n\) is expressed as \(\sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z\). Given that \( n \) is a unit vector, it satisfies \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\).

To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by considering the matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). 

The Pauli matrices are:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is given by:
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z
\]

This results in the matrix:
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

The Hamiltonian \( H \) is then:
\[
H = \varepsilon \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(H - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon n_z - \lambda & \varepsilon (n_x - i n_y) \\ \varepsilon (n_x + i n_y) & -\varepsilon n_z - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = 0
\]

Calculating the determinant:
\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) - \varepsilon^2 (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y)
\]

Simplifying each term:
\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) = \lambda^2 - (\varepsilon n_z)^2
\]
\[
\varepsilon^2 (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2)
\]

Using the fact that \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \):
\[
\lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 n_z^2 - \varepsilon^2 (1 - n_z^2) = \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2
\]

The characteristic equation is:
\[
\lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \varepsilon
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

Let me write down the matrix for σ · n. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Let's compute that:

n_x [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_y [[0, -i], [i, 0]] + n_z [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Adding these together:

Top left element: n_z

Top right element: n_x - i n_y

Bottom left element: n_x + i n_y

Bottom right element: -n_z

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x - i n_y], [n_x + i n_y, -n_z]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0. Since H = ε σ · n, the matrix is ε times the matrix above. Let's compute the determinant.

The matrix H is:

[[ε n_z, ε (n_x - i n_y)], [ε (n_x + i n_y), -ε n_z]]

So H - λ I is:

[[ε n_z - λ, ε (n_x - i n_y)], [ε (n_x + i n_y), -ε n_z - λ]]

The determinant is (ε n_z - λ)(-ε n_z - λ) - [ε (n_x - i n_y)][ε (n_x + i n_y)]

Let me compute each part:

First term: (ε n_z - λ)(-ε n_z - λ) = (-ε² n_z² - ε n_z λ + ε n_z λ + λ²) = -ε² n_z² + λ²

Wait, expanding (a - λ)(-a - λ) where a = ε n_z:

= -a² -a λ + a λ + λ² = -a² + λ²

So that term is λ² - (ε n_z)^2

Second term: [ε (n_x - i n_y)][ε (n_x + i n_y)] = ε² (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = ε² (n_x² + n_y²)

Because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b²

So the determinant is (λ² - ε² n_z²) - ε² (n_x² + n_y²)

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1, so n_x² + n_y² = 1 - n_z²

Therefore, the determinant becomes:

λ² - ε² n_z² - ε² (1 - n_z²) = λ² - ε² n_z² - ε² + ε² n_z² = λ² - ε²

So the characteristic equation is λ² - ε² = 0, which gives λ = ± ε

Therefore, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Wait, so regardless of the direction n, the eigenvalues are always ±ε? That seems to make sense because the Pauli matrices are traceless and their sum in any direction squared would be the identity times the magnitude squared. But here, since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, so the eigenvalues should be ±ε. Because the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator in the direction n, scaled by ε. So if the spin operator has eigenvalues ±1/2, then scaling by 2ε would give ±ε. Wait, but in our case, H is ε times σ · n, and σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, so H has eigenvalues ±ε. That's consistent with the calculation above.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

But let me check with another approach. Suppose we take n in the z-direction. Then n = (0, 0, 1), so σ · n = σ_z. Then H = ε σ_z. The eigenvalues of σ_z are +1 and -1, so H has eigenvalues +ε and -ε. Similarly, if n is in any other direction, the eigenvalues should still be ±ε because the eigenvalues are basis-independent. The direction of n just changes the eigenstates, but the eigenvalues remain the same. So that's another way to see it. Since the Hamiltonian is just a scalar multiple of the component of spin in some direction, and the eigenvalues of that component are ±1, multiplying by ε gives ±ε.

Therefore, regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues are ±ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by considering the properties of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) each have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). 

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) can be written as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z
\]
Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a 2x2 matrix with trace 0 and determinant \(-1\). The eigenvalues of such a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\lambda^2 - \text{Tr}(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) \lambda + \det(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) = 0
\]
Given the trace is 0 and the determinant is \(-1\), the characteristic equation simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - 1 = 0
\]
Solving this, we find the eigenvalues \(\lambda = \pm 1\). 

Since the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is \(\varepsilon\) times the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To verify, consider when \(\vec{n}\) is along the z-axis. In this case, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \sigma_z\), which has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\), leading to \(H\) having eigenvalues \(\pm \varepsilon\). The same reasoning applies for any direction of \(\vec{n}\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

1. To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the eigenvalues of the matrix σ · n. 

The general form of σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out:

σ · n = [ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],
          [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]

The trace of this matrix is 0 (since the diagonal entries are n_z and -n_z), and the determinant should be -(n_z² + (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2) = -1 (since n is a unit vector). The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix with trace T and determinant D are (T ± sqrt(T² - 4D))/2. Plugging in T = 0 and D = -1, we get eigenvalues ±sqrt(-4*(-1))/2 = ±sqrt(4)/2 = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues of H must be ±ε.

Alternatively, since H is proportional to the spin operator in direction n, and spin operators have eigenvalues proportional to ±1/2. But in this case, the Pauli matrices themselves (without the 1/2 factor) have eigenvalues ±1, so H being ε times that would result in eigenvalues ±ε. 

Wait, but spin operators are usually S = ħ/2 σ, so S · n would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But in this problem, H = ε σ · n, so the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n, which we found to be ±1, leading to ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. 

Another check: If n is along the z-axis, then σ · n = σ_z, which has eigenvalues ±1. So H = ε σ_z has eigenvalues ±ε. Similarly, if n is along x or y, the eigenvalues remain ±ε. Therefore, regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. So the answer should be ±ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by considering the matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). This matrix is given by:

\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

The trace of this matrix is zero, and the determinant can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{det}(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) = (-n_z^2) - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = - (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = -1
\]

The characteristic equation for the eigenvalues \(\lambda\) is:

\[
\lambda^2 - \text{trace} \cdot \lambda + \text{det} = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Solving this equation gives the eigenvalues \(\lambda = \pm 1\). Since the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a scalar multiple of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), its eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

This result can also be verified by considering that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \(\pm 1\) regardless of the direction of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\). Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are:

\[
\boxed{+\varepsilon} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{-\varepsilon}
\]

The matrix representation of \( \sigma \cdot n \) would then be:

\[
\sigma \cdot n = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

This matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix since the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and the linear combination with real coefficients (since \( n \) is a real unit vector) preserves Hermiticity. To find its eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation. The trace of this matrix is \( n_z + (-n_z) = 0 \), and the determinant is \( (-n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) \). Let me compute that determinant:

First, the (1,1) entry is \( -n_z \), so the diagonal product is \( (-n_z)(-n_z) = n_z^2 \). The off-diagonal entries are \( n_x - i n_y \) and \( n_x + i n_y \). Multiplying these gives \( (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 \), since \( (a - ib)(a + ib) = a^2 + b^2 \). Therefore, the determinant is \( n_z^2 - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) \). But since \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \), this becomes \( n_z^2 - (1 - n_z^2) = 2n_z^2 - 1 \). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Wait, determinant is product of diagonal minus product of off-diagonal. So:

det(\(\sigma \cdot n\)) = (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = -n_z^2 - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = - (n_z^2 + n_x^2 + n_y^2) = -1, since \( n \) is a unit vector. Wait, hold on, that can't be. Wait, the matrix is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

So the determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = -n_z^2 - (n_x^2 + n_y^2). But since \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \), then \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 = 1 - n_z^2 \). Therefore, determinant is -n_z^2 - (1 - n_z^2) = -n_z^2 -1 + n_z^2 = -1. So determinant is -1. But the trace is 0. Therefore, the characteristic equation is \( \lambda^2 - \text{trace} \cdot \lambda + \text{det} = \lambda^2 - 0 \cdot \lambda + (-1) = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \). Therefore, eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( \sigma \cdot n \) are +1 and -1. Therefore, when we multiply by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon \sigma \cdot n \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \). 

But let me cross-check this. Suppose \( n \) is along the z-axis. Then \( n = (0, 0, 1) \), so \( \sigma \cdot n = \sigma_z \), which is diagonal with entries 1 and -1. Hence, eigenvalues are indeed +1 and -1. Then \( H = \varepsilon \sigma_z \), so eigenvalues are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

So it seems that regardless of the direction of \( n \), the eigenvalues of \( \sigma \cdot n \) are ±1, so scaling by \( \varepsilon \) gives eigenvalues ±ε. Therefore, the answer should be eigenvalues of \( \varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Alternatively, another approach: since the Pauli vector \( \sigma \) dotted with a unit vector \( n \) gives a Hermitian operator, and since any such combination can be rotated to align with the z-axis through a unitary transformation. Since eigenvalues are invariant under unitary transformations, the eigenvalues must be the same as those of \( \sigma_z \), which are ±1. Therefore, eigenvalues of \( \sigma \cdot n \) are ±1, leading to eigenvalues of \( H \) being ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues are \( \varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Wait, but perhaps there is a factor of 1/2 somewhere? Let me recall. For spin-1/2 systems, the spin operator is \( S = \hbar/2 \sigma \), so eigenvalues of \( S \cdot n \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \).
