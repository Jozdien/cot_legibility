To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity divided by the speed of light \( c \), and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
   \]
   Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

3. **Calculate the velocity factor \( \beta \):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E_X} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1.2}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]
   Breaking down the calculation:
   \[
   \gamma \beta \approx 6.59
   \]
   \[
   c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L \approx 6.59 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 4.07 \, \text{fm}
   \]

Thus, the mean decay distance is approximately \(\boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, let me recall how to approach this.

First, the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula should be something like L = γβcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity divided by the speed of light c, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle. But wait, I need to figure out τ from the given width Γ_X. 

I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime τ and the width Γ through τ ≈ ħ/Γ. Since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert units appropriately. But ħ in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm) would mean that τ = ħ / Γ. But then to get τ in seconds, I need to convert MeV to inverse seconds. Let me check: 1 GeV ≈ 1.78×10^-27 kg·m²/s², but maybe it's easier to use the conversion factor for ħc. 

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. 

First, the proper lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Since Γ is 320 MeV, converting that to GeV for consistency with other terms: Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. But actually, units for Γ are energy, and ħ has units of energy·time. So τ = ħ / Γ. So ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Therefore, τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875×10^-24 seconds. 

But wait, let me verify. The Planck constant ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, because 1 eV·s = 6.582×10^-16 GeV·s, so 1 GeV·s is 1e9 eV·s, so ħ in eV·s is 6.582×10^-16 eV·s, so in GeV·s, divide by 1e9: 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So, correct. Therefore τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. 

Now, to find the mean decay distance, I need the velocity of the meson. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy E is related to the Lorentz factor γ by E = γ m c². Since we are working in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. Therefore, γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. 

Then, β is v/c, which can be found from γ. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), solving for β: β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 ))). Let's compute that. 

(8/1.2) is approximately 6.6667, so γ ≈ 6.6667. Then, 1/γ² ≈ 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. Therefore, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. 

So, the velocity is approximately 0.9887c. 

Now, the mean decay distance L is γβcτ. Wait, but actually, in natural units, c=1, so the mean path length is L = γ β c τ. But τ is in seconds, so I need to convert τ into meters. Let's see. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute everything in natural units first and then convert. Let's see. 

The lifetime τ in natural units (where c=1, ħ=1) is τ = 1 / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so we need to convert Γ to inverse seconds to get τ in seconds. Wait, no. Wait, Γ in energy units (MeV) is related to τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, and Γ is 0.32 GeV, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. 

Then, the mean decay length is L = γ β c τ. Let's compute that. 

γ is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667, β is ≈ 0.9887, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, τ is ≈ 2.056e-24 s. 

So multiplying all together: L ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.056e-24. Let's compute step by step. 

First, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667*0.9887. Let me compute that: 

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.658. So total is approx 5.9322 + 0.658 ≈ 6.59. 

Then, 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9. 

Then, 1.977e9 * 2.056e-24 ≈ (1.977 * 2.056) * 10^(9-24) ≈ 4.065 * 10^-15 meters. 

Wait, 1.977 * 2.056 is approx 1.977*2 = 3.954, 1.977*0.056≈0.1107, so total ≈ 4.0647. So 4.0647e-15 meters, which is 4.0647 femtometers. 

But wait, that seems extremely small. A mean decay distance of a few femtometers? That seems like it's happening immediately, but given the lifetime is 1e-24 seconds, which is indeed very short. 

But wait, mesons typically have lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds or shorter, but resonances have even shorter lifetimes. For example, the Rho meson has a width of around 150 MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of about 4e-24 seconds, similar to what we calculated here. So a decay length of femtometers would make sense for a resonance, as they decay almost immediately. 

But let me check if I did the calculation correctly. Let's redo the calculation more precisely. 

First, compute γ: E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

Then β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(6.6667²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/44.444) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct. 

τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

Then L = γ β c τ. 

γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.59. 

c = 3e8 m/s. 

τ = 2.056875e-24 s. 

So L = 6.59 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.59 * 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24. 

First, 6.59 * 3 = 19.77. 

19.77 * 2.056875 ≈ 19.77 * 2 = 39.54, 19.77 * 0.056875 ≈ 1.125, total ≈ 40.665. 

Then, 40.665 * 1e-16 = 4.0665e-15 meters, which is 4.0665 femtometers. 

So approximately 4.07 femtometers. 

But wait, that's about the size of a nucleus. So the particle decays pretty much immediately after production, which makes sense for a resonance with a large width (short lifetime). 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me check again. 

Wait, another approach: in particle physics, the mean decay length is often calculated using L = (cτ) * βγ. So cτ is the natural length scale. 

Given τ = 2.056e-24 s, cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 6.168e-16 meters, which is 0.6168 femtometers. Then multiply by βγ: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.59. So 6.59 * 0.6168 femtometers ≈ 4.06 femtometers. Same result. 

Yes, so the calculation seems consistent. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.06 femtometers. 

But let me check with another formula. The formula for decay length is also sometimes written as L = (E / m) * (p / E) * cτ, which simplifies to (p / m) * cτ. Wait, but p is the momentum. Let's see. 

Alternatively, maybe using E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Since in natural units, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²). 

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. 

Then, β = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875, which matches the earlier calculation. 

So then, γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Thus, βγ = (p/m) = 7.91 / 1.2 ≈ 6.59. 

Therefore, L = βγ cτ. 

So again, cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.168e-16 m. Multiply by βγ ≈6.59: 6.168e-16 *6.59 ≈4.06e-15 m, which is 4.06 femtometers. 

So all methods give the same result. 

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.06 femtometers. 

But the question might expect the answer in meters or centimeters? But 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters. 

Alternatively, maybe they want it in some other unit, but I think femtometers (fm) are standard for particle physics. 

Alternatively, maybe they want the answer in centimeters. Let's see: 4.06e-15 meters is 4.06e-13 centimeters. 

But I think femtometers is acceptable. 

So the final answer should be approximately 4.1 femtometers. However, let me check the exact numbers again for precision. 

Calculating τ: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582/0.32 * 1e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. Correct. 

cτ: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m. 

βγ: 8/1.2 * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = 6.6667 * sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.59. 

So 6.59 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 40.67e-16 m = 4.067e-15 m = 4.067 femtometers. 

Yes, so rounding to two significant figures, since Γ is given as 320 MeV (two sig figs), E is 8 GeV (one sig fig), mass is 1.2 GeV (two sig figs). The least number of sig figs is one (from E=8 GeV), but maybe Γ is 320 which is two sig figs. Wait, 320 has two sig figs? If it's written as 320 without a decimal, sometimes it's ambiguous. If it's 320 MeV, it could be two or three sig figs. But in particle physics, widths are usually quoted with uncertainties, so maybe 320 is two sig figs. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume two sig figs. Then the answer should be given with two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers. 

Alternatively, if E is 8 GeV (one sig fig), then the answer should be 4 femtometers. But given that γ is 8/1.2=6.666..., which is more precise. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects two sig figs. 

Alternatively, the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, two sig figs. The mass is 1.2 GeV, two sig figs. The energy is 8 GeV, one sig fig. But in the calculation of γ, we have 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is limited by the least number of sig figs. If 8 has one sig fig, then γ would be 7 (one sig fig). But that seems rough. Alternatively, maybe the energy is given as 8.0 GeV, which would be two sig figs. But it's written as 8 GeV. So perhaps one sig fig. This is a bit ambiguous. 

However, given that 320 MeV is two sig figs, and 1.2 GeV is two sig figs, but 8 GeV is one, it's safer to go with the least, which is one. But that would make the answer 4e-15 meters, which is 4 femtometers. But since in intermediate steps we have 4.06, maybe they expect two sig figs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects natural units where c=1 and calculation in those units. Wait, but the answer is in distance, so it's necessary to convert. 

Alternatively, maybe I should present the answer as approximately 4.1 femtometers. 

But let me check with precise calculation. 

Compute βγ: 

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. 

γ = E/m = 8/1.2 = 6.666666...

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868689...

Thus, βγ = (8/1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.98868689 ≈ 6.5902. 

τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. 

cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m. 

Then L = βγ * cτ = 6.5902 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 40.67e-16 m = 4.067e-15 m = 4.067 fm. 

So approximately 4.07 fm. 

Given the inputs, if we take Γ as 320 MeV (two sig figs), m as 1.2 GeV (two sig figs), and E as 8 GeV (one sig fig), the precision is limited by the 8 GeV. But if 8 GeV is considered as one sig fig, then the answer should be 4 fm. However, sometimes in physics, trailing zeros without a decimal are ambiguous, but in contexts like this, 8 GeV might actually be considered as a precise value (maybe exact), so the sig figs could come from the other numbers. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps we should present two sig figs, given that most inputs have two. 

Therefore, rounding to two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers. 

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.1 femtometers. 

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}.

Therefore, τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875×10^-24 seconds. 

But wait, let me verify. The Planck constant ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, because 1 eV·s = 6.582×10^-16 GeV·s, so 1 GeV·s is 1e9 eV·s, so ħ in eV·s is 6.582×10^-16 eV·s, so in GeV·s, divide by 1e9: 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So, correct. Therefore τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. 

Now, to find the mean decay distance, I need the velocity of the meson. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy E is related to the Lorentz factor γ by E = γ m c². Since we are working in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. Therefore, γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

(8/1.2) is approximately 6.6667, so γ ≈ 6.6667. Then, 1/γ² ≈ 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. Therefore, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. 

So, the velocity is approximately 0.9887c. 

Now, the mean decay distance L is γβcτ. Wait, but actually, in natural units, c=1, so the mean path length is L = γ β c τ. But τ is in seconds, so I need to convert τ into meters. Let's see.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X with the following parameters: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Let me work through this step by step.

The mean decay distance is calculated using the formula L = γβcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity relative to the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle.

First, I need to find τ from the width Γ_X using the uncertainty principle relationship: τ = ħ/Γ. Converting the width to GeV for consistency: Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

Since ħ has units of energy×time, and its value is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, I can calculate:
τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875×10^-24 seconds.

Let me verify this calculation. The Planck constant ħ is indeed 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s (since 1 eV·s = 6.582×10^-16 GeV·s, and in GeV·s, we divide by 10^9). So τ ≈ 6.582×10^-25/0.32 ≈ 2.056×10^-24 seconds, which confirms my calculation.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Using the production energy E_X = 8 GeV and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, I can calculate the Lorentz factor.

In natural units (c=1): E = γm, therefore γ = E/m = 8 GeV/1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

To find β, I use the relationship: γ = 1/sqrt(1-β²)
Solving for β: β = sqrt(1-(1/γ²)) = sqrt(1-(1/((8/1.2)²)))

Since γ ≈ 6.6667, then 1/γ² ≈ 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225
Therefore, 1-0.0225 = 0.9775, and β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So the velocity of the meson is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now I can calculate the mean decay distance using L = γβcτ. In natural units where c=1, this becomes L = γβτ. However, since τ is in seconds, I need to consider the conversion to distance units in my final calculation.

I need to determine the mean decay distance for a meson resonance X. The parameters provided are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Let me figure out how to proceed.

The mean decay distance is linked to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula is L = γβcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over the speed of light c, and τ is the proper lifetime. To find τ, I must derive it from the width Γ_X.

The uncertainty principle connects the lifetime τ and the width Γ by τ ≈ ħ/Γ. With Γ in MeV, I must convert units. In natural units (with c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm), we find τ = ħ / Γ. But to express τ in seconds, I must convert MeV to inverse seconds. Considering 1 GeV ≈ 1.78×10^-27 kg·m²/s², perhaps using the conversion factor for ħc is more straightforward.

Approaching this stepwise: τ is related to Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Given Γ is 320 MeV, converting it to GeV yields Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. Since Γ is an energy unit and ħ is energy·time, τ = ħ / Γ follows. With ħ approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, we get τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875×10^-24 seconds.

Let’s verify. The Planck constant ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 eV·s = 6.582×10^-16 GeV·s, and 1 GeV·s equals 1e9 eV·s, ħ becomes 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Correct, so τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

To find the mean decay distance, I need the meson's velocity. With the production energy E_X = 8 GeV and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, the total energy E relates to γ as E = γ m c². In natural units where c=1, E = γ m implies γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

β, defined as v/c, can be derived from γ. Given γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), solving for β gives β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 ))). Calculating:

(8/1.2) is approximately 6.6667, so γ ≈ 6.6667. Thus, 1/γ² ≈ 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225, leading to 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root yields β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

The velocity is roughly 0.9887c.

Therefore, mean decay distance L = γβcτ. Remembering c=1 in natural units, L = γ β c τ. But τ is in seconds, so I should convert τ to meters. Alternatively, computing entirely in natural units might be simpler.

Let\'s see. \n\nIn natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the lifetime τ in natural units is τ = 1/Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so to convert τ into seconds, we need to use the conversion factor with ħ. Wait, perhaps it\'s more straightforward to compute the decay length in natural units and then convert to meters. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s compute the velocity β, the gamma factor, then multiply by the speed (β c) times the lifetime (τ). But τ is in seconds, so β c τ would be in meters. \n\nWait, let\'s recall the formula again. The mean decay length L is given by:\n\nL = γ β c τ\n\nBut τ is the proper lifetime, which is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nL = γ β c (ħ / Γ )\n\nBut let\'s check the units. ħ has units of GeV·s, Γ is in GeV. So ħ / Γ has units of seconds. Then c is in m/s, so multiplying by c gives meters. So L has units of meters. \n\nGiven that, we can compute L as:\n\nL = γ β (c ħ / Γ )\n\nBut let\'s compute each term numerically.\n\nFirst, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887\n\nc is approximately 3e8 m/s\n\nħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s\n\nΓ is 0.32 GeV\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nL = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV )\n\nCompute the term inside the parentheses first:\n\n3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (3 * 6.582 / 0.32) * 1e8 * 1e-25 = (19.746 / 0.32) * 1e-17 ≈ 61.70625 * 1e-17 = 6.170625e-16 m\n\nThen multiply by γ and β:\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let\'s compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591, total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913\n\nTherefore, L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ let\'s compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15, 0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16, total ≈ 3.702375e-15 + 3.648e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Wait, that can\'t be right. That\'s 4e-15 meters, which is 4 femtometers. That seems extremely short. But mesons typically have decay lengths on the order of millimeters to kilometers depending on their energy and lifetime. For example, a pion with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds would have a decay length of gamma * beta * c * tau. If this comes out as femtometers, that\'s way too short. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again.\n\nFirst, compute γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Correct.\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nNow, τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nThen, L = γ β c τ. So:\n\nγβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nτ = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nTherefore, L = 6.5913 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.\n\nCompute 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.97739e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.068 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. So 4.068 femtometers. That\'s what I had before.\n\nBut that seems way too short. For example, a typical strong interaction time is around 1e-23 seconds, so a particle with a lifetime of 1e-24 seconds would decay almost immediately, but even so, if it\'s moving at relativistic speeds, the decay length might still be short. However, 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus, which seems too small. But let\'s think about the numbers.\n\nWait, the width Γ is 320 MeV, which is quite large. A large width corresponds to a short lifetime. Since Γ is the decay width, τ = ħ / Γ, so with Γ = 320 MeV, τ is indeed very short. Let\'s confirm with an example: the Rho meson has a width of about 150 MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of about 4e-24 seconds. So 320 MeV would be about half that, so 2e-24 seconds, which matches our calculation. So a particle with such a large width would decay almost immediately, hence the decay length is extremely short. \n\nBut in experimental terms, particles with such short lifetimes are considered resonances and don\'t travel measurable distances; they decay at the production point. Therefore, the mean decay distance being on the order of femtometers is consistent with them not leaving a detectable track. \n\nSo, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me check once again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy? Wait, the problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". If E_X is the total energy, then our calculation is correct. If it\'s the kinetic energy, then we need to compute the total energy as K + m = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV. But the problem says "production energy", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics, sometimes "energy" refers to total energy, but sometimes kinetic energy. Hmm.\n\nWait, let\'s see. If E is the total energy, then γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If E is the kinetic energy, then total energy is K + m = 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV, so γ = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈ 7.6667. Then β would be sqrt(1 - (m/(K + m))²) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/9.2)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (0.1304)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.017) ≈ sqrt(0.983) ≈ 0.9915. Then γβ would be 7.6667 * 0.9915 ≈ 7.6. Then L would be 7.6 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 7.6 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 4.69e-15 meters, still femtometers. So even if it\'s kinetic energy, the decay length is still femtometers. \n\nBut the problem states "production energy E_X =8 GeV". In particle physics, when they give the production energy, it\'s usually the total energy, especially for a resonance. So probably the original calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of β. Let me check:\n\nIf E is total energy, then gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nSo β is approximately 0.9887, gamma is approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.056e-24.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.\n\nThen, 6.591 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9773e9.\n\nThen, 1.9773e9 * 2.056e-24 ≈ (1.9773 * 2.056) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters.\n\nYes, which is 4.067 femtometers. So that\'s the mean decay distance.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s think about another approach. The mean decay length can also be written as L = (E / m) * (p / E) * c * (ħ / Γ), where p is the momentum. Because gamma = E/m, beta = p/E (since in natural units, p = gamma beta m, so beta = p/(gamma m) = (gamma beta m)/(gamma m) ) = beta. Wait, maybe that\'s not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since p = gamma beta m, so beta = p / (gamma m). But E = gamma m, so p = gamma beta m = beta E. Therefore, beta = p / E.\n\nBut in any case, the formula L = gamma beta c tau is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using lab frame quantities: the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the mean lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau, and the particle is moving at speed beta c, so the decay length is gamma beta c tau. So that\'s the same as before.\n\nGiven that, and the numbers check out, even though the result is small, it\'s consistent with the large width leading to a very short lifetime. \n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. \n\nBut wait, the problem says "mean decay distance". Maybe they expect the answer in meters, or centimeters, but 4e-15 meters is 4 femtometers, which is 4e-15 m or 4e-6 nanometers. \n\nBut in particle physics, decay lengths are sometimes given in centimeters. Let\'s convert 4.07e-15 meters to centimeters: 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. That\'s 0.407 femtometers, wait no, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. Still extremely small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion for ħ. Let me double-check that.\n\nThe value of ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm this. \n\n1 eV·s = 1.602e-19 J·s. But since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV·s = 1e9 eV·s = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J·s = 1.602e-10 J·s. But Planck\'s constant is h = 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Therefore, converting ħ into GeV·s:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J·s/GeV·s) ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yes, correct. So that part is right.\n\nTherefore, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by gamma beta c:\n\ngamma beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s.\n\nWait, no, units: gamma beta is unitless, c is m/s. So 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s. But then τ is 2.056e-24 s. So multiplying those gives 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ (1.9774 * 2.056) * 1e-15 m ≈ 4.067e-15 m. So same result.\n\nYes, so the calculation is consistent. Therefore, despite seeming counterintuitive, the mean decay distance is about 4.07 femtometers. Given that the width is very large (320 MeV), the particle decays almost immediately, so it doesn\'t travel any significant distance. Hence, such resonances are observed as peaks in invariant mass plots rather than actual tracks in detectors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be approximately 4.07e-15 meters. But let me check if there was a miscalculation somewhere. \n\nWait, another way: Using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then the decay length L = gamma * beta * tau. But in natural units, tau is in GeV^-1, so need to convert to meters. \n\nWait, in natural units, 1 GeV^-1 = (ħc)/GeV = (197.33 MeV·fm)/(1e3 MeV) ) = 0.19733 fm. So 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 0.19733 fm. Therefore, L in natural units is gamma * beta * tau, where tau = 1/Gamma. So Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so tau = 1/0.32 GeV^-1 ≈ 3.125 GeV^-1. Therefore, L = gamma * beta * 3.125 GeV^-1. Then convert GeV^-1 to meters: 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 0.19733e-15 m (since 1 fm = 1e-15 m). So 3.125 GeV^-1 ≈ 3.125 * 0.19733e-15 m ≈ 0.6167e-15 m. Then multiply by gamma * beta: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913. So 6.5913 * 0.6167e-15 m ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So the answer is about 4.1e-15 meters. However, given the precision of the input parameters (E_X=8 GeV, m_X=1.2 GeV, Γ_X=320 MeV), maybe we should round it to one significant figure or two. But since 8 GeV is exact, 1.2 GeV is two significant figures, 320 MeV is two significant figures (0.32 GeV). So the answer should have two significant figures. 4.07e-15 m rounds to 4.1e-15 m, which is 4.1 femtometers. \n\nBut let me check if the question expects the answer in some other unit. 4.1e-15 meters is 4.1 femtometers, which is 4.1e-6 nanometers or 4.1e-15 meters. Alternatively, in centimeters, it\'s 4.1e-13 cm. \n\nBut in particle physics, femtometers (also called fermis) are commonly used for nuclear sizes, so 4.1 fm is a reasonable unit here. So perhaps the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers, written as 4.1 fm or 4.1×10^-15 m.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is about 4.1 femtometers. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389443, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4121, prompt_tokens=942, total_tokens=5063, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \(X\), we use the formula \(L = \gamma \beta c \tau\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, \(\beta\) is the velocity divided by the speed of light \(c\), and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8\ \text{GeV}}{1.2\ \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

2. **Calculate the velocity factor \(\beta\):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E_X}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2\ \text{GeV}}{8\ \text{GeV}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

3. **Calculate the proper lifetime \(\tau\):**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}\ \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32\ \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}\ \text{s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance \(L\):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}\ \text{s}
   \]
   \[
   L \approx 6.5913 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{m} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the mean decay distance is \(\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{m}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

first, then convert. Let's see. 

In natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the lifetime τ in natural units is τ = 1/Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so to convert τ into seconds, we need to use the conversion factor with ħ. Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to compute the decay length in natural units and then convert to meters. 

Alternatively, let's compute the velocity β, the gamma factor, then multiply by the speed (β c) times the lifetime (τ). But τ is in seconds, so β c τ would be in meters. 

Wait, let's recall the formula again. The mean decay length L is given by:

L = γ β c τ

But τ is the proper lifetime, which is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ.

So putting it all together:

L = γ β c (ħ / Γ )

But let's check the units. ħ has units of GeV·s, Γ is in GeV. So ħ / Γ has units of seconds. Then c is in m/s, so multiplying by c gives meters. So L has units of meters. 

Given that, we can compute L as:

L = γ β (c ħ / Γ )

But let's compute each term numerically.

First, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

c is approximately 3e8 m/s

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s

Γ is 0.32 GeV

So plugging in:

L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV )

Compute the term inside the parentheses first:

3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (3 * 6.582 / 0.32) * 1e8 * 1e-25 = (19.746 / 0.32) * 1e-17 ≈ 61.70625 * 1e-17 = 6.170625e-16 m

Then multiply by γ and β:

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591, total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913

Therefore, L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ let's compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15, 0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16, total ≈ 3.702375e-15 + 3.648e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Wait, that can't be right. That's 4e-15 meters, which is 4 femtometers. That seems extremely short. But mesons typically have decay lengths on the order of millimeters to kilometers depending on their energy and lifetime. For example, a pion with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds would have a decay length of gamma * beta * c * tau. If this comes out as femtometers, that's way too short. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

First, compute γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Correct.

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

Then, L = γ β c τ. So:

γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.

c = 3e8 m/s.

τ = 2.056875e-24 s.

Therefore, L = 6.5913 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.97739e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.068 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. So 4.068 femtometers. That's what I had before.

But that seems way too short. For example, a typical strong interaction time is around 1e-23 seconds, so a particle with a lifetime of 1e-24 seconds would decay almost immediately, but even so, if it's moving at relativistic speeds, the decay length might still be short. However, 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus, which seems too small. But let's think about the numbers.

Wait, the width Γ is 320 MeV, which is quite large. A large width corresponds to a short lifetime. Since Γ is the decay width, τ = ħ / Γ, so with Γ = 320 MeV, τ is indeed very short. Let's confirm with an example: the Rho meson has a width of about 150 MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of about 4e-24 seconds. So 320 MeV would be about half that, so 2e-24 seconds, which matches our calculation. So a particle with such a large width would decay almost immediately, hence the decay length is extremely short. 

But in experimental terms, particles with such short lifetimes are considered resonances and don't travel measurable distances; they decay at the production point. Therefore, the mean decay distance being on the order of femtometers is consistent with them not leaving a detectable track. 

So, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me check once again.

Alternatively, maybe the production energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy? Wait, the problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". If E_X is the total energy, then our calculation is correct. If it's the kinetic energy, then we need to compute the total energy as K + m = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV. But the problem says "production energy", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics, sometimes "energy" refers to total energy, but sometimes kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, let's see. If E is the total energy, then γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If E is the kinetic energy, then total energy is K + m = 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV, so γ = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈ 7.6667. Then β would be sqrt(1 - (m/(K + m))²) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/9.2)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (0.1304)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.017) ≈ sqrt(0.983) ≈ 0.9915. Then γβ would be 7.6667 * 0.9915 ≈ 7.6. Then L would be 7.6 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 7.6 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 4.69e-15 meters, still femtometers. So even if it's kinetic energy, the decay length is still femtometers. 

But the problem states "production energy E_X =8 GeV". In particle physics, when they give the production energy, it's usually the total energy, especially for a resonance. So probably the original calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of β. Let me check:

If E is total energy, then gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

So β is approximately 0.9887, gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.056e-24.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.

Then, 6.591 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9773e9.

Then, 1.9773e9 * 2.056e-24 ≈ (1.9773 * 2.056) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters.

Yes, which is 4.067 femtometers. So that's the mean decay distance.

But to confirm, let's think about another approach. The mean decay length can also be written as L = (E / m) * (p / E) * c * (ħ / Γ), where p is the momentum. Because gamma = E/m, beta = p/E (since in natural units, p = gamma beta m, so beta = p/(gamma m) = (gamma beta m)/(gamma m) ) = beta. Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since p = gamma beta m, so beta = p / (gamma m). But E = gamma m, so p = gamma beta m = beta E. Therefore, beta = p / E.

But in any case, the formula L = gamma beta c tau is correct.

Alternatively, using lab frame quantities: the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the mean lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau, and the particle is moving at speed beta c, so the decay length is gamma beta c tau. So that's the same as before.

Given that, and the numbers check out, even though the result is small, it's consistent with the large width leading to a very short lifetime. 

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. 

But wait, the problem says "mean decay distance". Maybe they expect the answer in meters, or centimeters, but 4e-15 meters is 4 femtometers, which is 4e-15 m or 4e-6 nanometers. 

But in particle physics, decay lengths are sometimes given in centimeters. Let's convert 4.07e-15 meters to centimeters: 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. That's 0.407 femtometers, wait no, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. Still extremely small.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion for ħ. Let me double-check that.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm this. 

1 eV·s = 1.602e-19 J·s. But since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV·s = 1e9 eV·s = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J·s = 1.602e-10 J·s. But Planck's constant is h = 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Therefore, converting ħ into GeV·s:

1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J·s/GeV·s) ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yes, correct. So that part is right.

Therefore, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct.

Then, multiplying by gamma beta c:

gamma beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s.

Wait, no, units: gamma beta is unitless, c is m/s. So 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s. But then τ is 2.056e-24 s. So multiplying those gives 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ (1.9774 * 2.056) * 1e-15 m ≈ 4.067e-15 m. So same result.

Yes, so the calculation is consistent. Therefore, despite seeming counterintuitive, the mean decay distance is about 4.07 femtometers. Given that the width is very large (320 MeV), the particle decays almost immediately, so it doesn't travel any significant distance. Hence, such resonances are observed as peaks in invariant mass plots rather than actual tracks in detectors.

Therefore, the final answer should be approximately 4.07e-15 meters. But let me check if there was a miscalculation somewhere. 

Wait, another way: Using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then the decay length L = gamma * beta * tau. But in natural units, tau is in GeV^-1, so need to convert to meters. 

Wait, in natural units, 1 GeV^-1 = (ħc)/GeV = (197.33 MeV·fm)/(1e3 MeV) ) = 0.19733 fm. So 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 0.19733 fm. Therefore, L in natural units is gamma * beta * tau, where tau = 1/Gamma. So Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so tau = 1/0.32 GeV^-1 ≈ 3.125 GeV^-1. Therefore, L = gamma * beta * 3.125 GeV^-1. Then convert GeV^-1 to meters: 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 0.19733e-15 m (since 1 fm = 1e-15 m). So 3.125 GeV^-1 ≈ 3.125 * 0.19733e-15 m ≈ 0.6167e-15 m. Then multiply by gamma * beta: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913. So 6.5913 * 0.6167e-15 m ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Same result. 

Therefore, regardless of the method, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So the answer is about 4.1e-15 meters. However, given the precision of the input parameters (E_X=8 GeV, m_X=1.2 GeV, Γ_X=320 MeV), maybe we should round it to one significant figure or two. But since 8 GeV is exact, 1.2 GeV is two significant figures, 320 MeV is two significant figures (0.32 GeV). So the answer should have two significant figures. 4.07e-15 m rounds to 4.1e-15 m, which is 4.1 femtometers. 

But let me check if the question expects the answer in some other unit. 4.1e-15 meters is 4.1 femtometers, which is 4.1e-6 nanometers or 4.1e-15 meters. Alternatively, in centimeters, it's 4.1e-13 cm. 

But in particle physics, femtometers (also called fermis) are commonly used for nuclear sizes, so 4.1 fm is a reasonable unit here. So perhaps the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers, written as 4.1 fm or 4.1×10^-15 m.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is about 4.1 femtometers. 

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{m}}.

Let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute γβ: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.\n\nThen multiply by cτ: c = 3×10^8 m/s, τ = 2.056875×10^-24 s.\n\nSo cτ = 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s ≈ 6.1706×10^-16 m.\n\nThen L = γβ * cτ ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706×10^-16 m ≈ 4.068×10^-15 m.\n\nBut this seems extremely small. Maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the production energy is the total energy or the kinetic energy. The problem states "production energy is E_X =8 GeV". If E_X is the total energy, then the calculation is correct. But if E_X is the kinetic energy, then we need to adjust γ. However, the problem says "production energy", which typically refers to the total energy. Let me confirm.\n\nIn particle physics, when they refer to the energy of a particle, it\'s usually the total energy (rest mass + kinetic). So E = γm. Therefore, using E_X =8 GeV and m_X=1.2 GeV, γ = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Correct.\n\nSo β = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nThen τ = ħ/Γ. Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^-25 s? Wait, no: 6.582×10^-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056×10^-24 seconds. Wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875×10^-25 s = 2.056875×10^-24 s. Correct.\n\nThen L = γβcτ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s.\n\nWait, but let\'s compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute γβ: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. Then cτ: 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s ≈ 6.1706×10^-16 m. Then multiply by γβ: 6.591 * 6.1706×10^-16 ≈ 4.068×10^-15 m.\n\nWait, 4.068×10^-15 meters is 4.068 femtometers. That seems extremely small. The typical decay lengths for particles like B mesons are on the order of millimeters or centimeters. But maybe for a resonance with a very large width (Γ=320 MeV), the lifetime is extremely short, leading to a very small decay length. That might make sense. Let me check.\n\nThe width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via τ = ħ/Γ. A larger Γ implies a shorter lifetime. Since Γ here is 320 MeV, which is quite large (for example, the Z boson has a width of about 2.5 GeV, and its lifetime is around τ ≈ 1/(2.5 GeV) * 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s ≈ 2.6×10^-25 s, leading to a decay length of maybe a few nanometers if it were moving at relativistic speeds. But for a resonance, perhaps the decay length is indeed very small. However, meson resonances typically decay via the strong interaction and have lifetimes around 10^-23 seconds, leading to decay lengths on the order of femtometers. So 4 femtometers seems reasonable. Let me confirm with an example.\n\nTake the rho meson, for instance. Its width is about 150 MeV, so Γ=0.15 GeV. Then τ = 6.582×10^-25 / 0.15 ≈ 4.388×10^-24 s. If produced with energy, say, 1 GeV (mass 0.77 GeV), then γ = 1/0.77 ≈ 1.299, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/1.687) ≈ sqrt(0.407) ≈ 0.638. Then L = γβcτ ≈ 1.299 * 0.638 * 3×10^8 * 4.388×10^-24 ≈ 1.299*0.638 ≈ 0.828, times 3e8*4.388e-24 ≈ 1.316e-15, so total L ≈ 0.828*1.316e-15 ≈ 1.09e-15 m, or about 1.09 femtometers. That\'s even smaller. So our calculation of 4 femtometers for a Γ=320 MeV meson with higher energy seems plausible. So maybe the answer is around 4×10^-15 meters. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let\'s check the calculation again:\n\nFirst, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nτ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m_X^2 / E_X^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44 / 64)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.\n\nThen, L = γβcτ.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nγβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nτ = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen L = 6.591 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 4.068e-15 m.\n\nYes, that\'s 4.068 femtometers. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That seems correct given the parameters. Since the problem states that X is a meson resonance, which typically have very short lifetimes (as they decay via the strong interaction), such a small decay length makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be around 4.07×10^-15 meters, which can be written as 4.07 femtometers or 4.07 fm.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a different approach. Sometimes, in experimental contexts, the mean decay length might be calculated using the formula L = (E_X * c * τ) / m_X. Wait, let\'s see. Let me think about the formula again. The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle\'s rest frame. The mean decay length in the lab frame is L = vγτ, where v is the velocity. Since v = βc, then L = βγcτ. Which is the same as what I did. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, since τ is the proper lifetime, the lab frame lifetime is γτ. Then the decay length is v * γτ = βc * γτ = γβcτ, which is the same as before. So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 6.582×10^-25 seconds. Then τ = ħ/Γ = (6.582×10^-25 s·GeV)/0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056×10^-24 s. Then using L = γβcτ. But in natural units, c=1, so L = γβτ. But τ is in seconds, so to convert to meters, we need to multiply by c (3e8 m/s). Wait, perhaps another approach in natural units.\n\nIn natural units (GeV, seconds, meters), we can convert τ from seconds to meters by multiplying by c. Since 1 second = 3e8 meters (since light travels 3e8 meters in one second). Therefore, τ in meters is τ_seconds * 3e8 m/s. Wait, but actually, to convert time to length, we multiply by c. So τ in seconds converted to meters is τ * c = 2.056875e-24 s * 3e8 m/s ≈ 6.1706e-16 m. Then, L = γβ * τ (in meters). So γβ is 6.591, so L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 m. Same result. So this confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. Since the problem might expect the answer in meters or perhaps centimeters, but femtometers are more appropriate here. However, let\'s check if there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters, which is 4×10^-15 m. That is indeed correct. For example, a typical strong interaction decay length would be on the order of femtometers because the lifetimes are around 1e-23 to 1e-24 seconds. For example, a particle with τ=1e-24 s moving at v≈c would have a decay length of about 3e8 m/s * 1e-24 s = 3e-16 m = 0.3 femtometers. Our calculation gives 4 femtometers, which is longer because the particle here has a higher Lorentz gamma factor (γ≈6.67), so even though the proper lifetime is short, the time dilation extends the decay length. So 4 femtometers seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in natural units, but no, since they ask for the mean decay distance in physical units (meters, I assume). Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters. Rounded to two significant figures, since the given values are E_X=8 GeV (1 significant figure), m_X=1.2 GeV (two significant figures), Γ_X=320 MeV (two significant figures). The least number of significant figures in the given data is one (from E_X=8 GeV), but I think usually, in such problems, the energy might be considered as having one or two significant figures, depending on context. However, 8 GeV could be one or two (if it\'s 8.0 GeV). But since it\'s written as 8 GeV, probably one significant figure. However, m_X is 1.2 GeV (two), Γ_X is 320 MeV (two, since 3.2e2). So maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures. Then 4.1×10^-15 m. But the calculation gives 4.068, so 4.1×10^-15 m. But let me check again the exact numbers.\n\nLet me recompute the exact value without rounding:\n\nτ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 = 20.56875 × 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nγ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988686991.\n\nThen γβ = 6.666666... * 0.988686991 ≈ 6.591129.\n\ncτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen L = 6.591129 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 6.591129 * 6.170625 × 1e-16.\n\nCompute 6.591129 * 6.170625:\n\n6.591129 * 6 = 39.546774\n\n6.591129 * 0.170625 ≈ 1.125\n\nSo total ≈ 39.546774 + 1.125 ≈ 40.671774 × 1e-16 m = 4.0671774e-15 m.\n\nSo approximately 4.07e-15 m, which is 4.07 femtometers. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.1 femtometers (if rounding to two significant figures) or 4.07 femtometers (if three significant figures). Given the input data, E_X=8 GeV (1 sig fig), m_X=1.2 GeV (2 sig figs), Γ_X=320 MeV (2 sig figs). The least precise value is E_X with 1 sig fig, but in practice, the energy might be known more precisely. However, since the problem provides Γ_X as 320 MeV (two sig figs) and m_X as 1.2 GeV (two sig figs), it\'s safer to use two sig figs for the answer. Therefore, 4.1×10^-15 m, which is 4.1 femtometers.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer in units like millimeters or meters, but 4.1e-15 m is 4.1 femtometers, which is a typical scale for strong interaction decays. So the answer should be approximately 4.1×10^-15 meters.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389664, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3771, prompt_tokens=616, total_tokens=4387, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity relative to the speed of light, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   Using the uncertainty principle relationship \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   Using the production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

3. **Calculate the velocity factor \( \beta \):**
   Using the relationship \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E_X} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1.2}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.591
   \]
   \[
   c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L \approx 6.591 \times 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.068 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

Rounding to two significant figures, the mean decay distance is:
\[
\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}
\]

Wait, actually, since τ is in seconds and c is in meters per second, multiplying by c gives the distance in meters.

Wait, let me check the units. τ is in seconds, c is about 3×10^8 m/s, so L = γβcτ. Let me compute this.

First, compute γβ: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.

Then multiply by cτ: c = 3×10^8 m/s, τ = 2.056875×10^-24 s.

So cτ = 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s ≈ 6.1706×10^-16 m.

Then L = γβ * cτ ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706×10^-16 m ≈ 4.068×10^-15 m.

But this seems extremely small. Maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the production energy is the total energy or the kinetic energy. The problem states "production energy is E_X =8 GeV". If E_X is the total energy, then the calculation is correct. But if E_X is the kinetic energy, then we need to adjust γ. However, the problem says "production energy", which typically refers to the total energy. Let me confirm.

In particle physics, when they refer to the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy (rest mass + kinetic). So E = γm. Therefore, using E_X =8 GeV and m_X=1.2 GeV, γ = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Correct.

So β = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Then τ = ħ/Γ. Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^-25 s? Wait, no: 6.582×10^-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056×10^-24 seconds. Wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875×10^-25 s = 2.056875×10^-24 s. Correct.

Then L = γβcτ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s.

Wait, but let's compute this step by step.

First, compute γβ: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. Then cτ: 3×10^8 m/s * 2.056875×10^-24 s ≈ 6.1706×10^-16 m. Then multiply by γβ: 6.591 * 6.1706×10^-16 ≈ 4.068×10^-15 m.

Wait, 4.068×10^-15 meters is 4.068 femtometers. That seems extremely small. The typical decay lengths for particles like B mesons are on the order of millimeters or centimeters. But maybe for a resonance with a very large width (Γ=320 MeV), the lifetime is extremely short, leading to a very small decay length. That might make sense. Let me check.

The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via τ = ħ/Γ. A larger Γ implies a shorter lifetime. Since Γ here is 320 MeV, which is quite large (for example, the Z boson has a width of about 2.5 GeV, and its lifetime is around τ ≈ 1/(2.5 GeV) * 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s ≈ 2.6×10^-25 s, leading to a decay length of maybe a few nanometers if it were moving at relativistic speeds. But for a resonance, perhaps the decay length is indeed very small. However, meson resonances typically decay via the strong interaction and have lifetimes around 10^-23 seconds, leading to decay lengths on the order of femtometers. So 4 femtometers seems reasonable. Let me confirm with an example.

Take the rho meson, for instance. Its width is about 150 MeV, so Γ=0.15 GeV. Then τ = 6.582×10^-25 / 0.15 ≈ 4.388×10^-24 s. If produced with energy, say, 1 GeV (mass 0.77 GeV), then γ = 1/0.77 ≈ 1.299, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/1.687) ≈ sqrt(0.407) ≈ 0.638. Then L = γβcτ ≈ 1.299 * 0.638 * 3×10^8 * 4.388×10^-24 ≈ 1.299*0.638 ≈ 0.828, times 3e8*4.388e-24 ≈ 1.316e-15, so total L ≈ 0.828*1.316e-15 ≈ 1.09e-15 m, or about 1.09 femtometers. That's even smaller. So our calculation of 4 femtometers for a Γ=320 MeV meson with higher energy seems plausible. So maybe the answer is around 4×10^-15 meters. But let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let's check the calculation again:

First, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

β = sqrt(1 - (m_X^2 / E_X^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44 / 64)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Then, L = γβcτ.

Compute each term:

γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.

c = 3e8 m/s.

τ = 2.056875e-24 s.

So cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.170625e-16 m.

Then L = 6.591 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 4.068e-15 m.

Yes, that's 4.068 femtometers. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That seems correct given the parameters. Since the problem states that X is a meson resonance, which typically have very short lifetimes (as they decay via the strong interaction), such a small decay length makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be around 4.07×10^-15 meters, which can be written as 4.07 femtometers or 4.07 fm.

But let me check if there's a different approach. Sometimes, in experimental contexts, the mean decay length might be calculated using the formula L = (E_X * c * τ) / m_X. Wait, let's see. Let me think about the formula again. The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The mean decay length in the lab frame is L = vγτ, where v is the velocity. Since v = βc, then L = βγcτ. Which is the same as what I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, since τ is the proper lifetime, the lab frame lifetime is γτ. Then the decay length is v * γτ = βc * γτ = γβcτ, which is the same as before. So the formula is correct.

Therefore, my calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 6.582×10^-25 seconds. Then τ = ħ/Γ = (6.582×10^-25 s·GeV)/0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056×10^-24 s. Then using L = γβcτ. But in natural units, c=1, so L = γβτ. But τ is in seconds, so to convert to meters, we need to multiply by c (3e8 m/s). Wait, perhaps another approach in natural units.

In natural units (GeV, seconds, meters), we can convert τ from seconds to meters by multiplying by c. Since 1 second = 3e8 meters (since light travels 3e8 meters in one second). Therefore, τ in meters is τ_seconds * 3e8 m/s. Wait, but actually, to convert time to length, we multiply by c. So τ in seconds converted to meters is τ * c = 2.056875e-24 s * 3e8 m/s ≈ 6.1706e-16 m. Then, L = γβ * τ (in meters). So γβ is 6.591, so L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 m. Same result. So this confirms it.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. Since the problem might expect the answer in meters or perhaps centimeters, but femtometers are more appropriate here. However, let's check if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters, which is 4×10^-15 m. That is indeed correct. For example, a typical strong interaction decay length would be on the order of femtometers because the lifetimes are around 1e-23 to 1e-24 seconds. For example, a particle with τ=1e-24 s moving at v≈c would have a decay length of about 3e8 m/s * 1e-24 s = 3e-16 m = 0.3 femtometers. Our calculation gives 4 femtometers, which is longer because the particle here has a higher Lorentz gamma factor (γ≈6.67), so even though the proper lifetime is short, the time dilation extends the decay length. So 4 femtometers seems reasonable.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in natural units, but no, since they ask for the mean decay distance in physical units (meters, I assume). Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.07×10^-15 meters. Rounded to two significant figures, since the given values are E_X=8 GeV (1 significant figure), m_X=1.2 GeV (two significant figures), Γ_X=320 MeV (two significant figures). The least number of significant figures in the given data is one (from E_X=8 GeV), but I think usually, in such problems, the energy might be considered as having one or two significant figures, depending on context. However, 8 GeV could be one or two (if it's 8.0 GeV). But since it's written as 8 GeV, probably one significant figure. However, m_X is 1.2 GeV (two), Γ_X is 320 MeV (two, since 3.2e2). So maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures. Then 4.1×10^-15 m. But the calculation gives 4.068, so 4.1×10^-15 m. But let me check again the exact numbers.

Let me recompute the exact value without rounding:

τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 = 20.56875 × 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988686991.

Then γβ = 6.666666... * 0.988686991 ≈ 6.591129.

cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then L = 6.591129 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 6.591129 * 6.170625 × 1e-16.

Compute 6.591129 * 6.170625:

6.591129 * 6 = 39.546774

6.591129 * 0.170625 ≈ 1.125

So total ≈ 39.546774 + 1.125 ≈ 40.671774 × 1e-16 m = 4.0671774e-15 m.

So approximately 4.07e-15 m, which is 4.07 femtometers. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.1 femtometers (if rounding to two significant figures) or 4.07 femtometers (if three significant figures). Given the input data, E_X=8 GeV (1 sig fig), m_X=1.2 GeV (2 sig figs), Γ_X=320 MeV (2 sig figs). The least precise value is E_X with 1 sig fig, but in practice, the energy might be known more precisely. However, since the problem provides Γ_X as 320 MeV (two sig figs) and m_X as 1.2 GeV (two sig figs), it's safer to use two sig figs for the answer. Therefore, 4.1×10^-15 m, which is 4.1 femtometers.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in units like millimeters or meters, but 4.1e-15 m is 4.1 femtometers, which is a typical scale for strong interaction decays. So the answer should be approximately 4.1×10^-15 meters.


**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

Let me recall that in particle physics, the mean decay length is given by L = (cτ) * βγ. So first, compute cτ, then multiply by βγ. So first, compute cτ. But τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.1706e-16 meters. Then βγ is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591. Therefore, L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706e-16 m ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. But that\'s in meters. Converting to more appropriate units like centimeters or femtometers: 4.068e-15 meters is 4.068e-13 cm or 4.068 femtometers. However, this seems extremely small. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the formula again. The proper lifetime τ is related to the width by τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me check the conversion again. The Planck constant ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. But then βγ is approx 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. So L = 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. That\'s 4.068 femtometers. But particles with lifetimes around 1e-24 seconds would have decay lengths in the femtometer range. However, 4 femtometers is extremely short, even for a resonance. But meson resonances typically have very short lifetimes. For example, the rho meson has a width around 150 MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of about 4e-24 seconds, leading to a similar decay length.\n\nWait, but the production energy is 8 GeV. But when we compute γ, we used E_X = 8 GeV. But is that the total energy or the kinetic energy? The problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". Assuming E_X is the total energy. Then γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. That\'s correct. Then βγ is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. So the calculation seems correct. But 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters. So is that the answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me confirm with another approach. The mean decay length is L = v * t, where v is the velocity and t is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. So L = v * γτ. Since β = v/c, then L = β c γ τ. Which is the same as βγ c τ. So that\'s the same formula. So the calculation is correct.\n\nBut let\'s check the numbers again. Γ_X is 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ_X. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ_X is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. Then cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. Then βγ ≈ 6.591, so L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. That\'s 4.068 femtometers. That seems correct. But is that a reasonable number? For example, a tau lepton with a lifetime of ~3e-13 seconds and high gamma factor can have decay lengths in millimeters. But here, the lifetime is much shorter (1e-24 seconds) so even with gamma ~6.6, the decay length is femtometers. So yes, such a particle would decay almost immediately. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the production energy is the kinetic energy? If E_X is the kinetic energy, then total energy E = K + m = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV. Then γ = E/m = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈ 7.6667. Then β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(58.777)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0170) ≈ sqrt(0.983) ≈ 0.9915. Then βγ ≈ 7.6667 * 0.9915 ≈ 7.6. Then L = 7.6 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.69e-15 meters, which is about 4.7 femtometers. But the problem states "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". It\'s unclear whether that\'s total energy or kinetic. In high-energy physics, often energies are given as total energy, but sometimes kinetic. However, given that the mass is 1.2 GeV, an 8 GeV total energy would make sense. But if it\'s kinetic, then E_total is higher. But the problem doesn\'t specify. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "production energy is E_X=8GeV". If that\'s the total energy, then γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If it\'s kinetic, then E_total = 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV. The answer would differ. So this is a possible ambiguity. But since the problem states "production energy", perhaps it refers to the total energy. Alternatively, maybe the production energy is the momentum? Wait, no, production energy is likely the total energy. Let me check the possible difference. If E is total, γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If E is kinetic, then γ = (K + m)/m = (8 + 1.2)/1.2 = 9.2/1.2 ≈ 7.6667. So depending on that, the answer changes. However, since the problem doesn\'t specify, perhaps it\'s better to assume that E_X is the total energy. But maybe the problem uses a different definition. Let me check standard conventions. In particle physics, when someone refers to the "production energy" of a particle, they usually mean the total energy. Because the kinetic energy would be E - m. So I think γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667 is correct. Therefore, the calculation of L ≈ 4.068e-15 meters, or 4.068 femtometers. But let\'s check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula: L = (c * ħ * E_X) / (m_X * Γ_X). Let\'s see. Since L = γ β c τ, and τ = ħ / Γ_X, so substituting, L = γ β c (ħ / Γ_X). Then, γ = E_X / m_X, β = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2). So substituting, L = (E_X / m_X) * sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2) * c * ħ / Γ_X. Let\'s compute this.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nE_X = 8 GeV,\n\nm_X = 1.2 GeV,\n\nΓ_X = 0.32 GeV,\n\nc = 3e8 m/s,\n\nħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (8 / 1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2 / 8)^2) * 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.\n\nFirst compute each part:\n\n8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.\n\n(1.2 / 8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.\n\nMultiply these: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.\n\nThen 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16.\n\nDivide by 0.32: 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 ≈ 6.1706e-16.\n\nMultiply by 6.591: 6.1706e-16 * 6.591 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters.\n\nSame result. So 4.068e-15 meters, which is 4.068 femtometers. So the answer is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But perhaps the problem expects units in meters or centimeters. However, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. Alternatively, in natural units, using GeV and inverse GeV, but I think the answer is expected in meters or centimeters. So converting 4.07e-15 meters to more common units: 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so 4.07 femtometers. Since particle physics often uses femtometers or centimeters (1 cm = 1e2 meters). But 4.07e-15 m is 4.07e-13 cm. However, the answer is more naturally expressed in femtometers. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let\'s check the calculation once more for errors.\n\nWait, I just realized that when using Γ_X = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, and ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, the calculation of τ is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 s. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. Then βγ is (E/m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = (8/1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. Multiply by cτ: 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. Correct. So the answer is indeed approximately 4.07 femtometers. But maybe the problem expects the answer in meters, so 4.07e-15 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s an error in units. Let me check the conversion from Γ to τ. The relation τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is in GeV, so τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.17e-16 m. So that\'s 0.617 femtometers. Wait, no, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters. So 6.17e-16 meters is 0.617 femtometers. Then multiplying by βγ (6.591) gives 0.617 * 6.591 ≈ 4.07 femtometers. Correct. So the answer is 4.07 femtometers.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in centimeters. 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But that\'s 0.000407 femtometers, which is the same as 4.07e-4 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But femtometers to centimeters: 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is 1e-13 centimeters. So 4.07 femtometers is 4.07e-13 centimeters. So both 4.07 femtometers or 4.07e-13 cm are correct. But in particle physics, femtometers (also called fermis) are standard for such scales. So the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers. Rounding to two significant figures, since Γ_X is given as 320 MeV (two significant figures), the answer would be 4.1 femtometers. But let\'s check the inputs: E_X=8 GeV (1 sig fig?), m_X=1.2 GeV (two sig figs), Γ_X=320 MeV (two sig figs). The least number of sig figs is 1 from E_X. But maybe 8 GeV is considered one sig fig, but sometimes trailing zeros without decimal can be ambiguous. If 8 GeV is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig: 4e-15 meters or 4 femtometers. But maybe the problem expects more precise. Alternatively, considering 8 GeV could be two sig figs if the trailing zero is significant, but usually, 8 GeV is one sig fig. However, 320 MeV is two sig figs, m_X is 1.2 GeV (two sig figs). So perhaps the answer should have two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more precise constants. Let me use ħ = 6.582119569e-25 GeV·s. Then τ = 6.582119569e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.05691236e-24 s. Then cτ = 2.05691236e-24 * 299792458 ≈ 6.1705e-16 meters. Then βγ: γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666..., β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988686991. So βγ ≈ 6.666666667 * 0.988686991 ≈ 6.5911294. Multiply by cτ: 6.5911294 * 6.1705e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. So more precisely, 4.068e-15 meters. So approximately 4.07 femtometers. Rounding to two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers. Alternatively, if the problem expects three sig figs, 4.07 femtometers. Depending on the desired precision. But given the inputs, two sig figs seems appropriate. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.1 femtometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\text{ fm}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389847, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3897, prompt_tokens=794, total_tokens=4691, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the mean decay distance for the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity ratio, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
   \]
   Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Convert \( \tau \) to meters using \( c \tau \):**
   \[
   c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

4. **Calculate the velocity ratio \( \beta \):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E_X} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1.2}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

5. **Calculate \( \gamma \beta \):**
   \[
   \gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.591
   \]

6. **Determine the mean decay distance \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta \times c \tau \approx 6.591 \times 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.068 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

Converting this to femtometers (1 femtometer = \( 10^{-15} \) meters):
   \[
   L \approx 4.07 \, \text{fm}
   \]

Considering significant figures, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Wait, let me check.

Alternatively, using the formula for mean path length: L = (E_X / m_X) * (1 / Γ_X) * ħ c.

Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward formula. Let me recall that in particle physics, the mean decay length is given by L = (cτ) * βγ. So first, compute cτ, then multiply by βγ. So first, compute cτ. But τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.1706e-16 meters. Then βγ is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591. Therefore, L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1706e-16 m ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. But that's in meters. Converting to more appropriate units like centimeters or femtometers: 4.068e-15 meters is 4.068e-13 cm or 4.068 femtometers. However, this seems extremely small. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the formula again. The proper lifetime τ is related to the width by τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me check the conversion again. The Planck constant ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. But then βγ is approx 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. So L = 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. That's 4.068 femtometers. But particles with lifetimes around 1e-24 seconds would have decay lengths in the femtometer range. However, 4 femtometers is extremely short, even for a resonance. But meson resonances typically have very short lifetimes. For example, the rho meson has a width around 150 MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of about 4e-24 seconds, leading to a similar decay length.

Wait, but the production energy is 8 GeV. But when we compute γ, we used E_X = 8 GeV. But is that the total energy or the kinetic energy? The problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". Assuming E_X is the total energy. Then γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. That's correct. Then βγ is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. So the calculation seems correct. But 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters. So is that the answer?

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me confirm with another approach. The mean decay length is L = v * t, where v is the velocity and t is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. So L = v * γτ. Since β = v/c, then L = β c γ τ. Which is the same as βγ c τ. So that's the same formula. So the calculation is correct.

But let's check the numbers again. Γ_X is 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ_X. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ_X is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. Then cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. Then βγ ≈ 6.591, so L ≈ 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. That's 4.068 femtometers. That seems correct. But is that a reasonable number? For example, a tau lepton with a lifetime of ~3e-13 seconds and high gamma factor can have decay lengths in millimeters. But here, the lifetime is much shorter (1e-24 seconds) so even with gamma ~6.6, the decay length is femtometers. So yes, such a particle would decay almost immediately. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach?

Wait, perhaps the production energy is the kinetic energy? If E_X is the kinetic energy, then total energy E = K + m = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV. Then γ = E/m = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈ 7.6667. Then β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(58.777)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0170) ≈ sqrt(0.983) ≈ 0.9915. Then βγ ≈ 7.6667 * 0.9915 ≈ 7.6. Then L = 7.6 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.69e-15 meters, which is about 4.7 femtometers. But the problem states "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". It's unclear whether that's total energy or kinetic. In high-energy physics, often energies are given as total energy, but sometimes kinetic. However, given that the mass is 1.2 GeV, an 8 GeV total energy would make sense. But if it's kinetic, then E_total is higher. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "production energy is E_X=8GeV". If that's the total energy, then γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If it's kinetic, then E_total = 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV. The answer would differ. So this is a possible ambiguity. But since the problem states "production energy", perhaps it refers to the total energy. Alternatively, maybe the production energy is the momentum? Wait, no, production energy is likely the total energy. Let me check the possible difference. If E is total, γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If E is kinetic, then γ = (K + m)/m = (8 + 1.2)/1.2 = 9.2/1.2 ≈ 7.6667. So depending on that, the answer changes. However, since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's better to assume that E_X is the total energy. But maybe the problem uses a different definition. Let me check standard conventions. In particle physics, when someone refers to the "production energy" of a particle, they usually mean the total energy. Because the kinetic energy would be E - m. So I think γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667 is correct. Therefore, the calculation of L ≈ 4.068e-15 meters, or 4.068 femtometers. But let's check with another approach.

Alternatively, use the formula: L = (c * ħ * E_X) / (m_X * Γ_X). Let's see. Since L = γ β c τ, and τ = ħ / Γ_X, so substituting, L = γ β c (ħ / Γ_X). Then, γ = E_X / m_X, β = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2). So substituting, L = (E_X / m_X) * sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2) * c * ħ / Γ_X. Let's compute this.

Plugging in the numbers:

E_X = 8 GeV,

m_X = 1.2 GeV,

Γ_X = 0.32 GeV,

c = 3e8 m/s,

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So,

L = (8 / 1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2 / 8)^2) * 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

First compute each part:

8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

(1.2 / 8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Multiply these: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.

Then 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 ≈ 6.1706e-16.

Multiply by 6.591: 6.1706e-16 * 6.591 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters.

Same result. So 4.068e-15 meters, which is 4.068 femtometers. So the answer is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But perhaps the problem expects units in meters or centimeters. However, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. Alternatively, in natural units, using GeV and inverse GeV, but I think the answer is expected in meters or centimeters. So converting 4.07e-15 meters to more common units: 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so 4.07 femtometers. Since particle physics often uses femtometers or centimeters (1 cm = 1e2 meters). But 4.07e-15 m is 4.07e-13 cm. However, the answer is more naturally expressed in femtometers. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let's check the calculation once more for errors.

Wait, I just realized that when using Γ_X = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, and ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, the calculation of τ is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 s. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 6.1707e-16 meters. Then βγ is (E/m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = (8/1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591. Multiply by cτ: 6.591 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. Correct. So the answer is indeed approximately 4.07 femtometers. But maybe the problem expects the answer in meters, so 4.07e-15 meters.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in units. Let me check the conversion from Γ to τ. The relation τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is in GeV, so τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct. Then cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.17e-16 m. So that's 0.617 femtometers. Wait, no, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters. So 6.17e-16 meters is 0.617 femtometers. Then multiplying by βγ (6.591) gives 0.617 * 6.591 ≈ 4.07 femtometers. Correct. So the answer is 4.07 femtometers.

But maybe the problem expects the answer in centimeters. 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But that's 0.000407 femtometers, which is the same as 4.07e-4 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But femtometers to centimeters: 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is 1e-13 centimeters. So 4.07 femtometers is 4.07e-13 centimeters. So both 4.07 femtometers or 4.07e-13 cm are correct. But in particle physics, femtometers (also called fermis) are standard for such scales. So the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers. Rounding to two significant figures, since Γ_X is given as 320 MeV (two significant figures), the answer would be 4.1 femtometers. But let's check the inputs: E_X=8 GeV (1 sig fig?), m_X=1.2 GeV (two sig figs), Γ_X=320 MeV (two sig figs). The least number of sig figs is 1 from E_X. But maybe 8 GeV is considered one sig fig, but sometimes trailing zeros without decimal can be ambiguous. If 8 GeV is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig: 4e-15 meters or 4 femtometers. But maybe the problem expects more precise. Alternatively, considering 8 GeV could be two sig figs if the trailing zero is significant, but usually, 8 GeV is one sig fig. However, 320 MeV is two sig figs, m_X is 1.2 GeV (two sig figs). So perhaps the answer should have two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise constants. Let me use ħ = 6.582119569e-25 GeV·s. Then τ = 6.582119569e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.05691236e-24 s. Then cτ = 2.05691236e-24 * 299792458 ≈ 6.1705e-16 meters. Then βγ: γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666..., β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988686991. So βγ ≈ 6.666666667 * 0.988686991 ≈ 6.5911294. Multiply by cτ: 6.5911294 * 6.1705e-16 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. So more precisely, 4.068e-15 meters. So approximately 4.07 femtometers. Rounding to two sig figs: 4.1 femtometers. Alternatively, if the problem expects three sig figs, 4.07 femtometers. Depending on the desired precision. But given the inputs, two sig figs seems appropriate. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.1 femtometers.

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}.
