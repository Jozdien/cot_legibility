# Original Question

Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \lambda and the angle \theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,

To determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), we consider the radiation from an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis.

1. **Radiation Pattern Analysis**:
   - The oscillating charge distribution is most likely a dipole radiator due to its symmetry along the z-axis and linear oscillation.
   - The power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole is given by:
     \[
     \frac{dP}{d\Omega} \propto \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}
     \]
   - The maximum power \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:
   - The power at any angle \( \theta \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \).
   - For \( \theta = 30^\circ \), we calculate:
     \[
     \sin^2(30^\circ) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Form of the Function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \)**:
   - The function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) must include the dependence on both \( \lambda \) and \( \theta \).
   - The power radiated is proportional to \( \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4} \), as derived from the dipole radiation formula.

### Final Answer
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}, and a possible form of \( f \) is \boxed{\dfrac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem about an oscillating charge distribution that's shaped like a spheroid, right? The symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates electromagnetic waves with a wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. They mention that this power is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is A, and I need to find two things: first, the fraction of A that is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and second, a possible form of the function f.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about radiation from charge distributions. For an oscillating charge distribution, the radiation pattern depends on the multipole moments. Since it's a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, maybe it's a dipole radiator? Or maybe higher multipoles? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the exact nature of the oscillation, just that it's a spheroid. Hmm.

But in general, the simplest case is a dipole radiator. For a dipole antenna, the power radiated per unit solid angle is given by the formula:

dP/dΩ = (k^4 * p_0^2 / (32π²ε₀ c)) * sin²θ

Where p_0 is the dipole moment, k is the wave number (2π/λ), and θ is the angle from the dipole axis. The maximum power occurs at θ = 90 degrees, where sin²θ is 1. So the maximum power A would be (k^4 p_0^2)/(32π²ε₀ c). Then, the power at an angle θ is A * sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30 degrees would be sin²(30°). Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = 1/4. So the fraction would be 1/4, or 25% of A.

But wait, the problem mentions that the charge distribution is a spheroid. A spheroid could imply a quadrupole or higher moment? Hmm, but if it's oscillating along the z-axis, maybe it's still a dipole. Wait, a spheroid could be prolate or oblate. If it's oscillating in such a way that the shape changes along the z-axis, then the dominant radiation might still be dipole.

Alternatively, if the charge distribution is undergoing quadrupole oscillations, the radiation pattern would be different. For a quadrupole, the angular dependence is more complicated, like sinθ cosθ or something. But the problem states "possible form of f", so maybe they expect the dipole formula. Also, the answer of 1/4 at 30 degrees is a standard result for dipole radiation.

But let me verify. Let's recall the dipole radiation formula. The time-averaged power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is:

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ ω⁴ p₀²)/(32π²c) sin²θ

Yes, and since ω = 2πc/λ, so ω⁴ is proportional to 1/λ⁴. Therefore, the function f would involve sin²θ and 1/λ⁴. But the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So perhaps f(λ, θ) = (constant / λ⁴) sin²θ. Then, the maximum value A occurs when sin²θ is maximum, which is 1, so A = constant / λ⁴. Therefore, the ratio would be sin²θ, so at 30 degrees, sin²(30°) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4.

Alternatively, if the radiation were quadrupole, the angular dependence would be different. For example, a quadrupole has a sin²θ cos²θ dependence, which peaks at different angles. But since the problem states that the maximum is A, and asks for the fraction at θ = 30°, if it were quadrupole, the fraction would be different. But since the answer 1/4 is a standard result for dipole, and given that the problem mentions a spheroid with symmetry along z-axis oscillating, which could be a dipole oscillation, I think dipole is the right approach here.

So, possible form of f would be proportional to sin²θ / λ⁴. But the problem states f is a function of λ and θ. So the dependence on λ would be 1/λ⁴, and on θ would be sin²θ. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = C * sin²θ / λ⁴, where C is a constant. Then, the maximum A is when sin²θ = 1, so A = C / λ⁴. Therefore, the ratio is sin²θ, so at θ=30°, it's 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is sin²θ / λ⁴ times a constant.

But the problem says "a possible form of f". So they might want the functional form without the constants, just the dependence on λ and θ. So f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²θ / λ⁴. So the answer would be 1/4 and f ∝ sin²θ / λ⁴.

Alternatively, maybe they want the exact expression? But since constants are not given, probably just the proportionality.

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if the charge distribution is a rotating spheroid, but the problem says oscillating. So it's linear oscillations along the z-axis. Therefore, dipole radiation.

Alternatively, maybe the charge distribution is a sphere oscillating in size, but that would be a monopole oscillation, which doesn't radiate. So since it's a spheroid, maybe it's a dipole.

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/4 and f proportional to sin²θ / λ⁴.

Wait, but in dipole radiation, the power is proportional to ω^4, which is (2πc/λ)^4, so 1/λ^4. So yes, the dependence on λ is 1/λ^4. So the function f would have a sin²θ term and 1/λ^4 term.

Therefore, the fraction is 1/4 and the possible form is f(λ,θ) = (something) * sin²θ / λ^4.

So in the answer, they might write the fraction as 1/4 and the function as sin²θ / λ^4.

Hence, the answers are 1/4 and sin²θ / λ⁴.

**Final Answer**
The fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}, and a possible form of f is \boxed{\dfrac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}}.

# Anthropic completion

I'm dealing with a problem involving a spheroid-shaped oscillating charge distribution with its symmetry axis aligned along the z-axis. This oscillating distribution generates electromagnetic waves with wavelength λ. I need to determine the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone, which is described by some function f that depends on λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. Given that the maximum radiated power is A, I must find: 1) what fraction of A is radiated at θ = 30°, and 2) a possible expression for the function f.

I should consider what I understand about radiation from charge distributions. For oscillating charge distributions, the radiation pattern is determined by the multipole moments. Since we're dealing with a spheroid that has symmetry along the z-axis, it could be a dipole radiator or possibly involve higher multipoles. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the oscillation type, only that the charge distribution has a spheroidal shape.

Generally speaking, the simplest scenario would be a dipole radiator. In the case of a dipole antenna, the formula for power radiated per unit solid angle is:

dP/dΩ = (k^4 * p_0^2 / (32π²ε₀ c)) * sin²θ

In this equation, p_0 represents the dipole moment, k is the wave number (2π/λ), and θ is the angle measured from the dipole axis. The maximum power radiation occurs at θ = 90° where sin²θ equals 1.

Alright, I have a situation involving an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. Due to its oscillation, it emits electromagnetic waves with a wavelength λ. The problem is focused on the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone, and this power is described as a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The peak power radiated is A, and my task is to determine two things: the fraction of A that is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and a potential form for the function f.

Let's consider the basics of radiation from charge distributions. The radiation pattern for an oscillating charge distribution is influenced by the multipole moments. Given that it is a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, it might be a dipole radiator, or possibly involve higher multipoles. However, the problem doesn't specify the precise nature of the oscillation, only that it has a spheroidal shape.

Generally, for simplicity, a dipole radiator is a straightforward case to consider. In the context of a dipole antenna, the power radiated per unit solid angle is calculated with the formula:

dP/dΩ = (k^4 * p_0^2 / (32π²ε₀ c)) * sin²θ

Here, p_0 represents the dipole moment, k is the wave number (2π/λ), and θ is the angle from the dipole axis. The maximum power is radiated at θ = 90 degrees, which is when sin²θ equals 1.

Therefore, the fraction would be 1/4, or 25% of the maximum power A.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "a possible form of f". If the function f is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum is indeed at θ=90°, and the fraction at θ=30° is 1/4. But is this the case for a spheroidal charge distribution?\n\nWait, a spheroid could be prolate or oblate. But the problem just says spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. If it\'s oscillating in such a way that the charge distribution is changing in a dipolar fashion, then yes, the dipole radiation formula applies. But if the oscillation is quadrupolar or higher, the angular dependence would be different.\n\nBut the problem states "because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength λ". So maybe it\'s a dipole? Because dipole radiation is the dominant term for a time-varying dipole moment. If it\'s a higher multipole, the radiation would be weaker, but the problem doesn\'t indicate that. Also, the mention of wavelength λ might imply that the radiation is determined by the oscillation frequency, which for a dipole is related to the oscillation frequency of the dipole moment.\n\nAlternatively, if the charge distribution is a spheroid that\'s oscillating in size, maybe along the z-axis? So, for example, the spheroid is expanding and contracting along the z-axis, which would create a time-varying quadrupole moment? Wait, but a quadrupole moment\'s radiation pattern is different from a dipole. Let me recall.\n\nThe power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ, I think. Let me check. The quadrupole radiation has a different angular distribution. For an oscillating quadrupole, the angular dependence might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe for a prolate spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern could be similar to a dipole if the oscillation is dipolar, or different if it\'s quadrupolar.\n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify the exact nature of the oscillation. Hmm. Since it\'s a spheroid, which is symmetric around the z-axis, perhaps the simplest assumption is that it\'s a dipole oscillation along the z-axis. Then the radiation pattern would be the standard dipole pattern, which is sin²θ. Therefore, the maximum power A is at θ=90°, and the fraction at θ=30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. Then, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ, and the fraction is 1/4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "a possible form of f". So they might be asking for the general form, which in the dipole case is sin²θ. However, if the charge distribution is a quadrupole, then the angular dependence would be different. For example, electric quadrupole radiation has an angular dependence of (1 - cos²θ) or something else. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe power radiated by an electric quadrupole is given by a more complex expression. The angular distribution for electric quadrupole radiation is proportional to (sin²θ)(1 + cos²θ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s better to recall that higher multipoles have higher powers of sine and cosine. For example, quadrupole terms can involve terms like sin²θ cos²θ or sin²θ (3cos²θ - 1)^2, depending on the quadrupole configuration.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about multipole expansion. The power radiated by electric dipole is proportional to sin²θ, magnetic dipole also has a sin²θ dependence, but electric quadrupole would have a different dependence.\n\nAlternatively, if the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating in such a way that it\'s a quadrupole moment, then the radiation would be quadrupolar. But in general, the dipole radiation is dominant unless the dipole moment is zero. So if the charge distribution is symmetric in such a way that the dipole moment is zero, then the quadrupole moment would be the leading term.\n\nBut a spheroid that\'s oscillating—if it\'s a prolate spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, stretching and compressing, then the dipole moment might not be zero. Wait, if the spheroid is neutral but the shape is changing, maybe the dipole moment is zero? Let\'s see.\n\nSuppose we have a spheroidal charge distribution that remains symmetric under reflection through the origin. If it\'s oscillating in size, but keeping the symmetry, then the dipole moment would still be zero. For example, imagine a sphere of charge that expands and contracts—this would have a zero dipole moment. Similarly, a spheroid that oscillates between prolate and oblate might have a time-varying quadrupole moment but no dipole moment.\n\nBut the problem says "because it oscillates, it would radiate". If the dipole moment is zero, then the radiation would be due to quadrupole or higher moments. But quadrupole radiation is usually much weaker than dipole. However, the problem doesn\'t specify anything about the strength, just the angular dependence.\n\nBut the problem states "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So maybe the function f has a dependence on λ, which for dipole radiation would be through the wave number k = 2π/λ, but in the far field, the power per solid angle for dipole is proportional to k^4 sin²θ. But the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So if we write f(λ, θ), then for dipole radiation, f would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But the maximum power A would be the value at θ=90°, so A is proportional to 1/λ^4. Then, the fraction at θ=30° would be sin²(30°)/sin²(90°) = 1/4, so 1/4 of A.\n\nAlternatively, if it\'s quadrupole radiation, the angular dependence would be different, but the problem is asking for a possible form of f. Since the answer requires giving the fraction and a possible f, and given that dipole is the most common and if nothing else is specified, maybe we are supposed to assume dipole radiation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more general. The maximum power A is given, so regardless of the actual dependence on λ, the fraction would depend only on θ. But the problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and θ". So f depends on both, but when they ask for the fraction of A, which is the maximum, that fraction would be f(λ, θ)/f_max, which would remove the dependence on λ. So the fraction is just a function of θ. Therefore, if the angular dependence is sin²θ, the fraction at 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of f is sin²θ times some function of λ. But the answer needs to specify a possible form of f, which would include the λ dependence.\n\nWait, the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30° and a possible form of f are, respectively,". So we need to give two things: the fraction (a number) and the form of f (a function). The fraction would be 1/4 if the angular dependence is sin²θ, but if the angular dependence is different, like cos²θ, then the maximum could be at 0°, but the problem states that the maximum is A, so if the maximum is at θ=0, then θ=30° would be higher than other angles. But usually, dipoles have maxima at 90°, so maybe that\'s the case here.\n\nBut wait, if the spheroid is oscillating along the z-axis, then the dipole radiation would have maxima at 90°, as usual. So the fraction is 1/4, and f is proportional to sin²θ. But the problem says "a possible form of f". So maybe f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ, but since A is the maximum power, which occurs at θ=90°, then f(λ, θ) should be equal to A sin²θ. But then f would depend on θ but not on λ. However, the problem states that f is a function of λ and θ. So maybe f has a dependence on λ as well, but when normalized to the maximum A, the angular part is sin²θ. Hmm.\n\nWait, let\'s recall the exact formula for the power radiated per solid angle by an electric dipole:\n\ndP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c³) sin²θ\n\nHere, ω is the angular frequency, related to λ by ω = 2πc/λ. So substituting that in, we get:\n\ndP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² (2πc/λ)^4)/(32π²c³) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² 16π⁴ c^4 / λ^4)/(32π² c³) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² π² c)/(2 λ^4) sin²θ\n\nSo, in terms of λ, the power per solid angle is proportional to 1/λ^4 sin²θ. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = C / λ^4 sin²θ, where C is a constant. The maximum power A is at θ=90°, so A = C / λ^4. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, even though f is a function of λ and θ, when expressed in terms of A, the dependence on λ is absorbed into A, and the angular part is just sin²θ.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of A radiated at θ=30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. So the answer would be 1/4 and f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. But the problem states "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So if the answer requires the form of f including the λ dependence, then f would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But since A is the maximum power, which is (1/λ^4) times the constant factors, we can write f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Because A already includes the 1/λ^4 dependence.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the explicit form, not in terms of A, then f would be something like C sin²θ / λ^4, but since the problem mentions A as the maximum power, then expressing f in terms of A would make it A sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4 and the form is f = A sin²θ.\n\nAlternatively, if the oscillation is not dipolar but, say, quadrupolar, then the angular dependence would be different. Suppose it\'s a quadrupole radiation. Then the power per solid angle is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ. Then the maximum would occur at θ=45°, and the maximum power A would be at 45°, so the fraction at θ=30° would be [sin²(30°) cos²(30°)] / [sin²(45°) cos²(45°)] = [(0.25)(0.75)] / [(0.5)(0.5)] = (0.1875)/(0.25) = 0.75, so 75% of A. But this contradicts the problem statement that the maximum is A. Wait, but if the radiation pattern is sin²θ cos²θ, the maximum is indeed at 45°, but the problem says the symmetry axis is along z-axis and the maximum power is A. If the problem states the maximum is A, then regardless of the angular dependence, the fraction would be f(30°)/f_max. But in the quadrupole case, the fraction would be 0.75, which is 3/4. But I don\'t know, maybe.\n\nHowever, the problem says "a possible form of f". So unless there is more information, the answer could be either depending on the multipole. But since the problem mentions it\'s a spheroid oscillating, which is symmetric along z-axis. If it\'s a dipole, then sin²θ. If it\'s a quadrupole, maybe different. But without more information, the most straightforward assumption is dipole radiation. Additionally, in many cases, when problems mention oscillating charge distributions without specifying multipolarity, dipole is the default.\n\nTherefore, I think the fraction is 1/4 and the form is f = A sin²θ. So the answer should be 1/4 and f proportional to sin²θ.\n\nWait, but the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30°". So if A is the maximum power per solid angle, then the power at 30° is f(λ, 30°), and the fraction is f(λ, 30°)/A. Since A is the maximum value of f(λ, θ), which for dipole is at θ=90°, so f(λ, 30°)/A = sin²(30°)/sin²(90°) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and a possible form of f is A sin²θ. So even though f could have a λ dependence, when expressed in terms of A, which is the maximum (and thus incorporates the λ dependence), the angular part is sin²θ. So the answer is 1/4 and A sin²θ.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the explicit form without using A, it would be something like (constant / λ^4) sin²θ, but since the problem defines A as the maximum power, which would be (constant / λ^4), then expressing f as A sin²θ is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 1/4 and the possible form is f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. So that\'s the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\) and a possible form of \\( f \\) is \\(\\boxed{A \\sin^2 \\theta}\\).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390302, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3558, prompt_tokens=450, total_tokens=4008, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, we need to determine the fraction of the maximum radiated power \( A \) at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

1. **Radiation Pattern Analysis**:
   - The charge distribution oscillates, leading to radiation. For a spheroid symmetric along the z-axis, the simplest assumption is dipole radiation.
   - The power radiated per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to \( \sin^2 \theta \).

2. **Maximum Power**:
   - The maximum power \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2 \theta = 1 \).

3. **Fraction of Power at \( 30^\circ \)**:
   - The power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) \).
   - \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \).
   - Therefore, the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Form of the Function \( f \)**:
   - The function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) must account for the angular dependence and wavelength.
   - For dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2 \theta \). The maximum power \( A \) incorporates the wavelength dependence, leading to \( f(\lambda, \theta) = A \sin^2 \theta \).

### Final Answer
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}\) and a possible form of \( f \) is \(\boxed{A \sin^2 \theta}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

So in that case, the maximum power A would be (k^4 p_0^2)/(32π²ε₀ c). Then, the power at θ = 30 degrees would be A multiplied by sin²(30°). Since sin(30°) is 0.5, sin²(30°) is 0.25. Therefore, the fraction would be 1/4, or 25% of the maximum power A.

But wait, the problem says "a possible form of f". If the function f is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum is indeed at θ=90°, and the fraction at θ=30° is 1/4. But is this the case for a spheroidal charge distribution?

If it's a higher multipole, the radiation would be weaker, but the problem doesn't indicate that. Also, the mention of wavelength λ might imply that the radiation is determined by the oscillation frequency, which for a dipole is related to the oscillation frequency of the dipole moment.

Alternatively, if the charge distribution is a spheroid that's oscillating in size, maybe along the z-axis? So, for example, the spheroid is expanding and contracting along the z-axis, which would create a time-varying quadrupole moment? Wait, but a quadrupole moment's radiation pattern is different from a dipole. Let me recall.

The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ, I think. Let me check. The quadrupole radiation has a different angular distribution. For an oscillating quadrupole, the angular dependence might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe for a prolate spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern could be similar to a dipole if the oscillation is dipolar, or different if it's quadrupolar.

But the problem doesn't specify the exact nature of the oscillation. Hmm. Since it's a spheroid, which is symmetric around the z-axis, perhaps the simplest assumption is that it's a dipole oscillation along the z-axis. Then the radiation pattern would be the standard dipole pattern, which is sin²θ. Therefore, the maximum power A is at θ=90°, and the fraction at θ=30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. Then, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ, and the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, the problem says "a possible form of f". So they might be asking for the general form, which in the dipole case is sin²θ. However, if the charge distribution is a quadrupole, then the angular dependence would be different. For example, electric quadrupole radiation has an angular dependence of (1 - cos²θ) or something else. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.

The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is given by a more complex expression. The angular distribution for electric quadrupole radiation is proportional to (sin²θ)(1 + cos²θ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should check.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to recall that higher multipoles have higher powers of sine and cosine. For example, quadrupole terms can involve terms like sin²θ cos²θ or sin²θ (3cos²θ - 1)^2, depending on the quadrupole configuration.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about multipole expansion. The power radiated by electric dipole is proportional to sin²θ, magnetic dipole also has a sin²θ dependence, but electric quadrupole would have a different dependence.

Alternatively, if the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating in such a way that it's a quadrupole moment, then the radiation would be quadrupolar. But in general, the dipole radiation is dominant unless the dipole moment is zero. So if the charge distribution is symmetric in such a way that the dipole moment is zero, then the quadrupole moment would be the leading term.

But a spheroid that's oscillating—if it's a prolate spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, stretching and compressing, then the dipole moment might not be zero. Wait, if the spheroid is neutral but the shape is changing, maybe the dipole moment is zero? Let's see.

Suppose we have a spheroidal charge distribution that remains symmetric under reflection through the origin. If it's oscillating in size, but keeping the symmetry, then the dipole moment would still be zero. For example, imagine a sphere of charge that expands and contracts—this would have a zero dipole moment. Similarly, a spheroid that oscillates between prolate and oblate might have a time-varying quadrupole moment but no dipole moment.

But the problem says "because it oscillates, it would radiate". If the dipole moment is zero, then the radiation would be due to quadrupole or higher moments. But quadrupole radiation is usually much weaker than dipole. However, the problem doesn't specify anything about the strength, just the angular dependence.

But the problem states "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So maybe the function f has a dependence on λ, which for dipole radiation would be through the wave number k = 2π/λ, but in the far field, the power per solid angle for dipole is proportional to k^4 sin²θ. But the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So if we write f(λ, θ), then for dipole radiation, f would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But the maximum power A would be the value at θ=90°, so A is proportional to 1/λ^4. Then, the fraction at θ=30° would be sin²(30°)/sin²(90°) = 1/4, so 1/4 of A.

Alternatively, if it's quadrupole radiation, the angular dependence would be different, but the problem is asking for a possible form of f. Since the answer requires giving the fraction and a possible f, and given that dipole is the most common and if nothing else is specified, maybe we are supposed to assume dipole radiation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more general. The maximum power A is given, so regardless of the actual dependence on λ, the fraction would depend only on θ. But the problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and θ". So f depends on both, but when they ask for the fraction of A, which is the maximum, that fraction would be f(λ, θ)/f_max, which would remove the dependence on λ. So the fraction is just a function of θ. Therefore, if the angular dependence is sin²θ, the fraction at 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of f is sin²θ times some function of λ. But the answer needs to specify a possible form of f, which would include the λ dependence.

Wait, the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30° and a possible form of f are, respectively,". So we need to give two things: the fraction (a number) and the form of f (a function). The fraction would be 1/4 if the angular dependence is sin²θ, but if the angular dependence is different, like cos²θ, then the maximum could be at 0°, but the problem states that the maximum is A, so if the maximum is at θ=0, then θ=30° would be higher than other angles. But usually, dipoles have maxima at 90°, so maybe that's the case here.

But wait, if the spheroid is oscillating along the z-axis, then the dipole radiation would have maxima at 90°, as usual. So the fraction is 1/4, and f is proportional to sin²θ. But the problem says "a possible form of f". So maybe f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ, but since A is the maximum power, which occurs at θ=90°, then f(λ, θ) should be equal to A sin²θ. But then f would depend on θ but not on λ. However, the problem states that f is a function of λ and θ. So maybe f has a dependence on λ as well, but when normalized to the maximum A, the angular part is sin²θ. Hmm.

Wait, let's recall the exact formula for the power radiated per solid angle by an electric dipole:

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c³) sin²θ

Here, ω is the angular frequency, related to λ by ω = 2πc/λ. So substituting that in, we get:

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² (2πc/λ)^4)/(32π²c³) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² 16π⁴ c^4 / λ^4)/(32π² c³) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² π² c)/(2 λ^4) sin²θ

So, in terms of λ, the power per solid angle is proportional to 1/λ^4 sin²θ. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = C / λ^4 sin²θ, where C is a constant. The maximum power A is at θ=90°, so A = C / λ^4. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, even though f is a function of λ and θ, when expressed in terms of A, the dependence on λ is absorbed into A, and the angular part is just sin²θ.

Therefore, the fraction of A radiated at θ=30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. So the answer would be 1/4 and f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. But the problem states "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So if the answer requires the form of f including the λ dependence, then f would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But since A is the maximum power, which is (1/λ^4) times the constant factors, we can write f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Because A already includes the 1/λ^4 dependence.

Alternatively, if they want the explicit form, not in terms of A, then f would be something like C sin²θ / λ^4, but since the problem mentions A as the maximum power, then expressing f in terms of A would make it A sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4 and the form is f = A sin²θ.

Alternatively, if the oscillation is not dipolar but, say, quadrupolar, then the angular dependence would be different. Suppose it's a quadrupole radiation. Then the power per solid angle is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ. Then the maximum would occur at θ=45°, and the maximum power A would be at 45°, so the fraction at θ=30° would be [sin²(30°) cos²(30°)] / [sin²(45°) cos²(45°)] = [(0.25)(0.75)] / [(0.5)(0.5)] = (0.1875)/(0.25) = 0.75, so 75% of A. But this contradicts the problem statement that the maximum is A. Wait, but if the radiation pattern is sin²θ cos²θ, the maximum is indeed at 45°, but the problem says the symmetry axis is along z-axis and the maximum power is A. If the problem states the maximum is A, then regardless of the angular dependence, the fraction would be f(30°)/f_max. But in the quadrupole case, the fraction would be 0.75, which is 3/4. But I don't know, maybe.

However, the problem says "a possible form of f". So unless there is more information, the answer could be either depending on the multipole. But since the problem mentions it's a spheroid oscillating, which is symmetric along z-axis. If it's a dipole, then sin²θ. If it's a quadrupole, maybe different. But without more information, the most straightforward assumption is dipole radiation. Additionally, in many cases, when problems mention oscillating charge distributions without specifying multipolarity, dipole is the default.

Therefore, I think the fraction is 1/4 and the form is f = A sin²θ. So the answer should be 1/4 and f proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, but the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30°". So if A is the maximum power per solid angle, then the power at 30° is f(λ, 30°), and the fraction is f(λ, 30°)/A. Since A is the maximum value of f(λ, θ), which for dipole is at θ=90°, so f(λ, 30°)/A = sin²(30°)/sin²(90°) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and a possible form of f is A sin²θ. So even though f could have a λ dependence, when expressed in terms of A, which is the maximum (and thus incorporates the λ dependence), the angular part is sin²θ. So the answer is 1/4 and A sin²θ.

Alternatively, if they want the explicit form without using A, it would be something like (constant / λ^4) sin²θ, but since the problem defines A as the maximum power, which would be (constant / λ^4), then expressing f as A sin²θ is appropriate.

Therefore, the fraction is 1/4 and the possible form is f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. So that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}\) and a possible form of \( f \) is \(\boxed{A \sin^2 \theta}\).

Therefore, the fraction would be 1/4, or 25% of A.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions a spheroid. A spheroid can be either prolate or oblate. However, the symmetry is along the z-axis, so maybe it\'s a prolate spheroid. But how does the shape affect the radiation pattern? If it\'s a dipole, the radiation pattern is the same as a dipole, but if the charge distribution is more complex, perhaps quadrupole moments come into play. However, the problem states it\'s oscillating, so it\'s possible that it\'s a dipole oscillation. The term "spheroid" might be a red herring, or perhaps it\'s meant to imply that the charge distribution is symmetric around the z-axis but extended, leading to a certain radiation pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if the charge distribution is a quadrupole, the angular dependence would be different. For example, a quadrupole radiator has a dependence like sin²θ cos²θ or something similar, depending on the type of quadrupole. However, the problem states that the maximum power is A. If it\'s a quadrupole, the maximum would occur at angles different from 90 degrees. For instance, a quadrupole can have maxima at 45 degrees or other angles. But the problem states that the maximum is A, so perhaps we need to check whether the maximum is indeed at 90 degrees or another angle.\n\nBut since the problem says "spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)", maybe the charge distribution is undergoing oscillations along the z-axis, which would make it a dipole. If it\'s oscillating along the z-axis, the dipole moment is along z, and the radiation pattern would be the standard dipole pattern, which is sin²θ. Hence, the maximum at θ = 90°, and the power at θ = 30° would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f would be proportional to sin²θ. Since the problem says "possible form of f", and the options are not given, but we need to state the fraction and the form.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So, the function f depends on λ and θ. However, in the dipole formula, the power per solid angle is proportional to k^4 sin²θ. Since k = 2π/λ, that would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But the problem states "f of λ and θ". So, perhaps f(λ,θ) = C * (1/λ^4) sin²θ, where C is a constant. However, the problem states that the maximum power is A. The maximum occurs when sin²θ is maximum, which is 1, so A = C / λ^4. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. So, the function f is A sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction at θ = 30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. So, the answer would be 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the power radiated per solid angle for an oscillating electric dipole is indeed given by:\n\ndP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c) sin²θ\n\nBut ω = 2πc/λ, so ω⁴ is proportional to 1/λ⁴. So, the formula can be written as:\n\ndP/dΩ = (constant / λ⁴) sin²θ\n\nBut the problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So, if we take A as the maximum value of dP/dΩ, then A occurs when sin²θ = 1, so A = constant / λ⁴. Therefore, the general expression is A sin²θ. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. Hence, at θ = 30°, the fraction is sin²(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is A sin²θ.\n\nBut the problem says "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So, perhaps the answer is 1/4 and f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. But perhaps the function f is given in terms of λ and θ, so maybe more explicitly, but since A is the maximum power, which is at θ = 90°, and A is proportional to 1/λ^4, but since A is given as the maximum, perhaps the dependence on λ is already incorporated into A, and f is only a function of θ. Wait, the problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and θ". So, the function f depends on both λ and θ. However, when they say the maximum power is A, then A would be f(λ, θ=90°). Therefore, if f(λ,θ) = (A / sin²θ_max) * sin²θ, but since sin²θ_max = 1, then f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. But in reality, the dependence on λ would be in A, since A itself is proportional to 1/λ^4. So, perhaps the function f is written as f(λ,θ) = (A) sin²θ, where A is a constant (since A is given as the maximum power, which already includes the λ dependence). But the problem says "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So, perhaps f is written in terms of λ and θ, but since A is given as the maximum, maybe they consider A to encapsulate the λ dependence. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. Then, the fraction is 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the dependence on λ is explicit, then f(λ,θ) = C / λ^4 sin²θ, and A = C / λ^4, so f = A sin²θ. Either way, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ, scaled by A, and the fraction at 30 degrees is 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the charge distribution is a quadrupole, the angular dependence would be different. For example, a quadrupole radiation pattern is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ. The maximum of sin²θ cos²θ occurs at θ = 45°, where sin²θ cos²θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Wait, but the maximum value would be when derivative of sin²θ cos²θ is zero. Let\'s compute d/dθ [sin²θ cos²θ] = 2 sinθ cosθ cos²θ + sin²θ * 2 cosθ (-sinθ) = 2 sinθ cosθ (cos²θ - sin²θ) = sin(2θ) cos(2θ). Setting this equal to zero, solutions occur when sin(2θ) = 0 or cos(2θ) = 0. Therefore, θ = 0°, 90°, or 45°. At θ = 45°, sin²θ cos²θ = (sqrt(2)/2)^4 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. At θ = 0° or 90°, it\'s zero. Wait, that doesn\'t make sense. Wait, sin²θ cos²θ is equal to (1/4) sin²(2θ). Therefore, the maximum of sin²(2θ) is 1, at 2θ = 90°, so θ = 45°, so the maximum value is 1/4. Therefore, if the radiation pattern were quadrupole, the maximum power would be A, and the power at θ = 30° would be (1/4) sin²(60°) = (1/4)*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. So, the fraction would be 3/16 of A. However, the problem states that the maximum power is A, so if the radiation pattern were quadrupole, then A would be 1/4 times some constant, and the power at θ = 30° would be 3/16, so 3/16 divided by 1/4 would be 3/4. Wait, no. Wait, if the maximum power is A, then A = (1/4) * constant. Then, the power at θ = 30° would be (1/4) sin²(60°) * constant = (1/4)*(3/4)*constant = (3/16)*constant. Since A = (1/4)*constant, the ratio would be (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4. Wait, but that would imply the fraction is 3/4 of A. But that contradicts the previous result. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, if the quadrupole radiation is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ, which can be written as (1/4) sin²(2θ). Then, the maximum of sin²(2θ) is 1, so maximum power is proportional to 1/4. So, if A is the maximum power, then A = (1/4)*C, where C is the constant of proportionality. Then, the power at angle θ is (1/4) sin²(2θ)*C = A sin²(2θ). Therefore, the fraction would be sin²(2θ). So, at θ = 30°, 2θ = 60°, sin²(60°) = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. Therefore, the power is (3/4) A. Therefore, the fraction would be 3/4. But in that case, the function f would be A sin²(2θ). But the problem states that the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating along the z-axis. A quadrupole might be more elongated, but the problem doesn\'t specify the type of oscillation. However, the problem states that the shape is a spheroid, which is symmetric along the z-axis. If the charge distribution is undergoing a simple dipole oscillation, then the radiation pattern is the standard dipole pattern. However, if the spheroid is undergoing a more complex oscillation, such as a quadrupole oscillation, then the pattern would be different. But since the problem mentions "because it oscillates", which is a bit vague. Typically, a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the symmetry axis would be a dipole radiator. Quadrupole oscillations usually involve more complex deformations. \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for a possible form of f, and the possible fraction, and since the answer for dipole is 1/4 and sin²θ, and for quadrupole it\'s 3/4 and sin²(2θ), but the question says "a possible form". Since the problem does not specify whether it\'s a dipole or quadrupole, but given that the maximum power is A, and the answer requires a possible form, then the answer is likely the dipole case, since dipole is the simplest and most common case for such problems.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be referring to a rotated dipole or something else, but without more information, I think the standard dipole radiation is the way to go. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to sin²θ. Since A is the maximum power, which occurs at θ = 90°, then f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, the answer is 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.\n\nBut let me check once again. The problem says the function f is a function of λ and θ. In the dipole case, the power per solid angle is:\n\ndP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c) sin²θ\n\nBut ω = 2πc/λ, so ω⁴ = (16π⁴c⁴)/λ⁴. Therefore,\n\ndP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² (16π⁴c⁴)/(32π²c λ⁴)) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² π² c³)/(2 λ⁴) sin²θ\n\nTherefore, the dependence on λ is 1/λ⁴. Therefore, if we write f(λ, θ) = C / λ⁴ sin²θ, where C is a constant. Then, the maximum power A is when sin²θ = 1, so A = C / λ⁴. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, even though f is a function of λ and θ, the λ dependence is incorporated into A. Therefore, the answer is that f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ, and the fraction at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n\nHence, the answer should be 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} and a possible form of f is \\boxed{A \\sin^2 \\theta}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390628, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3440, prompt_tokens=445, total_tokens=3885, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with its symmetry axis along the z-axis, we need to determine the fraction of the maximum radiated power \( A \) at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) describing the radiated power per unit solid angle.

1. **Radiation Pattern Analysis**:
   - The charge distribution oscillates along the z-axis, which is characteristic of a dipole radiator.
   - The power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole is given by:
     \[
     \frac{dP}{d\Omega} \propto \sin^2 \theta
     \]
   - The maximum power \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2 \theta = 1 \).

2. **Fraction of Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:
   - The power radiated at any angle \( \theta \) is proportional to \( \sin^2 \theta \).
   - For \( \theta = 30^\circ \), we calculate:
     \[
     \sin^2(30^\circ) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Form of the Function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \)**:
   - The power radiated per unit solid angle depends on \( \lambda \) and \( \theta \).
   - The function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) incorporates the wavelength dependence through the maximum power \( A \), which is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \).
   - The angular dependence is given by \( \sin^2 \theta \), leading to:
     \[
     f(\lambda, \theta) = A \sin^2 \theta
     \]

### Final Answer
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}} and a possible form of \( f \) is \boxed{A \sin^2 \theta}.

The maximum power A would then be (k^4 p_0^2)/(32π²ε₀ c). So, the power radiated at any angle θ is A sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30 degrees would be sin²(30°). Since sin(30°) is 1/2, sin²(30°) is 1/4. Therefore, the fraction would be 1/4, or 25% of A.

Hence, the maximum at θ = 90°, and the power at θ = 30° would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f would be proportional to sin²θ. Since the problem says "possible form of f", and the options are not given, but we need to state the fraction and the form.

But let me check again. The problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So, the function f depends on λ and θ. However, in the dipole formula, the power per solid angle is proportional to k^4 sin²θ. Since k = 2π/λ, that would be proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. But the problem states "f of λ and θ". So, perhaps f(λ,θ) = C * (1/λ^4) sin²θ, where C is a constant. However, the problem states that the maximum power is A. The maximum occurs when sin²θ is maximum, which is 1, so A = C / λ^4. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. So, the function f is A sin²θ. Therefore, the fraction at θ = 30° is sin²(30°) = 1/4. So, the answer would be 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.

But wait, in reality, the power radiated per solid angle for an oscillating electric dipole is indeed given by:

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c) sin²θ

But ω = 2πc/λ, so ω⁴ is proportional to 1/λ⁴. So, the formula can be written as:

dP/dΩ = (constant / λ⁴) sin²θ

But the problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So, if we take A as the maximum value of dP/dΩ, then A occurs when sin²θ = 1, so A = constant / λ⁴. Therefore, the general expression is A sin²θ. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. Hence, at θ = 30°, the fraction is sin²(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is A sin²θ.

But the problem says "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So, perhaps the answer is 1/4 and f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. But perhaps the function f is given in terms of λ and θ, so maybe more explicitly, but since A is the maximum power, which is at θ = 90°, and A is proportional to 1/λ^4, but since A is given as the maximum, perhaps the dependence on λ is already incorporated into A, and f is only a function of θ. Wait, the problem says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and θ". So, the function f depends on both λ and θ. However, when they say the maximum power is A, then A would be f(λ, θ=90°). Therefore, if f(λ,θ) = (A / sin²θ_max) * sin²θ, but since sin²θ_max = 1, then f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. But in reality, the dependence on λ would be in A, since A itself is proportional to 1/λ^4. So, perhaps the function f is written as f(λ,θ) = (A) sin²θ, where A is a constant (since A is given as the maximum power, which already includes the λ dependence). But the problem says "a possible form of f are, respectively,". So, perhaps f is written in terms of λ and θ, but since A is given as the maximum, maybe they consider A to encapsulate the λ dependence. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ. Then, the fraction is 1/4.

Alternatively, if the dependence on λ is explicit, then f(λ,θ) = C / λ^4 sin²θ, and A = C / λ^4, so f = A sin²θ. Either way, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ, scaled by A, and the fraction at 30 degrees is 1/4.

Alternatively, if the charge distribution is a quadrupole, the angular dependence would be different. For example, a quadrupole radiation pattern is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ. The maximum of sin²θ cos²θ occurs at θ = 45°, where sin²θ cos²θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Wait, but the maximum value would be when derivative of sin²θ cos²θ is zero. Let's compute d/dθ [sin²θ cos²θ] = 2 sinθ cosθ cos²θ + sin²θ * 2 cosθ (-sinθ) = 2 sinθ cosθ (cos²θ - sin²θ) = sin(2θ) cos(2θ). Setting this equal to zero, solutions occur when sin(2θ) = 0 or cos(2θ) = 0. Therefore, θ = 0°, 90°, or 45°. At θ = 45°, sin²θ cos²θ = (sqrt(2)/2)^4 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. At θ = 0° or 90°, it's zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, sin²θ cos²θ is equal to (1/4) sin²(2θ). Therefore, the maximum of sin²(2θ) is 1, at 2θ = 90°, so θ = 45°, so the maximum value is 1/4. Therefore, if the radiation pattern were quadrupole, the maximum power would be A, and the power at θ = 30° would be (1/4) sin²(60°) = (1/4)*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16. So, the fraction would be 3/16 of A. However, the problem states that the maximum power is A, so if the radiation pattern were quadrupole, then A would be 1/4 times some constant, and the power at θ = 30° would be 3/16, so 3/16 divided by 1/4 would be 3/4. Wait, no. Wait, if the maximum power is A, then A = (1/4) * constant. Then, the power at θ = 30° would be (1/4) sin²(60°) * constant = (1/4)*(3/4)*constant = (3/16)*constant. Since A = (1/4)*constant, the ratio would be (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4. Wait, but that would imply the fraction is 3/4 of A. But that contradicts the previous result. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, if the quadrupole radiation is proportional to sin²θ cos²θ, which can be written as (1/4) sin²(2θ). Then, the maximum of sin²(2θ) is 1, so maximum power is proportional to 1/4. So, if A is the maximum power, then A = (1/4)*C, where C is the constant of proportionality. Then, the power at angle θ is (1/4) sin²(2θ)*C = A sin²(2θ). Therefore, the fraction would be sin²(2θ). So, at θ = 30°, 2θ = 60°, sin²(60°) = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. Therefore, the power is (3/4) A. Therefore, the fraction would be 3/4. But in that case, the function f would be A sin²(2θ). But the problem states that the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating along the z-axis. A quadrupole might be more elongated, but the problem doesn't specify the type of oscillation. However, the problem states that the shape is a spheroid, which is symmetric along the z-axis. If the charge distribution is undergoing a simple dipole oscillation, then the radiation pattern is the standard dipole pattern. However, if the spheroid is undergoing a more complex oscillation, such as a quadrupole oscillation, then the pattern would be different. But since the problem mentions "because it oscillates", which is a bit vague. Typically, a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the symmetry axis would be a dipole radiator. Quadrupole oscillations usually involve more complex deformations. 

Given that the problem is asking for a possible form of f, and the possible fraction, and since the answer for dipole is 1/4 and sin²θ, and for quadrupole it's 3/4 and sin²(2θ), but the question says "a possible form". Since the problem does not specify whether it's a dipole or quadrupole, but given that the maximum power is A, and the answer requires a possible form, then the answer is likely the dipole case, since dipole is the simplest and most common case for such problems.

Alternatively, the problem might be referring to a rotated dipole or something else, but without more information, I think the standard dipole radiation is the way to go. Therefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to sin²θ. Since A is the maximum power, which occurs at θ = 90°, then f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, the answer is 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.

But let me check once again. The problem says the function f is a function of λ and θ. In the dipole case, the power per solid angle is:

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π²c) sin²θ

But ω = 2πc/λ, so ω⁴ = (16π⁴c⁴)/λ⁴. Therefore,

dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² (16π⁴c⁴)/(32π²c λ⁴)) sin²θ = (μ₀ p₀² π² c³)/(2 λ⁴) sin²θ

Therefore, the dependence on λ is 1/λ⁴. Therefore, if we write f(λ, θ) = C / λ⁴ sin²θ, where C is a constant. Then, the maximum power A is when sin²θ = 1, so A = C / λ⁴. Therefore, f(λ, θ) = A sin²θ. Therefore, even though f is a function of λ and θ, the λ dependence is incorporated into A. Therefore, the answer is that f(λ,θ) = A sin²θ, and the fraction at θ = 30° is 1/4.

Hence, the answer should be 1/4 and f = A sin²θ.

**Final Answer**
The fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}} and a possible form of f is \boxed{A \sin^2 \theta}.
