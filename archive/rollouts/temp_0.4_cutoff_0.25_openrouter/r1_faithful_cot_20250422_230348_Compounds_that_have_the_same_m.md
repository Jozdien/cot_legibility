To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each for the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. Despite the bulky substituents, the molecule is symmetric due to identical substituents on both rings. The plane of symmetry through the central bond makes the molecule achiral. While hindered rotation (atropisomerism) is possible, the symmetry precludes optical isomerism. **No optical isomerism.**

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH(OH)-CH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl ester (-COOCH₃), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This creates a **chiral center**, leading to enantiomers. **Optical isomerism is present.**

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone ((C₆H₅)₂CO) has a planar carbonyl carbon bonded to two identical phenyl groups. The molecule is symmetric and lacks any chiral centers. **No optical isomerism.**

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**  
   Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) has a trans double bond, making the molecule planar and symmetric. The identical substituents on both sides of the double bond eliminate chirality. **No optical isomerism.**

**Conclusion:** Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Option 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  

**Answer:**  
\boxed{2}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. The question is about optical isomerism, which I remember has to do with chirality. Optical isomers are molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. So, they must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic center, right? 

The options given are four different compounds. I need to check each one to see if they have any chiral centers or other elements that can lead to optical isomerism. Let me go through them one by one.

First, option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. That sounds complex. Let me visualize the structure. A biphenyl ring connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Then, at the 2 and 2' positions, there are carboxylate groups, which are esterified to methyl groups. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at the 6 position. Wait, nitro groups are substituents on the benzene rings. Now, could there be any chiral centers here? 

Chiral centers are usually carbons with four different substituents. In the biphenyl structure, the carbons where the substituents are attached: the biphenyl rings. Let's see. The biphenyl rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, so the 2 and 2' positions are adjacent. Each of those positions has a carboxylate methyl ester. The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups. So, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. But the central bond between the two phenyl rings might allow for some kind of restricted rotation, leading to atropisomerism. Wait, atropisomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where the isomers can be interconverted by rotation around a single bond, but if the barrier to rotation is high enough, they can be isolated as separate isomers. However, the question is about optical isomerism specifically, which usually refers to enantiomers or diastereomers due to chiral centers or other elements like planes or axes of chirality. 

In the case of biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral. For example, if each ring has different substituents in positions that would prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substituents on each ring are the same: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl carboxylate at 2. Wait, but since the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring might be arranged symmetrically. Let me think. If both rings have nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then the entire molecule might be symmetrical along the axis that bisects the two rings. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it would look the same. That would mean it has a plane of symmetry and therefore is not chiral. But maybe the substituents are not symmetrically placed? Wait, the positions are 6 and 6'. If the biphenyl is 1,1'-connected, then numbering on each ring starts at the connection point. So on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent. Wait, benzene rings are six-membered. So position 1 is where the two rings are connected. Then positions 2 and 6 on each ring would be meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a benzene ring, the positions are numbered such that position 1 is connected to the other ring. Then moving around the ring, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So on each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the connecting position (position 1). So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in positions that are adjacent (since 1 is connected to the other ring, 2 is next to 1, and 6 is the next one after 5, which is across from 1). Wait, maybe I need to draw a benzene ring with positions. Let's say the first ring has positions 1 (connected to the other ring), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then substituents at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to position 1. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If both rings have nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then when you look at the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is symmetric with respect to the central bond, then it might not be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions. So, for example, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and ester at 2. So the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings. Therefore, it would be achiral. So maybe this compound isn't optically active? Hmm. But sometimes, even with substituents in symmetric positions, if the molecule can't freely rotate, it can have atropisomerism. But if the substituents are such that they cause steric hindrance, preventing free rotation around the central bond, then the molecule might exist as two enantiomers. But would that apply here? The substituents here are nitro and ester groups. Nitro is a bulky group, so maybe the rotation around the biphenyl bond is hindered. If the substituents are in positions that cause the molecule to have a high barrier to rotation, then even if the substituents are symmetric, but if the molecule can't rotate, then maybe the two rings are fixed in a certain conformation. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetric, then even if rotation is hindered, the molecule would still be the same after 180-degree rotation. So maybe it's not chiral. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should come back to this one after looking at the others.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse the name. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. So the structure would be: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, let me get the numbering right. The propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. So carbon 2 is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Then, the methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH3. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, a methyl ester group (COOCH3), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's draw it:

The parent chain is propanoic acid: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe better to write as:

Structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group. So:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: -CH3

Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH3

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on carbon 2. So structure is:

COOH-CH(OH)-CH3

Then, the methyl ester would be COOCH3 instead of COOH. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3

So the structure is OCH3-O-C(=O)-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the acid (COOH) and methanol. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3, and the ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- The COOCH3 group (which is -O-C(=O)-OCH3)

- The hydroxyl (-OH)

- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate part is the ester. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The "2-hydroxy" is on the propanoate chain. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, maybe better to write as:

The ester group is OCH3 connected to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the central carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) has the following substituents: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), and two oxygens? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon chain is:

The carbonyl carbon is connected to an oxygen (ester oxygen) and then to the rest of the molecule. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) is CH(OH)CH3. So that carbon has:

- The carbonyl group (C=O)

- A hydroxyl group (-OH)

- Two methyl groups? Wait, no. Let me count again.

The propanoate is three carbons. The first carbon is the carbonyl carbon (COOCH3). The second carbon (alpha) is CH(OH), and the third carbon is CH3. So the alpha carbon (carbon 2) has:

- One bond to the carbonyl group (COOCH3)

- One bond to hydroxyl (-OH)

- Two bonds to CH3?

Wait, no. The structure should be:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl group attached to OCH3)

- OH

- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. The central carbon is CH(OH) connected to COOCH3 and CH3. So the substituents on the central carbon are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH3? Because the third carbon is CH3. Wait, no. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to carbon 1 (COOCH3), carbon 3 (CH3), and has an -OH group. So the substituents on carbon 2 are: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and a hydrogen? Wait, that's four substituents. So the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- COOCH3 (a carbonyl group connected to OCH3)

- CH3

- OH

- H

So four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, which would give rise to optical isomerism. So option 2 should show optical isomerism. That seems like a yes.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is:

       O
       ||
C6H5-C-C6H5

So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. The carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar, so it's sp² hybridized. The two phenyl groups are identical. So the molecule is symmetrical. The central carbon can't be a chiral center because it's double-bonded to oxygen. Even if it were a single bond, if there are two identical substituents (two phenyl groups), then there's no chirality. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So option 3 is out.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two central carbons, and the two carboxylic acid groups are trans to each other. Then, the dimethyl ester would replace the -OH groups of the carboxylic acids with -OCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is:

CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in the trans configuration. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's look. The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, in fumarate, the double bond is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So the structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3
|
CH
||
CH
|
C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no, better to write as:

O=C-OCH3
       \
        CH=CH
       /
O=C-OCH3

But with the double bond in trans configuration. So each carbon of the double bond has one COOCH3 and one hydrogen. So each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, but since they are double-bonded, there's no free rotation. However, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. The molecule is planar, and the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So if you imagine the molecule, it's symmetrical along the plane perpendicular to the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral. However, if there were different substituents on each end, then there could be cis-trans isomerism, but since both ends are the same (both are COOCH3), the trans isomer is symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and is not optically active. Wait, but wait. The double bond itself can't be a chiral center. Chiral centers are single bonds. So unless there's a carbon with four different groups, there's no chirality. In this case, each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), so even in the trans configuration, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. So option 4 is out.

So going back to option 1. The first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to visualize it again. Biphenyl with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and ester groups at 2 and 2'. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Let me think. Each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. If the biphenyl is planar, then maybe there's a plane of symmetry. But in reality, biphenyl rings are usually not coplanar due to steric hindrance between the hydrogen atoms. However, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Let me try to imagine the structure. The two benzene rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). If the rings are rotated such that the substituents are on the same side, or opposite sides. Wait, but since the molecule is symmetric (each ring has the same substituents), even if the rings are rotated, the molecule might still be symmetrical. For example, if the nitro groups are both on the same face, then there's a plane of symmetry. If they are on opposite faces, but since both rings have nitro groups, the molecule might still be symmetrical. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose the nitro groups are both on the top face of their respective rings. Then, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings. But if one nitro is up and the other is down, then maybe the molecule is not symmetrical. However, in the case of a biphenyl, the substituents can rotate. Wait, but if the substituents are bulky enough, rotation around the central bond might be hindered, leading to atropisomerism. In this case, nitro groups are bulky, and the ester groups might also be bulky. So, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule cannot freely rotate, then different conformations might be possible. However, for atropisomerism to exist, the barrier to rotation must be high enough that the isomers can be isolated. But does that count as optical isomerism? Atropisomers are a type of stereoisomers. If the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl rings, then it can be chiral. For example, if each ring has different substituents, but in this case, they are the same. Wait, but if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, then even if they are rotated, the molecule might still be symmetrical. For example, if you have two nitro groups on adjacent rings in positions that are mirror images, then the overall molecule is symmetrical. So maybe this compound is not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The biphenyl rings are connected at 1 and 1'. Substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are para to each other? Wait, on a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So if substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, that's positions that are meta to each other? No, wait. Position 1 is the point of attachment. Position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 3 is next, position 4 is para to 1, position 5 is meta, and position 6 is adjacent to position 5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's say on each benzene ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So on the first ring, substituent at 2 (adjacent to the connection point) and 6 (which is two positions away from the connection point). So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So each ring has substituents at meta positions. Now, when the two rings are connected, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring can be arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetric or not. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in the same way (e.g., both nitro groups on the same side), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged such that one nitro is up and the other is down relative to the central bond, then maybe there's no plane of symmetry. However, since both rings have the same substituents, even if they are arranged oppositely, the molecule might still have a center of inversion. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the key here is that if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. If not, it is. Given that both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule is likely to be symmetrical. For example, if you imagine the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the nitro groups are both in the same orientation relative to the central bond, then there's a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry, but since they are the same on both rings, it's hard to see how. Wait, maybe if the nitro groups are on opposite sides, but since both rings have nitro groups, flipping one ring would make it symmetric. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of chirality. But in biphenyl systems, chirality usually comes from hindered rotation leading to axial chirality, not a central chiral center. For axial chirality, the substituents on each end of the axis (the central bond) must be arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. The criteria for axial chirality in biphenyls is that the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. For example, if each ring has two different substituents in the ortho positions, but in this case, each ring has two substituents (nitro and ester) in positions 2 and 6. Wait, but each ring has two substituents: nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So each ring has two different substituents in the ortho positions relative to the central bond (position 1). Therefore, this could lead to axial chirality. Because each ring has different substituents in the ortho positions (nitro and ester), the molecule as a whole may not have a plane of symmetry. Let's think. If the nitro groups are on one side and the ester groups on the other, then the mirror image would be different. For example, imagine the left ring has nitro at 6 (which is two positions away from the central bond) and ester at 2 (adjacent to the central bond), and the right ring similarly. If the nitro groups are both on the same side of the central bond, then there's a plane of symmetry. But if one nitro is above and the other is below, then there's no plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged such that the left ring's nitro is up and the right ring's nitro is down, then the molecule might not be superimposable on its mirror image. But since both rings have the same substituents, maybe flipping the molecule would make them superimposable. Hmm. This is tricky. 

In the case of biphenyls with substituents in the ortho positions, if the substituents on each ring are different, then axial chirality is possible. For example, if one ring has a nitro and a methyl, and the other ring has a nitro and a methyl in the ortho positions, then depending on their arrangement, the molecule can be chiral. But in our case, each ring has a nitro and an ester. Are these substituents different enough to create axial chirality? Since nitro (NO2) and ester (COOCH3) are different groups, yes. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, then the molecule can be chiral. 

The key here is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. If not, then it's chiral. For example, if the left ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, and the right ring also has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, but arranged in such a way that the nitro groups are on opposite sides of the central bond, then there's no plane of symmetry. Wait, but since both rings have the same substituents, rotating the molecule 180 degrees would make it look the same. So maybe there is a center of inversion. Hmm. 

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the nitro groups are both on the same side, then there's a plane of symmetry between the two rings. But if they are on opposite sides, then there's no plane of symmetry. However, in that case, the molecule would have a center of inversion. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think of a simpler case. Suppose we have two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at position 2 and an ester at position 6. Then, depending on the rotation around the central bond, the nitro groups can be on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on the same side, the molecule is symmetrical. If they are on opposite sides, then the molecule is also symmetrical because flipping it 180 degrees would superimpose the nitro groups. Wait, no. If the nitro groups are on opposite sides, then flipping the molecule would swap their positions, but since both rings have nitro groups, it would still look the same. Therefore, regardless of the rotation, the molecule remains symmetrical. Therefore, it's achiral. 

But wait, in the actual compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2. If the nitro is at 6, which is two positions away from the central bond (position 1), and the ester is at 2, adjacent to the central bond. So the substituents are in ortho and meta positions relative to the central bond. Wait, position 1 is the connection point. Position 2 is adjacent (ortho), position 3 is meta, position 4 is para. So on each ring, substituents are at ortho (position 2) and meta (position 6) positions. Therefore, the arrangement is such that each ring has substituents in different positions. If the two rings are rotated relative to each other, the substituents can be arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. For example, if one ring's nitro is up and the other's is down, but given that they are in different positions (ortho vs meta), maybe this creates asymmetry. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should recall that axial chirality in biphenyls requires that the substituents in the ortho positions are different on each ring. For example, if each ring has two different groups in the ortho positions, then axial chirality is possible. But in this case, each ring has one substituent in the ortho position (position 2: ester) and one in the meta position (position 6: nitro). So maybe the axial chirality isn't applicable here. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that are not across from each other, leading to a lack of symmetry. 

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is too symmetrical. Since both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. Therefore, option 1 does not show optical isomerism. 

So to recap:

Option 1: Likely not chiral due to symmetry.

Option 2: Has a chiral center, so yes.

Option 3: No chiral centers, symmetrical.

Option 4: Symmetrical, no chiral centers.

Therefore, the answer is option 2. But wait, wait. Let me double-check option 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- COOCH3 (which is O-C(=O)-OCH3)

- OH

- CH3

- And what's the fourth group? Wait, the central carbon is CH(OH), so the groups are:

- COOCH3 (from the carbonyl)

- OH

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)

- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The central carbon is part of the chain: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

1. The COOCH3 group (which is -O-C(=O)-OCH3, but in terms of the carbon chain, it's the previous carbon)

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's write the full structure. 

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3

When esterified with methanol, the carboxylic acid group becomes COOCH3:

CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3

So the carbon chain is:

COOCH3 (carbon 1) - CH(OH) (carbon 2) - CH3 (carbon 3)

So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: COOCH3

- Carbon 3: CH3

- OH group

- And a hydrogen atom.

Therefore, the four substituents on carbon 2 are: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. All four are different, so carbon 2 is a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 is correct.

Options 1, 3, and 4 do not have chiral centers or other elements of chirality. Therefore, the answer is option 2.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. The question is about optical isomerism, which I remember has to do with chirality. Optical isomers are molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. So, they must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic center, right? 

The options given are four different compounds. I need to check each one to see if they have any chiral centers or other elements that can lead to optical isomerism. Let me go through them one by one.

First, option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. That sounds complex. Let me visualize the structure. A biphenyl ring connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Then, at the 2 and 2' positions, there are carboxylate groups, which are esterified to methyl groups. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at the 6 position. Wait, nitro groups are substituents on the benzene rings. Now, could there be any chiral centers here? 

Chiral centers are usually carbons with four different substituents. In the biphenyl structure, the carbons where the substituents are attached: the biphenyl rings. Let's see. The biphenyl rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, so the 2 and 2' positions are adjacent. Each of those positions has a carboxylate methyl ester. The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups. So, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. But the central bond between the two phenyl rings might allow for some kind of restricted rotation, leading to atropisomerism. Wait, atropisomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where the isomers can be interconverted by rotation around a single bond, but if the barrier to rotation is high enough, they can be isolated as separate isomers. However, the question is about optical isomerism specifically, which usually refers to enantiomers or diastereomers due to chiral centers or other elements like planes or axes of chirality. 

In the case of biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral. For example, if each ring has different substituents in positions that would prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substituents on each ring are the same: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl carboxylate at 2. Wait, but since the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring might be arranged symmetrically. Let me think. If both rings have nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then the entire molecule might be symmetrical along the axis that bisects the two rings. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it would look the same. That would mean it has a plane of symmetry and therefore is not chiral. But maybe the substituents are not symmetrically placed? Wait, the positions are 6 and 6'. If the biphenyl is 1,1'-connected, then numbering on each ring starts at the connection point. So on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent. Wait, benzene rings are six-membered. So position 1 is where the two rings are connected. Then positions 2 and 6 on each ring would be meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a benzene ring, the positions are numbered such that position 1 is connected to the other ring. Then moving around the ring, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So on each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the connecting position (position 1). So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in positions that are adjacent (since 1 is connected to the other ring, 2 is next to 1, and 6 is the next one after 5, which is across from 1). Wait, maybe I need to draw a benzene ring with positions. Let's say the first ring has positions 1 (connected to the other ring), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then substituents at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to position 1. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If both rings have nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then when you look at the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is symmetric with respect to the central bond, then it might not be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions. So, for example, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and ester at 2. So the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings. Therefore, it would be achiral. So maybe this compound isn't optically active? Hmm. But sometimes, even with substituents in symmetric positions, if the molecule can't freely rotate, it can have atropisomerism. But if the substituents are such that they cause steric hindrance, preventing free rotation around the central bond, then the molecule might exist as two enantiomers. But would that apply here? The substituents here are nitro and ester groups. Nitro is a bulky group, so maybe the rotation around the biphenyl bond is hindered. If the substituents are in positions that cause the molecule to have a high barrier to rotation, then even if the substituents are symmetric, but if the molecule can't rotate, then maybe the two rings are fixed in a certain conformation. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetric, then even if rotation is hindered, the molecule would still be the same after 180-degree rotation. So maybe it's not chiral. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should come back to this one after looking at the others.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse the name. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. So the structure would be: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, let me get the numbering right. The propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. So carbon 2 is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Then, the methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH3. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking

Alright, I'm examining the concept of optical isomerism, which relates to chirality. Optical isomers are molecules that exist as non-superimposable mirror images of each other, requiring a chiral center or stereogenic element.

I need to analyze the four provided compounds to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism. Let me evaluate them individually.

For the first option, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, I need to visualize its structure. This consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a methyl carboxylate group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. I must determine if this arrangement creates chirality.

In biphenyls, restricted rotation around the central bond can lead to atropisomerism if the substituents create sufficient steric hindrance. Even with identical substituents on both rings (nitro at position 6 and methyl carboxylate at position 2), the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry depending on how these groups are oriented in three-dimensional space. If rotation is significantly hindered, the molecule could potentially exist as optical isomers, though I'm not entirely certain without further analysis.

Moving to option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This is a methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid has a three-carbon chain (CH₃-CH₂-COOH). With a hydroxyl group at position 2, the structure becomes CH₃-CH(OH)-COOH, and as a methyl ester, it's CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. I need to determine if this molecule contains a chiral center that would allow for optical isomerism.

Alright, let's take a closer look. The question asks about optical isomerism, which seems linked to chirality. Optical isomers are essentially molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images, indicating the presence of a chiral center or a stereogenic center.

We're given four different compounds to analyze. I need to examine each one to determine if they possess chiral centers or elements that could cause optical isomerism. Let's proceed with that approach.

For option 1, we have dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. This seems quite complex; visualizing the structure might help. It includes a biphenyl structure, with two benzene rings connected via a single bond at the 1 and 1' positions. There's a carboxylate group with esterification to methyl groups at the 2 and 2' positions on each ring. Moreover, there's a nitro group on each 6-position of the benzene rings.

Next, we determine if there are any chiral centers. Generally, chiral centers are carbon atoms bound to four distinct substituents. Here, with a biphenyl structure, we observe substituents at specific positions on each ring. The rings are linked at 1 and 1', with substituents at 2 and 6 simultaneously. The central bond could restrict rotation, potentially leading to atropisomerism. Atropisomerism is a type of stereoisomerism that involves isomers interconverted through rotation around a single bond. If sufficiently hindered, distinct isomers might be isolated. However, optical isomerism mainly refers to enantiomers and diastereomers arising from chiral centers or elements like chirality planes or axes.

Considering biphenyls, if substituents hinder a plane of symmetry, they might render the molecule chiral. Nevertheless, in this specific case, each benzene ring has identical substituents: a nitro group in the 6-position and a methyl carboxylate in the 2-position, suggesting symmetrical arrangements for the molecule as a whole. Consequently, rotating the molecule 180 degrees results in an identical appearance, indicating a plane of symmetry and suggesting the molecule is not chiral. As a result, this compound may lack optical activity.

For option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate needs analysis based on its nomenclature. Propanoate indicates a three-carbon chain, with "2-hydroxy" showing a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Therefore, the structure equates to a methyl ester derivative of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Reviewing this, propanoic acid is structured as CH3CH2COOH. By placing the hydroxy group on the second carbon, we obtain CH3CHOHCOOH for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Then, substituting the carboxylic acid with a methyl ester results in CH3CHOHCOOCH3. 

Thus, examining the compound, we should focus on whether chiral centers exist due to the presence of differing substituents on the middle carbon, potentially leading to optical isomerism. The configuration of such a carbon could determine whether the molecule manifests as a chiral and optically active substance.

Let's check if that carbon is a chiral center. Carbon 2 is connected to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methylene group (CH2COOCH3), another CH2 group (from the first carbon), and the rest. Wait, wait. Let me write the structure properly. The parent chain is propanoic acid: carbons 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, then carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group. So structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let's think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: Carboxylic acid (carbon 1), then two more carbons (carbons 2 and 3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. So structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would be the ester form: the COOCH3 group. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that's not right. Let me check. The original acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would replace the acidic hydrogen (from the carboxylic acid) with a methyl group. So the ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, looking at the structure, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is connected to: \n\n- The oxygen from the ester (O from COOCH3)\n- The hydroxyl group (OH)\n- Two CH3 groups?\n\nWait, no. Let's count the substituents. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:\n\n1. The hydroxyl group (-OH)\n2. The carbonyl group (COOCH3)\n3. A methyl group (CH3)\n4.

Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)\n- Carbon 3 (CH3)\n- Hydroxyl (OH)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nSo four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option 2 is a candidate.\n\nMoving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Let's see if that carbon is a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's trigonal planar. Therefore, it can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four substituents. The two phenyl groups and the oxygen are attached, but since the carbonyl is a double bond, the carbon is sp² hybridized. So no chiral center here. Therefore, benzophenone does not have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.\n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but in the trans configuration. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. So the structure is the trans-dioic acid. The ester form, dimethyl fumarate, would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. In the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, looking at each carbon in the double bond: each is connected to COOCH3, H, and the other carbon. But since it's a double bond, those carbons are sp² hybridized and have three substituents. So no chiral centers there. The rest of the molecule is symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical molecule. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, and there's also maleate, the cis isomer. But that's geometric isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism), not optical isomerism. Since the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers or other elements leading to non-superimposable mirror images, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it's not optically active. So option 4 is out.\n\nSo going back to option 1. The dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it might be. Wait, in this case, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. If the two rings are identical in substitution, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the central bond, making it achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. But in this case, since both rings have the same substituents in the same positions (6-nitro and 2-ester), the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, maybe option 1 isn't optically active either. \n\nWait, but biphenyl compounds can sometimes exhibit chirality due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism) even if substituents are symmetric. Wait, no. If substituents are symmetric, then even if rotation is restricted, the two possible conformations would be mirror images but superimposable if there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane or center of symmetry, then even with restricted rotation, it can be chiral. Let me think again. For example, if each ring has two different substituents in positions that are not mirrored, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. If the two rings are connected in such a way that when you look at the whole molecule, the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, but since the molecule is symmetric, if substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and ester at 2, then the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents were in positions that are not symmetrical, like one ring has substituents in different positions than the other, then it could be chiral. But in this case, they are both 2 and 6. So I think option 1 is not optically active.\n\nSo the only compound with a chiral center is option 2. Therefore, the answer should be option 2. Let me confirm.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) has four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Hence, it has optical isomers.

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  
   This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and methyl ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. The substituents on both rings are symmetrically arranged, creating a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Despite potential steric hindrance restricting rotation (atropisomerism), the symmetrical substitution pattern ensures the molecule is achiral. **No optical isomerism**.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

at the structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) has the hydroxyl group. Let's check if that carbon is a chiral center. Carbon 2 is connected to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methylene group (CH2COOCH3), another CH2 group (from the first carbon), and the rest. Wait, wait. Let me write the structure properly. The parent chain is propanoic acid: carbons 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, then carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group. So structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let's think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: Carboxylic acid (carbon 1), then two more carbons (carbons 2 and 3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. So structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would be the ester form: the COOCH3 group. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that's not right. Let me check. The original acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would replace the acidic hydrogen (from the carboxylic acid) with a methyl group. So the ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, looking at the structure, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is connected to: 

- The oxygen from the ester (O from COOCH3)
- The hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Let's count the substituents. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

1. The hydroxyl group (-OH)
2. The carbonyl group (COOCH3)
3. A methyl group (CH3)
4. And another carbon (from the adjacent carbon, which is the COOCH3 group). Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the ester)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, so the actual structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) has the following substituents: 

- One side: COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl oxygen connected to OCH3)
- Another side: CH3
- The hydroxyl group (OH)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)
- Carbon 3 (CH3)
- Hydroxyl (OH)
- And a hydrogen.

So four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option 2 is a candidate.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Let's see if that carbon is a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's trigonal planar. Therefore, it can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four substituents. The two phenyl groups and the oxygen are attached, but since the carbonyl is a double bond, the carbon is sp² hybridized. So no chiral center here. Therefore, benzophenone does not have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but in the trans configuration. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. So the structure is the trans-dioic acid. The ester form, dimethyl fumarate, would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. In the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, looking at each carbon in the double bond: each is connected to COOCH3, H, and the other carbon. But since it's a double bond, those carbons are sp² hybridized and have three substituents. So no chiral centers there. The rest of the molecule is symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical molecule. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, and there's also maleate, the cis isomer. But that's geometric isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism), not optical isomerism. Since the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers or other elements leading to non-superimposable mirror images, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it's not optically active. So option 4 is out.

So going back to option 1. The dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it might be. Wait, in this case, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. If the two rings are identical in substitution, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the central bond, making it achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. But in this case, since both rings have the same substituents in the same positions (6-nitro and 2-ester), the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, maybe option 1 isn't optically active either. 

Wait, but biphenyl compounds can sometimes exhibit chirality due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism) even if substituents are symmetric. Wait, no. If substituents are symmetric, then even if rotation is restricted, the two possible conformations would be mirror images but superimposable if there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane or center of symmetry, then even with restricted rotation, it can be chiral. Let me think again. For example, if each ring has two different substituents in positions that are not mirrored, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. If the two rings are connected in such a way that when you look at the whole molecule, the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, but since the molecule is symmetric, if substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and ester at 2, then the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. 

Alternatively, if the substituents were in positions that are not symmetrical, like one ring has substituents in different positions than the other, then it could be chiral. But in this case, they are both 2 and 6. So I think option 1 is not optically active.

So the only compound with a chiral center is option 2. Therefore, the answer should be option 2. Let me confirm.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) has four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Hence, it has optical isomers. So option 2 is correct.

So the answer is option 2.

This configuration does form a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should exhibit optical isomerism. However, I should verify if there\'s any internal plane of symmetry that might negate this.\n\nOption 3 is benzophenone. Benzophenone has two benzene rings connected by a ketone group (C=O). The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is part of the ketone and is double-bonded to oxygen. Since a double bond doesn\'t allow for tetrahedral geometry, the central carbon is sp² hybridized and has only three substituents (two phenyl groups and one oxygen). Therefore, there\'s no possibility of a chiral center here. Benzophenone is planar and symmetrical, so it doesn\'t have optical isomers.\n\nOption 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure is trans-1,2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. The double bond between the two central carbons is in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a methyl ester group (COOCH₃) and a hydrogen. The trans arrangement creates a planar molecule. However, since the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule doesn\'t have a plane of symmetry. But wait, does this lead to optical isomerism? For a molecule to be chiral due to a double bond, it needs to have different groups on each end. In fumarate, each end of the double bond is identical (each has a COOCH₃ and a H). Because of the trans configuration, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is actually not chiral and doesn\'t exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I might be confusing this with maleate (the cis isomer). Maleic anhydride is the cis form, which would have the two ester groups on the same side. However, maleate would be planar but not chiral. Wait, no, the maleate would have the ester groups cis, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. However, dimethyl fumarate, being trans, actually does have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, option 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\nRevisiting option 1: The key here is whether the biphenyl rings are substituted in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. If both rings have nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate groups at 2, then when the rings are rotated, the substituents would be in positions that might not allow for a plane of symmetry. However, biphenyls can have atropisomerism if the substituents are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. If the rotation is hindered, the substituents can be arranged in a way that creates enantiomers. For example, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides versus the same side, but in this case, since both rings have the same substituents (6-nitro and 2-carboxylate), the molecule might actually be meso if there\'s a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that they are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule could be chiral. However, I need to think carefully. Let me draw it mentally: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The two rings are connected via a single bond. If we look along the biphenyl axis, the nitro groups on each ring could be either on the same side (leading to a plane of symmetry) or opposite sides. Wait, but in the 6,6\'-dinitro substitution, the nitro groups are on the same position relative to the connecting bond. So, if both rings have nitro in position 6, which is the same relative position. If the rings are rotated 180 degrees relative to each other, the nitro groups would be across from each other, but since they are on the same relative position (6 and 6\'), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, biphenyls with substituents in positions that are not symmetrically equivalent can lead to atropisomers. For example, 2,2\'-dinitrobiphenyl might have restricted rotation and be chiral if the substituents are arranged to prevent a plane of symmetry. However, in this question, it\'s 6,6\'-dinitro and 2,2\'-dicarboxylate. Let me think of the numbering. In biphenyl, each benzene is numbered such that the connecting bond is position 1. So, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1. If each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2, then each ring\'s substituents are at positions 2 and 6. If the rings are rotated such that the substituents are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry vertically through the central bond. If rotated 180 degrees, the substituents would be on opposite sides. However, due to the single bond rotation, unless hindered, they could interconvert. But if the substituents are bulky enough (like nitro and carboxylate), rotation might be hindered, leading to atropisomerism. In such a case, the molecule could exist as two enantiomers. However, whether this is considered for optical isomerism here depends on the substituents\' positions. Since both rings have the same substituents (6-nitro and 2-carboxylate), if the molecule is arranged symmetrically, it might be meso (achiral) due to an internal plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images (like mirror planes between the rings), then the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. I\'m getting a bit confused here, so I need to check this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has two planes of symmetry. If each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond, then if the substituents on each ring are arranged so that their positions mirror each other across the central bond, the entire molecule might be symmetrical. For example, if on the left ring, the nitro is at position 6 (which is one position away from the connecting bond), and on the right ring, the nitro is at position 6\', which would be directly opposite. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that are equivalent when rotated. This is getting complicated. Perhaps in this case, the substituents are such that the molecule is not symmetrical and thus chiral, leading to optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Since I\'m not entirely sure, I need to consider other options first and come back.\n\nOption 2 seems to be a clear case with a chiral center. The carbon with the hydroxyl group is attached to four different groups: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and -H. Therefore, it\'s a chiral center. However, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might actually be the ester of lactic acid. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is chiral, and its ester should retain that chirality. So option 2 should exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nOption 3 is benzophenone, which is definitely not chiral as discussed.\n\nOption 4, dimethyl fumarate: since fumarate is trans, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry (as each end of the double bond has the same groups), it\'s achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.\n\nRevisiting option 1. Let me think again. If the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent and meta to the connecting bond. If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then when the two rings are rotated relative to each other, the substituents could either align or oppose. If the substituents are arranged such that the nitro groups are on the same side and the carboxylates on the same side, then there might be a plane of symmetry through the central axis. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there\'s no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. However, since both rings have the same substituents, maybe there\'s a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. For example, if you rotate one ring 180 degrees relative to the other, the nitro and carboxylate groups would mirror each other, creating a symmetrical structure. Therefore, the molecule might be meso, meaning it\'s achiral despite having stereogenic elements. Alternatively, if the substituents prevent such symmetry. This is tricky. In some cases, biphenyls with substituents in positions that are not symmetrical can lead to atropisomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. For instance, if the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation and create non-superimposable mirror images. However, in this case, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring (2 and 6), which might allow for a plane of symmetry. For example, if each ring\'s substituents are arranged so that the nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. However, if they are on the same side, then there might not be a plane of symmetry. Wait, perhaps the substituents\' positions would lead to a situation where the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it\'s hard to say. However, given that the question includes this as an option, and considering that atropisomerism is possible in certain biphenyl derivatives, perhaps the correct answer includes option 1. But I need to recall that for atropisomerism, the substituents need to be sufficiently bulky to prevent rotation. Nitro and carboxylate groups are bulky, so rotation might be hindered at room temperature, leading to separable enantiomers. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6\'-dinitro-[1,1\'-biphenyl]-2,2\'-dicarboxylate might exhibit optical isomerism due to atropisomerism. Hence, option 1 could be correct.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. Possible atropisomerism (chirality due to restricted rotation) → optical isomers.\n2. Chiral center present → optical isomers.\n3. No chiral centers → no optical isomerism.\n4. Symmetrical trans configuration → no optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, options 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. But I need to check the options given. The question asks "Which of the following...", so the answer could be 1 and 2. However, in the original problem, the options are numbered 1 to 4, and the user is to select which ones. But the user hasn\'t specified if multiple answers are possible. The way the question is phrased, "Which of the following...", suggests multiple could be correct.\n\nBut in my analysis, options 1 and 2 are possible. However, I need to verify again.\n\nFor option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:\n\n- CH3 (from the left)\n- OH\n- COOCH3 (ester group)\n- H\n\nYes, four different groups. Therefore, it\'s a chiral center. Therefore, option 2 is correct.\n\nFor option 1, if the biphenyl derivative has atropisomerism, then yes. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it might not. However, given the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent and meta to the bridge, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side, then rotating the rings would not produce a superimposable image. However, due to the symmetry between the two rings (each has nitro and carboxylate in the same positions), maybe there\'s a center of inversion. Wait, if you imagine the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each with nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. If you rotate one ring 180 degrees relative to the other, the substituents would align in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. But if rotation is restricted, then the molecule could exist in two enantiomeric forms. However, if the molecule can freely rotate, then it\'s not chiral. But since nitro and carboxylate groups are bulky, rotation might be hindered, leading to atropisomerism. Therefore, option 1 could exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are options 1 and 2. But I need to check if the original problem allows multiple answers. The way the question is presented here, it\'s a multiple-choice question where the user is to select all that apply. Since the user hasn\'t specified options, but in the original context (possibly a multiple-select question), the answer would be 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, I should confirm once more. For option 1, if the biphenyl has two identical rings with substituents at 2 and 6, then the molecule\'s symmetry depends on the substituents\' arrangement. If the substituents are in positions that are mirror images across the central bond, the molecule would be achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged such that there\'s no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Given that the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent and meta to the connecting bond, and considering that each substituent is a nitro and a carboxylate, the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged in a certain way. For example, if each ring\'s nitro group is on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry. Therefore, this would create enantiomers. Hence, option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is options 1 and 2.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745388737, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3406, prompt_tokens=493, total_tokens=3899, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each for the presence of chiral centers or other stereogenic elements:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  
   This biphenyl derivative has nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2'. The bulky substituents hinder free rotation around the central C–C bond, leading to **atropisomerism**. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the spatial arrangement of the substituents, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). **Optical isomerism is present**.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The second carbon (α-carbon) is bonded to four distinct groups: –OH, –CH₃, –COOCH₃, and –H. This creates a **chiral center**, making the molecule optically active. **Optical isomerism is present**.

3. **Benzophenone**:  
   The central carbon is part of a ketone group (C=O) and is sp² hybridized, bonded to two identical phenyl groups and an oxygen. No chiral center exists, and the molecule is planar and symmetrical. **No optical isomerism**.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The trans configuration creates a plane of symmetry through the double bond, rendering the molecule achiral. **No optical isomerism**.

**Answer**: Options **1** and **2** exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Final Answer**: \boxed{1} and \boxed{2}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group (the second carbon in the chain) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl group (CH₃), a carbonyloxy group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen. This configuration does form a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should exhibit optical isomerism. However, I should verify if there's any internal plane of symmetry that might negate this.

Option 3 is benzophenone. Benzophenone has two benzene rings connected by a ketone group (C=O). The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is part of the ketone and is double-bonded to oxygen. Since a double bond doesn't allow for tetrahedral geometry, the central carbon is sp² hybridized and has only three substituents (two phenyl groups and one oxygen). Therefore, there's no possibility of a chiral center here. Benzophenone is planar and symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomers.

Option 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure is trans-1,2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. The double bond between the two central carbons is in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a methyl ester group (COOCH₃) and a hydrogen. The trans arrangement creates a planar molecule. However, since the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. But wait, does this lead to optical isomerism? For a molecule to be chiral due to a double bond, it needs to have different groups on each end. In fumarate, each end of the double bond is identical (each has a COOCH₃ and a H). Because of the trans configuration, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is actually not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I might be confusing this with maleate (the cis isomer). Maleic anhydride is the cis form, which would have the two ester groups on the same side. However, maleate would be planar but not chiral. Wait, no, the maleate would have the ester groups cis, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. However, dimethyl fumarate, being trans, actually does have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, option 4 does not show optical isomerism.

Revisiting option 1: The key here is whether the biphenyl rings are substituted in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. If both rings have nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate groups at 2, then when the rings are rotated, the substituents would be in positions that might not allow for a plane of symmetry. However, biphenyls can have atropisomerism if the substituents are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. If the rotation is hindered, the substituents can be arranged in a way that creates enantiomers. For example, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides versus the same side, but in this case, since both rings have the same substituents (6-nitro and 2-carboxylate), the molecule might actually be meso if there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that they are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule could be chiral. However, I need to think carefully. Let me draw it mentally: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The two rings are connected via a single bond. If we look along the biphenyl axis, the nitro groups on each ring could be either on the same side (leading to a plane of symmetry) or opposite sides. Wait, but in the 6,6'-dinitro substitution, the nitro groups are on the same position relative to the connecting bond. So, if both rings have nitro in position 6, which is the same relative position. If the rings are rotated 180 degrees relative to each other, the nitro groups would be across from each other, but since they are on the same relative position (6 and 6'), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, biphenyls with substituents in positions that are not symmetrically equivalent can lead to atropisomers. For example, 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl might have restricted rotation and be chiral if the substituents are arranged to prevent a plane of symmetry. However, in this question, it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me think of the numbering. In biphenyl, each benzene is numbered such that the connecting bond is position 1. So, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1. If each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2, then each ring's substituents are at positions 2 and 6. If the rings are rotated such that the substituents are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry vertically through the central bond. If rotated 180 degrees, the substituents would be on opposite sides. However, due to the single bond rotation, unless hindered, they could interconvert. But if the substituents are bulky enough (like nitro and carboxylate), rotation might be hindered, leading to atropisomerism. In such a case, the molecule could exist as two enantiomers. However, whether this is considered for optical isomerism here depends on the substituents' positions. Since both rings have the same substituents (6-nitro and 2-carboxylate), if the molecule is arranged symmetrically, it might be meso (achiral) due to an internal plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images (like mirror planes between the rings), then the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. I'm getting a bit confused here, so I need to check this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two planes of symmetry. If each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond, then if the substituents on each ring are arranged so that their positions mirror each other across the central bond, the entire molecule might be symmetrical. For example, if on the left ring, the nitro is at position 6 (which is one position away from the connecting bond), and on the right ring, the nitro is at position 6', which would be directly opposite. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that are equivalent when rotated. This is getting complicated. Perhaps in this case, the substituents are such that the molecule is not symmetrical and thus chiral, leading to optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Since I'm not entirely sure, I need to consider other options first and come back.

Option 2 seems to be a clear case with a chiral center. The carbon with the hydroxyl group is attached to four different groups: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and -H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. However, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might actually be the ester of lactic acid. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is chiral, and its ester should retain that chirality. So option 2 should exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 3 is benzophenone, which is definitely not chiral as discussed.

Option 4, dimethyl fumarate: since fumarate is trans, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry (as each end of the double bond has the same groups), it's achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Revisiting option 1. Let me think again. If the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent and meta to the connecting bond. If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then when the two rings are rotated relative to each other, the substituents could either align or oppose. If the substituents are arranged such that the nitro groups are on the same side and the carboxylates on the same side, then there might be a plane of symmetry through the central axis. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. However, since both rings have the same substituents, maybe there's a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. For example, if you rotate one ring 180 degrees relative to the other, the nitro and carboxylate groups would mirror each other, creating a symmetrical structure. Therefore, the molecule might be meso, meaning it's achiral despite having stereogenic elements. Alternatively, if the substituents prevent such symmetry. This is tricky. In some cases, biphenyls with substituents in positions that are not symmetrical can lead to atropisomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. For instance, if the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation and create non-superimposable mirror images. However, in this case, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring (2 and 6), which might allow for a plane of symmetry.

Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate might exhibit optical isomerism due to atropisomerism. Hence, option 1 could be correct.

So summarizing:

1. Possible atropisomerism (chirality due to restricted rotation) → optical isomers.
2. Chiral center present → optical isomers.
3. No chiral centers → no optical isomerism.
4. Symmetrical trans configuration → no optical isomerism.

Therefore, options 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. But I need to check the options given. The question asks "Which of the following...", so the answer could be 1 and 2. However, in the original problem, the options are numbered 1 to 4, and the user is to select which ones. But the user hasn't specified if multiple answers are possible. The way the question is phrased, "Which of the following...", suggests multiple could be correct.

But in my analysis, options 1 and 2 are possible. However, I need to verify again.

For option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- H

Yes, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Therefore, option 2 is correct.

For option 1, if the biphenyl derivative has atropisomerism, then yes. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it might not. However, given the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent and meta to the bridge, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side, then rotating the rings would not produce a superimposable image.

Therefore, the answer is options 1 and 2.

Wait, the structure might be different. Let me verify. \n\nWait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be: the ester is methyl, so the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but numbering starts from the COOH end. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (the middle carbon), then it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, when esterified, the methyl ester would replace the -COOH with COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the central carbon (the second carbon) have substituents: two CH2 groups (one leading to COOCH3 and the other to CH2(OH)), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Then, when esterified, the COOH groups are converted to COOCH3. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (the middle one), then the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. However, when forming the methyl ester, only the carboxylic acid group is esterified. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, examining the central carbon (second carbon), it's attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methylene group (CH2COOCH3), a methylene group (CH2- from the first carbon), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's not correct. Let me correct.\n\nWait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The three carbons are: COOH (carbon 1), CH2 (carbon 2), and CH3 (carbon 3). If we have 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure would be COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, when we make the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. But wait, that would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to the hydroxyl group, a COOCH3 group, a CH3 group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, the substituents are: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and -H. All four substituents are different, so this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound (option 2) would exhibit optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. Thus, option 2 is a candidate.\n\nMoving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a diaryl ketone, specifically diphenyl ketone. Its structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbonyl group (C=O) is connected to two phenyl groups. To assess chirality, we check if there's a carbon with four distinct substituents. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. The double bond restricts rotation, but the carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, so it's not a chiral center. Moreover, the two phenyl groups are attached symmetrically. Even if there were different substituents on the phenyl rings, the central carbon would still be part of a planar structure. Therefore, benzophenone lacks a chiral center and isn't expected to show optical isomerism. Hence, option 3 is out.\n\nOption 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure is trans-1,2-ethylenedicarboxylate. The dimethyl ester would be (E)-1,4-dicarbomethoxy-2-butenedioate. Wait, perhaps more accurately, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, so its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides (trans). Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where both -OH groups are replaced by -OCH3. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), with the double bond in the trans configuration. \n\nNow, considering optical isomerism. The molecule is planar in the center with the double bond. The substituents on either end are two ester groups. However, the double bond has a trans configuration, so each end (left and right) has a COOCH3 group. However, because of the double bond's geometry, the molecule is symmetrical. The central part is (COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me correct. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (trans), so the diester would be CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. Wait, not CH2, but actually, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So each end is a carbonyl group connected to OCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. The trans configuration would place the two ester groups on opposite sides. \n\nBut to have optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or another element of chirality. However, in this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If you imagine the molecule, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. If you bisect the molecule through the double bond, the left side is a mirror image of the right side. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Hence, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nAlternatively, if there were a chiral center, but in this case, the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration, but no chirality. So, option 4 is out.\n\nTherefore, reviewing the four options:\n\n1. Likely not chiral due to symmetry.\n2. Chiral center present, so yes.\n3. No chiral centers.\n4. Symmetrical, no chirality.\n\nThus, the answer should be option 2. But wait, let me recheck option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. If the substituents on each ring are the same (each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6), then the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis perpendicular to the biphenyl bond, the substituents would align, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, even if the biphenyl has restricted rotation (leading to atropisomers), if the substituents are symmetrical, there's no chirality.\n\nHowever, if the substituents were in different positions, leading to no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral. But in this case, since both rings have the same substituents (COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6), the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center or axis, so option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nSo, the only correct answer is option 2.

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each for the presence of chiral centers or elements of chirality:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  
   This biphenyl derivative has identical substituents (COOCH₃ at 2 and NO₂ at 6) on both rings. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry due to its symmetrical substitution pattern, eliminating chirality. No optical isomerism is observed.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure is CH₃-C(OH)(COOCH₃)-H. The second carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: -OH, -COOCH₃, -CH₃, and -H. This creates a **chiral center**, making the compound optically active. Enantiomers exist, confirming optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**:  
   The central carbonyl carbon in (C₆H₅)₂CO is sp² hybridized and planar. It lacks a tetrahedral arrangement of substituents, so no chiral center exists. Symmetry further rules out optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   As the trans isomer of butenedioate, dimethyl fumarate has a symmetrical structure (O=C(OCH₃)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH₃). The double bond enforces a planar geometry, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. No chiral centers or elements of chirality are present.

**Conclusion**:  
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (option 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  

**Answer**:  
\boxed{2}

The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl ester group (COOCH3), a methyl group (CH3), and a hydrogen atom. Wait, the structure might be different. Let me verify. 

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be: the ester is methyl, so the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but numbering starts from the COOH end. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (the middle carbon), then it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, when esterified, the methyl ester would replace the -COOH with COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the central carbon (the second carbon) have substituents: two CH2 groups (one leading to COOCH3 and the other to CH2(OH)), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Then, when esterified, the COOH groups are converted to COOCH3. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (the middle one), then the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. However, when forming the methyl ester, only the carboxylic acid group is esterified. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, examining the central carbon (second carbon), it's attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methylene group (CH2COOCH3), a methylene group (CH2- from the first carbon), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's not correct. Let me correct.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The three carbons are: COOH (carbon 1), CH2 (carbon 2), and CH3 (carbon 3). If we have 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure would be COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, when we make the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. But wait, that would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to the hydroxyl group, a COOCH3 group, a CH3 group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, the substituents are: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and -H. All four substituents are different, so this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound (option 2) would exhibit optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. Thus, option 2 is a candidate.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a diaryl ketone, specifically diphenyl ketone. Its structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbonyl group (C=O) is connected to two phenyl groups. To assess chirality, we check if there's a carbon with four distinct substituents. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. The double bond restricts rotation, but the carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, so it's not a chiral center. Moreover, the two phenyl groups are attached symmetrically. Even if there were different substituents on the phenyl rings, the central carbon would still be part of a planar structure. Therefore, benzophenone lacks a chiral center and isn't expected to show optical isomerism. Hence, option 3 is out.

Option 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure is trans-1,2-ethylenedicarboxylate. The dimethyl ester would be (E)-1,4-dicarbomethoxy-2-butenedioate. Wait, perhaps more accurately, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, so its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides (trans). Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where both -OH groups are replaced by -OCH3. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), with the double bond in the trans configuration. 

Now, considering optical isomerism. The molecule is planar in the center with the double bond. The substituents on either end are two ester groups. However, the double bond has a trans configuration, so each end (left and right) has a COOCH3 group. However, because of the double bond's geometry, the molecule is symmetrical. The central part is (COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me correct. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (trans), so the diester would be CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. Wait, not CH2, but actually, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So each end is a carbonyl group connected to OCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. The trans configuration would place the two ester groups on opposite sides. 

But to have optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or another element of chirality. However, in this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If you imagine the molecule, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. If you bisect the molecule through the double bond, the left side is a mirror image of the right side. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Hence, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if there were a chiral center, but in this case, the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration, but no chirality. So, option 4 is out.

Therefore, reviewing the four options:

1. Likely not chiral due to symmetry.
2. Chiral center present, so yes.
3. No chiral centers.
4. Symmetrical, no chirality.

Thus, the answer should be option 2. But wait, let me recheck option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. If the substituents on each ring are the same (each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6), then the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis perpendicular to the biphenyl bond, the substituents would align, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, even if the biphenyl has restricted rotation (leading to atropisomers), if the substituents are symmetrical, there's no chirality.

However, if the substituents were in different positions, leading to no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral. But in this case, since both rings have the same substituents (COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6), the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center or axis, so option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism. 

So, the only correct answer is option 2. Therefore, the answer is option 2.
