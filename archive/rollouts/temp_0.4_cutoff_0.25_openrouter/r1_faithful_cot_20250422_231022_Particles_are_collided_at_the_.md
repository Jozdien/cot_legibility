# Original Question

Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. 
The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

What Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the required Lorentz factor (γ) for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we start by analyzing the survival probability of the particles. The survival probability follows an exponential decay law:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. 

Given that one-third of the particles reach the walls at \( \gamma = 20 \), we solve for \( R/(c \tau) \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{R}{c \tau} = 20 \ln 3.
\]

For two-thirds survival probability:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \implies \frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( R/(c \tau) = 20 \ln 3 \):

\[
\frac{20 \ln 3}{\gamma_{\text{new}}} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \implies \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln(3/2)}.
\]

Numerically, \( \ln 3 \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055 \), so:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} \approx \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.2.
\]

**Answer:** A Lorentz factor of approximately **54** is needed.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have particles produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required so that about two thirds of the particles reach the walls instead.

First, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor means. The Lorentz factor (γ) is defined as 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), right? So, γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, v is very close to c, so γ is large. In this case, the original Lorentz factor is around 20, which is indeed large.

The problem states that the particles decay quickly, so their lifetime is important here. The proper lifetime (τ) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be γτ. So, the distance a particle travels before decaying would be v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is vγτ. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so the distance is approximately cγτ.

Now, the detector is a sphere with radius R = 30 meters. For a particle to reach the inner walls, the distance it travels before decaying must be at least equal to the radius R. So, the condition is cγτ ≥ R. If the particle decays before traveling R, it doesn't reach the wall; if it decays after, it does.

But wait, the particles are produced at the center, and they can move in any direction. So, actually, even if the lifetime is long enough, the direction matters. If a particle is moving in a direction away from the detector wall, it might reach the wall if it lives long enough, but if it's moving in some other direction, maybe it doesn't have to travel the full radius? Wait, no. The detector is spherical, so all directions are symmetric. The maximum distance a particle needs to travel to reach the wall is the radius R, regardless of direction. But actually, particles are emitted isotropically, so the distance they need to travel depends on the angle at which they're emitted. Wait, that complicates things.

Wait, hold on. If particles are emitted isotropically from the center, then the direction is random. The path length required for a particle emitted in a particular direction to reach the detector wall is R divided by the cosine of the angle from the radial direction? No, that's not right. Wait, if you're at the center of a sphere and you move in any direction, the distance to the wall is just R, because you're moving radially outward. Wait, no. Wait, if you're at the center, no matter which direction you go, straight line distance to the wall is R. So, if a particle is moving in any direction, the distance it needs to travel to reach the wall is R. Wait, that seems too simplistic.

Wait, maybe I need to think in three dimensions. Suppose you have a sphere of radius R. A particle is emitted at the center in a random direction. The path length required to exit the sphere is always R, right? Because no matter the direction, moving straight in that direction, the distance from the center to the wall is R. So, if the particle's decay length is L = cγτ, then if L ≥ R, the particle will reach the wall; otherwise, it will decay before. But that would mean that the fraction of particles reaching the wall is either 0% or 100%, depending on whether L is greater or less than R. But the problem states that with γ ~20, one third reach the walls. So, my previous reasoning must be wrong.

Ah, I see. The decay is a probabilistic process. The particle has a certain probability per unit time to decay, so the survival probability decreases exponentially with time. Therefore, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that it survives for at least the time it takes to travel to the wall.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the number of particles surviving after time t is N(t) = N0 * exp(-t/τ'), where τ' is the lab frame lifetime, which is γτ. So, the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)).

But the time it takes to reach the wall depends on the direction. For a particle moving at speed v ≈ c, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c * cosθ), where θ is the angle between the particle's velocity and the radial direction. Wait, no. Wait, if the particle is emitted at an angle, the actual distance it needs to travel to exit the sphere is not just R. For example, if a particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, the path length would be R / cosθ. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, imagine a sphere of radius R. If you are at the center and move at an angle θ relative to some radial direction, the actual distance to the wall along that path is indeed R / cosθ. But wait, that seems like if θ is 90 degrees, the path length would be infinite, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If θ is the angle from the radial direction, then if you move at θ = 90 degrees, you're moving tangentially, and your distance from the center remains R (since you started at the center). Wait, but that's not right. If you start at the center and move in a tangential direction, your path is a straight line, but the closest approach to the center is zero. Wait, actually, the path would pass through the center again. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe we should parameterize the path. Let's consider a particle emitted from the center with velocity v at an angle θ from some radial direction. The path of the particle is a straight line. The minimum distance from the center to this path is zero because it passes through the center. Wait, no. If you shoot a particle from the center in any direction, the path is a straight line going outwards radially. Wait, no. If you shoot a particle at an angle θ from the radial direction, the path is a straight line, but since it's emitted from the center, the direction is purely radial. Wait, no, that's not correct. If you are at the center of the sphere, any direction you choose is a radial direction. So, actually, all particles are emitted radially outward. Wait, that can't be. If the detector is spherical, and the particles are produced at the center, then when they are emitted in any direction, they are moving along a radius of the sphere. Therefore, the distance they need to travel to reach the wall is exactly R. Therefore, all particles have to travel a distance R to exit the sphere. Therefore, the time taken to reach the wall is t = R/(v). Since they are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/c.

But this contradicts the problem statement, which says that on average, one third reach the inner walls. If all particles have to travel a distance R, then if their decay length L = cγτ is greater than R, all of them reach the wall; if not, none do. But the problem says one third reach, which suggests that it's probabilistic. So, perhaps the decay is not deterministic but follows an exponential decay law.

Ah, yes, right. The decay time is random, following an exponential distribution. So, the probability that a particle survives until time t is exp(-t/τ'), where τ' is the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor, τ' = γτ.

But in this case, the time required to reach the wall is t = R/(v) ≈ R/c. So, the survival probability is exp(-R/(c γ τ)).

But the problem states that with γ ≈ 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, we can set up the equation:

exp(-R/(c * 20 * τ)) = 1/3.

Then, we can solve for R/(c * 20 * τ) = -ln(1/3) = ln(3).

Therefore, R/(c * τ) = 20 * ln(3).

But we need to find the Lorentz factor γ such that the survival probability is two thirds, so:

exp(-R/(c * γ * τ)) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3? Wait, wait. Wait, the survival probability is the probability that the particle survives until it reaches the wall. So, if two thirds reach the wall, that means the survival probability is two thirds? Wait, no. Wait, if a particle reaches the wall, it means it survived for the time t = R/(c). The survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)) = exp(-R/(c γ τ)). So, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-R/(c γ τ)). Wait, but in the original case, this fraction is one third. So, exp(-R/(c * 20 * τ)) = 1/3. Then, if we want the fraction to be two thirds, we need exp(-R/(c * γ * τ)) = 2/3. Wait, but 2/3 is greater than 1/3, so the exponent would be less negative, meaning that R/(c γ τ) is smaller. Therefore, γ needs to be larger. Wait, but the question says "about two thirds of these particles reaches the detector inner walls". So, the survival probability is two thirds. Therefore, the equation is:

exp(-R/(c γ τ)) = 2/3.

But we can relate this to the original case. From the original case, we have exp(-R/(c * 20 * τ)) = 1/3. Let's take the ratio of the two equations. Let me denote γ_new as the new Lorentz factor we need to find.

We have:

exp(-R/(c γ_new τ)) / exp(-R/(c * 20 τ)) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2.

Therefore:

exp[ R/(c τ) (1/20 - 1/γ_new) ] = 2.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

R/(c τ) (1/20 - 1/γ_new) = ln(2).

But from the original equation, we have:

R/(c τ) = 20 * ln(3).

Therefore, substituting into the above equation:

20 * ln(3) * (1/20 - 1/γ_new) = ln(2).

Simplify:

ln(3) * (1 - 20/γ_new) = ln(2).

Divide both sides by ln(3):

1 - 20/γ_new = ln(2)/ln(3).

Then,

20/γ_new = 1 - ln(2)/ln(3).

Compute ln(2)/ln(3):

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986. So, ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.6309.

Therefore,

20/γ_new ≈ 1 - 0.6309 ≈ 0.3691.

Thus,

γ_new ≈ 20 / 0.3691 ≈ 54.2.

So, approximately, the required Lorentz factor is about 54.2.

Wait, let me check the steps again to make sure.

1. The survival probability is exp(-t/τ'), where τ' = γτ.

2. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(c), since v ≈ c.

3. Therefore, survival probability is exp(-R/(c γ τ)).

4. Given that at γ = 20, survival probability is 1/3:

exp(-R/(c * 20 τ)) = 1/3.

5. Therefore, R/(c τ) = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 ln 3 ≈ 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

6. For the survival probability to be 2/3, set exp(-R/(c γ_new τ)) = 2/3.

7. Then, R/(c γ_new τ) = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

8. But from step 5, R/(c τ) = 20 ln 3, so substituting:

(20 ln 3)/γ_new = ln(3/2).

9. Therefore, γ_new = (20 ln 3) / ln(3/2).

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So, γ_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.2.

Yes, that matches. So, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

Therefore, the answer is about 54. But let me check if the approximation is correct. Let me compute ln(3)/ln(3/2):

ln(3) = 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708

Then, 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Yes, so approximately 54.2. Rounding to two significant figures, since the original Lorentz factor was given as ~20 (one significant figure?), but maybe two. If the question expects an approximate answer, maybe 54 or 55. But perhaps we need to give it more precisely.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the particles are "ultra-relativistic", so β ≈ 1. The proper lifetime is τ. The lab frame lifetime is γτ. The distance they travel is βγcτ ≈ γcτ.

But the maximum distance they need to travel is R = 30 m. So, the condition is γcτ ≥ R. But again, since it's probabilistic, the probability that a particle travels distance L before decaying is proportional to exp(-L/(γcτ)).

Wait, but in reality, the decay probability is a function of time. The probability density function for decaying at time t is (1/γτ) exp(-t/(γτ)). Therefore, the probability that the particle survives until time t is exp(-t/(γτ)). The time to reach the wall is t = R/(c). Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-R/(c γ τ)).

So, if we have two conditions:

For γ = 20, survival probability P = 1/3 = exp(-R/(c * 20 τ)).

For γ = γ_new, survival probability P_new = 2/3 = exp(-R/(c γ_new τ)).

Dividing the two equations:

P_new / P = exp( R/(c τ) (1/20 - 1/γ_new) ) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2.

Therefore,

R/(c τ) (1/20 - 1/γ_new) = ln 2.

But from the first equation, R/(c τ) = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln 3.

Therefore,

20 ln 3 (1/20 - 1/γ_new) = ln 2.

Simplify:

ln 3 (1 - 20/γ_new) = ln 2.

Then,

1 - 20/γ_new = ln 2 / ln 3.

So,

20/γ_new = 1 - ln 2 / ln 3.

Therefore,

γ_new = 20 / (1 - ln 2 / ln 3).

Compute 1 - ln2 / ln3:

ln2 ≈ 0.6931, ln3 ≈ 1.0986.

ln2 / ln3 ≈ 0.6309.

Therefore, 1 - 0.6309 ≈ 0.3691.

Thus,

γ_new ≈ 20 / 0.3691 ≈ 54.2.

So, the calculation is consistent.

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Depending on the required precision, maybe 54 or 55. But since the original Lorentz factor was given as ~20 (approximate), perhaps the answer should be around 55. But maybe we need to present it as 54.2 or round to two significant figures, so 54.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach where the solid angle is considered. Wait, but in the previous reasoning, we considered that all particles have to travel a distance R, which is only true if they are moving radially outward. Wait, but if particles are emitted isotropically, some particles would have to travel more than R, some less? Wait, no. Wait, if a particle is emitted in any direction from the center of a sphere, the distance it needs to travel to exit the sphere is R, because it's moving in a straight line from the center. Wait, that's not correct. For example, if a particle is emitted at an angle, say, not directly along a radius, but in some direction, wouldn't it exit the sphere after traveling a distance R? No, actually, no. Wait, imagine a sphere with radius R. If you start at the center and move in any direction, the straight-line distance to the edge is always R. Because the sphere is symmetrical. So regardless of the direction, the path length from the center to the surface is R. Therefore, all particles have to travel a distance R to exit the sphere. Therefore, the time to exit is t = R / (v) ≈ R / c. Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-R/(c γ τ)).

Therefore, the initial reasoning is correct. Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

But let me check with an example. Suppose R = 30 meters. Let's compute R/c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So, R/c = 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 microseconds. The proper lifetime τ is unknown, but from the first condition, with γ = 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:

exp(-30/(3e8 * 20 * τ)) = 1/3.

Taking natural logarithm:

-30/(3e8 * 20 * τ) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986.

Therefore,

30/(3e8 * 20 * τ) = 1.0986.

Solving for τ:

τ = 30 / (3e8 * 20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30 / (6.5916e9) ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds.

So, τ ≈ 4.55 nanoseconds.

Then, for the new Lorentz factor γ_new, we have:

exp(-30/(3e8 * γ_new * 4.55e-9)) = 2/3.

Compute the exponent:

-30 / (3e8 * γ_new * 4.55e-9) = -30 / (1.365e0 * γ_new) ≈ -21.978 / γ_new.

Set equal to ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

Therefore:

-21.978 / γ_new = -0.4055.

Thus,

γ_new ≈ 21.978 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.2.

Same result. So, the calculations are consistent.

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Since the problem mentions "about two thirds", and the original Lorentz factor is given as ~20, which is approximate, the answer should be approximately 55. But maybe to two significant figures, 54.

But let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem, perhaps considering the angular distribution.

Wait, suppose someone thought that the particles are emitted isotropically, and the distance they need to travel depends on the angle. For instance, a particle emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction would have to travel a distance of R / cosθ to exit the sphere. But that would be the case if the particle is emitted from a point at a distance d from the center, but here it's emitted from the center. Wait, no. If you're at the center of the sphere and you emit a particle at an angle θ, the path length to the wall is still R, because you're moving radially outward. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if you are at the center and you move in any direction, you are moving along a radius, so the distance to the wall is R. Wait, but that's only if you define the angle with respect to the radial direction. If you define θ as the angle from some axis, then moving at an angle θ would not change the path length. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let's clarify. In a sphere, any direction from the center is a radial direction. Therefore, regardless of the direction in which the particle is emitted, it is moving along a radius of the sphere, so the distance to the wall is R. Therefore, the path length is R for all particles. Therefore, the time to reach the wall is R/c for all particles. Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-R/(c γ τ)) for all particles. Therefore, the previous calculation holds, and the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 54. So, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have particles produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required so that about two thirds of the particles reach the walls instead.

First, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor means. The Lorentz factor (γ) is defined as 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), right? So, γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, v is very close to c, so γ is large. In this case, the original Lorentz factor is around 20, which is indeed large.

The problem states that the particles decay quickly, so their lifetime is important here. The proper lifetime (τ) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be γτ. So, the distance a particle travels before decaying would be v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is vγτ.

The path length required to exit the sphere is always R, right? Because no matter the direction, moving straight in that direction, the distance from the center to the wall is R. So, if the particle's decay length is L = cγτ, then if L ≥ R, the particle will reach the wall; otherwise, it will decay before. But that would mean that the fraction of particles reaching the wall is either 0% or 100%, depending on whether L is greater or less than R. But the problem states that with γ ~20, one third reach the walls. So, my previous reasoning must be wrong.

Ah, I see. The decay is a probabilistic process. The particle has a certain probability per unit time to decay, so the survival probability decreases exponentially with time. Therefore, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that it survives for at least the time it takes to travel to the wall.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the number of particles surviving after time t is N(t) = N0 * exp(-t/τ'), where τ' is the lab frame lifetime, which is γτ. So, the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)).

# Anthropic completion

Let me analyze this problem. We have particles produced at the center of a spherical detector with a 30-meter radius. These particles move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of approximately 20. Currently, one-third of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. We need to determine what Lorentz factor would allow two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls instead.

I should recall that the Lorentz factor (γ) is defined as 1/√(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity v approaches the speed of light c, resulting in a large γ value. In this case, γ ≈ 20, which confirms these are indeed ultra-relativistic particles.

Since the particles decay rapidly, their lifetime is a crucial factor. The proper lifetime (τ) is measured in the particle's rest frame. Due to time dilation, in the lab frame (detector's frame), the lifetime would be γτ. Therefore, the distance traveled before decay would be v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is vγτ. For ultra-relativistic particles where v ≈ c, this distance is approximately cγτ.

The detector has radius R = 30 meters. For a particle to reach the inner walls, it must travel at least the radius R before decaying. This gives us the condition: cγτ ≥ R.

I need to consider that particles are emitted from the center in all directions. Since the detector is spherical, all directions require the same travel distance - the radius R - to reach the wall.

However, there's a complication: decay is a probabilistic process. The number of particles surviving after time t follows N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ'), where τ' = γτ is the lab frame lifetime. Thus, the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)).

The time required to reach the wall depends on the particle's direction. For particles traveling at speeds very close to c, this introduces complexity into our calculation.

# OpenAI completion

Let me tackle this problem. We have particles generated at the center of a spherical detector with a 30-meter radius, moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of approximately 20. Currently, one third of these particles reach the detector walls. Our goal is to find the Lorentz factor necessary for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls instead.

Firstly, let's remember what the Lorentz factor means. The Lorentz factor (γ) is given by 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), so γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). In the case of ultra-relativistic particles, the speed v is nearly equal to c, meaning γ is quite large. The Lorentz factor being around 20 confirms this.

The problem notes that the particles decay rapidly, making their lifetime significant. The proper lifetime (τ) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, but due to time dilation, the lifetime in the laboratory frame (that of the detector) is γτ. Thus, the distance a particle travels before decaying would be given by v times the lab frame lifetime, which simplifies to vγτ. With v approximately equal to c, the distance is roughly cγτ.

The detector being a sphere with a radius R of 30 meters implies that for a particle to reach the walls, its travel distance before decaying should be at least equal to R. Thus, cγτ ≥ R is the required condition. If the particle decays before traveling this distance, it won’t reach the wall; if it survives longer, it will.

Particles, emitted from the center, can move in any direction. So even if the lifetime is sufficient, their trajectory matters. As particles are emitted isotropically, the distance they travel depends on their emission angle. Wait, this adds complexity.

Imagine you are at the center of a sphere; regardless of direction, the shortest distance to the wall is always R, because all directions are symmetric in a spherical detector. However, because decay is a probabilistic event, the survival probability diminishes exponentially over time. Therefore, the probability of a particle reaching the wall is proportional to its likelihood of surviving long enough to cover that distance.

Thus, the number of surviving particles after a time t is given by N(t) = N0 * exp(-t/τ'), where τ' is the lifetime in the lab frame, γτ. The survival probability then becomes exp(-t/(γτ)).

As travel time to the wall varies with direction for isotropically emitted particles, a particle moving in a specific direction has a survival probability related directly to its travel time, which connects back to the Lorentz factor needed to ensure a greater proportion reaches the walls.

Wait, no. If the particle is moving in a particular direction, the distance to the wall in that direction is R, but if it\'s moving in a direction that\'s not radial, then the actual path length to the wall is longer. Wait, no. If the particle is emitted from the center in any direction, the distance to the wall along that direction is R. Wait, but if the particle is moving in a direction that\'s not radial, then it would have a radial component and a tangential component. Wait, no. If the particle is moving in any direction from the center, the straight-line distance to the wall in that direction is R. So, if the particle moves in that direction at speed v, the time to reach the wall is t = R / v. But if the particle is moving in a different direction, say at an angle θ from the radial direction, then the radial component of velocity is v cosθ, so the time to reach the wall would be R / (v cosθ). Wait, that seems more accurate.\n\nSo, if a particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, its radial velocity is v cosθ, so the time it takes to reach the wall is R / (v cosθ). But if θ is 90 degrees, the radial velocity is zero, so the particle would never reach the wall. But in reality, particles emitted exactly perpendicular to the radial direction would orbit around the center, but since the detector is a sphere, they would still hit the wall eventually if they don\'t decay. Wait, but in reality, particles are moving in straight lines. So, if a particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, the actual distance it needs to travel to exit the sphere is not just R. Let me think.\n\nImagine a sphere of radius R. If a particle is moving in a direction that\'s not radial, its trajectory is a straight line. The distance from the center to the point where it exits the sphere is R, but the path length along the trajectory would be longer. Wait, no. If you have a sphere and a chord of the sphere, the length of the chord depends on the angle. Wait, for a sphere, the maximum chord length is 2R (diameter), and the minimum is... it depends on how you define the chord. Wait, if the particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, then the path length to the wall can be found using trigonometry.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s better to model the problem in terms of impact parameter. Wait, but maybe an easier way is to parameterize the emission angle.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Suppose the particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction. The trajectory is a straight line. The distance from the center to the point where the particle exits the sphere is R, but the path length along the trajectory is the length of the chord. The chord length can be calculated as 2R sin(α), where α is half the central angle. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the formula for chord length. The chord length between two points on a sphere separated by central angle φ is 2R sin(φ/2). But in this case, the particle is emitted at angle θ from the radial direction. Hmm, maybe I need to relate θ to the chord length.\n\nAlternatively, think of the particle\'s trajectory as a straight line starting at the center. The point where it exits the sphere is at a distance R from the center. The angle between the velocity vector and the radial vector at the point of emission is θ. Then, the path length L from the center to the exit point can be found using trigonometry.\n\nWait, if the velocity vector makes an angle θ with the radial direction at the center, then the trajectory is a straight line. The exit point is at a distance R from the center. Let me consider the triangle formed by the center, the point of emission, and the exit point. The angle at the center is θ, the two sides from the center are both R (radius), and the side opposite θ is the chord length. Wait, no. If the velocity vector is at angle θ from the radial direction, then the exit point is not necessarily at angle θ from the center.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach. Let\'s use coordinates. Suppose the particle is emitted from the origin (center of the sphere) with velocity vector making an angle θ with the radial direction (let\'s say the z-axis). The trajectory is a straight line. The parametric equations for the position of the particle as a function of time t would be:\n\nx(t) = v t sinθ cosφ\n\ny(t) = v t sinθ sinφ\n\nz(t) = v t cosθ\n\nWe want to find the time t when the particle reaches the sphere of radius R. That is, when x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 + z(t)^2 = R^2.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(v t sinθ cosφ)^2 + (v t sinθ sinφ)^2 + (v t cosθ)^2 = R^2\n\nFactor out (v t)^2:\n\n(v t)^2 [sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) + cos²θ] = R^2\n\nSince cos²φ + sin²φ = 1:\n\n(v t)^2 [sin²θ + cos²θ] = R^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(v t)^2 = R^2\n\nTherefore, t = R / v\n\nWait, that\'s interesting. So regardless of the angle θ, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is R / v. That seems counterintuitive. Because if the particle is moving in the radial direction (θ = 0), then it travels a distance R at speed v, taking time R / v. If it\'s moving at an angle θ, intuitively, the path length is longer, but according to this calculation, the time is still R / v. Wait, that can\'t be right. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nThe position coordinates after time t are x = v t sinθ cosφ, y = v t sinθ sinφ, z = v t cosθ. Then, the distance from the center is sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = v t sqrt(sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) + cos²θ) = v t sqrt(sin²θ + cos²θ) = v t. So, the distance from the center is v t, which must equal R when the particle reaches the sphere. Therefore, t = R / v. So, regardless of direction, the time to reach the sphere is R / v. That\'s because even though the particle is moving in a different direction, the radial component of velocity is such that the radial distance increases at a rate v_r = v cosθ, but the total distance (which is the hypotenuse) is increasing at rate v. So, even though the radial component is slower, the total distance is still increasing at v. Therefore, the time to reach the sphere is always t = R / v, no matter the direction.\n\nWait, that\'s fascinating. So, in the lab frame, regardless of the direction the particle is moving, the time it takes to reach the detector wall is R / v. Therefore, the distance traveled is v t = R. So, the path length is always R. Therefore, even though the particle is moving in a different direction, it still travels a path length of R to exit the sphere. That seems non-intuitive, but the math checks out.\n\nTherefore, the proper lifetime is τ, so the lab frame lifetime is γτ. The probability that the particle survives until time t is exp(-t / (γτ)). Since t = R / v, the survival probability is exp(-R / (v γτ)).\n\nBut since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c. So, we can approximate v ≈ c. Therefore, survival probability P ≈ exp(-R / (c γ τ)).\n\nGiven that, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is exp(-R / (c γ τ)). The problem states that with γ ≈ 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So, exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ)) ≈ 1/3. Then, we need to find γ such that exp(-R / (c γ τ)) ≈ 2/3.\n\nWait, but hang on. If the survival probability is exp(-R / (c γ τ)), then increasing γ would decrease the argument of the exponential, making the survival probability higher. So, to go from 1/3 survival to 2/3 survival, we need to make the exponent less negative, i.e., decrease R / (c γ τ). Since R and c and τ are constants, we need to increase γ.\n\nBut first, let\'s use the given information to relate R, c, τ, and γ. Let me denote γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3, and we need to find γ2 such that P2 = 2/3.\n\nSo, for γ1:\n\nP1 = exp(-R / (c γ1 τ)) = 1/3\n\nTake natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -R / (c γ1 τ)\n\nSimilarly, for γ2:\n\nln(2/3) = -R / (c γ2 τ)\n\nSo, if we take the ratio of these two equations:\n\n[ln(2/3)] / [ln(1/3)] = [ -R / (c γ2 τ) ] / [ -R / (c γ1 τ) ] = γ1 / γ2\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ2 = γ1 * [ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ]\n\nCompute that:\n\nln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.4055\n\nSo,\n\nγ2 = 20 * [ (-1.0986) / (-0.4055) ] ≈ 20 * (2.709) ≈ 54.18\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify the steps again.\n\n1. Survival probability P = exp(-R / (c γ τ))\n\n2. For γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3: exp(-R/(c*20*τ)) = 1/3\n\n3. For γ2, P2 = 2/3: exp(-R/(c*γ2*τ)) = 2/3\n\n4. Take ln of both sides for both equations:\n\n   - For γ1: -R/(c*20*τ) = ln(1/3)\n\n   - For γ2: -R/(c*γ2*τ) = ln(2/3)\n\n5. Divide the two equations: [ -R/(c*γ2*τ) ] / [ -R/(c*20*τ) ] = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)\n\n   Simplifies to: (20)/γ2 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)\n\n   Therefore, γ2 = 20 * [ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ]\n\n6. Compute the ratio of the logs:\n\n   ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986\n\n   ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055\n\n   So, the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.709\n\n   Therefore, γ2 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18\n\nSo, approximately 54.2. Therefore, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.2.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If you increase the Lorentz factor, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so their decay length is longer, hence more particles survive to reach the wall. So, going from γ=20 with 1/3 survival to γ≈54 with 2/3 survival makes sense.\n\nBut let me check the formula again. The key assumption here is that the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)), where t = R/c (since t = R/v ≈ R/c). Therefore, P = exp(-R/(c γ τ)). Therefore, the ratio between the two Lorentz factors is determined by the ratio of the logarithms of the survival probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve for τ from the first equation and plug into the second.\n\nFrom γ1:\n\n- R/(c γ1 τ) = ln(P1)\n\n=> τ = - R / (c γ1 ln(P1))\n\nThen, for γ2:\n\nln(P2) = - R/(c γ2 τ) = - R/(c γ2 * (- R / (c γ1 ln(P1))) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nln(P2) = (γ1 ln(P1)) / γ2\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ2 = γ1 ln(P1) / ln(P2)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, plugging in P1 = 1/3, P2 = 2/3:\n\nγ2 = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ≈ 20 * (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Rounding to a reasonable number, maybe 54 or 55. Since the question says "about two thirds," an approximate answer is acceptable. However, let me check if there\'s a different approach or if I missed something.\n\nWait, the problem says "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20". Does that mean the Lorentz factor has a narrow distribution? But the question is asking for the required Lorentz factor so that two thirds reach the walls, so I think we can treat it as a monochromatic beam with Lorentz factor γ, and find γ such that the survival probability is 2/3. So, the answer is approximately 54.2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that the particles are moving in random directions, but the decay probability depends on the proper time. Wait, but in that case, the proper time experienced by the particle is t / γ, where t is the lab frame time. Wait, no. The proper time τ experienced by the particle is t / γ, since τ = t / γ. The survival probability in the lab frame is exp(-t / (γ τ_0)), where τ_0 is the proper lifetime. Wait, hold on. If the proper lifetime is τ_0, then in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ_0. Therefore, the decay rate in the lab frame is 1/(γ τ_0). Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-t / (γ τ_0)).\n\nBut t is the lab frame time taken to reach the wall, which we established is R / c. Therefore, survival probability is exp(-R / (c γ τ_0)). So, same as before.\n\nGiven that, with γ1 = 20, P1 = exp(-R/(c*20*τ0)) = 1/3.\n\nWe need to find γ2 such that P2 = exp(-R/(c*γ2*τ0)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, the ratio of the exponents is [ -R/(c γ2 τ0) ] / [ -R/(c γ1 τ0) ] = γ1 / γ2 = ln(P2)/ln(P1)\n\nTherefore, γ2 = γ1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2) = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) ≈ 54.18.\n\nSo, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Since Lorentz factors are usually given to a couple of significant figures, maybe 54 or 55. But let me check the exact value.\n\nCompute ln(1/3) / ln(2/3):\n\nln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.098612289\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.69314718056 - 1.098612289 ≈ -0.4054651084\n\nSo, the ratio is (-1.098612289)/(-0.4054651084) ≈ 2.709511549\n\nMultiply by 20: 20 * 2.709511549 ≈ 54.19023098\n\nSo, approximately 54.2. So, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.2.\n\nBut let me think again if there\'s another factor I might have missed. For instance, in the case of non-radial motion, does the actual proper time experienced by the particle differ? Wait, the proper time is always τ = t / γ, where t is the lab frame time. But in this case, the lab frame time to reach the wall is R / c, regardless of direction, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is (R / c) / γ. The survival probability is exp(-τ / τ0) = exp(-R/(c γ τ0)).\n\nTherefore, even though the particle is moving in a different direction, the proper time it experiences is the same, because the lab frame time is the same. Therefore, the survival probability is the same for all particles, regardless of direction. Therefore, all particles have the same survival probability, which is exp(-R/(c γ τ0)). Therefore, the fraction reaching the wall is just this value.\n\nWait, that seems odd. If all particles have the same survival probability regardless of direction, then even though some particles are moving in a direction where they have to travel a longer path, but wait, we saw earlier that in the lab frame, all particles take the same time to reach the wall, which is R / c. Therefore, regardless of direction, they all have the same lab frame time to reach the wall, hence the same proper time, hence the same survival probability.\n\nTherefore, the initial assumption that one third reach the wall with γ=20 implies that the survival probability is 1/3, and we need to find γ where survival probability is 2/3. Therefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 54.2.\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Let\'s compute the exponent:\n\nFor γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3:\n\nexp(-R/(c*20*τ0)) = 1/3\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-R/(c*20*τ0) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986\n\nTherefore,\n\nR/(c*20*τ0) ≈ 1.0986\n\nSimilarly, for γ2:\n\nexp(-R/(c*γ2*τ0)) = 2/3\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-R/(c*γ2*τ0) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055\n\nTherefore,\n\nR/(c*γ2*τ0) ≈ 0.4055\n\nTherefore, the ratio of R/(c*γ2*τ0) to R/(c*20*τ0) is 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369\n\nTherefore, γ2 / 20 = 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709\n\nTherefore, γ2 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Since the problem mentions Lorentz factor is "highly centered around ~20", implying perhaps some spread, but the answer is a specific value. Since the question is asking for "about two thirds", and given that in the original scenario it\'s "about one third", the answer should be approximately 54.2. Since Lorentz factors are often given to two significant figures, maybe 54 or 55. But perhaps the problem expects an exact form. Let\'s see:\n\nThe ratio of the Lorentz factors is ln(1/3)/ln(2/3). Let\'s compute that exactly:\n\nln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ2 = 20 * (-ln(3))/(ln(2) - ln(3)) = 20 * ln(3)/(ln(3) - ln(2)) = 20 * ln(3)/(ln(3/2))\n\nCompute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055, so 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709, so same as before.\n\nAlternatively, ln(3)/ln(3/2) is exactly the same as ln(3)/(ln(3) - ln(2)). So, this is the exact expression. If we want to write it in terms of logarithms, but the problem probably expects a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Depending on the desired precision, but likely rounding to two significant figures, 54. But maybe 55. Let me check:\n\nCompute 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)):\n\nFirst, exact value:\n\nln(3) ≈ 1.098612289\n\nln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081\n\n1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.70951155\n\n20 * 2.70951155 ≈ 54.190231\n\nSo, approximately 54.2. So, depending on how precise the answer should be, it\'s about 54.2. If we need to give an exact answer, maybe leave it in terms of logarithms, but since the problem is numerical, probably 54.2 is acceptable, or 54.\n\nBut let me check with the original numbers. If we use more precise values:\n\nln(3) = 1.09861228866811\n\nln(2) = 0.6931471805599453\n\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) = 1.09861228866811 - 0.6931471805599453 = 0.4054651081081647\n\nThen, ln(3)/ln(3/2) = 1.09861228866811 / 0.4054651081081647 ≈ 2.7095115290724046\n\nMultiply by 20: 2.7095115290724046 * 20 ≈ 54.19023058144809\n\nSo, approximately 54.19. So, 54.2 when rounded to one decimal place. Since Lorentz factors are often given to the nearest integer or with one decimal, 54.2 is appropriate. However, in experimental physics, sometimes factors are given to the nearest whole number, so 54. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of fractions of logarithms, but I think not. The answer is approximately 54.2.\n\nTherefore, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately \\boxed{54}.'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745388892, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5590, prompt_tokens=1047, total_tokens=6637, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters, particles are produced at the center with a Lorentz factor of ~20, and one third of these particles reach the inner walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required for two thirds of the particles to reach the walls.

1. **Survival Probability**:
   - The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector wall is given by \( P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau}\right) \), where \( R \) is the radius of the detector, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Given Information**:
   - For \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \).
   - We need to find \( \gamma_2 \) such that the survival probability \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Using Logarithms**:
   - For \( \gamma_1 \): 
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
     \]
   - For \( \gamma_2 \):
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \cdot \gamma_2 \cdot \tau}
     \]

4. **Ratio of Logarithms**:
   - Taking the ratio of the two equations:
     \[
     \frac{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)} = \frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \gamma_2 \):
     \[
     \gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
     \]

5. **Calculations**:
   - Compute the logarithms:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3) \approx -1.0986
     \]
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln(2) - \ln(3) \approx -0.4055
     \]
   - Compute the ratio:
     \[
     \frac{-1.0986}{-0.4055} \approx 2.709
     \]
   - Calculate \( \gamma_2 \):
     \[
     \gamma_2 = 20 \cdot 2.709 \approx 54.18
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The required Lorentz factor is approximately \(\boxed{54}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

herically symmetric direction, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(v cosθ), where θ is the angle between the particle's velocity and the radial direction. Wait, no. If the particle is moving in a particular direction, the distance to the wall in that direction is R, but if it's moving in a direction that's not radial, then the actual path length to the wall is longer. Wait, no. If the particle is emitted from the center in any direction, the distance to the wall along that direction is R. Wait, but if the particle is moving in a direction that's not radial, then it would have a radial component and a tangential component. Wait, no. If the particle is moving in any direction from the center, the straight-line distance to the wall in that direction is R. So, if the particle moves in that direction at speed v, the time to reach the wall is t = R / v. But if the particle is moving in a different direction, say at an angle θ from the radial direction, then the radial component of velocity is v cosθ, so the time to reach the wall would be R / (v cosθ). Wait, that seems more accurate.

So, if a particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, its radial velocity is v cosθ, so the time it takes to reach the wall is R / (v cosθ). But if θ is 90 degrees, the radial velocity is zero, so the particle would never reach the wall. But in reality, particles emitted exactly perpendicular to the radial direction would orbit around the center, but since the detector is a sphere, they would still hit the wall eventually if they don't decay. Wait, but in reality, particles are moving in straight lines. So, if a particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, the actual distance it needs to travel to exit the sphere is not just R. Let me think.

Imagine a sphere of radius R. If a particle is moving in a direction that's not radial, its trajectory is a straight line. The distance from the center to the point where it exits the sphere is R, but the path length along the trajectory would be longer. Wait, no. If you have a sphere and a chord of the sphere, the length of the chord depends on the angle. Wait, for a sphere, the maximum chord length is 2R (diameter), and the minimum is... it depends on how you define the chord. Wait, if the particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction, then the path length to the wall can be found using trigonometry.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of impact parameter. Wait, but maybe an easier way is to parameterize the emission angle.

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose the particle is emitted at an angle θ from the radial direction. The trajectory is a straight line. The distance from the center to the point where the particle exits the sphere is R, but the path length along the trajectory is the length of the chord. The chord length can be calculated as 2R sin(α), where α is half the central angle. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the formula for chord length. The chord length between two points on a sphere separated by central angle φ is 2R sin(φ/2). But in this case, the particle is emitted at angle θ from the radial direction. Hmm, maybe I need to relate θ to the chord length.

Alternatively, think of the particle's trajectory as a straight line starting at the center. The point where it exits the sphere is at a distance R from the center. The angle between the velocity vector and the radial vector at the point of emission is θ. Then, the path length L from the center to the exit point can be found using trigonometry.

Wait, if the velocity vector makes an angle θ with the radial direction at the center, then the trajectory is a straight line. The exit point is at a distance R from the center. Let me consider the triangle formed by the center, the point of emission, and the exit point. The angle at the center is θ, the two sides from the center are both R (radius), and the side opposite θ is the chord length. Wait, no. If the velocity vector is at angle θ from the radial direction, then the exit point is not necessarily at angle θ from the center.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach. Let's use coordinates. Suppose the particle is emitted from the origin (center of the sphere) with velocity vector making an angle θ with the radial direction (let's say the z-axis). The trajectory is a straight line. The parametric equations for the position of the particle as a function of time t would be:

x(t) = v t sinθ cosφ

y(t) = v t sinθ sinφ

z(t) = v t cosθ

We want to find the time t when the particle reaches the sphere of radius R. That is, when x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 + z(t)^2 = R^2.

Plugging in:

(v t sinθ cosφ)^2 + (v t sinθ sinφ)^2 + (v t cosθ)^2 = R^2

Factor out (v t)^2:

(v t)^2 [sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) + cos²θ] = R^2

Since cos²φ + sin²φ = 1:

(v t)^2 [sin²θ + cos²θ] = R^2

Which simplifies to:

(v t)^2 = R^2

Therefore, t = R / v

Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of the angle θ, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is R / v. That seems counterintuitive. Because if the particle is moving in the radial direction (θ = 0), then it travels a distance R at speed v, taking time R / v. If it's moving at an angle θ, intuitively, the path length is longer, but according to this calculation, the time is still R / v. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again.

The position coordinates after time t are x = v t sinθ cosφ, y = v t sinθ sinφ, z = v t cosθ. Then, the distance from the center is sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = v t sqrt(sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) + cos²θ) = v t sqrt(sin²θ + cos²θ) = v t. So, the distance from the center is v t, which must equal R when the particle reaches the sphere. Therefore, t = R / v. So, regardless of direction, the time to reach the sphere is R / v. That's because even though the particle is moving in a different direction, the radial component of velocity is such that the radial distance increases at a rate v_r = v cosθ, but the total distance (which is the hypotenuse) is increasing at rate v. So, even though the radial component is slower, the total distance is still increasing at v. Therefore, the time to reach the sphere is always t = R / v, no matter the direction.

Wait, that's fascinating. So, in the lab frame, regardless of the direction the particle is moving, the time it takes to reach the detector wall is R / v. Therefore, the distance traveled is v t = R. So, the path length is always R. Therefore, even though the particle is moving in a different direction, it still travels a path length of R to exit the sphere. That seems non-intuitive, but the math checks out.

Therefore, the proper lifetime is τ, so the lab frame lifetime is γτ. The probability that the particle survives until time t is exp(-t / (γτ)). Since t = R / v, the survival probability is exp(-R / (v γτ)).

But since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c. So, we can approximate v ≈ c. Therefore, survival probability P ≈ exp(-R / (c γ τ)).

Given that, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is exp(-R / (c γ τ)). The problem states that with γ ≈ 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So, exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ)) ≈ 1/3. Then, we need to find γ such that exp(-R / (c γ τ)) ≈ 2/3.

Wait, but hang on. If the survival probability is exp(-R / (c γ τ)), then increasing γ would decrease the argument of the exponential, making the survival probability higher. So, to go from 1/3 survival to 2/3 survival, we need to make the exponent less negative, i.e., decrease R / (c γ τ). Since R and c and τ are constants, we need to increase γ.

But first, let's use the given information to relate R, c, τ, and γ. Let me denote γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3, and we need to find γ2 such that P2 = 2/3.

So, for γ1:

P1 = exp(-R / (c γ1 τ)) = 1/3

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = -R / (c γ1 τ)

Similarly, for γ2:

ln(2/3) = -R / (c γ2 τ)

So, if we take the ratio of these two equations:

[ln(2/3)] / [ln(1/3)] = [ -R / (c γ2 τ) ] / [ -R / (c γ1 τ) ] = γ1 / γ2

Therefore,

γ2 = γ1 * [ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ]

Compute that:

ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.4055

So,

γ2 = 20 * [ (-1.0986) / (-0.4055) ] ≈ 20 * (2.709) ≈ 54.18

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify the steps again.

1. Survival probability P = exp(-R / (c γ τ))

2. For γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3: exp(-R/(c*20*τ)) = 1/3

3. For γ2, P2 = 2/3: exp(-R/(c*γ2*τ)) = 2/3

4. Take ln of both sides for both equations:

   - For γ1: -R/(c*20*τ) = ln(1/3)

   - For γ2: -R/(c*γ2*τ) = ln(2/3)

5. Divide the two equations: [ -R/(c*γ2*τ) ] / [ -R/(c*20*τ) ] = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)

   Simplifies to: (20)/γ2 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)

   Therefore, γ2 = 20 * [ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ]

6. Compute the ratio of the logs:

   ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986

   ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055

   So, the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.709

   Therefore, γ2 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18

So, approximately 54.2. Therefore, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.2.

But wait, let me think again. If you increase the Lorentz factor, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so their decay length is longer, hence more particles survive to reach the wall. So, going from γ=20 with 1/3 survival to γ≈54 with 2/3 survival makes sense.

But let me check the formula again. The key assumption here is that the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)), where t = R/c (since t = R/v ≈ R/c). Therefore, P = exp(-R/(c γ τ)). Therefore, the ratio between the two Lorentz factors is determined by the ratio of the logarithms of the survival probabilities.

Alternatively, we can solve for τ from the first equation and plug into the second.

From γ1:

- R/(c γ1 τ) = ln(P1)

=> τ = - R / (c γ1 ln(P1))

Then, for γ2:

ln(P2) = - R/(c γ2 τ) = - R/(c γ2 * (- R / (c γ1 ln(P1))) )

Simplify:

ln(P2) = (γ1 ln(P1)) / γ2

Therefore,

γ2 = γ1 ln(P1) / ln(P2)

Which is the same as before. So, plugging in P1 = 1/3, P2 = 2/3:

γ2 = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ≈ 20 * (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Rounding to a reasonable number, maybe 54 or 55. Since the question says "about two thirds," an approximate answer is acceptable. However, let me check if there's a different approach or if I missed something.

Wait, the problem says "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20". Does that mean the Lorentz factor has a narrow distribution? But the question is asking for the required Lorentz factor so that two thirds reach the walls, so I think we can treat it as a monochromatic beam with Lorentz factor γ, and find γ such that the survival probability is 2/3. So, the answer is approximately 54.2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.

Suppose that the particles are moving in random directions, but the decay probability depends on the proper time. Wait, but in that case, the proper time experienced by the particle is t / γ, where t is the lab frame time. Wait, no. The proper time τ experienced by the particle is t / γ, since τ = t / γ. The survival probability in the lab frame is exp(-t / (γ τ_0)), where τ_0 is the proper lifetime. Wait, hold on. If the proper lifetime is τ_0, then in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ_0. Therefore, the decay rate in the lab frame is 1/(γ τ_0). Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-t / (γ τ_0)).

But t is the lab frame time taken to reach the wall, which we established is R / c. Therefore, survival probability is exp(-R / (c γ τ_0)). So, same as before.

Given that, with γ1 = 20, P1 = exp(-R/(c*20*τ0)) = 1/3.

We need to find γ2 such that P2 = exp(-R/(c*γ2*τ0)) = 2/3.

So, the ratio of the exponents is [ -R/(c γ2 τ0) ] / [ -R/(c γ1 τ0) ] = γ1 / γ2 = ln(P2)/ln(P1)

Therefore, γ2 = γ1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2) = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) ≈ 54.18.

So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Since Lorentz factors are usually given to a couple of significant figures, maybe 54 or 55. But let me check the exact value.

Compute ln(1/3) / ln(2/3):

ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.098612289

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.69314718056 - 1.098612289 ≈ -0.4054651084

So, the ratio is (-1.098612289)/(-0.4054651084) ≈ 2.709511549

Multiply by 20: 20 * 2.709511549 ≈ 54.19023098

So, approximately 54.2. So, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.2.

But let me think again if there's another factor I might have missed. For instance, in the case of non-radial motion, does the actual proper time experienced by the particle differ? Wait, the proper time is always τ = t / γ, where t is the lab frame time. But in this case, the lab frame time to reach the wall is R / c, regardless of direction, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is (R / c) / γ. The survival probability is exp(-τ / τ0) = exp(-R/(c γ τ0)).

Therefore, even though the particle is moving in a different direction, the proper time it experiences is the same, because the lab frame time is the same. Therefore, the survival probability is the same for all particles, regardless of direction. Therefore, all particles have the same survival probability, which is exp(-R/(c γ τ0)). Therefore, the fraction reaching the wall is just this value.

Wait, that seems odd. If all particles have the same survival probability regardless of direction, then even though some particles are moving in a direction where they have to travel a longer path, but wait, we saw earlier that in the lab frame, all particles take the same time to reach the wall, which is R / c. Therefore, regardless of direction, they all have the same lab frame time to reach the wall, hence the same proper time, hence the same survival probability.

Therefore, the initial assumption that one third reach the wall with γ=20 implies that the survival probability is 1/3, and we need to find γ where survival probability is 2/3. Therefore, our calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2.

But let me check with actual numbers. Let's compute the exponent:

For γ1 = 20, P1 = 1/3:

exp(-R/(c*20*τ0)) = 1/3

Take natural log:

-R/(c*20*τ0) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

Therefore,

R/(c*20*τ0) ≈ 1.0986

Similarly, for γ2:

exp(-R/(c*γ2*τ0)) = 2/3

Take natural log:

-R/(c*γ2*τ0) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055

Therefore,

R/(c*γ2*τ0) ≈ 0.4055

Therefore, the ratio of R/(c*γ2*τ0) to R/(c*20*τ0) is 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369

Therefore, γ2 / 20 = 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709

Therefore, γ2 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18, same as before.

Therefore, the calculation is consistent.

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Since the problem mentions Lorentz factor is "highly centered around ~20", implying perhaps some spread, but the answer is a specific value. Since the question is asking for "about two thirds", and given that in the original scenario it's "about one third", the answer should be approximately 54.2. Since Lorentz factors are often given to two significant figures, maybe 54 or 55. But perhaps the problem expects an exact form. Let's see:

The ratio of the Lorentz factors is ln(1/3)/ln(2/3). Let's compute that exactly:

ln(1/3) = -ln(3)

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)

Therefore,

γ2 = 20 * (-ln(3))/(ln(2) - ln(3)) = 20 * ln(3)/(ln(3) - ln(2)) = 20 * ln(3)/(ln(3/2))

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055, so 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709, so same as before.

Alternatively, ln(3)/ln(3/2) is exactly the same as ln(3)/(ln(3) - ln(2)). So, this is the exact expression. If we want to write it in terms of logarithms, but the problem probably expects a numerical answer.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Depending on the desired precision, but likely rounding to two significant figures, 54. But maybe 55. Let me check:

Compute 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)):

First, exact value:

ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081

1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.70951155

20 * 2.70951155 ≈ 54.190231

So, approximately 54.2. So, depending on how precise the answer should be, it's about 54.2. If we need to give an exact answer, maybe leave it in terms of logarithms, but since the problem is numerical, probably 54.2 is acceptable, or 54.

But let me check with the original numbers. If we use more precise values:

ln(3) = 1.09861228866811

ln(2) = 0.6931471805599453

ln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) = 1.09861228866811 - 0.6931471805599453 = 0.4054651081081647

Then, ln(3)/ln(3/2) = 1.09861228866811 / 0.4054651081081647 ≈ 2.7095115290724046

Multiply by 20: 2.7095115290724046 * 20 ≈ 54.19023058144809

So, approximately 54.19. So, 54.2 when rounded to one decimal place. Since Lorentz factors are often given to the nearest integer or with one decimal, 54.2 is appropriate. However, in experimental physics, sometimes factors are given to the nearest whole number, so 54. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of fractions of logarithms, but I think not. The answer is approximately 54.2.

Therefore, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.2.

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

So maybe we can approximate their velocity as c? Then, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c * sinθ), where θ is the angle between the particle\'s velocity and the radial direction. Wait, no. If the detector is a sphere, then regardless of the direction, the maximum path length is the radius R. Wait, that doesn\'t make sense. If a particle is moving in any direction, the distance to the wall is from the center to the point on the sphere in that direction. So, actually, all particles have a straight path of exactly R meters to the wall. Wait, but that can\'t be. If a particle is moving in any direction from the center, then the distance to the wall is R. Therefore, all particles have to travel exactly R meters to reach the wall. But that contradicts the initial statement that on average, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, perhaps I\'m misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the particles are produced in such a way that their directions are isotropic, but their decay probability depends on the time it takes to reach the wall. Let me think again.\n\nIf particles are moving in all directions, then the distance they need to travel to reach the wall is R, but the time taken depends on their velocity component towards the wall. Wait, no. If they are moving in a straight line from the center, then regardless of direction, the path length is R. But the time to reach the wall is R / (v * cosθ), where θ is the angle between the particle\'s velocity and the radial direction. Wait, that\'s not correct. If the particle is moving in a direction making an angle θ with the radial direction, then the radial component of velocity is v * cosθ. Therefore, the time to reach the wall (moving radially outward) would be R / (v * cosθ). However, if the particle is moving at an angle θ, then the radial component of velocity is v * cosθ, so the time to reach radius R is t = R / (v * cosθ). But if θ is such that cosθ is negative, the particle is moving inward, so it would never reach the wall. Wait, but the problem states that the particles are produced at the center. If a particle is emitted inward, it would move towards the center, but the detector is a sphere with radius R. So particles emitted inward (θ > 90 degrees) would not reach the walls. Therefore, only particles emitted outward (θ < 90 degrees) have a chance to reach the walls. But then, even among those, the time to reach the wall depends on the angle θ. Particles moving radially outward (θ=0) have the shortest time (R / v), while particles moving at an angle θ (0 < θ < 90 degrees) have longer times (R / (v * cosθ)). Therefore, the survival probability depends on the angle θ. The probability that a particle emitted at angle θ survives to reach the wall is exp(-t/(γτ)) = exp(-R / (v * cosθ * γτ)). Then, the total fraction of particles that reach the wall is the integral over all outward directions (θ from 0 to π/2) of [survival probability] weighted by the solid angle.\n\nBut since the emission is isotropic, the probability distribution for θ is proportional to sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating over φ gives 2π, so the fraction of particles reaching the wall would be:\n\n(1/(4π)) * ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp(-R / (v γ τ cosθ)) sinθ dθ dφ )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(1/2) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp(-R / (v γ τ cosθ)) sinθ dθ\n\nLet me make a substitution. Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/2) ∫ (u=1 to 0) exp(-R / (v γ τ u)) (-du) = (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to 1) exp(-R / (v γ τ u)) du\n\nBut this integral might be difficult to compute. Let\'s check the initial condition. It\'s given that with γ = 20, the average fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, for γ = 20, the integral equals 1/3 * 2 (since the (1/2) factor), so the integral from 0 to1 of exp(-R/(v γ τ u)) du = 2/3.\n\nBut wait, the integral is (1/2) ∫ exp(...) du = 1/3, so the integral itself is 2/3.\n\nBut how to relate R, v γ τ, and so on. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so we can approximate v as c. Therefore, R/(c γ τ u) = (R)/(c γ τ u). Let\'s denote k = R/(c γ τ). Then the integral becomes ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k / u) du.\n\nBut integrating exp(-k/u) du from 0 to1 is equal to k * Γ(-1, k), where Γ is the incomplete Gamma function, but this might not be helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution. Let’s set y = 1/u, so when u approaches 0, y approaches infinity, and when u =1, y=1. Then, du = -1/y² dy. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ (y=1 to ∞) exp(-k y) * (1/y²) dy = ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k y) / y² dy.\n\nThis integral can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral function or related functions. However, perhaps there\'s a different approach. Let\'s recall that for the original problem, when γ =20, the integral equals 2/3. So, with γ =20, k = R/(c *20* τ). Let\'s compute this. If we can find k for γ=20, then we can relate it to the integral result 2/3. Then, for the desired case where the integral should be 2/3 *2 = 4/3 (since we want two-thirds of the particles, so the integral would need to be 4/3, but wait, no. Let\'s double-check.\n\nWait, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du. For γ=20, this fraction is 1/3, so (1/2)*Integral =1/3 => Integral=2/3. Therefore, when we want the fraction to be 2/3, we need (1/2)*Integral_new =2/3 => Integral_new=4/3. Therefore, we need to find k_new such that ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k_new /u) du =4/3.\n\nBut how do we relate k and γ? Since k = R/(c γ τ). Let\'s denote k = R/(c γ τ). So, for the original case, k1 = R/(c *20* τ). For the new case, k2 = R/(c * γ_new * τ). Therefore, k2 = (20 / γ_new) * k1.\n\nBut we need to find γ_new such that ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k2 /u) du =4/3. But we know that when k=k1, the integral is 2/3. So, we need to find k2 such that the integral is 4/3. However, the integral ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du is a decreasing function of k. Because as k increases, the integrand becomes smaller for each u. Therefore, if we want the integral to increase from 2/3 to 4/3, we need to decrease k. Since k = R/(c γ τ), decreasing k would require increasing γ. Therefore, γ_new should be larger than 20. Wait, but the question is asking what γ is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls. Since the original γ=20 gives one-third, increasing γ (i.e., longer lifetime in lab frame) would allow more particles to survive longer, thus increasing the fraction reaching the walls. Therefore, γ_new should be higher than 20.\n\nBut how much higher? Let\'s think. Let\'s denote k = R/(c γ τ). For γ=20, k = R/(c *20 τ). Let\'s call this k1. Then, the integral I(k1) =2/3. We need to find k2 such that I(k2)=4/3. But wait, the integral I(k) is always between 0 and 1, since u ranges from 0 to1. Wait, no. Wait, when k approaches 0, exp(-k/u) approaches 1, so the integral becomes ∫ (0 to1) 1 du =1. So when k approaches 0, I(k) approaches1. When k increases, the integral decreases. Therefore, when k= k1, I(k1)=2/3. If we want I(k2)=4/3, that\'s impossible because the maximum value is1. Wait, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is (1/2)*Integral. So, if Integral=2/3, then the fraction is1/3. If we want the fraction to be2/3, then Integral must be4/3. But the Integral itself cannot exceed1, since it\'s ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du. Wait, exp(-k/u) is always ≤1, so the integral over [0,1] must be ≤1. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, there\'s a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls." So, the survival probability is 1/3. When we increase the Lorentz factor, the lifetime increases, so the survival probability should increase. However, according to my previous calculation, the survival fraction is (1/2)*Integral from0 to1 of exp(-k/u) du, which for k=0 would give 1/2*1=1/2. Wait, that can\'t be. If the particles don\'t decay at all (k=0), all particles emitted outward (half of the total) would reach the walls. Therefore, the maximum fraction is1/2, not1. Therefore, in the problem statement, when they say one third reaches the walls, that is out of all particles, not just the ones emitted outward. Therefore, the maximum possible fraction is1/2 (if all particles emitted outward reach the walls, and none of the inward). So, if currently, the fraction is1/3, which is less than1/2, then increasing the Lorentz factor would increase the survival probability towards1/2. Therefore, to get two-thirds (which is more than1/2) is impossible. Therefore, the problem must be considering that all particles are emitted isotropically, but only those moving outward, and maybe the question is considering the fraction of outward-moving particles. Wait, but the problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls." So, total particles, regardless of direction. Therefore, if half are emitted outward, and half inward, but inward-moving particles never reach the walls, then the maximum fraction is1/2. But the problem states one third, so maybe the survival probability for outward-moving particles is2/3 (since half the particles are outward, and2/3 of them survive, leading to total fraction1/3). Therefore, if we want the total fraction to be two-thirds, then we need survival probability for outward-moving particles to be4/3, which is impossible. Therefore, there\'s a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states: "particles travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls."\n\nWait, perhaps "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20" means that their velocities are directed mostly radially outward, so that the angular distribution is not isotropic, but peaked in the forward direction. However, the problem doesn\'t specify the angular distribution, so maybe we are to assume isotropic emission.\n\nBut given that with isotropic emission, the maximum fraction reaching the walls is1/2 (if all outward-moving particles survive), but the problem states that with γ=20, the fraction is1/3. So, perhaps the survival probability for each outward-moving particle is2/3, but when multiplied by1/2 (fraction of outward-moving particles), gives1/3. Therefore, to get two-thirds overall, we need survival probability for outward-moving particles to be4/3, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles are all emitted isotropically, but the ones that can reach the walls are those whose lifetime in the lab frame is sufficient to travel the distance R. Therefore, the condition is that the lab frame lifetime γτ must be at least R/c. Wait, but that would mean that if γτ ≥ R/c, then the particle can reach the wall. However, the decay time is probabilistic. So even if γτ is greater than R/c, there\'s still a probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall. Conversely, even if γτ is less than R/c, there\'s a small chance it survives.\n\nWait, the correct approach is to model the decay as a Poisson process. The probability that a particle survives to reach a distance R is exp(-t_rest / τ), where t_rest is the proper time experienced by the particle. The proper time is related to the lab frame time t via t_rest = t / γ. The lab frame time to reach the wall is t = R/(v cosθ). For ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/(c cosθ). Therefore, the proper time is t_rest = R/(c γ cosθ). Therefore, the survival probability is exp(- t_rest / τ ) = exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ).\n\nTherefore, for each particle emitted at angle θ (0 ≤ θ < π/2 for outward-moving), the survival probability is exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ). The total fraction of particles that reach the wall is then:\n\n(1/(4π)) * ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ dφ )\n\nAgain, integrating over φ gives 2π, so:\n\n(1/(4π)) * 2π * ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ ) = (1/2) ∫ (0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ\n\nChanging variable to u = cosθ, so du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. Therefore:\n\n(1/2) ∫ (u=1 to 0) exp( - R/(c γ τ u) ) (-du) = (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp( - R/(c γ τ u) ) du\n\nLet’s denote k = R/(c γ τ). Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp( -k / u ) du\n\nLet’s make substitution: let x = 1/u, so u =1/x, du = -1/x² dx. When u=0, x=∞; u=1, x=1. Therefore:\n\n(1/2) ∫ (x=∞ to1) exp( -k x ) ( -1/x² dx ) = (1/2) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x) / x² dx\n\nThis integral can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral function, but perhaps there\'s another way. Let\'s integrate by parts. Let’s set:\n\nLet’s let dv = exp(-k x) dx, then v = -exp(-k x)/k\n\nLet u = 1/x², then du = -2/x³ dx\n\nBut integration by parts gives:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\n= [ -exp(-k x)/(k x²) ] from1 to ∞ + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx\n\nEvaluating the boundary term: as x→∞, exp(-k x) goes to0, so the term at ∞ is0. At x=1, it\'s -exp(-k)/k. Therefore:\n\n= 0 - (-exp(-k)/k ) + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx\n\n= exp(-k)/k + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx\n\nThis seems to lead to an infinite series. Alternatively, recognizing that ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x² dx = k^{-1} Γ(-1, k), where Γ is the upper incomplete gamma function. However, this might not be helpful for an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, note that ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x² dx = exp(-k) * ∫ (0 to ∞) exp(-k t)/(1 + t)^2 dt, by substituting t = x -1, but this also complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the integral for small k or large k.\n\nGiven that in the original problem, with γ=20, the integral is (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du =1/3. Therefore, ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du =2/3. Let\'s compute this integral numerically for k= R/(c γ τ). However, since we don\'t know τ, we need to relate it to the given information.\n\nWait, but we can set up a ratio. Let’s denote that for γ=20, the integral I(k1)=2/3, where k1= R/(c *20* τ). For the desired case, we need I(k2)=4/3, but since the integral cannot exceed1, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The fraction of particles reaching the wall is (1/2)*Integral. For γ=20, (1/2)*I(k1)=1/3 => I(k1)=2/3. To get (1/2)*I(k2)=2/3 => I(k2)=4/3. But since the integral I(k) is always less than1 (as the integrand exp(-k/u) ≤1), this is impossible. Therefore, my model must be wrong.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption about the survival probability is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are emitted in all directions, but only those moving radially outward can reach the walls, and the rest decay before changing direction? That doesn\'t make sense for ultra-relativistic particles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that all particles are moving radially outward. If that\'s the case, then the time to reach the wall is t=R/(v), and the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)). Therefore, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-R/(c γτ)) (since v≈c). If this fraction is1/3 for γ=20, then we can solve for R/(c τ):\n\nexp(-R/(c *20* τ)) =1/3\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\n-R/(c*20*τ) = ln(1/3) => R/(c*20*τ) = ln3\n\nThen, for the desired case where the fraction is2/3, we set:\n\nexp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ)) =2/3\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\n-R/(c*γ_new*τ) = ln(2/3) => R/(c*γ_new*τ) = ln(3/2)\n\nBut from the first equation, R/(c*τ) =20*ln3. Therefore, substituting into the second equation:\n\n20*ln3 / γ_new = ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore, γ_new =20*ln3 / ln(3/2)\n\nCompute this value:\n\nln3 ≈1.0986\n\nln(3/2) ≈0.4055\n\nThus,\n\nγ_new ≈20*1.0986 /0.4055 ≈20*2.709 ≈54.18\n\nTherefore, approximately γ≈54.2.\n\nBut this assumes that all particles are moving directly outward. However, the problem states that particles are produced at the center and travel uninterrupted. If they are moving in all directions, but only a fraction of them (those moving outward) can reach the walls, but with isotropic emission, half are moving outward, half inward. If we assume that only the outward-moving particles have a chance to reach the walls, and their survival probability is exp(-R/(c γτ)), then the total fraction is (1/2)*exp(-R/(c γτ)). Given that with γ=20, this is1/3, so:\n\n(1/2)*exp(-R/(c*20*τ)) =1/3 => exp(-R/(c*20*τ))=2/3\n\nThen, solving for R/(c τ):\n\n-R/(c*20*τ)=ln(2/3) => R/(c τ)= -20*ln(2/3)=20*ln(3/2)\n\nThen, for the desired case where the total fraction is2/3:\n\n(1/2)*exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=2/3 => exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=4/3\n\nBut exp(-x)=4/3 implies x= -ln(4/3)≈-0.2877, which is impossible since x=R/(c*γ_new*τ) must be positive. Hence, this is impossible. Therefore, this model is also flawed.\n\nTherefore, returning to the previous approach where all particles are moving directly outward, which gives γ_new≈54.2. However, in that case, the original fraction would be exp(-R/(c*20*τ))=1/3, implying R/(c*20*τ)=ln3. Then, for two-thirds survival, exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=2/3, leading to R/(c*γ_new*τ)=ln(3/2). Therefore, γ_new= (R/(c*τ))/ln(3/2)= (20*ln3)/ln(3/2)=20*(ln3)/(ln(3/2))≈54.18.\n\nBut why would the problem mention the detector is spherical if all particles are moving outward? Maybe it\'s a trick question where direction doesn\'t matter because all particles move radially outward, but that’s not standard. The mention of a spherical detector usually implies isotropic emission.\n\nGiven the confusion here, perhaps the problem expects a simple scaling. Since the survival probability depends on γ as exp(-R/(c γ τ)). Given that for γ=20, survival probability is1/3, and we want it to be2/3. Assuming that the survival probability scales as exp(-k/γ), then:\n\nFor γ=20: exp(-k/20)=1/3 => -k/20=ln(1/3) =>k=20*ln3\n\nFor desired γ_new: exp(-k/γ_new)=2/3 => -k/γ_new=ln(2/3) =>γ_new= k / ln(3/2)=20*ln3 / ln(3/2)≈54.18.\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately54.2.\n\nThis approach assumes that all particles are moving directly outward, which might not account for the spherical detector, but given the problem\'s phrasing and the need to get a feasible answer, this is likely the intended solution. Therefore, the answer is about54.2, so rounding to two significant figures,γ≈54.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389170, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5635, prompt_tokens=499, total_tokens=6134, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the required Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we start by analyzing their survival probability. 

1. **Survival Probability**: For a particle moving radially outward, the survival probability is given by:
   \[
   P(\gamma) = e^{-R / (c \gamma \tau)}
   \]
   where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \), \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime.

2. **Given Condition for \(\gamma = 20\)**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = e^{-R / (c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau)} \implies \frac{R}{c \tau} = 20 \ln 3
   \]

3. **Desired Condition for Two-Thirds Survival**:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = e^{-R / (c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau)} \implies \frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
   \]

4. **Solving for \(\gamma_{\text{new}}\)**:
   Substitute \( \frac{R}{c \tau} = 20 \ln 3 \) into the second equation:
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.2
   \]

**Answer**: The required Lorentz factor is approximately **54**.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, but the problem states that the particles are moving "uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities." So maybe we can approximate their velocity as c? Then, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c * sinθ), where θ is the angle between the particle's velocity and the radial direction. Wait, no. If the detector is a sphere, then regardless of the direction, the maximum path length is the radius R. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If a particle is moving in any direction, the distance to the wall is from the center to the point on the sphere in that direction. So, actually, all particles have a straight path of exactly R meters to the wall. Wait, but that can't be. If a particle is moving in any direction from the center, then the distance to the wall is R. Therefore, all particles have to travel exactly R meters to reach the wall. But that contradicts the initial statement that on average, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the particles are produced in such a way that their directions are isotropic, but their decay probability depends on the time it takes to reach the wall. Let me think again.

If particles are moving in all directions, then the distance they need to travel to reach the wall is R, but the time taken depends on their velocity component towards the wall. Wait, no. If they are moving in a straight line from the center, then regardless of direction, the path length is R. But the time to reach the wall is R / (v * cosθ), where θ is the angle between the particle's velocity and the radial direction. Wait, that's not correct. If the particle is moving in a direction making an angle θ with the radial direction, then the radial component of velocity is v * cosθ. Therefore, the time to reach the wall (moving radially outward) would be R / (v * cosθ). However, if the particle is moving at an angle θ, then the radial component of velocity is v * cosθ, so the time to reach radius R is t = R / (v * cosθ). But if θ is such that cosθ is negative, the particle is moving inward, so it would never reach the wall. Wait, but the problem states that the particles are produced at the center. If a particle is emitted inward, it would move towards the center, but the detector is a sphere with radius R. So particles emitted inward (θ > 90 degrees) would not reach the walls. Therefore, only particles emitted outward (θ < 90 degrees) have a chance to reach the walls. But then, even among those, the time to reach the wall depends on the angle θ. Particles moving radially outward (θ=0) have the shortest time (R / v), while particles moving at an angle θ (0 < θ < 90 degrees) have longer times (R / (v * cosθ)). Therefore, the survival probability depends on the angle θ. The probability that a particle emitted at angle θ survives to reach the wall is exp(-t/(γτ)) = exp(-R / (v * cosθ * γτ)). Then, the total fraction of particles that reach the wall is the integral over all outward directions (θ from 0 to π/2) of [survival probability] weighted by the solid angle.

But since the emission is isotropic, the probability distribution for θ is proportional to sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating over φ gives 2π, so the fraction of particles reaching the wall would be:

(1/(4π)) * ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp(-R / (v γ τ cosθ)) sinθ dθ dφ )

Which simplifies to:

(1/2) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp(-R / (v γ τ cosθ)) sinθ dθ

Let me make a substitution. Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫ (u=1 to 0) exp(-R / (v γ τ u)) (-du) = (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to 1) exp(-R / (v γ τ u)) du

But this integral might be difficult to compute. Let's check the initial condition. It's given that with γ = 20, the average fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, for γ = 20, the integral equals 1/3 * 2 (since the (1/2) factor), so the integral from 0 to1 of exp(-R/(v γ τ u)) du = 2/3.

But wait, the integral is (1/2) ∫ exp(...) du = 1/3, so the integral itself is 2/3.

But how to relate R, v γ τ, and so on. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so we can approximate v as c. Therefore, R/(c γ τ u) = (R)/(c γ τ u). Let's denote k = R/(c γ τ). Then the integral becomes ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k / u) du.

But integrating exp(-k/u) du from 0 to1 is equal to k * Γ(-1, k), where Γ is the incomplete Gamma function, but this might not be helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution. Let’s set y = 1/u, so when u approaches 0, y approaches infinity, and when u =1, y=1. Then, du = -1/y² dy. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ (y=1 to ∞) exp(-k y) * (1/y²) dy = ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k y) / y² dy.

This integral can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral function or related functions. However, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's recall that for the original problem, when γ =20, the integral equals 2/3. So, with γ =20, k = R/(c *20* τ). Let's compute this. If we can find k for γ=20, then we can relate it to the integral result 2/3. Then, for the desired case where the integral should be 2/3 *2 = 4/3 (since we want two-thirds of the particles, so the integral would need to be 4/3, but wait, no. Let's double-check.

Wait, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du. For γ=20, this fraction is 1/3, so (1/2)*Integral =1/3 => Integral=2/3. Therefore, when we want the fraction to be 2/3, we need (1/2)*Integral_new =2/3 => Integral_new=4/3. Therefore, we need to find k_new such that ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k_new /u) du =4/3.

But how do we relate k and γ? Since k = R/(c γ τ). Let's denote k = R/(c γ τ). So, for the original case, k1 = R/(c *20* τ). For the new case, k2 = R/(c * γ_new * τ). Therefore, k2 = (20 / γ_new) * k1.

But we need to find γ_new such that ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k2 /u) du =4/3. But we know that when k=k1, the integral is 2/3. So, we need to find k2 such that the integral is 4/3. However, the integral ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du is a decreasing function of k. Because as k increases, the integrand becomes smaller for each u. Therefore, if we want the integral to increase from 2/3 to 4/3, we need to decrease k. Since k = R/(c γ τ), decreasing k would require increasing γ. Therefore, γ_new should be larger than 20. Wait, but the question is asking what γ is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls. Since the original γ=20 gives one-third, increasing γ (i.e., longer lifetime in lab frame) would allow more particles to survive longer, thus increasing the fraction reaching the walls. Therefore, γ_new should be higher than 20.

But how much higher? Let's think. Let's denote k = R/(c γ τ). For γ=20, k = R/(c *20 τ). Let's call this k1. Then, the integral I(k1) =2/3. We need to find k2 such that I(k2)=4/3. But wait, the integral I(k) is always between 0 and 1, since u ranges from 0 to1. Wait, no. Wait, when k approaches 0, exp(-k/u) approaches 1, so the integral becomes ∫ (0 to1) 1 du =1. So when k approaches 0, I(k) approaches1. When k increases, the integral decreases. Therefore, when k= k1, I(k1)=2/3. If we want I(k2)=4/3, that's impossible because the maximum value is1. Wait, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is (1/2)*Integral. So, if Integral=2/3, then the fraction is1/3. If we want the fraction to be2/3, then Integral must be4/3. But the Integral itself cannot exceed1, since it's ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du. Wait, exp(-k/u) is always ≤1, so the integral over [0,1] must be ≤1. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, my approach is wrong.

Hmm. So, there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls." So, the survival probability is 1/3. When we increase the Lorentz factor, the lifetime increases, so the survival probability should increase. However, according to my previous calculation, the survival fraction is (1/2)*Integral from0 to1 of exp(-k/u) du, which for k=0 would give 1/2*1=1/2. Wait, that can't be. If the particles don't decay at all (k=0), all particles emitted outward (half of the total) would reach the walls. Therefore, the maximum fraction is1/2, not1. Therefore, in the problem statement, when they say one third reaches the walls, that is out of all particles, not just the ones emitted outward. Therefore, the maximum possible fraction is1/2 (if all particles emitted outward reach the walls, and none of the inward). So, if currently, the fraction is1/3, which is less than1/2, then increasing the Lorentz factor would increase the survival probability towards1/2. Therefore, to get two-thirds (which is more than1/2) is impossible. Therefore, the problem must be considering that all particles are emitted isotropically, but only those moving outward, and maybe the question is considering the fraction of outward-moving particles. Wait, but the problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls." So, total particles, regardless of direction. Therefore, if half are emitted outward, and half inward, but inward-moving particles never reach the walls, then the maximum fraction is1/2. But the problem states one third, so maybe the survival probability for outward-moving particles is2/3 (since half the particles are outward, and2/3 of them survive, leading to total fraction1/3). Therefore, if we want the total fraction to be two-thirds, then we need survival probability for outward-moving particles to be4/3, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem states: "particles travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls."

Wait, perhaps "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20" means that their velocities are directed mostly radially outward, so that the angular distribution is not isotropic, but peaked in the forward direction. However, the problem doesn't specify the angular distribution, so maybe we are to assume isotropic emission.

But given that with isotropic emission, the maximum fraction reaching the walls is1/2 (if all outward-moving particles survive), but the problem states that with γ=20, the fraction is1/3. So, perhaps the survival probability for each outward-moving particle is2/3, but when multiplied by1/2 (fraction of outward-moving particles), gives1/3. Therefore, to get two-thirds overall, we need survival probability for outward-moving particles to be4/3, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a different interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the particles are all emitted isotropically, but the ones that can reach the walls are those whose lifetime in the lab frame is sufficient to travel the distance R. Therefore, the condition is that the lab frame lifetime γτ must be at least R/c. Wait, but that would mean that if γτ ≥ R/c, then the particle can reach the wall. However, the decay time is probabilistic. So even if γτ is greater than R/c, there's still a probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall. Conversely, even if γτ is less than R/c, there's a small chance it survives.

Wait, the correct approach is to model the decay as a Poisson process. The probability that a particle survives to reach a distance R is exp(-t_rest / τ), where t_rest is the proper time experienced by the particle. The proper time is related to the lab frame time t via t_rest = t / γ. The lab frame time to reach the wall is t = R/(v cosθ). For ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/(c cosθ). Therefore, the proper time is t_rest = R/(c γ cosθ). Therefore, the survival probability is exp(- t_rest / τ ) = exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ).

Therefore, for each particle emitted at angle θ (0 ≤ θ < π/2 for outward-moving), the survival probability is exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ). The total fraction of particles that reach the wall is then:

(1/(4π)) * ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ dφ )

Again, integrating over φ gives 2π, so:

(1/(4π)) * 2π * ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ ) = (1/2) ∫ (0 to π/2) exp( - R/(c γ τ cosθ) ) sinθ dθ

Changing variable to u = cosθ, so du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. Therefore:

(1/2) ∫ (u=1 to 0) exp( - R/(c γ τ u) ) (-du) = (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp( - R/(c γ τ u) ) du

Let’s denote k = R/(c γ τ). Then the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp( -k / u ) du

Let’s make substitution: let x = 1/u, so u =1/x, du = -1/x² dx. When u=0, x=∞; u=1, x=1. Therefore:

(1/2) ∫ (x=∞ to1) exp( -k x ) ( -1/x² dx ) = (1/2) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x) / x² dx

This integral can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral function, but perhaps there's another way. Let's integrate by parts. Let’s set:

Let’s let dv = exp(-k x) dx, then v = -exp(-k x)/k

Let u = 1/x², then du = -2/x³ dx

But integration by parts gives:

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du

= [ -exp(-k x)/(k x²) ] from1 to ∞ + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx

Evaluating the boundary term: as x→∞, exp(-k x) goes to0, so the term at ∞ is0. At x=1, it's -exp(-k)/k. Therefore:

= 0 - (-exp(-k)/k ) + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx

= exp(-k)/k + (2/k) ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x³ dx

This seems to lead to an infinite series. Alternatively, recognizing that ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x² dx = k^{-1} Γ(-1, k), where Γ is the upper incomplete gamma function. However, this might not be helpful for an exact solution.

Alternatively, note that ∫ (1 to ∞) exp(-k x)/x² dx = exp(-k) * ∫ (0 to ∞) exp(-k t)/(1 + t)^2 dt, by substituting t = x -1, but this also complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate the integral for small k or large k.

Given that in the original problem, with γ=20, the integral is (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du =1/3. Therefore, ∫ (0 to1) exp(-k/u) du =2/3. Let's compute this integral numerically for k= R/(c γ τ). However, since we don't know τ, we need to relate it to the given information.

Wait, but we can set up a ratio. Let’s denote that for γ=20, the integral I(k1)=2/3, where k1= R/(c *20* τ). For the desired case, we need I(k2)=4/3, but since the integral cannot exceed1, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, no. The fraction of particles reaching the wall is (1/2)*Integral. For γ=20, (1/2)*I(k1)=1/3 => I(k1)=2/3. To get (1/2)*I(k2)=2/3 => I(k2)=4/3. But since the integral I(k) is always less than1 (as the integrand exp(-k/u) ≤1), this is impossible. Therefore, my model must be wrong.

This suggests that the initial assumption about the survival probability is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are emitted in all directions, but only those moving radially outward can reach the walls, and the rest decay before changing direction? That doesn't make sense for ultra-relativistic particles.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that all particles are moving radially outward. If that's the case, then the time to reach the wall is t=R/(v), and the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)). Therefore, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-R/(c γτ)) (since v≈c). If this fraction is1/3 for γ=20, then we can solve for R/(c τ):

exp(-R/(c *20* τ)) =1/3

Taking natural logarithm:

-R/(c*20*τ) = ln(1/3) => R/(c*20*τ) = ln3

Then, for the desired case where the fraction is2/3, we set:

exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ)) =2/3

Taking natural logarithm:

-R/(c*γ_new*τ) = ln(2/3) => R/(c*γ_new*τ) = ln(3/2)

But from the first equation, R/(c*τ) =20*ln3. Therefore, substituting into the second equation:

20*ln3 / γ_new = ln(3/2)

Therefore, γ_new =20*ln3 / ln(3/2)

Compute this value:

ln3 ≈1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈0.4055

Thus,

γ_new ≈20*1.0986 /0.4055 ≈20*2.709 ≈54.18

Therefore, approximately γ≈54.2.

But this assumes that all particles are moving directly outward. However, the problem states that particles are produced at the center and travel uninterrupted. If they are moving in all directions, but only a fraction of them (those moving outward) can reach the walls, but with isotropic emission, half are moving outward, half inward. If we assume that only the outward-moving particles have a chance to reach the walls, and their survival probability is exp(-R/(c γτ)), then the total fraction is (1/2)*exp(-R/(c γτ)). Given that with γ=20, this is1/3, so:

(1/2)*exp(-R/(c*20*τ)) =1/3 => exp(-R/(c*20*τ))=2/3

Then, solving for R/(c τ):

-R/(c*20*τ)=ln(2/3) => R/(c τ)= -20*ln(2/3)=20*ln(3/2)

Then, for the desired case where the total fraction is2/3:

(1/2)*exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=2/3 => exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=4/3

But exp(-x)=4/3 implies x= -ln(4/3)≈-0.2877, which is impossible since x=R/(c*γ_new*τ) must be positive. Hence, this is impossible. Therefore, this model is also flawed.

Therefore, returning to the previous approach where all particles are moving directly outward, which gives γ_new≈54.2. However, in that case, the original fraction would be exp(-R/(c*20*τ))=1/3, implying R/(c*20*τ)=ln3. Then, for two-thirds survival, exp(-R/(c*γ_new*τ))=2/3, leading to R/(c*γ_new*τ)=ln(3/2). Therefore, γ_new= (R/(c*τ))/ln(3/2)= (20*ln3)/ln(3/2)=20*(ln3)/(ln(3/2))≈54.18.

But why would the problem mention the detector is spherical if all particles are moving outward? Maybe it's a trick question where direction doesn't matter because all particles move radially outward, but that’s not standard. The mention of a spherical detector usually implies isotropic emission.

Given the confusion here, perhaps the problem expects a simple scaling. Since the survival probability depends on γ as exp(-R/(c γ τ)). Given that for γ=20, survival probability is1/3, and we want it to be2/3. Assuming that the survival probability scales as exp(-k/γ), then:

For γ=20: exp(-k/20)=1/3 => -k/20=ln(1/3) =>k=20*ln3

For desired γ_new: exp(-k/γ_new)=2/3 => -k/γ_new=ln(2/3) =>γ_new= k / ln(3/2)=20*ln3 / ln(3/2)≈54.18.

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately54.2.

This approach assumes that all particles are moving directly outward, which might not account for the spherical detector, but given the problem's phrasing and the need to get a feasible answer, this is likely the intended solution. Therefore, the answer is about54.2, so rounding to two significant figures,γ≈54.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

Given particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters, traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of approximately 20, and one third of these particles reach the detector walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls.

1. **Survival Probability Equation**:
   The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector walls is given by:
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau}\right)
   \]
   where \( R = 30 \) meters, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Determine \( c \tau \)**:
   For the initial condition where \( \gamma = 20 \) and \( P = \frac{1}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma \tau}\right)
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma \tau}
   \]
   Solving for \( c \tau \):
   \[
   c \tau = \frac{30}{\gamma \ln(3)} = \frac{30}{20 \times \ln(3)} \approx \frac{30}{20 \times 1.0986} \approx 1.365 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Find New Lorentz Factor**:
   For the desired survival probability \( P = \frac{2}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma' \tau}\right)
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma' \tau}
   \]
   Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.365 \):
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{1.365 \gamma'}
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma' \):
   \[
   \gamma' = \frac{30}{1.365 \times (-\ln(2/3))} \approx \frac{30}{1.365 \times 0.4055} \approx 54.17
   \]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

Wait, perhaps my initial thought process is missing something here.

Therefore, the time taken to reach the wall is R/(v), which for ultra-relativistic particles is approximately R/c.

But the decay time is probabilistic. The probability that a particle survives long enough to reach the wall is the probability that its lifetime in the lab frame exceeds the travel time. The survival probability P is exp(-t/τ_lab), where τ_lab = γτ. So t = R/(v) ≈ R/c. Therefore, P = exp(-R/(c γ τ)).

But the problem states that on average, one third of the particles reach the walls when γ is ~20. So we can use this information to find the product c τ. Then, using that, we can solve for γ when the probability is two-thirds.

Wait, but how does the average relate to the probability? If each particle has a survival probability P, then the fraction of particles that reach the walls is P. So if one third reach the walls, then P = 1/3. For two-thirds, P = 2/3.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

For γ = 20, 1/3 = exp(-R/(c γ τ))

We can solve for R/(c τ) first.

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c γ τ)

Thus,

R/(c τ) = - γ ln(1/3) = γ ln(3)

Therefore,

c τ = R / (γ ln(3))

Given R = 30 meters, γ = 20, so:

c τ = 30 m / (20 * ln(3)) ≈ 30 / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Wait, but c τ has units of meters if τ is in seconds and c is in m/s. So c τ is indeed the distance light travels in the particle's lifetime. So the proper lifetime τ is (c τ)/c. Let me check:

c τ = 1.365 meters => τ = 1.365 m / c ≈ 1.365 / 3e8 m/s ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds, which is 4.55 nanoseconds. That seems reasonable for a particle's proper lifetime.

Now, we need to find the γ' such that P = 2/3 = exp(-R/(c γ' τ))

Again, take the natural logarithm:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c γ' τ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = R/(c γ' τ)

But R/(c τ) is equal to γ ln(3) from before. Wait, no. Wait, from the first part:

c τ = R / (γ ln(3))

So R/(c τ) = γ ln(3)

Therefore, substituting into the second equation:

- ln(2/3) = (γ ln(3)) / γ'

Thus,

γ' = (γ ln(3)) / (- ln(2/3))

But let's compute the values step by step.

We need:

- ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

Therefore,

γ' = (γ ln(3)) / ln(3/2) ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ 54.17

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.17. So about 54.

But let's check the steps again to ensure no mistakes.

Given that with γ = 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

We found that c τ = R / (γ ln(3)) ≈ 1.365 meters.

Then, for survival probability 2/3, we set:

2/3 = exp(- R/(c γ' τ)) => ln(2/3) = - R/(c γ' τ)

But R/(c τ) = γ ln(3) from earlier. So substituting:

ln(2/3) = - γ ln(3)/ γ'

Therefore,

γ' = - γ ln(3) / ln(2/3) = γ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.17

Yes, that seems correct. So the Lorentz factor needs to be approximately 54. So the answer is around 54.

But let me verify with actual numbers.

First, compute c τ:

With γ = 20, R = 30 m.

From 1/3 = exp(- R/(c γ τ)), so R/(c γ τ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

Thus, c τ = R / (γ ln(3)) = 30 / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Now, for two-thirds survival:

2/3 = exp(- R/(c γ' τ)) => R/(c γ' τ) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So, γ' = R / (c τ * 0.4055) = 30 / (1.365 * 0.4055) ≈ 30 / 0.553 ≈ 54.25

Yes, so approximately 54.25. So the answer is about 54. So Lorentz factor of approximately 54.

But let me check if the initial assumption is correct. The problem states that particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, which justifies the approximation v ≈ c. So that's acceptable.

Additionally, the problem says the particles decay "fast-decaying," but since they are moving at high Lorentz factors, their lifetimes are significantly extended in the lab frame. So even if the proper lifetime is short, the lab frame lifetime is γ τ, allowing them to reach the detector walls if γ is high enough.

Therefore, the key equation is the survival probability P = exp(- R/(c γ τ)), and by using the given information for γ = 20 and P = 1/3, we can solve for τ, then use that τ to find the required γ for P = 2/3.

Hence, the answer is approximately 54. So the Lorentz factor needed is about 54. To be precise, 54.17, but since the original Lorentz factor was given as ~20, the answer should be approximately 54. So \boxed{54} would be appropriate.

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.
