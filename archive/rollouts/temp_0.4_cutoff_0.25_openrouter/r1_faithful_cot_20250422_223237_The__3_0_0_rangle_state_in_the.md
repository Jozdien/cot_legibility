The |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom decays to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions require that the orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l \) changes by \( \pm 1 \) and the magnetic quantum number \( m \) changes by 0, \( \pm 1 \).

1. **Initial Transition**: The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) must transition to an intermediate state with \( l = 1 \). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1, m=-1, 0, +1) because the principal quantum number \( n \) decreases from 3 to 2 to ensure a valid energy transition.

2. **Second Transition**: The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1) must then transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0). This transition also follows the dipole selection rules, changing \( l \) from 1 to 0 and adjusting \( m \) appropriately.

3. **Probability Consideration**: The total probability is the sum over all possible intermediate \( m \) states (-1, 0, +1). Due to the spherical symmetry of the s-states (l=0), the transition probabilities for each \( m \) are symmetric. The total probability is proportional to the sum of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition step, considering all three possible \( m \) values.

### Final Answer
The transition route is \boxed{|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle} and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the dipole transition probabilities for each step, summed over all intermediate magnetic quantum numbers \( m = -1, 0, +1 \).

Okay, so I have this problem about the hydrogen atom where a state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the transition route and the corresponding probability. Let me start by recalling what dipole transitions are. 

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon. The dipole transition rules say that the change in angular momentum quantum numbers must follow Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for a dipole transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can stay the same or change by ±1. 

The initial state here is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the transition happens via two dipole steps, there must be an intermediate state. So the electron can't go directly from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ in one step because that would require l to change by 0 (from 0 to 0), which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. Therefore, it has to go through an intermediate state with l=1, right? Because starting from l=0, the only possible change is to l=1. 

So the first transition would be from |3,0,0⟩ to some state with n=2 or n=3 (since the principal quantum number can change in transitions, but wait, no—the principal quantum number can change by any amount, but the energy difference determines the probability. However, in dipole transitions, the selection rules are about l and m, not n. So maybe the intermediate state could be in n=2 or n=3? Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So the first transition would be from n=3, l=0 to some n', l'=1, and then from there to n=1, l=0. But n' has to be between 3 and 1? Wait, but if it's decaying, it's going from higher energy to lower energy. So first step: n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1? But the angular momentum must change accordingly.

Wait, let's think again. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. To make a dipole transition, the first step must go to a state with l=1. So possible intermediate states would have l=1. The principal quantum number n can be anything, but since we're decaying, the energy should decrease each time. So the first transition could be from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. That seems plausible. Let me check the m values. The initial m is 0. In the first transition, since Δm can be 0, ±1, so the intermediate state could have m = -1, 0, +1. Then from there, transitioning to |1,0,0⟩ which has m=0. So the second transition must have Δm = 0 if the intermediate has m=0, or Δm = +1 if intermediate has m=-1, or Δm = -1 if intermediate has m=+1. But the final m is 0. So the possible intermediate m's are 0, 1, or -1, but in the second transition, you have to get back to m=0. 

Wait, but the problem says the decay is from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So the route must go through a state with l=1. Let's confirm the possible intermediate states. The first transition must be from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. The principal quantum number for the intermediate state could be n=2 or n=3? But if it's n=3, then after that, going to n=1 would require another dipole transition. However, if the intermediate state is n=3, l=1, then going to n=1, l=0 would require l to change from 1 to 0, which is allowed (Δl = -1). But would that be a dipole transition? Yes, because Δl = ±1. So both steps would be allowed. But wait, but if the electron is in n=3, l=1, can it transition directly to n=1, l=0? The selection rules allow it, but does the energy difference matter? The transition probability depends on the matrix element, which might not be zero. However, the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So maybe the path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0. Or 3,0,0 → 3,1,m → 1,0,0. Which one is more probable? 

I think the energy levels are such that transitions between higher n to lower n are more probable when the energy difference is larger, but in terms of selection rules, both paths might be possible. However, typically, in such problems, the intermediate state is the one with the next lower n. So maybe the standard path is 3→2→1. Let me check.

But wait, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Both steps satisfy Δl = ±1. Alternatively, could you go from n=3, l=0 to n=3, l=1, and then from n=3, l=1 to n=1, l=0? But that would require the electron to first change l without changing n, which is possible via a transition, but in reality, the photon emitted would have very low energy (since the energy difference between l states within the same n is much smaller, especially in non-relativistic theory where l states are degenerate). Wait, but in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, states with the same n but different l are degenerate (same energy). Therefore, a transition from n=3, l=0 to n=3, l=1 would require no energy change, which is not possible because the photon emitted must carry away energy. Therefore, such a transition is not allowed. Hence, the intermediate state must have a lower n. So the only possible path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0. 

Therefore, the intermediate state is n=2, l=1, and m can be -1, 0, +1. However, the transition probabilities might depend on the m values. But since the initial m is 0, the first transition can go to m = -1, 0, +1. Then from each of those m's, the second transition has to go back to m=0. 

But the problem is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. Since m can be different in the intermediate state, the total probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate m states. But maybe the question just wants the route through a specific m? Or the total probability considering all possible m's?

Let me recall that in dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For hydrogen atom states, the dipole matrix elements depend on the integrals involving the radial part and the angular part. The angular part is given by the spherical harmonics. For a transition from l=0 to l=1, the angular integral is non-zero only if the change in m is 0, ±1, which is already part of the selection rules. 

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has spherical harmonic Y_0^0. The intermediate state after the first transition is |n=2,l=1,m⟩. The spherical harmonic for the intermediate state is Y_1^m. The dipole operator has components proportional to r times spherical harmonics of degree 1 (since the dipole moment is a vector operator, which transforms as a spherical tensor of rank 1). Therefore, the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only if m = -1, 0, +1, and the angular part integral is non-zero. 

Then, the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Similarly, the matrix element ⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩ must be non-zero. For this, the change in l is from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, allowed. The change in m must be 0, ±1. Since the final m is 0, the initial m in the intermediate state must be m = 0, +1, or -1. So for the second transition, if the intermediate state has m=0, then the final m=0 requires Δm=0; if intermediate has m=1, then Δm=-1; if intermediate has m=-1, then Δm=+1. All these are allowed. 

However, the total transition probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate m states. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (since l=0, m=0), the transition probabilities to each intermediate m should be the same due to symmetry. Therefore, the total probability would involve summing over m=-1,0,+1. 

But the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". Maybe it's considering each possible route through different m's and their probabilities, but perhaps in the standard case, since the initial and final states have m=0, the dominant path might be through m=0? Or maybe it's considering all possible paths and adding their probabilities. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the possible intermediate states (n=2, l=1) regardless of m, and the total probability is the sum over all m. 

Let me think about the probabilities. The probability for each two-step process is the product of the probabilities for each step, right? So first, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. The total amplitude is the sum over all intermediate m of the product of the two amplitudes. But since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ and the final is |1,0,0⟩, which are both spherically symmetric, the total amplitude should be the same for all m, and we can sum the probabilities. 

Alternatively, since the dipole transitions have different matrix elements for different m, but due to the spherical symmetry, the sum over all m would give a total probability that's isotropic. 

But maybe the problem is simplified, and the route is just specified as going through the n=2, l=1 state, and the probability is calculated considering all possible m contributions. 

Alternatively, maybe the intermediate state is specified with a particular m, but since the initial and final m are both 0, the transition through m=0 would be the only one that contributes? Wait, no. Because the dipole operator has components that can change m by 0, ±1. So from m=0 in the initial state, the first transition can go to m=-1,0,+1. Then, from each of those m's, the second transition can go to m=0 by changing m appropriately. For example, from m=1, you can go to m=0 by Δm=-1; from m=-1, you can go to m=0 by Δm=+1; and from m=0, you can stay at m=0. Therefore, all three intermediate m states contribute to the total transition amplitude. 

However, when you calculate the total transition probability, you have to consider the interference between different paths. But in this case, since the intermediate states with different m are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path. 

So the total probability would be the sum over m=-1,0,+1 of |⟨1,0,0| d |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| d |3,0,0⟩|², where d is the dipole operator. But actually, the amplitude is ⟨1,0,0| d |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| d |3,0,0⟩, and the total amplitude is the sum over m. Then the probability is the square of the absolute value of the total amplitude. 

But perhaps due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the sum over m can be simplified. Alternatively, since the initial and final states are both spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the total amplitude must be the same regardless of the direction, so the sum over m would result in an isotropic transition. 

But maybe there's a simpler way to compute the total probability. Let's recall that the dipole matrix element between states |n,l,m⟩ and |n',l',m'⟩ is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m, m ±1. The actual matrix element can be written as a product of a radial integral and an angular integral. 

For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the radial integral is ∫ R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr (since the dipole operator is proportional to r), and the angular integral is ∫ Y_{1}^m* (θ,φ) Y_{0}^0 (θ,φ) cosθ sinθ dθ dφ (if we consider the z-component of the dipole, for example). Wait, actually, the dipole operator has components proportional to x, y, z, which correspond to spherical harmonics of order 1. So the angular integral would involve Y_{1}^m. 

But the angular integral for ⟨Y_{1}^m | Y_{1}^k | Y_{0}^0⟩, where Y_{1}^k corresponds to the dipole component. Wait, the dipole operator in spherical coordinates is proportional to r times the vector spherical harmonics, which can be expressed in terms of Y_{1}^m. So the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_{1}^m* (θ,φ) times r times Y_{0}^0 (θ,φ). But since Y_{0}^0 is a constant (1/√(4π)), the angular part becomes integrating Y_{1}^m* times (x, y, z components) over the sphere. 

Actually, the dipole operator components can be written as r times spherical harmonics. Specifically, the position vector components can be expressed in terms of Y_{1}^m:

x = r sinθ cosφ = r √(2π/3) (Y_{1}^{-1} - Y_{1}^{1})

y = r sinθ sinφ = r i √(2π/3) (Y_{1}^{-1} + Y_{1}^{1})

z = r cosθ = r √(4π/3) Y_{1}^0

Therefore, the dipole matrix elements involve the integral of Y_{l'}^m'* times Y_{1}^k times Y_{l}^m, which is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m +k. 

In our case, the initial state is Y_{0}^0. So for the first transition, the dipole operator (any component) will couple Y_{0}^0 to Y_{1}^m. The angular integral ∫ Y_{1}^m* Y_{1}^k Y_{0}^0 dΩ. Since Y_{0}^0 is 1/√(4π), this becomes 1/√(4π) ∫ Y_{1}^m* Y_{1}^k dΩ. Which is 1/√(4π) δ_{m,k}. Therefore, the angular integral is non-zero only if m=k. But the dipole components are proportional to Y_{1}^{-1}, Y_{1}^0, Y_{1}^1. So for each component of the dipole (x, y, z), the angular integral will pick out the corresponding m. 

Therefore, the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| x |3,0,0⟩ is proportional to δ_{m, -1} - δ_{m, 1}, and similarly for y and z. But the z-component would be proportional to δ_{m,0}. Therefore, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is possible only for m=-1,0,+1, depending on the dipole component. However, when considering all possible polarizations of the emitted photon (i.e., summing over all dipole components), the total transition rate would involve summing over m=-1,0,+1. 

Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole matrix element would involve integrating Y_{0}^0* (which is 1/√(4π)) times Y_{1}^k (from the dipole component) times Y_{1}^m. The integral becomes 1/√(4π) ∫ Y_{1}^k Y_{1}^m dΩ = 1/√(4π) δ_{k,m}. Therefore, for each dipole component k, the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m=k. 

Therefore, combining both transitions, the total amplitude would be the sum over m of ⟨1,0,0| d |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| d |3,0,0⟩. Each term in the sum is non-zero only if the dipole component in the first transition matches m, and the dipole component in the second transition matches m. However, since we are considering spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any polarization, so we need to sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., all dipole components). 

Alternatively, the total transition rate is proportional to the sum over all possible intermediate m and dipole components. But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way using the fact that the overall transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via a two-photon process would have a rate that is the product of the rates for each step, but actually, since it's a two-photon emission, the process is a second-order process in time-dependent perturbation theory. 

Wait, but the problem says "decays via two dipole transitions", which I think means two successive electric dipole transitions, emitting two photons. But wait, no—the question says "decays to the state |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions". Wait, but a decay via two dipole transitions would involve emitting two photons, right? Because each dipole transition corresponds to emitting one photon. However, in hydrogen, transitions usually emit one photon. But if a direct transition is forbidden, then a two-photon process can occur, but that's a second-order process. However, the problem says "two dipole transitions", which might mean two successive electric dipole transitions, which would require an intermediate state. 

Wait, but in hydrogen, the lifetime of excited states is such that transitions occur quickly, but if the direct transition is forbidden by selection rules, the atom may undergo a two-photon emission. However, in this case, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden for a single dipole transition because Δl=0, so it must go via two dipole transitions, meaning two photons are emitted. But the problem might be considering a cascade decay: first, |3,0,0⟩ emits a photon to go to an intermediate state, then emits another photon to go to |1,0,0⟩. 

In that case, the intermediate state must have l=1, as we discussed. The possible intermediate states are either n=2, l=1 or n=3, l=1. But as I thought earlier, transitioning within the same n is not possible because the energy difference is zero in non-relativistic theory, so no photon is emitted. Therefore, the intermediate state must have n=2, l=1. So the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. 

Now, the probability for each step can be calculated using the dipole transition rates. The total probability would be the product of the probabilities for each step, but actually, since the intermediate state is a real state, the total rate is determined by the rates of each step. However, in reality, the total decay rate would be dominated by the slowest step, but since both are dipole transitions, they are both allowed. 

But the problem asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. So maybe we just need to specify the route via |2,1,m⟩ and state that the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. 

Alternatively, since the problem might be asking for the most probable route, which would be the one with the largest matrix elements. The radial part of the dipole matrix element for the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 is given by the integral of R_{2,1}(r) * r * R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly, for the transition from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0, it's the integral of R_{1,0}(r) * r * R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. 

The radial wave functions for hydrogen are known. For example, R_{n,l}(r) is proportional to (r/a)^l e^{-r/(n a)} L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}(2r/(n a)), where a is the Bohr radius. 

Calculating these integrals might be complicated, but perhaps there's a selection rule or a known result for these matrix elements. 

Alternatively, the transition probability is proportional to (n² - n'²)/(n² n'²) or something like that, but I need to recall the exact formula. 

Alternatively, the dipole matrix element squared is proportional to (n² - l (l +1)) or something else. Wait, I think the dipole matrix elements for hydrogen can be expressed in terms of the quantum numbers. 

For example, the radial integral for the transition from n=3, l=0 to n'=2, l'=1. The radial integral ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr. Similarly for the other transition. 

But without calculating the exact integral, perhaps we can note that the transition from 3,0 to 2,1 is allowed and has a certain probability, and from 2,1 to 1,0 is also allowed. The total probability would be the product of the probabilities for each transition. 

Alternatively, the problem might just want the route specified as 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0 and state that the probability is the product of the individual probabilities, but since the problem mentions "the corresponding probability", maybe we need to write it in terms of the hydrogen atom parameters. 

However, given that this is a non-relativistic H-atom, and using standard dipole transition probabilities, the probability for a transition from n to n' is proportional to (1/n^3 - 1/n'^3) or something else. Wait, the spontaneous emission rate for a dipole transition is given by the Einstein A coefficient, which is proportional to ω^3 |⟨f| r |i⟩|², where ω is the transition frequency. 

For hydrogen, the Einstein A coefficient for a transition from n to n' can be calculated, but it's complicated. However, in this case, since we have two transitions, the total A coefficient would be the product of the A coefficients for each step, but actually, no—the total decay rate would be determined by the sum of the decay rates for each possible path. 

But perhaps the problem is more conceptual and just wants the route through the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ and the probability being non-zero. But I need to check. 

Alternatively, maybe the transition can go through any of the m states, and the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each m. However, due to the spherical symmetry, the sum over all m would give a factor of 3, since there are three possible m values (-1,0,+1). 

But to compute the exact probability, we need to calculate the matrix elements. Let's attempt to do that. 

First, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩. The dipole matrix element is ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩. The position vector r can be expressed in terms of spherical components as r = (x, y, z), which correspond to spherical harmonics of order 1. The matrix element will have a radial part and an angular part. 

The angular part for ⟨2,1,m| x |3,0,0⟩, ⟨2,1,m| y |3,0,0⟩, ⟨2,1,m| z |3,0,0⟩. 

As mentioned earlier, the angular integrals for each component are proportional to δ_{m,1}, δ_{m,-1}, δ_{m,0}} respectively, up to constants. 

For example, the z-component (which is proportional to Y_1^0) will give a non-zero integral only if m=0. Similarly, x and y components (proportional to Y_1^1 and Y_1^{-1}) will give non-zero integrals for m=1 and m=-1. 

Therefore, the matrix elements for each component are non-zero only for specific m. However, when considering all polarizations (summing over x, y, z), the total transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ summed over all m would be the sum of the squares of each component's matrix element. 

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total transition probability to all possible |2,1,m⟩ states should be the same for each m. Therefore, the probability for the first transition is the same for each m, and there are three possible m states. 

Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the same logic applies. The dipole matrix elements will depend on m, but the total probability summed over all m would again consider all three possibilities. 

However, when calculating the total two-step transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, we need to consider the sum over all intermediate m states. The total amplitude is the sum over m of the product of the amplitudes for each step. 

But since the different m pathways are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each pathway. Therefore, the total probability is 3 times the probability of a single pathway (through a specific m). 

But actually, wait—the amplitude for each pathway is ⟨1,0,0| d |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| d |3,0,0⟩. Then the total amplitude is the sum over m of these terms. The total probability is |sum_m amplitudes|^2. However, if the different m terms are coherent, they might interfere. But since the intermediate states |2,1,m⟩ are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum of |amplitude|^2 for each m. Therefore, there is no interference, and the total probability is the sum over m of |⟨1,0,0| d |2,1,m⟩|^2 |⟨2,1,m| d |3,0,0⟩|^2. 

But in reality, the dipole operator components for different m are orthogonal, so the sum over m would just be the product of the total transition probabilities for the first and second steps, summed over intermediate m. 

However, this is getting too detailed. Given that this is a problem likely expecting a conceptual answer, the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ for m=-1,0,+1, and the total probability is proportional to the product of the individual probabilities for each transition, summed over all m. 

But to write the probability, we might need to use the fact that the dipole matrix element squared for a transition from n=3 to n=2 is a certain value, and from n=2 to n=1 is another. However, without specific radial integrals, it's hard to give a numerical probability. 

Alternatively, the problem might be referring to the fact that the two-step process has a certain probability relative to a single-step process, but since the single-step process is forbidden, the two-step is the only way. 

Wait, but the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are". So maybe it wants the route as 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0 and the probability as some expression. But I think the probability is generally given by the product of the Einstein coefficients for each transition, but since both are dipole transitions, the total rate would be something like A_32 * A_21, but integrated over the appropriate photon energies. 

Alternatively, since the lifetime for each transition is additive, but I think in multi-photon processes, the total rate is more complex. However, in this case, it's two successive one-photon emissions, so the total rate would be determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio for the second transition. 

But perhaps the problem is more about stating that the transition must go through l=1 and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step. 

Given that I'm supposed to provide the transition route and the probability, and the problem mentions "use latex", I think the answer is that the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. 

Alternatively, since the intermediate m can be -1,0,+1, the total probability is three times the probability of a single m=0 path. But I need to check standard formulas. 

Wait, in the case of the hydrogen atom, the transition rate from a state |n,l,m⟩ to |n',l',m'⟩ via dipole radiation is given by:

A_{n,l→n',l'} = \frac{4}{3} \frac{e^2 \omega^3}{\hbar c^3} \frac{1}{2l + 1} \sum_{m,m'} |⟨n',l',m'| r |n,l,m⟩|^2

But since the initial state here is |3,0,0⟩, and the first transition is to |2,1,m⟩, the rate would be summed over m. Then the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would also be summed over m. 

However, the total two-photon emission rate would involve the product of the rates for each step. But actually, the total rate is more complicated because it's a cascade process. The atom first decays from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ with a rate A_{3,0→2,1}, then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ with rate A_{2,1→1,0}. The total rate for the two-step process would be the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio that the second transition occurs. 

But the branching ratio for the second transition is A_{2,1→1,0} divided by the total decay rate of the |2,1,m⟩ state. However, in hydrogen, the |2,1,m⟩ state can decay to |1,0,0⟩ and also to other lower states if they exist, but since n=2 can only decay to n=1. So the total decay rate of |2,1,m⟩ is just A_{2,1→1,0}. Therefore, the total rate for the two-step process is A_{3,0→2,1} multiplied by A_{2,1→1,0} divided by the total decay rate of |2,1,m⟩, which is A_{2,1→1,0}. Therefore, the rate would be A_{3,0→2,1} * (A_{2,1→1,0} / A_{2,1→1,0}) ) = A_{3,0→2,1}. Wait, that doesn't make sense. 

Actually, in cascade decays, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition, and once the atom is in the intermediate state, it then decays with its own rate. The probability of the entire process is the product of the probabilities of each step. However, in terms of the total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via the intermediate state, it's given by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the probability that the second transition occurs. But since the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ with 100% probability (since there are no other lower states with l=0 for n=1), the total rate is just the rate of the first transition. 

But this contradicts because the total rate should depend on both transitions. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that the total decay rate for a cascade process is the minimum of the two rates, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the mean lifetime of the |3,0,0⟩ state is τ_1 = 1/A_{3,0→2,1}, and the mean lifetime of the |2,1,m⟩ state is τ_2 = 1/A_{2,1→1,0}. The total mean lifetime for the two-step process would be τ_1 + τ_2, but the total decay rate is 1/(τ_1 + τ_2). 

However, I think this is beyond the scope of the problem. The problem likely expects recognizing that the transition must go through the |2,1,m⟩ state and that the probability is the product of the probabilities for each dipole transition. 

Since the problem mentions "the corresponding probability", and in the absence of specific radial integrals, the answer is likely expressed in terms of the matrix elements squared. 

Therefore, the transition route is |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle for m = -1, 0, +1, and the total probability is proportional to the sum over m of | \langle 2,1,m| \mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle |^2 | \langle 1,0,0| \mathbf{r} |2,1,m\rangle |^2. 

But since the problem might want a specific probability expression, perhaps using the known matrix elements for hydrogen. 

The dipole matrix element for a transition from n to n' in hydrogen is given by:

| \langle n',l' | r | n,l \rangle |^2 = \left( \frac{2^{2l' + 1} (l')!}{(2l' + 1)!} \right) \left( \frac{n'!}{(n' - l' - 1)!} \right)^2 \left( \frac{(n + l)!}{(n - l - 1)!} \right) \left( \frac{a_0}{Z} \right)^2 \left( \frac{4 n n'}{(n - n')^2} \right)^{l' + 1} }

But this seems too complex. Alternatively, for hydrogen, the dipole matrix elements between states with l and l' = l ±1 are non-zero and have known values. 

For example, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1: 

The radial integral can be calculated using the standard hydrogen wavefunctions. The radial wavefunction for n=3, l=0 is:

R_{3,0}(r) = \frac{2}{3^{3/2} a_0^{3/2}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a_0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a_0^2}\right) e^{-r/(3a_0)}

And for n=2, l=1:

R_{2,1}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{24} a_0^{3/2}} \left(\frac{r}{a_0}\right) e^{-r/(2a_0)}

The dipole matrix element radial part is ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r^2 dr = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr

This integral can be evaluated, but it's quite involved. However, perhaps there's a selection rule or a known result. 

Alternatively, using the formula for the dipole matrix elements in hydrogen, which states that the non-zero matrix elements occur for Δl = ±1 and the radial integral is non-zero. The strength of the transition can be found in tables or derived using recursion relations. 

But given the time constraints, I think the problem expects acknowledging that the transition route is through the |2,1,m⟩ state and the probability is non-zero, calculated as the product of the probabilities for each step. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

The transition route is |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle for m = -1, 0, +1, and the total probability is proportional to the sum of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. In standard notation, this is often expressed as a product of the individual transition probabilities, summed over all intermediate m states. The probability is given by:

P \propto \sum_{m=-1}^{1} | \langle 2,1,m| \mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle |^2 | \langle 1,0,0| \mathbf{r} |2,1,m\rangle |^2

However, due to the spherical symmetry of the s-states, this sum simplifies to a single term multiplied by 3 (for the three m values), leading to:

P \propto 3 | \langle 2,1,0| z |3,0,0\rangle |^2 | \langle 1,0,0| z |2,1,0\rangle |^2

But since the exact radial integrals require detailed calculation, the answer is typically left in terms of the matrix elements. However, if we use the known oscillator strengths or transition rates for hydrogen, the probability can be expressed as:

P \propto \left( \frac{2^{8} 3^{5}}{5^{5}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2^{5}} \right) \propto \frac{2^{8} 3^{5}}{5^{5} 2^{5}}} = \frac{2^{3} 3^{5}}{5^{5}} = \frac{8 \cdot 243}{3125} = \frac{1944}{3125}

But this is speculative. Alternatively, the standard probability for the transition from 3s to 2p is a known value, and from 2p to 1s is another known value. Multiplying them gives the total probability. 

However, without specific values provided in the problem, the answer should likely state the route and note that the probability is the product of the individual dipole transition probabilities. 

But given that the problem is from a textbook or exam, there's probably a standard answer. For example, the transition route is |3,0,0\rangle → |2,1,0\rangle → |1,0,0\rangle, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. 

Alternatively, since the angular parts integrate to 1/√(4π) for the first transition and similarly for the second, the total probability involves the radial integrals squared. 

But I think the key points are:

1. The transition must go through an intermediate state with l=1, hence n=2, l=1.

2. The probability involves the product of the dipole matrix elements for each step.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The transition route is |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle, and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for the transitions |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle and |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle. 

But since the problem might expect a specific multiplicative factor due to summing over m, the probability is three times the square of a single matrix element product. 

Given that, the answer is:

The transition route is |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle with m = -1, 0, +1, and the total probability is three times the square of the dipole matrix element product for each m. 

But to write it in LaTeX:

The transition route is \( |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle \) for \( m = -1, 0, +1 \), and the corresponding probability is proportional to \( \sum_{m=-1}^{1} | \langle 2,1,m| \mathbf{d} |3,0,0\rangle \langle 1,0,0| \mathbf{d} |2,1,m\rangle |^2 \), where \( \mathbf{d} \) is the dipole operator.

However, given that the problem might want a more concise answer, perhaps specifying the route through the intermediate p-state and stating the probability as non-zero. 

Considering all this, the most precise answer within standard notation and knowledge is:

The transition occurs via the intermediate state \( |2,1,0\rangle \), and the probability is proportional to the product of the squared dipole matrix elements for the transitions \( |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \) and \( |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle \).

But given that all m components contribute, the sum over m gives a factor of 3. Hence, the probability is three times the square of a single matrix element product.

But without explicit radial integrals, we can't write a numerical probability. Therefore, the answer is the route through \( |2,1,m\rangle \) and the probability is the sum over m of the individual probabilities, which is three times that for a single m.

**Final Answer**
The transition route is \boxed{|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle} and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the dipole transition probabilities for each step.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem about the hydrogen atom where a state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the transition route and the corresponding probability. Let me start by recalling what dipole transitions are. 

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon. The dipole transition rules say that the change in angular momentum quantum numbers must follow Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for a dipole transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can stay the same or change by ±1. 

The initial state here is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the transition happens via two dipole steps, there must be an intermediate state. So the electron can't go directly from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ in one step because that would require l to change by 0 (from 0 to 0), which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. Therefore, it has to go through an intermediate state with l=1, right? Because starting from l=0, the only possible change is to l=1. 

So the first transition would be from |3,0,0⟩ to some state with n=2 or n=3 (since the principal quantum number can change in transitions, but wait, no—the principal quantum number can change by any amount, but the energy difference determines the probability. However, in dipole transitions, the selection rules are about l and m, not n. So maybe the intermediate state could be in n=2 or n=3? Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So the first transition would be from n=3, l=0 to some n', l'=1, and then from there to n=1, l=0. But n' has to be between 3 and 1? Wait, but if it's decaying, it's going from higher energy to lower energy. So first step: n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1? But the angular momentum must change accordingly.

Wait, let's think again. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. To make a dipole transition, the first step must go to a state with l=1. So possible intermediate states would have l=1. The principal quantum number n can be anything, but since we're decaying, the energy should decrease each time. So the first transition could be from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. That seems plausible. Let me check the m values. The initial m is 0. In the first transition, since Δm can be 0, ±1, so the intermediate state could have m = -1, 0, +1. Then from there, transitioning to |1,0,0⟩ which has m=0. So the second transition must have Δm = 0 if the intermediate has m=0, or Δm = +1 if intermediate has m=-1, or Δm = -1 if intermediate has m=+1. But the final m is 0. So the possible intermediate m's are 0, 1, or -1, but in the second transition, you have to get back to m=0. 

Wait, but the problem says the decay is from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So the route must go through a state with l=1. Let's confirm the possible intermediate states. The first transition must be from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. The principal quantum number for the intermediate state could be n=2 or n=3? But if it's n=3, then after that, going to n=1 would require another dipole transition. However, if the intermediate state is n=3, l=1, then going to n=1, l=0 would require l to change from 1 to 0, which is allowed (Δl = -1). But would that be a dipole transition? Yes, because Δl = ±1. So both steps would be allowed. But wait, but if the electron is in n=3, l=1, can it transition directly to n=1, l=0? The selection rules allow it, but does the energy difference matter? The transition probability depends on the matrix element, which might not be zero. However, the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So maybe the path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0. Or 3,0,0 → 3,1,m → 1,0,0. Which one is more probable? 

I think the energy levels are such that transitions between higher n to lower n are more probable when the energy difference is larger, but in terms of selection rules, both paths might be possible. However, typically, in such problems, the intermediate state is the one with the next lower n. So maybe the standard path is 3→2→1. Let me check.

But wait, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Both steps satisfy Δl = ±1. Alternatively, could you go from n=3, l=0 to n=3, l=1, and then from n=3, l=1 to n=1, l=0? But that would require the electron to first change l without changing n, which is possible via a transition, but in reality, the photon emitted would have very low energy (since the energy difference between l states within the same n is much smaller, especially in non-relativistic theory where l states are degenerate). Wait, but in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, states with the same n but different l are degenerate (same energy). Therefore, a transition from n=3, l=0 to n=3, l=1 would require no energy change, which is not possible because the photon emitted must carry away energy. Therefore, such a transition is not allowed. Hence, the intermediate state must have a lower n. So the only possible path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0. 

Therefore, the intermediate state is n=2, l=1, and m can be -1, 0, +1. However, the transition probabilities might depend on the m values. But since the initial m is 0, the first transition can go to m = -1, 0, +1. Then from each of those m's, the second transition has to go back to m=0. 

But the problem is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. Since m can be different in the intermediate state, the total probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate m states. But maybe the question just wants the route through a specific m? Or the total probability considering all possible m's?

Let me recall that in dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For hydrogen atom states, the dipole matrix elements depend on the integrals involving the radial part and the angular part. The angular part is given by the spherical harmonics. For a transition from l=0 to l=1, the angular integral is non-zero only if the change in m is 0, ±1, which is already part of the selection rules. 

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has spherical harmonic Y_0^0. The intermediate state after the first transition is |n=2,l=1,m⟩. The spherical harmonic for the intermediate state is Y_1^m. The dipole operator has components proportional to r times spherical harmonics of degree 1 (since the dipole moment is a vector operator, which transforms as a spherical tensor of rank 1). Therefore, the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only if m = -1, 0, +1, and the angular part integral is non-zero. 

Then, the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Similarly, the matrix element ⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩ must be non-zero. For this, the change in l is from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, allowed. The change in m must be 0, ±1. Since the final m is 0, the initial m in the intermediate state must be m = 0, +1, or -1. So for the second transition, if the intermediate state has m=0, then the final m=0 requires Δm=0; if intermediate has m=1, then Δm=-1; if intermediate has m=-1, then Δm=+1. All these are allowed. 

However, the total transition probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate m states. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (since l=0, m=0), the transition probabilities to each intermediate m should be the same due to symmetry. Therefore, the total probability would involve summing over m=-1,0,+1. 

But the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability". Maybe it's considering each possible route through different m's and their probabilities, but perhaps in the standard case, since the initial and final states have m=0, the dominant path might be through m=0? Or maybe it's considering all possible paths and adding their probabilities. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the possible intermediate states (n=2, l=1) regardless of m, and the total probability is the sum over all m. 

Let me think about the probabilities. The probability for each two-step process is the product of the probabilities for each step, right? So first, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. The total amplitude is the sum over all intermediate m of the product of the two amplitudes. But since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ and the final is |1,0,0⟩, which are both spherically symmetric, the total amplitude should be the same for all m, and we can sum the probabilities. 

Alternatively, since the dipole tran

In this hydrogen atom problem, I'm looking at a state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions, and need to determine the transition path and probability.

Recalling dipole transition rules, electrons transitioning between energy levels emit or absorb photons with selection rules of Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has quantum numbers n=3, l=0, m=0, while the final state |1,0,0⟩ has n=1, l=0, m=0.

Since we can't go directly from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (as this would mean Δl = 0, violating the selection rule), we need an intermediate state. From l=0, we must transition to l=1 in the first step.

When considering decay processes, energy should decrease with each transition, meaning n should decrease. The transition from n=3, l=0 to n=3, l=1 wouldn't be viable because in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, states with the same n but different l are degenerate, meaning no energy would be released.

Therefore, the intermediate state must have a lower principal quantum number. The most probable path would be: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

For the intermediate magnetic quantum number m, the possibilities are -1, 0, or +1. Starting with m=0, we could transition to any of these values, and then from each of these, we'd need to return to m=0 in the final state.

The transition probability is proportional to |⟨f|r|i⟩|², involving integrals of the radial part and angular part (spherical harmonics). For transitions between |3,0,0⟩ and |2,1,m⟩, and then between |2,1,m⟩ and |1,0,0⟩, the matrix elements must be non-zero.

Since the initial and final states are spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the transition probabilities to each intermediate m value should be equal due to symmetry. The total probability would involve summing over all intermediate states with m=-1, 0, and +1, with the probability for each two-step process being the product of the individual step probabilities.

Sure, here's the paraphrased text:

I have a problem involving a hydrogen atom where a state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions, and I need to determine the transition path and the probability associated with it. Let's start by reviewing dipole transitions: in a hydrogen atom, an electron emits or absorbs a photon when it transitions between energy levels. The rules for dipole transitions specify that the change in angular momentum quantum numbers must satisfy Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Hence, during a dipole transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can remain the same or vary by ±1.

For this problem, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, indicating n=3, l=0, and m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, with n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the transition involves two dipole steps, there must be an intermediate state, as going directly from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would require l to remain unchanged, violating the Δl = ±1 rule. Hence, the intermediate state must have l=1 because starting from l=0, the only viable change is to l=1.

The first transition has to be from |3,0,0⟩ to an n=2 or n=3 state, where l=1. Considering that the decay involves going from higher energy to lower energy, the transitions should be n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1, with appropriate changes in angular momentum.

Re-examining this, the initial state |3,0,0⟩ transitions first to an intermediate state with l=1. The principal quantum number n can vary, but as energy should decrease with each step, the path could be from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, then to |1,0,0⟩. The first step changes l from 0 to 1, the second changes it back to 0, satisfying Δl = ±1 each time.

For the magnetic quantum number, the initial m is 0. During the first transition, Δm can be 0, ±1, making possible intermediate m values -1, 0, +1. The final state is m=0, thus the second transition requires Δm adjusted accordingly: 0 if intermediate m=0, -1 if m=+1, and +1 if m=-1. Therefore, the intermediate m can be any of -1, 0, or +1, provided it correctly results in m=0 ultimately.

Considering the possible transitions, since the intermediate state must have a different quantum number n, it should reasonably decrease. Therefore, the intermediate state should likely be n=2, l=1, with m values that enable transitioning back to m=0 in the final state, matching the criteria.

In summary, the transition path is |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. The total transition probability is the sum of probabilities for each possible intermediate m state, given the spherical symmetry of the initial and final states.

The dipole transition probability from a state |n,l,m⟩ to |n\',l\',m\'⟩ is proportional to |⟨n\',l\',m\'| r |n,l,m⟩|². For hydrogen, the radial integral is separate from the angular integral. The angular part is given by the integral of Y_{l\'}^{m\'*} (θ,φ) times Y_1^q (θ,φ) times Y_l^m (θ,φ), where q corresponds to the component of the dipole (x, y, z). The angular integral is non-zero only if l\' = l ± 1 and m\' = m + q, where q = -1, 0, +1. \n\nBut in the case of spontaneous emission, the total transition rate is given by the sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., sum over q = -1, 0, +1). So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the transition rate would be proportional to the sum over q |⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩|², where r_q are the spherical components of the position vector. Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the transition rate is proportional to the sum over q\' |⟨1,0,0| r_{q\'} |2,1,m⟩|². \n\nBut since we\'re dealing with a two-step process, the total probability is not simply the product of the probabilities of each step. Wait, actually, in time-dependent perturbation theory, the probability amplitude for a two-photon process is given by the sum over intermediate states of the product of the amplitudes for each step. However, in this case, since the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions, it\'s a cascade process: first emitting one photon to go to the intermediate state, then emitting another photon to go to the final state. Therefore, the total transition rate would be the product of the transition rates for each step, but considering all possible intermediate states. \n\nBut actually, in cascade transitions, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the rate of the second transition. However, since the intermediate state has a finite lifetime, the calculation might involve some convolution, but perhaps for simplicity, we can consider the overall probability as proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be asking for the transition route, i.e., the sequence of states, and the corresponding probability, which would be the product of the probabilities for each transition. But probabilities in quantum mechanics for sequential processes multiply the probabilities (not the amplitudes), assuming they are independent. However, in reality, the process is a two-photon emission, and the total amplitude is a coherent sum over all possible intermediate states and photon emissions. But maybe in this context, since it\'s a decay process, it\'s treated as two successive dipole transitions, each with their own probability. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, it can transition to any |2,1,m⟩ with m = -1, 0, +1. Then, each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩. Therefore, the total transition probability is the sum over m of the probability to go from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ times the probability to go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. \n\nTo compute this, we need the transition probabilities for each step. Let\'s recall that for electric dipole transitions, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |⟨n\', l\' | r | n, l ⟩|², multiplied by some factors depending on the photon frequency. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can consider the relative probabilities. \n\nFirst, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩. The radial integral here is ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩. The angular integral is ⟨Y_1^m | Y_1^q | Y_0^0 ⟩, where q corresponds to the dipole component. Since Y_0^0 is a constant (1/√(4π)), the angular integral becomes proportional to ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q Y_0^0 dΩ. But Y_0^0 is 1/√(4π), so this integral is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q dΩ. This is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the angular integral is non-zero only when m = q. Therefore, for each m, the angular part is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}, but since the dipole operator has components q = -1, 0, +1, the amplitude for each m is proportional to δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is non-zero only for m = q, which are -1, 0, +1. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total transition rate to all m states should be the same. \n\nBut actually, the transition rate for each polarization (q) is different. Wait, but in spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any polarization, and the total transition rate is the sum over all polarizations. So for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the rate is the sum over q of |⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩|². But as we saw earlier, the angular integral is non-zero only when m = q, so each m corresponds to a specific q. Therefore, the rate for each m is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r_m |3,0,0⟩|². However, since the radial integral ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩ is the same for all m (since the radial part doesn\'t depend on m), the transition rate from |3,0,0⟩ to any |2,1,m⟩ is the same. Therefore, the total rate for the first transition is 3 times the rate for a single m (since m = -1, 0, +1). \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the same logic applies. The transition rate for each m is the same, and the total rate is 3 times the rate for a single m. However, when considering the cascade process, the total rate would be the product of the rates for each step? Wait, no, the rates add when they are parallel processes, but in a cascade, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio of the second transition. \n\nAlternatively, the probability for the entire two-step process is the probability of the first transition (from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m) multiplied by the probability of the second transition (from 2,1,m to 1,0,0). But since there are three possible intermediate m states, and the transitions to each are independent, the total probability is the sum over m of the product of the probabilities for each m. \n\nBut if the probability to go from 3,0,0 to any 2,1,m is the same for each m, say P1, and the probability to go from 2,1,m to 1,0,0 is P2 for each m, then the total probability is 3 * P1 * P2. However, if the transition from 2,1,m to 1,0,0 depends on m, then we have to calculate each term. \n\nBut let\'s think about the angular parts. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the angular integral for each m is proportional to δ_{m,q}, so the amplitude for each m is proportional to the radial integral times δ_{m,q}. Then, when we go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the angular integral is similar. The dipole operator component q\' must satisfy m\' = m + q\', where the final m is 0. So m\' = 0 = m + q\' → q\' = -m. Therefore, for each intermediate m, the second transition must involve a dipole component q\' = -m. The angular integral would then be proportional to δ_{-m, q\'}, so the amplitude is proportional to the radial integral times δ_{-m, q\'}. \n\nTherefore, the amplitude for the entire two-step process would be sum over m and q, q\' of ⟨1,0,0| r_{q\'} |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩. But due to the delta functions from the angular integrals, the only non-zero terms are when q = m and q\' = -m. Therefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over m ⟨1,0,0| r_{-m} |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| r_m |3,0,0⟩. \n\nBut since the radial integrals are independent of m, let\'s denote the radial integral for the first step as R1 = ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩ and for the second step as R2 = ⟨1,0| r |2,1⟩. Then, the total amplitude is proportional to R1 * R2 * sum over m [angular part for first transition * angular part for second transition]. \n\nThe angular part for the first transition is ⟨Y_1^m | Y_1^m | Y_0^0 ⟩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^m Y_0^0 dΩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ |Y_1^m|² Y_0^0 dΩ. But Y_0^0 is constant, so this becomes (1/√(4π)) * ∫ |Y_1^m|² dΩ. However, ∫ |Y_1^m|² dΩ = 1, so this term is (1/√(4π)). \n\nWait, but actually, the angular integral for the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩ is proportional to ∫ Y_1^m* (r_q) Y_0^0 dΩ. Since r_q is proportional to Y_1^q, this becomes ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q Y_0^0 dΩ. Since Y_0^0 is 1/√(4π), this integral is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q dΩ = (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the angular part of the first transition is δ_{m,q} / √(4π). Similarly, the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ involves ⟨1,0,0| r_{q\'} |2,1,m⟩, which is proportional to ∫ Y_0^0* Y_1^{q\'} Y_1^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^{q\'} Y_1^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) δ_{m, q\'}. Therefore, the angular part of the second transition is δ_{m, q\'} / √(4π). \n\nTherefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over m, q, q\' [δ_{m,q} δ_{m, q\'} / (4π)] R1 R2. But for the amplitude, we need to sum over intermediate m and sum over the polarization q and q\' (which are the photon directions or polarizations). However, in spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any direction with any polarization, so we need to sum over q and q\' for the two photons. But this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the overall transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole emissions must have a total angular momentum change of 0, since both initial and final states have l=0. Each photon carries away angular momentum 1, so two photons can have total angular momentum 0, 1, or 2. However, since the initial and final angular momentum is 0, the total angular momentum carried away by the photons must be 0. Therefore, the two photons must have their angular momenta coupled to total 0. That would require the two photons to have opposite angular momenta. So the first photon has polarization q, the second has polarization -q. Therefore, the intermediate state must have m = q, and then the second transition must have q\' = -q. Therefore, the sum over m would be equivalent to summing over q, and then q\' = -q. Therefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over q [ (1/√(4π)) δ_{q, q} (1/√(4π)) δ_{-q, q\'} ] R1 R2. Wait, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a simpler way. The transition rate for a two-photon process is generally much smaller than a one-photon process, but in this case, the problem states that it decays via two dipole transitions, so it\'s a two-step process, each step being a dipole transition. Therefore, the total rate is the product of the rates for each step, considering the intermediate state\'s lifetime. However, without specific lifetimes, perhaps the problem is just asking for the transition route and the square of the matrix elements. \n\nIn any case, perhaps the key points are:\n\n1. The transition must go through an intermediate state with l=1. Since from l=0 you can only go to l=1 in the first transition, and then from l=1 to l=0 in the second transition.\n\n2. The principal quantum number n must decrease each time. So the intermediate state is n=2, l=1. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.\n\n3. The probability involves the product of the probabilities for each transition. Since there are three possible m states (-1,0,+1) for the intermediate, the total probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each m.\n\nBut to compute the actual probability, we need the radial integrals. The radial part of the dipole matrix element for hydrogen can be calculated using the known wavefunctions. \n\nThe radial wavefunction for hydrogen is given by R_{n,l}(r) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{n a_0}\\right)^3 \\frac{(n - l - 1)!}{2n (n + l)!}} e^{-r/(n a_0)} \\left(\\frac{2r}{n a_0}\\right)^l L_{n - l - 1}^{2l + 1}\\left(\\frac{2r}{n a_0}\\right), where L are the associated Laguerre polynomials.\n\nThe dipole matrix element ⟨n\', l\' | r | n, l ⟩ is proportional to the integral from 0 to ∞ of R_{n\', l\'}(r) R_{n, l}(r) r^3 dr (since the dipole operator is e r, and we\'re considering the radial part).\n\nFor the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. The radial integral is ⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩.\n\nFor the second transition, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. The radial integral is ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩.\n\nThese integrals can be calculated, but they might be standard. Let me recall some known matrix elements for hydrogen.\n\nThe dipole matrix element ⟨n\', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ is non-zero and can be expressed using the formula involving the quantum numbers. There is a formula for the expectation value or the matrix element, which might be proportional to a0 * some combination of n and n\'.\n\nAlternatively, from selection rules and properties of the hydrogen atom, the non-vanishing dipole matrix elements occur when n\' = n ± 1, but actually, no, the principal quantum number can change by any amount, as long as l changes by ±1. For example, 3s → 2p is allowed, as well as 3s → 4p. However, the radial integral might be zero in some cases due to the orthogonality of the radial functions.\n\nBut in our case, the first transition is 3s → 2p, and the second is 2p → 1s. Both are allowed, and the radial integrals are non-zero.\n\nThe radial integral ⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩:\n\nThe radial functions for 3s (n=3, l=0) and 2p (n=2, l=1).\n\nThe 3s radial wavefunction is:\n\nR_{3,0}(r) = \\frac{2}{3^{3/2} a_0^{3/2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2r}{3a_0} + \\frac{2r^2}{27a_0^2}\\right) e^{-r/(3a_0)}\n\nThe 2p radial wavefunction is:\n\nR_{2,1}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24 a_0^3}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a_0}\\right) e^{-r/(2a_0)}\n\nSo the radial integral is:\n\n⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr\n\nSimilarly, ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) R_{2,1}(r) r^3 dr\n\nThese integrals can be computed, but they might be tedious. Alternatively, there are standard results for dipole matrix elements in hydrogen.\n\nFrom the formula for the dipole matrix elements in hydrogen, the radial part ⟨n\', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ is given by:\n\n⟨n\', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ = \\frac{3}{2} a_0 \\frac{n^{l+1} (n\' - l - 2)!}{\\sqrt{(n + l + 1)! (n\' + l + 1)!}}} \\times ... \n\nWait, perhaps it\'s better to look up the explicit value. Alternatively, recall that for transitions between states, the oscillator strength or the Einstein coefficients can be used. \n\nAlternatively, use recursion relations or known integrals. The integral ∫_0^∞ r^k e^{-α r} dr = k! / α^{k+1} for integer k.\n\nBut the product of the two radial functions will involve terms like e^{-r/(3a0)} * e^{-r/(2a0)} = e^{-r(1/(3a0) + 1/(2a0))} = e^{-r(5/(6a0))}, multiplied by polynomials in r.\n\nFor the first integral, R_{3,0}(r) is:\n\nR_{3,0}(r) = \\frac{2}{(3a0)^{3/2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2r}{3a0} + \\frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\\right) e^{-r/(3a0)}\n\nR_{2,1}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a0}\\right) e^{-r/(2a0)}\n\nSo the product R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 is:\n\n\\frac{2}{(3a0)^{3/2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2r}{3a0} + \\frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\\right) e^{-r/(3a0)} * \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a0}\\right) e^{-r/(2a0)} * r^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n= \\frac{2}{(3^{3/2} a0^{3/2}) \\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2r}{3a0} + \\frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\\right) r^4/a0 e^{-5r/(6a0)} }\n\n= \\frac{2}{3^{3/2} \\sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2r}{3a0} + \\frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\\right) r^4 e^{-5r/(6a0)} }\n\nThis integral can be split into three terms:\n\nTerm 1: ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr\n\nTerm 2: - (2/(3a0)) ∫_0^∞ r^5 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr\n\nTerm 3: (2/(27a0^2)) ∫_0^∞ r^6 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr\n\nEach of these integrals can be evaluated using the gamma function:\n\n∫_0^∞ r^n e^{-α r} dr = n! / α^{n+1}\n\nLet’s compute each term:\n\nLet α = 5/(6a0)\n\nTerm 1: 4! / α^5 = 24 / (5/(6a0))^5 = 24 * (6a0/5)^5\n\nTerm 2: - (2/(3a0)) * 5! / α^6 = - (2/(3a0)) * 120 / (5/(6a0))^6 = - (240/(3a0)) * (6a0/5)^6 = -80/a0 * (6a0/5)^6\n\nTerm 3: (2/(27a0^2)) * 6! / α^7 = (2/(27a0^2)) * 720 / (5/(6a0))^7 = (1440/(27a0^2)) * (6a0/5)^7 = (160/3a0^2) * (6a0/5)^7\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\nIntegral = [24*(6a0/5)^5 - 80/a0*(6a0/5)^6 + 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^7 ] * (2)/(3^{3/2} sqrt(24) a0^{9/2})\n\nLet’s factor out common terms:\n\nFirst, note that (6a0/5)^5 is common in all terms:\n\nTerm 1: 24*(6a0/5)^5\n\nTerm 2: -80/a0*(6a0/5)^6 = -80/a0*(6a0/5)*(6a0/5)^5 = -80*(6/5)*(a0/a0)*(6a0/5)^5 = -80*(6/5)*(6a0/5)^5\n\nTerm 3: 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^7 = 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^2*(6a0/5)^5 = 160/(3a0^2)*(36a0^2/25)*(6a0/5)^5 = 160*36/(3*25)*(a0^2/a0^2)*(6a0/5)^5 = (160*12)/25*(6a0/5)^5 = 1920/25*(6a0/5)^5\n\nTherefore, combining:\n\n24 - 80*(6/5) + 1920/25 = 24 - 96 + 76.8 = (24 - 96) + 76.8 = (-72) + 76.8 = 4.8\n\nBut let me calculate it step by step:\n\nFirst term coefficient: 24\n\nSecond term coefficient: -80*(6/5) = -96\n\nThird term coefficient: 1920/25 = 76.8\n\nTotal coefficient: 24 - 96 + 76.8 = (24 + 76.8) - 96 = 100.8 - 96 = 4.8\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n4.8 * (6a0/5)^5 * (2)/(3^{3/2} sqrt(24) a0^{9/2})\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4.8 = 24/5 = 4.8\n\nSo:\n\n24/5 * (6a0/5)^5 * 2 / (3^{3/2} * sqrt(24) * a0^{9/2})\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nMultiply constants: (24/5) * 2 = 48/5\n\nDenominator constants: 3^{3/2} * sqrt(24) = 3*sqrt(3) * sqrt(24) = 3*sqrt(72) = 3*6*sqrt(2) = 18√2\n\nSo denominator: 18√2 * a0^{9/2}\n\nNumerator: (6a0/5)^5 = 6^5 a0^5 / 5^5 = 7776 a0^5 / 3125\n\nTherefore, numerator total: 48/5 * 7776 a0^5 / 3125 = (48 * 7776) / (5 * 3125) a0^5 = (373,248) / 15,625 a0^5\n\nDenominator: 18√2 * a0^{9/2}\n\nSo the integral is:\n\n(373,248 / 15,625) / (18√2) * a0^5 / a0^{9/2} = (373,248 / (15,625 * 18√2)) * a0^{1/2}\n\nCalculate the numerical coefficient:\n\n373,248 ÷ 15,625 ≈ 23.887\n\n23.887 ÷ 18 ≈ 1.327\n\n1.327 ÷ √2 ≈ 1.327 / 1.414 ≈ 0.938\n\nSo approximately 0.938 * a0^{1/2}\n\nBut this seems rough. However, the exact expression is messy. The key point is that this integral is non-zero, so the transition is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for the second radial integral ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩.\n\nThe 1s radial wavefunction is:\n\nR_{1,0}(r) = 2 a0^{-3/2} e^{-r/a0}\n\nThe 2p radial wavefunction is:\n\nR_{2,1}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a0}\\right) e^{-r/(2a0)}\n\nSo the integral ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) R_{2,1}(r) r^3 dr\n\n= ∫_0^∞ [2 a0^{-3/2} e^{-r/a0}] [1/\\sqrt{24 a0^3} (r/a0) e^{-r/(2a0)}] r^3 dr\n\n= 2 a0^{-3/2} * 1/\\sqrt{24 a0^3} * 1/a0 ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-3r/(2a0)} dr\n\n= 2 / (\\sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}) ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-3r/(2a0)} dr\n\nThe integral ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-α r} dr = 4! / α^5 = 24 / (3/(2a0))^5 = 24 * (2a0/3)^5\n\nTherefore:\n\n= 2 / (\\sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}) * 24 * (2a0/3)^5\n\n= 2 * 24 / \\sqrt{24} * (32 a0^5 / 243) / a0^{9/2}\n\n= (48 / \\sqrt{24}) * (32 / 243) * a0^{5 - 9/2}\n\n= (48 / (2*sqrt(6))) * (32 / 243) * a0^{1/2}\n\n= (24 / sqrt(6)) * (32 / 243) * a0^{1/2}\n\n= (24 * 32) / (sqrt(6) * 243) * a0^{1/2}\n\n= 768 / (243 sqrt(6)) * a0^{1/2}\n\nSimplify:\n\n768 / 243 = 256 / 81 ≈ 3.1605\n\nSo ≈ 3.1605 / sqrt(6) ≈ 3.1605 / 2.449 ≈ 1.29\n\nTherefore, the integral is approximately 1.29 * a0^{1/2}\n\nBut again, the exact value is not crucial for the probability ratio. The key point is that both radial integrals are non-zero, so the transitions are allowed.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. Since we can\'t compute the exact probability without knowing the radial integrals, but in standard problems, often the answer is expressed in terms of the matrix elements or simply states that the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the matrix elements for each step, summed over the intermediate m states.\n\nGiven that there are three possible intermediate m states (-1, 0, +1), and the transition amplitude for each is the same due to rotational symmetry, the total probability would be three times the square of the amplitude for a single m.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a specific route through a particular m, but since the initial and final m are both 0, the dominant contribution might come from the intermediate m=0, but actually, due to the sum over all m, the total probability includes all paths.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions "the transition route", which might refer to the sequence of states regardless of m, so |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² summed over m.\n\nHowever, in reality, the total transition amplitude is a coherent sum over the intermediate states, but since they are different m states, which are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the sum over m |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|². But due to the orthogonality of the m states, this is equal to the sum over m |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|².\n\nBut since each |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² is the same for all m, and each |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² is also the same for all m (due to rotational symmetry), the total probability is 3 * |R1|² |R2|², where R1 and R2 are the radial integrals for the first and second transitions, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ for m = -1, 0, +1, and the probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each individual m path.\n\nHowever, without specific values for the radial integrals, we can\'t give a numerical probability, but the problem might be asking for the expression in terms of the squares of the matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, in many textbooks, the two-photon transition probability is given in terms of the product of the dipole matrix elements divided by the energy denominator, but since this is a cascade transition (two successive dipole emissions), the probability is just the product of the two dipole transition probabilities, multiplied by the number of possible intermediate states (which is 3 here).\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ for m = -1, 0, +1, and the total probability is proportional to 3 times the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition.\n\nBut the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are". Since it\'s a two-step dipole transition, the route is via the intermediate state with n=2, l=1, and the probability is proportional to the sum over all m of the product of the probabilities of each step. Given that each step\'s probability is independent of m, the total probability is 3 times the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, to write the probability explicitly, we need to express it in terms of the matrix elements. The standard expression for the transition probability in dipole approximation is given by the Einstein coefficient A, which is proportional to ω^3 |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For a two-step process, the total A would involve the product of the A coefficients for each step, but considering the intermediate state\'s lifetime. However, this is more involved.\n\nBut since the problem is in the non-relativistic theory, perhaps it\'s sufficient to state that the transition occurs via the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ and the probability is the sum over m of |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|². This can be simplified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the fact that the initial and final states are spherically symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, using the fact that the total transition amplitude is proportional to the sum over m ⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩. Since the initial and final states are spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the sum over m must be isotropic. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to the sum over m of the product of the two matrix elements. \n\nBut due to the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics, this sum can be simplified. Let\'s consider that the dipole operator is a vector operator, so the matrix elements ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩ are proportional to the spherical harmonics Y_1^m, and similarly for the second matrix element. The sum over m would then be proportional to the sum over m Y_1^m Y_1^{m*}, which is the sum over m |Y_1^m|². However, integrating over angles would give 1/(4π) sum over m |Y_1^m|² = 1/(4π) * (3/(4π)) = 3/(4π)^2. But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the closure relation, sum over m |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| = 1, but applied to the dipole operators. However, this might not help directly.\n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent, I think the answer expected here is that the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition, summed over the three possible m values. Therefore, the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is three times the product of the individual transition probabilities.\n\nBut to express this in a formula, the probability P is:\n\nP ∝ ∑_{m=-1}^1 |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|²\n\nSince each |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² is the same for all m, say A, and each |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² is the same, say B, then P = 3AB.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition route is via the intermediate state with n=2, l=1, and the probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each individual transition step. The corresponding probability would then depend on the radial integrals, but in terms of selection rules and the process, this is the route and the proportionality.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe transition route is \\boxed{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle} and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition, summed over all intermediate magnetic quantum numbers.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386832, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8588, prompt_tokens=2367, total_tokens=10955, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state in a hydrogen atom via two dipole transitions. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Dipole Transition Rules**: The selection rules for dipole transitions require that the orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l \) changes by \( \pm 1 \) and the magnetic quantum number \( m \) changes by 0, \( \pm 1 \).

2. **Intermediate State**: The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) must transition to an intermediate state with \( l = 1 \) (since \( \Delta l = \pm 1 \)). The principal quantum number \( n \) must decrease during each transition. The intermediate state is therefore |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1).

3. **Transition Route**: The transition route involves two steps:
   - First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ (where m can be -1, 0, +1)
   - Second transition: |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

4. **Probability Consideration**: The total probability is the sum over all possible intermediate magnetic quantum numbers \( m \). Each transition step's probability is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial and final states, the probabilities for each \( m \) are the same. Therefore, the total probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each individual transition step.

### Final Answer
The transition route is \boxed{|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle} and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition, summed over all intermediate magnetic quantum numbers.

stion elements depend on the direction (i.e., the polarization of the photon), but if we are considering spontaneous emission, the total transition rate is the sum over all possible photon polarizations, which effectively sums over the m values. 

In any case, perhaps the problem is expecting the route through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ for any m, and the total probability is summed over all m. 

But let me check the standard transition probabilities. The dipole transition probability from a state |n,l,m⟩ to |n',l',m'⟩ is proportional to |⟨n',l',m'| r |n,l,m⟩|². For hydrogen, the radial integral is separate from the angular integral. The angular part is given by the integral of Y_{l'}^{m'*} (θ,φ) times Y_1^q (θ,φ) times Y_l^m (θ,φ), where q corresponds to the component of the dipole (x, y, z). The angular integral is non-zero only if l' = l ± 1 and m' = m + q, where q = -1, 0, +1. 

But in the case of spontaneous emission, the total transition rate is given by the sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., sum over q = -1, 0, +1). So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the transition rate would be proportional to the sum over q |⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩|², where r_q are the spherical components of the position vector. Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the transition rate is proportional to the sum over q' |⟨1,0,0| r_{q'} |2,1,m⟩|². 

But since we're dealing with a two-step process, the total probability is not simply the product of the probabilities of each step. Wait, actually, in time-dependent perturbation theory, the probability amplitude for a two-photon process is given by the sum over intermediate states of the product of the amplitudes for each step. However, in this case, since the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions, it's a cascade process: first emitting one photon to go to the intermediate state, then emitting another photon to go to the final state. Therefore, the total transition rate would be the product of the transition rates for each step, but considering all possible intermediate states. 

But actually, in cascade transitions, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the rate of the second transition. However, since the intermediate state has a finite lifetime, the calculation might involve some convolution, but perhaps for simplicity, we can consider the overall probability as proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step. 

Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the transition route, i.e., the sequence of states, and the corresponding probability, which would be the product of the probabilities for each transition. But probabilities in quantum mechanics for sequential processes multiply the probabilities (not the amplitudes), assuming they are independent. However, in reality, the process is a two-photon emission, and the total amplitude is a coherent sum over all possible intermediate states and photon emissions. But maybe in this context, since it's a decay process, it's treated as two successive dipole transitions, each with their own probability. 

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, it can transition to any |2,1,m⟩ with m = -1, 0, +1. Then, each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩. Therefore, the total transition probability is the sum over m of the probability to go from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ times the probability to go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. 

To compute this, we need the transition probabilities for each step. Let's recall that for electric dipole transitions, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |⟨n', l' | r | n, l ⟩|², multiplied by some factors depending on the photon frequency. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can consider the relative probabilities. 

First, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩. The radial integral here is ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩. The angular integral is ⟨Y_1^m | Y_1^q | Y_0^0 ⟩, where q corresponds to the dipole component. Since Y_0^0 is a constant (1/√(4π)), the angular integral becomes proportional to ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q Y_0^0 dΩ. But Y_0^0 is 1/√(4π), so this integral is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q dΩ. This is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the angular integral is non-zero only when m = q. Therefore, for each m, the angular part is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}, but since the dipole operator has components q = -1, 0, +1, the amplitude for each m is proportional to δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is non-zero only for m = q, which are -1, 0, +1. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total transition rate to all m states should be the same. 

But actually, the transition rate for each polarization (q) is different. Wait, but in spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any polarization, and the total transition rate is the sum over all polarizations. So for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the rate is the sum over q of |⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩|². But as we saw earlier, the angular integral is non-zero only when m = q, so each m corresponds to a specific q. Therefore, the rate for each m is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r_m |3,0,0⟩|². However, since the radial integral ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩ is the same for all m (since the radial part doesn't depend on m), the transition rate from |3,0,0⟩ to any |2,1,m⟩ is the same. Therefore, the total rate for the first transition is 3 times the rate for a single m (since m = -1, 0, +1). 

Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the same logic applies. The transition rate for each m is the same, and the total rate is 3 times the rate for a single m. However, when considering the cascade process, the total rate would be the product of the rates for each step? Wait, no, the rates add when they are parallel processes, but in a cascade, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio of the second transition. 

Alternatively, the probability for the entire two-step process is the probability of the first transition (from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m) multiplied by the probability of the second transition (from 2,1,m to 1,0,0). But since there are three possible intermediate m states, and the transitions to each are independent, the total probability is the sum over m of the product of the probabilities for each m. 

But if the probability to go from 3,0,0 to any 2,1,m is the same for each m, say P1, and the probability to go from 2,1,m to 1,0,0 is P2 for each m, then the total probability is 3 * P1 * P2. However, if the transition from 2,1,m to 1,0,0 depends on m, then we have to calculate each term. 

But let's think about the angular parts. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the angular integral for each m is proportional to δ_{m,q}, so the amplitude for each m is proportional to the radial integral times δ_{m,q}. Then, when we go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the angular integral is similar. The dipole operator component q' must satisfy m' = m + q', where the final m is 0. So m' = 0 = m + q' → q' = -m. Therefore, for each intermediate m, the second transition must involve a dipole component q' = -m. The angular integral would then be proportional to δ_{-m, q'}, so the amplitude is proportional to the radial integral times δ_{-m, q'}. 

Therefore, the amplitude for the entire two-step process would be sum over m and q, q' of ⟨1,0,0| r_{q'} |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩. But due to the delta functions from the angular integrals, the only non-zero terms are when q = m and q' = -m. Therefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over m ⟨1,0,0| r_{-m} |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| r_m |3,0,0⟩. 

But since the radial integrals are independent of m, let's denote the radial integral for the first step as R1 = ⟨2,1| r |3,0⟩ and for the second step as R2 = ⟨1,0| r |2,1⟩. Then, the total amplitude is proportional to R1 * R2 * sum over m [angular part for first transition * angular part for second transition]. 

The angular part for the first transition is ⟨Y_1^m | Y_1^m | Y_0^0 ⟩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^m Y_0^0 dΩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ |Y_1^m|² Y_0^0 dΩ. But Y_0^0 is constant, so this becomes (1/√(4π)) * ∫ |Y_1^m|² dΩ. However, ∫ |Y_1^m|² dΩ = 1, so this term is (1/√(4π)). 

Wait, but actually, the angular integral for the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r_q |3,0,0⟩ is proportional to ∫ Y_1^m* (r_q) Y_0^0 dΩ. Since r_q is proportional to Y_1^q, this becomes ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q Y_0^0 dΩ. Since Y_0^0 is 1/√(4π), this integral is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^q dΩ = (1/√(4π)) δ_{m,q}. Therefore, the angular part of the first transition is δ_{m,q} / √(4π). Similarly, the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ involves ⟨1,0,0| r_{q'} |2,1,m⟩, which is proportional to ∫ Y_0^0* Y_1^{q'} Y_1^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y_1^{q'} Y_1^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) δ_{m, q'}. Therefore, the angular part of the second transition is δ_{m, q'} / √(4π). 

Therefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over m, q, q' [δ_{m,q} δ_{m, q'} / (4π)] R1 R2. But for the amplitude, we need to sum over intermediate m and sum over the polarization q and q' (which are the photon directions or polarizations). However, in spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any direction with any polarization, so we need to sum over q and q' for the two photons. But this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the overall transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole emissions must have a total angular momentum change of 0, since both initial and final states have l=0. Each photon carries away angular momentum 1, so two photons can have total angular momentum 0, 1, or 2. However, since the initial and final angular momentum is 0, the total angular momentum carried away by the photons must be 0. Therefore, the two photons must have their angular momenta coupled to total 0. That would require the two photons to have opposite angular momenta. So the first photon has polarization q, the second has polarization -q. Therefore, the intermediate state must have m = q, and then the second transition must have q' = -q. Therefore, the sum over m would be equivalent to summing over q, and then q' = -q. Therefore, the total amplitude is proportional to sum over q [ (1/√(4π)) δ_{q, q} (1/√(4π)) δ_{-q, q'} ] R1 R2. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. The transition rate for a two-photon process is generally much smaller than a one-photon process, but in this case, the problem states that it decays via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process, each step being a dipole transition. Therefore, the total rate is the product of the rates for each step, considering the intermediate state's lifetime. However, without specific lifetimes, perhaps the problem is just asking for the transition route and the square of the matrix elements. 

In any case, perhaps the key points are:

1. The transition must go through an intermediate state with l=1. Since from l=0 you can only go to l=1 in the first transition, and then from l=1 to l=0 in the second transition.

2. The principal quantum number n must decrease each time. So the intermediate state is n=2, l=1. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

3. The probability involves the product of the probabilities for each transition. Since there are three possible m states (-1,0,+1) for the intermediate, the total probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each m.

But to compute the actual probability, we need the radial integrals. The radial part of the dipole matrix element for hydrogen can be calculated using the known wavefunctions. 

The radial wavefunction for hydrogen is given by R_{n,l}(r) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{n a_0}\right)^3 \frac{(n - l - 1)!}{2n (n + l)!}} e^{-r/(n a_0)} \left(\frac{2r}{n a_0}\right)^l L_{n - l - 1}^{2l + 1}\left(\frac{2r}{n a_0}\right), where L are the associated Laguerre polynomials.

The dipole matrix element ⟨n', l' | r | n, l ⟩ is proportional to the integral from 0 to ∞ of R_{n', l'}(r) R_{n, l}(r) r^3 dr (since the dipole operator is e r, and we're considering the radial part).

For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. The radial integral is ⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩.

For the second transition, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. The radial integral is ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩.

These integrals can be calculated, but they might be standard. Let me recall some known matrix elements for hydrogen.

The dipole matrix element ⟨n', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ is non-zero and can be expressed using the formula involving the quantum numbers. There is a formula for the expectation value or the matrix element, which might be proportional to a0 * some combination of n and n'.

Alternatively, from selection rules and properties of the hydrogen atom, the non-vanishing dipole matrix elements occur when n' = n ± 1, but actually, no, the principal quantum number can change by any amount, as long as l changes by ±1. For example, 3s → 2p is allowed, as well as 3s → 4p. However, the radial integral might be zero in some cases due to the orthogonality of the radial functions.

But in our case, the first transition is 3s → 2p, and the second is 2p → 1s. Both are allowed, and the radial integrals are non-zero.

The radial integral ⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩:

The radial functions for 3s (n=3, l=0) and 2p (n=2, l=1).

The 3s radial wavefunction is:

R_{3,0}(r) = \frac{2}{3^{3/2} a_0^{3/2}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a_0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a_0^2}\right) e^{-r/(3a_0)}

The 2p radial wavefunction is:

R_{2,1}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{24 a_0^3}} \left(\frac{r}{a_0}\right) e^{-r/(2a_0)}

So the radial integral is:

⟨2,1 | r | 3,0 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr

Similarly, ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) R_{2,1}(r) r^3 dr

These integrals can be computed, but they might be tedious. Alternatively, there are standard results for dipole matrix elements in hydrogen.

From the formula for the dipole matrix elements in hydrogen, the radial part ⟨n', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ is given by:

⟨n', l+1 | r | n, l ⟩ = \frac{3}{2} a_0 \frac{n^{l+1} (n' - l - 2)!}{\sqrt{(n + l + 1)! (n' + l + 1)!}}} \times ... 

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the explicit value. Alternatively, recall that for transitions between states, the oscillator strength or the Einstein coefficients can be used. 

Alternatively, use recursion relations or known integrals. The integral ∫_0^∞ r^k e^{-α r} dr = k! / α^{k+1} for integer k.

But the product of the two radial functions will involve terms like e^{-r/(3a0)} * e^{-r/(2a0)} = e^{-r(1/(3a0) + 1/(2a0))} = e^{-r(5/(6a0))}, multiplied by polynomials in r.

For the first integral, R_{3,0}(r) is:

R_{3,0}(r) = \frac{2}{(3a0)^{3/2}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\right) e^{-r/(3a0)}

R_{2,1}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \left(\frac{r}{a0}\right) e^{-r/(2a0)}

So the product R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 is:

\frac{2}{(3a0)^{3/2}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\right) e^{-r/(3a0)} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \left(\frac{r}{a0}\right) e^{-r/(2a0)} * r^3

Simplify:

= \frac{2}{(3^{3/2} a0^{3/2}) \sqrt{24 a0^3}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\right) r^4/a0 e^{-5r/(6a0)} }

= \frac{2}{3^{3/2} \sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}} \left(1 - \frac{2r}{3a0} + \frac{2r^2}{27a0^2}\right) r^4 e^{-5r/(6a0)} }

This integral can be split into three terms:

Term 1: ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr

Term 2: - (2/(3a0)) ∫_0^∞ r^5 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr

Term 3: (2/(27a0^2)) ∫_0^∞ r^6 e^{-5r/(6a0)} dr

Each of these integrals can be evaluated using the gamma function:

∫_0^∞ r^n e^{-α r} dr = n! / α^{n+1}

Let’s compute each term:

Let α = 5/(6a0)

Term 1: 4! / α^5 = 24 / (5/(6a0))^5 = 24 * (6a0/5)^5

Term 2: - (2/(3a0)) * 5! / α^6 = - (2/(3a0)) * 120 / (5/(6a0))^6 = - (240/(3a0)) * (6a0/5)^6 = -80/a0 * (6a0/5)^6

Term 3: (2/(27a0^2)) * 6! / α^7 = (2/(27a0^2)) * 720 / (5/(6a0))^7 = (1440/(27a0^2)) * (6a0/5)^7 = (160/3a0^2) * (6a0/5)^7

Therefore, combining all terms:

Integral = [24*(6a0/5)^5 - 80/a0*(6a0/5)^6 + 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^7 ] * (2)/(3^{3/2} sqrt(24) a0^{9/2})

Let’s factor out common terms:

First, note that (6a0/5)^5 is common in all terms:

Term 1: 24*(6a0/5)^5

Term 2: -80/a0*(6a0/5)^6 = -80/a0*(6a0/5)*(6a0/5)^5 = -80*(6/5)*(a0/a0)*(6a0/5)^5 = -80*(6/5)*(6a0/5)^5

Term 3: 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^7 = 160/(3a0^2)*(6a0/5)^2*(6a0/5)^5 = 160/(3a0^2)*(36a0^2/25)*(6a0/5)^5 = 160*36/(3*25)*(a0^2/a0^2)*(6a0/5)^5 = (160*12)/25*(6a0/5)^5 = 1920/25*(6a0/5)^5

Therefore, combining:

24 - 80*(6/5) + 1920/25 = 24 - 96 + 76.8 = (24 - 96) + 76.8 = (-72) + 76.8 = 4.8

But let me calculate it step by step:

First term coefficient: 24

Second term coefficient: -80*(6/5) = -96

Third term coefficient: 1920/25 = 76.8

Total coefficient: 24 - 96 + 76.8 = (24 + 76.8) - 96 = 100.8 - 96 = 4.8

Therefore, the integral becomes:

4.8 * (6a0/5)^5 * (2)/(3^{3/2} sqrt(24) a0^{9/2})

Simplify constants:

4.8 = 24/5 = 4.8

So:

24/5 * (6a0/5)^5 * 2 / (3^{3/2} * sqrt(24) * a0^{9/2})

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply constants: (24/5) * 2 = 48/5

Denominator constants: 3^{3/2} * sqrt(24) = 3*sqrt(3) * sqrt(24) = 3*sqrt(72) = 3*6*sqrt(2) = 18√2

So denominator: 18√2 * a0^{9/2}

Numerator: (6a0/5)^5 = 6^5 a0^5 / 5^5 = 7776 a0^5 / 3125

Therefore, numerator total: 48/5 * 7776 a0^5 / 3125 = (48 * 7776) / (5 * 3125) a0^5 = (373,248) / 15,625 a0^5

Denominator: 18√2 * a0^{9/2}

So the integral is:

(373,248 / 15,625) / (18√2) * a0^5 / a0^{9/2} = (373,248 / (15,625 * 18√2)) * a0^{1/2}

Calculate the numerical coefficient:

373,248 ÷ 15,625 ≈ 23.887

23.887 ÷ 18 ≈ 1.327

1.327 ÷ √2 ≈ 1.327 / 1.414 ≈ 0.938

So approximately 0.938 * a0^{1/2}

But this seems rough. However, the exact expression is messy. The key point is that this integral is non-zero, so the transition is allowed.

Similarly, for the second radial integral ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩.

The 1s radial wavefunction is:

R_{1,0}(r) = 2 a0^{-3/2} e^{-r/a0}

The 2p radial wavefunction is:

R_{2,1}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{24 a0^3}} \left(\frac{r}{a0}\right) e^{-r/(2a0)}

So the integral ⟨1,0 | r | 2,1 ⟩ = ∫_0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) R_{2,1}(r) r^3 dr

= ∫_0^∞ [2 a0^{-3/2} e^{-r/a0}] [1/\sqrt{24 a0^3} (r/a0) e^{-r/(2a0)}] r^3 dr

= 2 a0^{-3/2} * 1/\sqrt{24 a0^3} * 1/a0 ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-3r/(2a0)} dr

= 2 / (\sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}) ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-3r/(2a0)} dr

The integral ∫_0^∞ r^4 e^{-α r} dr = 4! / α^5 = 24 / (3/(2a0))^5 = 24 * (2a0/3)^5

Therefore:

= 2 / (\sqrt{24} a0^{9/2}) * 24 * (2a0/3)^5

= 2 * 24 / \sqrt{24} * (32 a0^5 / 243) / a0^{9/2}

= (48 / \sqrt{24}) * (32 / 243) * a0^{5 - 9/2}

= (48 / (2*sqrt(6))) * (32 / 243) * a0^{1/2}

= (24 / sqrt(6)) * (32 / 243) * a0^{1/2}

= (24 * 32) / (sqrt(6) * 243) * a0^{1/2}

= 768 / (243 sqrt(6)) * a0^{1/2}

Simplify:

768 / 243 = 256 / 81 ≈ 3.1605

So ≈ 3.1605 / sqrt(6) ≈ 3.1605 / 2.449 ≈ 1.29

Therefore, the integral is approximately 1.29 * a0^{1/2}

But again, the exact value is not crucial for the probability ratio. The key point is that both radial integrals are non-zero, so the transitions are allowed.

However, the problem is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. Since we can't compute the exact probability without knowing the radial integrals, but in standard problems, often the answer is expressed in terms of the matrix elements or simply states that the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the matrix elements for each step, summed over the intermediate m states.

Given that there are three possible intermediate m states (-1, 0, +1), and the transition amplitude for each is the same due to rotational symmetry, the total probability would be three times the square of the amplitude for a single m.

But the problem might be expecting a specific route through a particular m, but since the initial and final m are both 0, the dominant contribution might come from the intermediate m=0, but actually, due to the sum over all m, the total probability includes all paths.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions "the transition route", which might refer to the sequence of states regardless of m, so |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² summed over m.

However, in reality, the total transition amplitude is a coherent sum over the intermediate states, but since they are different m states, which are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path.

Therefore, the probability is the sum over m |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|². But due to the orthogonality of the m states, this is equal to the sum over m |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|².

But since each |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² is the same for all m, and each |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² is also the same for all m (due to rotational symmetry), the total probability is 3 * |R1|² |R2|², where R1 and R2 are the radial integrals for the first and second transitions, respectively.

Therefore, the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ for m = -1, 0, +1, and the probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each individual m path.

However, without specific values for the radial integrals, we can't give a numerical probability, but the problem might be asking for the expression in terms of the squares of the matrix elements.

Alternatively, in many textbooks, the two-photon transition probability is given in terms of the product of the dipole matrix elements divided by the energy denominator, but since this is a cascade transition (two successive dipole emissions), the probability is just the product of the two dipole transition probabilities, multiplied by the number of possible intermediate states (which is 3 here).

Therefore, the answer is that the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ for m = -1, 0, +1, and the total probability is proportional to 3 times the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition.

But the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are". Since it's a two-step dipole transition, the route is via the intermediate state with n=2, l=1, and the probability is proportional to the sum over all m of the product of the probabilities of each step. Given that each step's probability is independent of m, the total probability is 3 times the product of the individual probabilities.

However, to write the probability explicitly, we need to express it in terms of the matrix elements. The standard expression for the transition probability in dipole approximation is given by the Einstein coefficient A, which is proportional to ω^3 |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For a two-step process, the total A would involve the product of the A coefficients for each step, but considering the intermediate state's lifetime. However, this is more involved.

But since the problem is in the non-relativistic theory, perhaps it's sufficient to state that the transition occurs via the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ and the probability is the sum over m of |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|². This can be simplified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the fact that the initial and final states are spherically symmetric. 

Alternatively, using the fact that the total transition amplitude is proportional to the sum over m ⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩. Since the initial and final states are spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the sum over m must be isotropic. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to the sum over m of the product of the two matrix elements. 

But due to the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics, this sum can be simplified. Let's consider that the dipole operator is a vector operator, so the matrix elements ⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩ are proportional to the spherical harmonics Y_1^m, and similarly for the second matrix element. The sum over m would then be proportional to the sum over m Y_1^m Y_1^{m*}, which is the sum over m |Y_1^m|². However, integrating over angles would give 1/(4π) sum over m |Y_1^m|² = 1/(4π) * (3/(4π)) = 3/(4π)^2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the closure relation, sum over m |2,1,m⟩⟨2,1,m| = 1, but applied to the dipole operators. However, this might not help directly.

Given the time I've spent, I think the answer expected here is that the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition, summed over the three possible m values. Therefore, the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is three times the product of the individual transition probabilities.

But to express this in a formula, the probability P is:

P ∝ ∑_{m=-1}^1 |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|²

Since each |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|² is the same for all m, say A, and each |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|² is the same, say B, then P = 3AB.

In conclusion, the transition route is via the intermediate state with n=2, l=1, and the probability is three times the product of the probabilities for each individual transition step. The corresponding probability would then depend on the radial integrals, but in terms of selection rules and the process, this is the route and the proportionality.

**Final Answer**
The transition route is \boxed{|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle} and the corresponding probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition, summed over all intermediate magnetic quantum numbers.

The transition from the \(|3,0,0\rangle\) state to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) in the hydrogen atom occurs via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\) require an intermediate state with \(l=1\). The only viable path is:

Alternatively, each m component may contribute equally.\n\nThe probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components proportional to spherical harmonics Y₁^m. The initial state is l=0 (Y₀⁰), so the first transition matrix element is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is spherically symmetric, the integral over angles for the dipole matrix element will involve integrating Y₁^m * Y₁^m\' * Y₀⁰. However, because Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), the integral over angles for the first transition would be non-zero only if m\' = m. But actually, the matrix element would involve the product of Y₁^m (from the dipole operator) and the initial state Y₀⁰. The angular integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ * Y₁^{m\'} dΩ, which is non-zero only when m\' = m and the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. However, since the initial state is l=0, the first transition\'s angular part is ∫ Y₁^m * Y₁^{m\'} * Y₀⁰. Wait, perhaps better to think that the dipole operator has components proportional to Y₁^m, so the matrix element is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. The angular part would be ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, the integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ dΩ. However, the product of Y₁^m and Y₀⁰ (which is 1/√(4π)) would involve integrating Y₁^m * 1/√(4π) over the sphere. But Y₁^m has an integral over the sphere equal to zero unless m=0. Wait, but Y₁^0 is symmetric, but even then, the integral of Y₁^m over the sphere is zero except when l=0. Wait, no. The integral of Y_l^m over the sphere is zero unless l=0 and m=0. Therefore, ∫ Y₁^m dΩ = 0. But here, we have the product of Y₁^m (from dipole operator) and Y₀⁰ (from the initial state). So the angular integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ dΩ = Y₀⁰ * ∫ Y₁^m dΩ = 0. Wait, that can\'t be right. Wait, no. The matrix element would involve the initial state\'s wavefunction (which has angular part Y₀⁰) multiplied by the dipole operator (which has angular dependence Y₁^m), and then projected onto the intermediate state which has angular part Y₁^m\'. So the angular integral is ⟨Y₁^m\' | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. This is ∫ Y₁^{m\'*} Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{m\'*} Y₁^m dΩ. The integral of Y₁^{m\'*} Y₁^m is δ_{m\',m}, so the angular integral is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m\',m}. Therefore, the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m\' = m. Wait, but m for the intermediate state must be the same as the dipole component m. However, the dipole operator can have m = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0) to |2,1,m⟩ would require the dipole component m, so the angular integral would be non-zero for any m = -1, 0, +1. Thus, the first transition can go to any of the m = -1, 0, +1 states in l=1. However, the probability for each m would depend on the square of the matrix element. But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total probability for the first transition would be the same for each m. Hence, each m component would have equal probability. Then, in the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole transition again requires Δl = ±1, so l must go from 1 to 0. The dipole operator here would again have components m\' such that the transition from l=1 to l=0 requires m changing by Δm = 0, ±1. But the final state is m=0, so the intermediate state m must satisfy m + Δm = 0. Since the dipole operator\'s m component for the second transition can be -1, 0, +1, so for example, if the intermediate state has m = 1, the dipole operator must have m = -1 to reach final m=0. But wait, the dipole operator\'s m in the second transition would be the change in m. So for the second transition from |2,1,m_i⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m is 0 - m_i. So the dipole component must be m = -m_i. But the allowed dipole components are m = -1, 0, +1. Therefore, m_i must be one of -1, 0, +1, and the dipole component m = -m_i must be allowed (i.e., within -1, 0, +1). Therefore, m_i can be -1, 0, +1, but if m_i = +1, then the dipole component must be m = -1; if m_i = 0, then m = 0; if m_i = -1, then m = +1. However, the transition matrix element for the second step would then depend on the overlap between the intermediate state\'s angular part Y₁^{m_i} and the dipole operator\'s Y₁^{-m_i} (since the final state has Y₀⁰). The angular integral here would be ⟨Y₀⁰ | Y₁^{-m_i} | Y₁^{m_i}⟩. Which is ∫ Y₀⁰ * Y₁^{-m_i} * Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. The product Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} is |Y₁^{m_i}|², which integrated over the sphere gives 1/(4π) * (1/(3)) [since the integral of |Y₁^m|² over the sphere is 1 for each l=1, m]. Wait, no. The integral of |Y_l^m|² over the sphere is 1, because they are normalized. So ∫ |Y₁^m|² dΩ = 1 for each m. Therefore, the integral ∫ Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ is ∫ |Y₁^{m_i}|² dΩ = 1, but actually, Y₁^{-m} = (-1)^m Y₁^{m*}, so Y₁^{-m} Y₁^{m} = (-1)^m |Y₁^{m}|². But integrating this would still be (-1)^m times 1. Wait, but the integral of Y₁^{-m} Y₁^{m} over the sphere would actually be δ_{m, m\'}, but here m\' = -m_i and m = m_i. Wait, maybe I confused the indices. Let me clarify. Let me compute the integral ⟨Y₀⁰ | Y₁^m_dipole | Y₁^{m_i}⟩, where m_dipole is the change in m. The dipole operator component is Y₁^{m_dipole}, so the integral is ∫ Y₀⁰^* Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is 1/√(4π), this becomes 1/√(4π) ∫ Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. The integral of two spherical harmonics is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, but here it\'s the integral of Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} which would be proportional to δ_{m_dipole + m_i, 0} multiplied by some factor. Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y₁^{m1} Y₁^{m2} dΩ is zero unless m1 + m2 = 0, in which case it\'s proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 and l=1 to L=0. But coupling two l=1 states to L=0 requires m1 + m2 = 0. The integral would then be non-zero only if m_dipole + m_i = 0. Therefore, m_dipole = -m_i. So for the second transition, the dipole component must have m_dipole = -m_i to get a non-zero integral. However, the allowed m_dipole values are -1, 0, +1. Therefore, m_i must be such that -m_i is within -1, 0, +1. So m_i can be -1, 0, +1. For each m_i, the dipole component is -m_i. Hence, for each intermediate state |2,1,m_i⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ requires a dipole component m = -m_i. The value of the matrix element will then depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the 3j-symbols for combining angular momenta. However, for the purposes of calculating the total transition probability, we might need to sum over all possible intermediate m_i and dipole components. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the total transition probability should be the same regardless of the path, but considering all possible intermediate m_i. Let\'s consider the first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m_i⟩. The matrix element for this transition is proportional to ⟨2,1,m_i | r Y₁^{m} |3,0,0⟩. As we discussed earlier, the angular part is non-zero only if m = m_i. So the dipole component m must equal m_i. The radial part would involve the integral of the radial wavefunctions R_{2,1}(r) * r * R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m_i⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the matrix element is proportional to ⟨1,0,0 | r Y₁^{-m_i} |2,1,m_i⟩. The angular part here is non-zero only if -m_i + m_i = 0, which is satisfied. The radial part is the integral of R_{1,0}(r) * r * R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. The total transition amplitude for the two-step process is the product of the two matrix elements, summed over all possible intermediate m_i. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total probability should be the same for all m_i contributions. Therefore, the total probability would be proportional to the sum over m_i of |⟨2,1,m_i | r Y₁^{m_i} |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0 | r Y₁^{-m_i} |2,1,m_i⟩|². But since the angular parts for each m_i are the same (due to spherical symmetry), the sum over m_i would just be 3 times the square of a single matrix element (since m_i can be -1, 0, +1). However, we need to check if the angular integrals for each step are indeed the same for all m_i. For the first step, the angular integral for each m_i is ⟨Y₁^{m_i} | Y₁^{m_i} | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Wait, but Y₁^{m_i} squared would involve terms like Y_2^{2m_i}, but integrating over the sphere, unless m_i=0, but even then, the integral of Y₁^0 Y₁^0 would involve the integral of Y_0^0 component. Wait, perhaps I\'m overcomplicating. Maybe the angular integral for the first transition is actually ⟨Y₁^{m_i} | Y₁^{m} | Y₀⁰⟩, and since the dipole operator has Y₁^{m}, and the initial state has Y₀⁰, the product Y₁^{m} Y₀⁰ is proportional to Y₁^{m}, so the overlap with Y₁^{m_i} would require m_i = m. Hence, the angular integral is non-zero only when m_i = m, and since the dipole components can be m = -1, 0, +1, each m_i corresponds to a different transition. However, the radial part for each m_i is the same because the radial wavefunctions don\'t depend on m_i. Therefore, the transition amplitude for each m_i is the same. Therefore, the total transition probability for the two-step process would be 3 times the square of the product of the radial integrals for each step. But wait, in reality, the dipole matrix elements depend on the polarization of the photon emitted, but since we\'re considering spontaneous emission averaged over all directions and polarizations, the total transition rate would sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., all m_i). Therefore, the total probability is the sum over m_i of the probabilities for each path through m_i. Since each m_i contributes equally, the total probability would be 3 times the probability for a single m_i. However, the problem states that the transition occurs via two dipole transitions, so the route would involve an intermediate state with l=1 and some m. But since the initial and final states are both spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition must go through any of the l=1, m=-1,0,+1 states. Therefore, the possible routes are |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Each of these paths contributes to the total transition probability. To calculate the probability, we need to compute the square of the matrix elements for each step and sum them up. The transition rate for a two-photon process is generally given by the product of the matrix elements for each step, divided by the energy denominator, integrated over intermediate states. However, since this is a two-dipole transition (two-photon emission?), wait, no. Wait, the problem says "decays via two dipole transitions", which implies two successive electric dipole transitions, emitting two photons in the process. However, in hydrogen, the usual decay from n=3 to n=1 would typically occur via a single dipole transition if allowed, but since Δl must be ±1, and here both initial and final states have l=0, a direct transition is forbidden. Therefore, the decay must proceed via two electric dipole transitions, first from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, and then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Each transition emits a photon. The total transition probability would then be the product of the probabilities for each individual transition, considering the lifetime of the intermediate state. However, in such a cascade decay, the total rate is determined by the product of the Einstein coefficients for each step. Alternatively, in perturbation theory, the second-order process would involve summing over intermediate states. The amplitude would be A = Σ_{intermediate} [⟨1,0,0| H\' |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| H\' |3,0,0⟩ ] / (E_3 - E_2 - ω_1), where H\' is the dipole interaction Hamiltonian, and ω_1 is the frequency of the first photon. However, considering energy conservation, the denominators would involve the intermediate state energy. However, for spontaneous emission, this is handled via time-dependent perturbation theory and the Fermi golden rule. However, the problem might be simplified by considering the overall transition probability as the product of the probabilities for each step. The probability for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩|², and the probability for the second transition (2,1,m → 1,0,0) is proportional to |⟨1,0,0| r Y₁^{-m} |2,1,m⟩|². The total probability would then be the sum over m of these products. However, due to selection rules and symmetries, these matrix elements might be related. For example, the radial integrals for the first and second steps are independent of m. Let\'s denote the radial integral for the first transition as R1 = ∫ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr, and for the second transition as R2 = ∫ R_{1,0}(r) r R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. Then, the angular parts for each transition are as follows: For the first transition, the angular integral for each m is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) * 1, since the integral of |Y₁^m|² over the sphere is 1. Wait, no. The angular part of the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩ is actually ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m dΩ. However, the product Y₁^m Y₁^m is Y_2^{2m} (from angular momentum addition), but integrating over all angles would give zero unless 2m = 0, which only occurs when m=0. Therefore, the angular integral for the first transition is non-zero only when m=0. Wait, this contradicts our earlier assumption. This suggests that only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed for the first transition. Wait, this is a critical point. Let me re-express this. The matrix element for the first transition is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. The angular part is ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is spherically symmetric, the integral becomes Y₀⁰ times the integral of Y₁^m Y₁^m. However, the product Y₁^m Y₁^m can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics with l=0, 1, 2. The integral over the sphere will pick out the l=0 component, which requires that 2m = 0 and l=0. But l=0 requires that the product of Y₁^m Y₁^m contains a component with l=0. However, coupling two l=1 states gives possible total L=0,1,2. The l=0 component exists only if m=0, since the sum of m\'s must be zero. Therefore, the integral ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ is non-zero only when m=0. Therefore, only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed in the first transition. This contradicts my initial thought that all m\'s are possible. Therefore, the first transition can only go to |2,1,0⟩. Then, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would require a dipole component m=0, since Δm=0. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. But wait, this seems to suggest that only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed. However, this conflicts with the previous consideration where the angular integral for the first transition would be zero unless m=0. Let me verify this with the 3j-symbols. The integral ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1,m;1,m | 0,0⟩. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling two l=1 states with m1=m and m2=m to total L=0, M=0. However, since L=0 requires that m1 + m2 = 0, but here m1 = m2 = m, so m1 + m2 = 2m = 0 ⇒ m=0. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only when m=0. Therefore, only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed in the first transition. Therefore, the transition path is uniquely |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Hence, there\'s only one possible route. But wait, this contradicts the initial thought that all m\'s are possible. This seems to indicate that the selection rules further restrict the intermediate m to 0. Therefore, the transition can only occur through the m=0 intermediate state. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability would then be the product of the probabilities for each transition. Let\'s compute the matrix elements. For the first transition: The dipole matrix element D1 = ⟨2,1,0| z |3,0,0⟩, where z is the dipole operator component along z-axis (m=0). The radial integral R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly, for the second transition: D2 = ⟨1,0,0| z |2,1,0⟩, with radial integral R2 = ∫0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) r R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. The total amplitude is proportional to D1 * D2, and the probability is |D1 * D2|². However, to compute the actual probability, we need the Einstein coefficients for each transition. The decay rate for a dipole transition is given by Γ = (4/3) (e^2 / ħ c^3) ω^3 |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,0), the frequency ω1 = (E3 - E2)/ħ. For the second transition (2,1,0 → 1,0,0), ω2 = (E2 - E1)/ħ. The total decay rate for the two-step process would be the product of the individual Γ\'s, but since it\'s a sequential process, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio of the second transition. However, since the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ can decay to other states as well, but assuming we\'re considering the specific path to |1,0,0⟩, the total probability would involve the product of the two transition probabilities. However, in reality, the total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via the two-step process is calculated using second-order perturbation theory, but given the complexity, the problem might expect a more qualitative answer. Alternatively, since the problem asks for the transition route and corresponding probability, the answer is likely that the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step. However, since the user asks for the probability, perhaps in terms of the standard expressions. The standard dipole matrix elements for hydrogen can be calculated. The radial integral for the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 is given by R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly for R2. The explicit forms of the radial wavefunctions are known. The radial wavefunction for hydrogen is R_{n,l}(r) = N_{n,l} e^{-r/(n a)} (r/(n a))^l L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}(2r/(n a)), where L are the associated Laguerre polynomials and N_{n,l} is the normalization constant. For n=3, l=0: R_{3,0}(r) = (2/(3 a))^{3/2} (1/√(3)) (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) e^{-r/(3a)} For n=2, l=1: R_{2,1}(r) = (1/(2a))^{3/2} (r/(√(3) a)) e^{-r/(2a)} For n=1, l=0: R_{1,0}(r) = 2 (1/a)^{3/2} e^{-r/a} Calculating R1: R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr = ∫0^∞ [ (1/(2a))^{3/2} (r/(√(3) a)) e^{-r/(2a)} ] * r * [ (2/(3a))^{3/2} (1/√(3)) (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) e^{-r/(3a)} ] r² dr This simplifies to constants times ∫0^∞ r^4 e^{-r/(2a) - r/(3a)} (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) dr = constants * ∫0^∞ r^4 e^{-5r/(6a)} (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) dr This integral can be evaluated term by term using gamma functions. Similarly for R2. However, this calculation is quite involved. Instead, we can recall that the dipole matrix elements for hydrogen are known and often tabulated. For example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 for l=0 to l=1 has a certain strength, and from n=2 to n=1 for l=1 to l=0. However, without specific values, it\'s hard to give a numerical probability. Alternatively, the problem may expect an expression in terms of the squares of the matrix elements. Given that the transition is allowed only through the m=0 intermediate state, the probability is proportional to |R1|² |R2|². However, the exact probability would require evaluating these integrals. Alternatively, since the user might expect the answer to state the path and note that the probability is the product of the probabilities for each individual transition, expressed in terms of the respective Einstein coefficients. Given that the problem is likely asking for the route and the form of the probability, I\'ll conclude that the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. Therefore, the final answer is the transition route through |2,1,0⟩ and the probability is the product of the individual transition probabilities, summed over possible intermediate m, but due to selection rules, only m=0 contributes, hence the probability is |⟨2,1,0| r Y₁^0 |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0| r Y₁^0 |2,1,0⟩|². However, the standard probability expressions for dipole transitions in hydrogen often involve factors like (n^2 - n\'^2)/n^5 for certain transitions, but I might need to recall specific formulas. Alternatively, the probability can be written in terms of the radial integrals. Since the problem doesn\'t provide specific wavefunctions or numerical values, the answer should be expressed symbolically. Therefore, the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,0| r |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,0⟩|². The exact proportionality constant would involve fundamental constants and the frequencies of the emitted photons, but in the context of the problem, stating the route and the product of the squared matrix elements suffices.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387248, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6764, prompt_tokens=748, total_tokens=7512, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The hydrogen atom state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) decays to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions (\(\Delta l = \pm 1\), \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\)) necessitate an intermediate state with \(l=1\). The only allowed path is through the \(|2,1,0\rangle\) state because angular momentum conservation restricts the magnetic quantum number \(m\) to remain 0 in both transitions due to the spherical symmetry of the initial and final states.

**Transition Route**:  
\[
|3,0,0\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{First Dipole Transition}} |2,1,0\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{Second Dipole Transition}} |1,0,0\rangle
\]

**Probability**:  
The total transition probability is proportional to the product of the squared dipole matrix elements for each step:  
\[
P \propto \left| \langle 2,1,0| \mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle \right|^2 \cdot \left| \langle 1,0,0| \mathbf{r} |2,1,0\rangle \right|^2
\]
Here, the radial integrals for the transitions \(3,0,0 \to 2,1,0\) and \(2,1,0 \to 1,0,0\) determine the probability. The angular components contribute equally due to symmetry, leaving only the radial dependencies. 

**Final Answer**:  
The transition route is \(\boxed{|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle}\) with a probability proportional to the product of the squared dipole matrix elements of the two transitions.

However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the transition probabilities might not depend on the intermediate m. Alternatively, each m component may contribute equally.

The probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components proportional to spherical harmonics Y₁^m. The initial state is l=0 (Y₀⁰), so the first transition matrix element is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is spherically symmetric, the integral over angles for the dipole matrix element will involve integrating Y₁^m * Y₁^m' * Y₀⁰. However, because Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), the integral over angles for the first transition would be non-zero only if m' = m. But actually, the matrix element would involve the product of Y₁^m (from the dipole operator) and the initial state Y₀⁰. The angular integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ * Y₁^{m'} dΩ, which is non-zero only when m' = m and the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied. However, since the initial state is l=0, the first transition's angular part is ∫ Y₁^m * Y₁^{m'} * Y₀⁰. Wait, perhaps better to think that the dipole operator has components proportional to Y₁^m, so the matrix element is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. The angular part would be ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, the integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ dΩ. However, the product of Y₁^m and Y₀⁰ (which is 1/√(4π)) would involve integrating Y₁^m * 1/√(4π) over the sphere. But Y₁^m has an integral over the sphere equal to zero unless m=0. Wait, but Y₁^0 is symmetric, but even then, the integral of Y₁^m over the sphere is zero except when l=0. Wait, no. The integral of Y_l^m over the sphere is zero unless l=0 and m=0. Therefore, ∫ Y₁^m dΩ = 0. But here, we have the product of Y₁^m (from dipole operator) and Y₀⁰ (from the initial state). So the angular integral becomes ∫ Y₁^m * Y₀⁰ dΩ = Y₀⁰ * ∫ Y₁^m dΩ = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. The matrix element would involve the initial state's wavefunction (which has angular part Y₀⁰) multiplied by the dipole operator (which has angular dependence Y₁^m), and then projected onto the intermediate state which has angular part Y₁^m'. So the angular integral is ⟨Y₁^m' | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. This is ∫ Y₁^{m'*} Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{m'*} Y₁^m dΩ. The integral of Y₁^{m'*} Y₁^m is δ_{m',m}, so the angular integral is (1/√(4π)) δ_{m',m}. Therefore, the matrix element for the first transition is non-zero only when m' = m. Wait, but m for the intermediate state must be the same as the dipole component m. However, the dipole operator can have m = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0) to |2,1,m⟩ would require the dipole component m, so the angular integral would be non-zero for any m = -1, 0, +1. Thus, the first transition can go to any of the m = -1, 0, +1 states in l=1. However, the probability for each m would depend on the square of the matrix element. But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total probability for the first transition would be the same for each m. Hence, each m component would have equal probability. Then, in the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole transition again requires Δl = ±1, so l must go from 1 to 0. The dipole operator here would again have components m' such that the transition from l=1 to l=0 requires m changing by Δm = 0, ±1. But the final state is m=0, so the intermediate state m must satisfy m + Δm = 0. Since the dipole operator's m component for the second transition can be -1, 0, +1, so for example, if the intermediate state has m = 1, the dipole operator must have m = -1 to reach final m=0. But wait, the dipole operator's m in the second transition would be the change in m. So for the second transition from |2,1,m_i⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m is 0 - m_i. So the dipole component must be m = -m_i. But the allowed dipole components are m = -1, 0, +1. Therefore, m_i must be one of -1, 0, +1, and the dipole component m = -m_i must be allowed (i.e., within -1, 0, +1). Therefore, m_i can be -1, 0, +1, but if m_i = +1, then the dipole component must be m = -1; if m_i = 0, then m = 0; if m_i = -1, then m = +1. However, the transition matrix element for the second step would then depend on the overlap between the intermediate state's angular part Y₁^{m_i} and the dipole operator's Y₁^{-m_i} (since the final state has Y₀⁰). The angular integral here would be ⟨Y₀⁰ | Y₁^{-m_i} | Y₁^{m_i}⟩. Which is ∫ Y₀⁰ * Y₁^{-m_i} * Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. The product Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} is |Y₁^{m_i}|², which integrated over the sphere gives 1/(4π) * (1/(3)) [since the integral of |Y₁^m|² over the sphere is 1 for each l=1, m]. Wait, no. The integral of |Y_l^m|² over the sphere is 1, because they are normalized. So ∫ |Y₁^m|² dΩ = 1 for each m. Therefore, the integral ∫ Y₁^{-m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ is ∫ |Y₁^{m_i}|² dΩ = 1, but actually, Y₁^{-m} = (-1)^m Y₁^{m*}, so Y₁^{-m} Y₁^{m} = (-1)^m |Y₁^{m}|². But integrating this would still be (-1)^m times 1. Wait, but the integral of Y₁^{-m} Y₁^{m} over the sphere would actually be δ_{m, m'}, but here m' = -m_i and m = m_i. Wait, maybe I confused the indices. Let me clarify. Let me compute the integral ⟨Y₀⁰ | Y₁^m_dipole | Y₁^{m_i}⟩, where m_dipole is the change in m. The dipole operator component is Y₁^{m_dipole}, so the integral is ∫ Y₀⁰^* Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Since Y₀⁰ is 1/√(4π), this becomes 1/√(4π) ∫ Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. The integral of two spherical harmonics is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, but here it's the integral of Y₁^{m_dipole} Y₁^{m_i} which would be proportional to δ_{m_dipole + m_i, 0} multiplied by some factor. Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y₁^{m1} Y₁^{m2} dΩ is zero unless m1 + m2 = 0, in which case it's proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 and l=1 to L=0. But coupling two l=1 states to L=0 requires m1 + m2 = 0. The integral would then be non-zero only if m_dipole + m_i = 0. Therefore, m_dipole = -m_i. So for the second transition, the dipole component must have m_dipole = -m_i to get a non-zero integral. However, the allowed m_dipole values are -1, 0, +1. Therefore, m_i must be such that -m_i is within -1, 0, +1. So m_i can be -1, 0, +1. For each m_i, the dipole component is -m_i. Hence, for each intermediate state |2,1,m_i⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ requires a dipole component m = -m_i. The value of the matrix element will then depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the 3j-symbols for combining angular momenta. However, for the purposes of calculating the total transition probability, we might need to sum over all possible intermediate m_i and dipole components. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), the total transition probability should be the same regardless of the path, but considering all possible intermediate m_i. Let's consider the first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m_i⟩. The matrix element for this transition is proportional to ⟨2,1,m_i | r Y₁^{m} |3,0,0⟩. As we discussed earlier, the angular part is non-zero only if m = m_i. So the dipole component m must equal m_i. The radial part would involve the integral of the radial wavefunctions R_{2,1}(r) * r * R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m_i⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the matrix element is proportional to ⟨1,0,0 | r Y₁^{-m_i} |2,1,m_i⟩. The angular part here is non-zero only if -m_i + m_i = 0, which is satisfied. The radial part is the integral of R_{1,0}(r) * r * R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. The total transition amplitude for the two-step process is the product of the two matrix elements, summed over all possible intermediate m_i. However, since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the total probability should be the same for all m_i contributions. Therefore, the total probability would be proportional to the sum over m_i of |⟨2,1,m_i | r Y₁^{m_i} |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0 | r Y₁^{-m_i} |2,1,m_i⟩|². But since the angular parts for each m_i are the same (due to spherical symmetry), the sum over m_i would just be 3 times the square of a single matrix element (since m_i can be -1, 0, +1). However, we need to check if the angular integrals for each step are indeed the same for all m_i. For the first step, the angular integral for each m_i is ⟨Y₁^{m_i} | Y₁^{m_i} | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant, this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^{m_i} Y₁^{m_i} dΩ. Wait, but Y₁^{m_i} squared would involve terms like Y_2^{2m_i}, but integrating over the sphere, unless m_i=0, but even then, the integral of Y₁^0 Y₁^0 would involve the integral of Y_0^0 component. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the angular integral for the first transition is actually ⟨Y₁^{m_i} | Y₁^{m} | Y₀⁰⟩, and since the dipole operator has Y₁^{m}, and the initial state has Y₀⁰, the product Y₁^{m} Y₀⁰ is proportional to Y₁^{m}, so the overlap with Y₁^{m_i} would require m_i = m. Hence, the angular integral is non-zero only when m_i = m, and since the dipole components can be m = -1, 0, +1, each m_i corresponds to a different transition. However, the radial part for each m_i is the same because the radial wavefunctions don't depend on m_i. Therefore, the transition amplitude for each m_i is the same. Therefore, the total transition probability for the two-step process would be 3 times the square of the product of the radial integrals for each step. But wait, in reality, the dipole matrix elements depend on the polarization of the photon emitted, but since we're considering spontaneous emission averaged over all directions and polarizations, the total transition rate would sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., all m_i). Therefore, the total probability is the sum over m_i of the probabilities for each path through m_i. Since each m_i contributes equally, the total probability would be 3 times the probability for a single m_i. However, the problem states that the transition occurs via two dipole transitions, so the route would involve an intermediate state with l=1 and some m. But since the initial and final states are both spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition must go through any of the l=1, m=-1,0,+1 states. Therefore, the possible routes are |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Each of these paths contributes to the total transition probability. To calculate the probability, we need to compute the square of the matrix elements for each step and sum them up. The transition rate for a two-photon process is generally given by the product of the matrix elements for each step, divided by the energy denominator, integrated over intermediate states. However, since this is a two-dipole transition (two-photon emission?), wait, no. Wait, the problem says "decays via two dipole transitions", which implies two successive electric dipole transitions, emitting two photons in the process. However, in hydrogen, the usual decay from n=3 to n=1 would typically occur via a single dipole transition if allowed, but since Δl must be ±1, and here both initial and final states have l=0, a direct transition is forbidden. Therefore, the decay must proceed via two electric dipole transitions, first from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, and then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Each transition emits a photon. The total transition probability would then be the product of the probabilities for each individual transition, considering the lifetime of the intermediate state. However, in such a cascade decay, the total rate is determined by the product of the Einstein coefficients for each step. Alternatively, in perturbation theory, the second-order process would involve summing over intermediate states. The amplitude would be A = Σ_{intermediate} [⟨1,0,0| H' |2,1,m⟩ ⟨2,1,m| H' |3,0,0⟩ ] / (E_3 - E_2 - ω_1), where H' is the dipole interaction Hamiltonian, and ω_1 is the frequency of the first photon. However, considering energy conservation, the denominators would involve the intermediate state energy. However, for spontaneous emission, this is handled via time-dependent perturbation theory and the Fermi golden rule. However, the problem might be simplified by considering the overall transition probability as the product of the probabilities for each step. The probability for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩|², and the probability for the second transition (2,1,m → 1,0,0) is proportional to |⟨1,0,0| r Y₁^{-m} |2,1,m⟩|². The total probability would then be the sum over m of these products. However, due to selection rules and symmetries, these matrix elements might be related. For example, the radial integrals for the first and second steps are independent of m. Let's denote the radial integral for the first transition as R1 = ∫ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr, and for the second transition as R2 = ∫ R_{1,0}(r) r R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. Then, the angular parts for each transition are as follows: For the first transition, the angular integral for each m is (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m dΩ = (1/√(4π)) * 1, since the integral of |Y₁^m|² over the sphere is 1. Wait, no. The angular part of the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩ is actually ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is a constant (1/√(4π)), this becomes (1/√(4π)) ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m dΩ. However, the product Y₁^m Y₁^m is Y_2^{2m} (from angular momentum addition), but integrating over all angles would give zero unless 2m = 0, which only occurs when m=0. Therefore, the angular integral for the first transition is non-zero only when m=0. Wait, this contradicts our earlier assumption. This suggests that only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed for the first transition. Wait, this is a critical point. Let me re-express this. The matrix element for the first transition is ⟨2,1,m| r Y₁^m |3,0,0⟩. The angular part is ⟨Y₁^m | Y₁^m | Y₀⁰⟩. Since Y₀⁰ is spherically symmetric, the integral becomes Y₀⁰ times the integral of Y₁^m Y₁^m. However, the product Y₁^m Y₁^m can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics with l=0, 1, 2. The integral over the sphere will pick out the l=0 component, which requires that 2m = 0 and l=0. But l=0 requires that the product of Y₁^m Y₁^m contains a component with l=0. However, coupling two l=1 states gives possible total L=0,1,2. The l=0 component exists only if m=0, since the sum of m's must be zero. Therefore, the integral ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ is non-zero only when m=0. Therefore, only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed in the first transition. This contradicts my initial thought that all m's are possible. Therefore, the first transition can only go to |2,1,0⟩. Then, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would require a dipole component m=0, since Δm=0. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. But wait, this seems to suggest that only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed. However, this conflicts with the previous consideration where the angular integral for the first transition would be zero unless m=0. Let me verify this with the 3j-symbols. The integral ∫ Y₁^m Y₁^m Y₀⁰ dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1,m;1,m | 0,0⟩. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling two l=1 states with m1=m and m2=m to total L=0, M=0. However, since L=0 requires that m1 + m2 = 0, but here m1 = m2 = m, so m1 + m2 = 2m = 0 ⇒ m=0. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only when m=0. Therefore, only the m=0 intermediate state is allowed in the first transition. Therefore, the transition path is uniquely |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Hence, there's only one possible route. But wait, this contradicts the initial thought that all m's are possible. This seems to indicate that the selection rules further restrict the intermediate m to 0. Therefore, the transition can only occur through the m=0 intermediate state. Therefore, the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability would then be the product of the probabilities for each transition. Let's compute the matrix elements. For the first transition: The dipole matrix element D1 = ⟨2,1,0| z |3,0,0⟩, where z is the dipole operator component along z-axis (m=0). The radial integral R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly, for the second transition: D2 = ⟨1,0,0| z |2,1,0⟩, with radial integral R2 = ∫0^∞ R_{1,0}(r) r R_{2,1}(r) r² dr. The total amplitude is proportional to D1 * D2, and the probability is |D1 * D2|². However, to compute the actual probability, we need the Einstein coefficients for each transition. The decay rate for a dipole transition is given by Γ = (4/3) (e^2 / ħ c^3) ω^3 |⟨f| r |i⟩|². For the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,0), the frequency ω1 = (E3 - E2)/ħ. For the second transition (2,1,0 → 1,0,0), ω2 = (E2 - E1)/ħ. The total decay rate for the two-step process would be the product of the individual Γ's, but since it's a sequential process, the total rate is determined by the rate of the first transition multiplied by the branching ratio of the second transition. However, since the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ can decay to other states as well, but assuming we're considering the specific path to |1,0,0⟩, the total probability would involve the product of the two transition probabilities. However, in reality, the total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via the two-step process is calculated using second-order perturbation theory, but given the complexity, the problem might expect a more qualitative answer. Alternatively, since the problem asks for the transition route and corresponding probability, the answer is likely that the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step. However, since the user asks for the probability, perhaps in terms of the standard expressions. The standard dipole matrix elements for hydrogen can be calculated. The radial integral for the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 is given by R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr. Similarly for R2. The explicit forms of the radial wavefunctions are known. The radial wavefunction for hydrogen is R_{n,l}(r) = N_{n,l} e^{-r/(n a)} (r/(n a))^l L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}(2r/(n a)), where L are the associated Laguerre polynomials and N_{n,l} is the normalization constant. For n=3, l=0: R_{3,0}(r) = (2/(3 a))^{3/2} (1/√(3)) (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) e^{-r/(3a)} For n=2, l=1: R_{2,1}(r) = (1/(2a))^{3/2} (r/(√(3) a)) e^{-r/(2a)} For n=1, l=0: R_{1,0}(r) = 2 (1/a)^{3/2} e^{-r/a} Calculating R1: R1 = ∫0^∞ R_{2,1}(r) r R_{3,0}(r) r² dr = ∫0^∞ [ (1/(2a))^{3/2} (r/(√(3) a)) e^{-r/(2a)} ] * r * [ (2/(3a))^{3/2} (1/√(3)) (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) e^{-r/(3a)} ] r² dr This simplifies to constants times ∫0^∞ r^4 e^{-r/(2a) - r/(3a)} (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) dr = constants * ∫0^∞ r^4 e^{-5r/(6a)} (1 - 2r/(3a) + 2r²/(27a²)) dr This integral can be evaluated term by term using gamma functions. Similarly for R2. However, this calculation is quite involved. Instead, we can recall that the dipole matrix elements for hydrogen are known and often tabulated. For example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 for l=0 to l=1 has a certain strength, and from n=2 to n=1 for l=1 to l=0. However, without specific values, it's hard to give a numerical probability. Alternatively, the problem may expect an expression in terms of the squares of the matrix elements. Given that the transition is allowed only through the m=0 intermediate state, the probability is proportional to |R1|² |R2|². However, the exact probability would require evaluating these integrals. Alternatively, since the user might expect the answer to state the path and note that the probability is the product of the probabilities for each individual transition, expressed in terms of the respective Einstein coefficients. Given that the problem is likely asking for the route and the form of the probability, I'll conclude that the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each transition. Therefore, the final answer is the transition route through |2,1,0⟩ and the probability is the product of the individual transition probabilities, summed over possible intermediate m, but due to selection rules, only m=0 contributes, hence the probability is |⟨2,1,0| r Y₁^0 |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0| r Y₁^0 |2,1,0⟩|². However, the standard probability expressions for dipole transitions in hydrogen often involve factors like (n^2 - n'^2)/n^5 for certain transitions, but I might need to recall specific formulas. Alternatively, the probability can be written in terms of the radial integrals. Since the problem doesn't provide specific wavefunctions or numerical values, the answer should be expressed symbolically. Therefore, the transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,0| r |3,0,0⟩|² * |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,0⟩|². The exact proportionality constant would involve fundamental constants and the frequencies of the emitted photons, but in the context of the problem, stating the route and the product of the squared matrix elements suffices.
