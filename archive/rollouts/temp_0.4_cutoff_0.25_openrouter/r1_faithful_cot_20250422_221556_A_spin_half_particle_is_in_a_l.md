To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for the given spin state \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **State Normalization Check**:
   The state is normalized since \((0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1\).

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2(1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Contribution from \(10\sigma_z\): \(10 \times (-0.5) = -5\).

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   The operator \(\sigma_x\) swaps the components of the state vector. Applying \(\sigma_x\) to \(|\psi\rangle\) gives \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle + 0.5|\downarrow\rangle\). The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   Contribution from \(5\sigma_x\): \(5 \times 0.866 \approx 4.33\).

4. **Total Expectation Value**:
   \[
   \text{Expectation value} = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounded to one decimal place: \(-0.7\).

**Final Answer**: \(\boxed{-0.7}\)

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle that's in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. 

First, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra vector multiplied by the operator multiplied by the ket vector. In other words, ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for some operator O. So in this case, I need to compute ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩. 

Let me write down the given state first. The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. To form the bra vector ⟨ψ|, I need to take the conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients here are real numbers, ⟨ψ| would just be 0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|. 

Now, the operator is 10σ_z + 5σ_x. Since expectation value is linear, I can split this into 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩. That might be easier. So I can compute each expectation value separately and then combine them.

Let me recall the matrix representations of σ_z and σ_x. The Pauli matrices. σ_z is diagonal with entries 1 and -1. So σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. σ_x is off-diagonal with entries 1 and 1. So σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. 

The state |↑⟩ is the column vector [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So let me represent |ψ⟩ as a vector. The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. So |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T. Let me confirm that this is normalized. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yes, that's normalized. Good.

Now, let's compute ⟨σ_z⟩ first. For σ_z, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩. Let's compute this. 

So the vector |ψ⟩ is [0.5, √3/2]^T. Applying σ_z to |ψ⟩ gives [1*0.5, -1*(√3/2)] = [0.5, -√3/2]. Then taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2], so:

0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5. Multiply that by 10 gives -5.

Next, compute ⟨σ_x⟩. Similarly, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. 

First, apply σ_x to |ψ⟩. σ_x swaps the components and adds them. So σ_x|ψ⟩ = [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product with ⟨ψ| is [0.5, √3/2] · [√3/2, 0.5] = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5. 

Calculating each term: 0.5*(√3/2) = (√3)/4, and the second term is the same. So total is 2*(√3)/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. 

Therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩ is √3/2. Multiply that by 5 gives 5*(√3)/2 ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two results: 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67.

Wait, but the question says "up to one decimal place." So -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. But let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, check ⟨σ_z⟩:

The state is [0.5, √3/2], applying σ_z gives [0.5, -√3/2]. Then inner product with original state: 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = -0.5. Correct.

Then ⟨σ_x⟩: applying σ_x swaps the components, so [√3/2, 0.5]. Inner product with original [0.5, √3/2] is 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5. Each term is (√3)/4, so total is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. Then total expectation: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. To one decimal place, that's -0.7. But let me check if the problem wants an exact value or the approximate decimal.

Wait, maybe I should compute √3 more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.732. So √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. Then 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.8660 ≈ 4.330. So 10⟨σ_z⟩ is -5. So total is -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. But sometimes, depending on the convention, if the next digit is exactly 5, you round up. Here it's 0.67, so the next digit is 7, which is more than 5, so you round up the previous digit. Wait, no: 0.67 is two decimal places. If we have -0.67 and we need one decimal place, the first decimal is 6 and the next is 7, so we round up the 6 to 7. So -0.7.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2. Let's compute that exactly. √3 ≈ 1.732, so 5*1.732/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33. So -5 + 4.33 is indeed -0.67, which is -0.7 to one decimal place.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute it without approximating √3. Let's see. The exact expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. If we need to present this as a decimal to one place, we have to compute it numerically. √3 ≈ 1.732, so (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 = 4.33. So total is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. 

But let me double-check all steps once more to be sure. 

First, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. That's correct. Then σ_z expectation: yes, because σ_z measures the difference in probabilities of up and down. The coefficient squared for up is 0.25, for down is 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct. 

For σ_x, the expectation is related to the coherence between the states. The off-diagonal terms. Since σ_x flips the spins, the expectation value is twice the product of the coefficients. Wait, let's see. If |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨σ_x⟩ = a*b* + a*b. Because σ_x has 1s in the off-diagonal, so ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = a*b* + a**b. Since a and b are real here, it's 2ab. 

In our case, a = 0.5, b = √3/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = (1)*(√3/2) = √3/2. Which matches the earlier calculation. So indeed, ⟨σ_x⟩ is √3/2. So 5*(√3)/2 ≈ 4.33. 

So adding them up, 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. Numerically, that's -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670. Rounded to one decimal is -0.7. 

But wait, the question says "up to one decimal place". If the exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2, is there a more precise way? Let me compute (5√3)/2 more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.73205080757. So (5*1.73205080757)/2 = (8.66025403785)/2 = 4.330127018925. So then total expectation value is -5 + 4.330127018925 ≈ -0.669872981075. Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be -0.7. But let me check if perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of exact fractions or something, but it says "up to one decimal place", so decimal is needed.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check σ_z: when you apply σ_z to |↓⟩, it's multiplied by -1. So when I did σ_z|ψ⟩, the first component is 1*0.5, the second is -1*(√3/2). Then inner product with ψ gives 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5. Correct. 

For σ_x, applying it to |ψ⟩ gives [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Then inner product with ψ is 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = same as 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = √3/2. Correct. 

So all steps check out. Therefore, the expectation value is approximately -0.7. 

But just to make sure, let's do the entire calculation in matrix form once. 

The state vector is:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T.

Compute 10σ_z + 5σ_x:

First, 10σ_z is [[10, 0], [0, -10]].

5σ_x is [[0, 5], [5, 0]].

So adding them together, the operator is:

[[10, 5], [5, -10]].

Now, compute the expectation value ⟨ψ| (operator) |ψ⟩.

So:

[0.5, √3/2] * [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T.

First, multiply the matrix with the vector:

First component: 10*0.5 + 5*(√3/2) = 5 + (5√3)/2.

Second component: 5*0.5 + (-10)*(√3/2) = 2.5 - 5√3.

Then take the inner product with [0.5, √3/2]:

0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2) + (√3/2)*(2.5 - 5√3).

Compute each term:

First term: 0.5*5 = 2.5; 0.5*(5√3/2) = (5√3)/4 ≈ 2.165.

Second term: (√3/2)*2.5 = (2.5√3)/2 ≈ 2.165; (√3/2)*(-5√3) = -5*(3)/2 = -7.5.

So adding the second term components: 2.165 -7.5 ≈ -5.335.

Now, total expectation value: 2.5 + 2.165 -5.335 ≈ (2.5 + 2.165) = 4.665; 4.665 -5.335 = -0.67. 

So again, we get approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So this confirms the previous result. 

Therefore, the expectation value is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle that's in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. 

First, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra vector multiplied by the operator multiplied by the ket vector. In other words, ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for some operator O. So in this case, I need to compute ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩.

Now, the operator is 10σ_z + 5σ_x. Since expectation value is linear, I can split this into 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩. That might be easier. So I can compute each expectation value separately and then combine them.

The state |↑⟩ is the column vector [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So let me represent |ψ⟩ as a vector. The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. So |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T. Let me confirm that this is normalized. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yes, that's normalized. Good.

Now, let's compute ⟨σ_z⟩ first. For σ_z, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩. Let's compute this. 

So the vector |ψ⟩ is [0.5, √3/2]^T. Applying σ_z to |ψ⟩ gives [1*0.5, -1*(√3/2)] = [0.5, -√3/2]. Then taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2], so:

0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5. Multiply that by 10 gives -5.

Next, compute ⟨σ_x⟩.

I need to calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me consider how expectation values are determined in quantum mechanics.

The expectation value of an operator is found by calculating ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for an operator O. In this specific case, I need to evaluate ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩.

First, I'll identify the given state. The ket vector |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. The corresponding bra vector ⟨ψ| is 0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓| since the coefficients are real numbers.

For the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, I can utilize the linearity of expectation values and split this into 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩, calculating each component separately.

Recalling the matrix representations, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]] and σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are represented by [1, 0]^T and [0, 1]^T respectively.

Therefore, |ψ⟩ can be written as the vector [0.5, √3/2]^T. I can verify this is normalized by checking that (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1.

Let me first calculate ⟨σ_z⟩. When σ_z is applied to |ψ⟩, I get [0.5, -√3/2]. Taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2]:

0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = -0.5

So ⟨σ_z⟩ equals -0.5, and multiplying by 10 gives -5.

Now I need to compute ⟨σ_x⟩.

Alright, I need to determine the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-1/2 particle in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me recall how to compute expectation values in quantum mechanics.

The expectation value of an operator is found by taking the bra vector, multiplying it by the operator, and then by the ket vector, expressed as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for some operator O. In this scenario, I need to determine ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩.

First, let me express the given state. The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. To form the bra vector ⟨ψ|, I perform a conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients are real, ⟨ψ| becomes 0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|.

The operator is 10σ_z + 5σ_x. Due to the linearity of expectation value calculation, I can separate this into 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ for simplicity, allowing me to calculate each expectation value separately and then combine them.

Let me recall the matrix forms of σ_z and σ_x, the Pauli matrices. σ_z is diagonal with entries 1 and -1, meaning σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. σ_x, on the other hand, is off-diagonal with entries 1 and 1, meaning σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]].

The state |↑⟩ corresponds to the column vector [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ to [0, 1]^T. Representing |ψ⟩ as a vector with the coefficients 0.5 and √3/2, we have |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T. Let’s verify normalization: the sum of squares of the coefficients should equal 1. Calculating, (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yes, it is indeed normalized. Great.

Now, let's calculate ⟨σ_z⟩. For σ_z, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩. Let’s compute this.

The vector |ψ⟩ is [0.5, √3/2]^T. Applying σ_z to |ψ⟩ results in [1*0.5, -1*(√3/2)] = [0.5, -√3/2]. Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2]:

0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ equals -0.5. Multiplying that by 10 gives -5.

Next, I’ll calculate ⟨σ_x⟩.

So σ_x|ψ⟩ = [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(√3/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(√3/2) ] = [√3/2, 0.5]. Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n\n0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5) = (0.5*√3)/2 + (√3*0.5)/2 = (√3/4 + √3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nBut let me check that again. Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T, it becomes [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product with ⟨ψ| is 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5) = (0.5*√3/2) + (0.5*√3/2) = 0.5*√3/2 * 2 = 0.5*√3. Wait, no.

So 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. \n\nAdding them: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the expectation value is -0.7. \n\nBut let me double-check the calculation for ⟨σ_x⟩. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward way. \n\nAlternatively, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z is the difference in probabilities of spin-up and spin-down. The coefficients squared give the probabilities. Probability of up is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, probability of down is (√3/2)^2 = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.\n\nFor σ_x, the expectation value can be calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Since σ_x is the spin operator in x-direction, which flips the spin. Alternatively, using the matrix multiplication as we did before, but another way is to express the state in terms of eigenstates of σ_x. However, maybe that's more complicated. Let's stick with the matrix calculation.\n\nExpressed as vectors:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T.\n\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [ [0,1;1,0] ] * [0.5; √3/2] = [√3/2; 0.5].\n\nThen ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. \n\nThus, total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. \n\nBut let me check if the question said up to one decimal place.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **State Representation**:
   The given state is \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). This can be represented as a vector:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_z\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_z | \psi \rangle = 0.5^2 \cdot 1 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Therefore, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5\).

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Applying \(\sigma_x\) to \(|\psi\rangle\) gives:
   \[
   \sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   Therefore, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33\).

4. **Total Expectation Value**:
   Combining the results, the total expectation value is:
   \[
   10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounded to one decimal place, this is \(-0.7\).

Thus, the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

Similarly, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. 

First, apply σ_x to |ψ⟩. σ_x swaps the components and adds a 1 in each off-diagonal. So σ_x|ψ⟩ = [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(√3/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(√3/2) ] = [√3/2, 0.5]. Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5) = (0.5*√3)/2 + (√3*0.5)/2 = (√3/4 + √3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

But let me check that again. Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T, it becomes [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product with ⟨ψ| is 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5) = (0.5*√3/2) + (0.5*√3/2) = 0.5*√3/2 * 2 = 0.5*√3. Wait, no. Let's compute each term:

First term: 0.5 (from ⟨ψ| first component) multiplied by √3/2 (from σ_x|ψ⟩ first component) gives 0.5*(√3/2) = √3/4.

Second term: (√3/2) (from ⟨ψ| second component) multiplied by 0.5 (from σ_x|ψ⟩ second component) gives (√3/2)*0.5 = √3/4.

So total is √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So ⟨σ_x⟩ is √3/2. Multiply that by 5 gives 5*(√3)/2 ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Therefore, the total expectation value is 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.

First, for ⟨σ_z⟩:

⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) + (√3/2)(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10*(-0.5) = -5. That seems right.

For ⟨σ_x⟩:

⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (0.5*√3)/2 + (0.5*√3)/2 = (√3)/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. 

Adding them: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the expectation value is -0.7. 

But let me double-check the calculation for ⟨σ_x⟩. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward way. 

Alternatively, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z is the difference in probabilities of spin-up and spin-down. The coefficients squared give the probabilities. Probability of up is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, probability of down is (√3/2)^2 = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.

For σ_x, the expectation value can be calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Since σ_x is the spin operator in x-direction, which flips the spin. Alternatively, using the matrix multiplication as we did before, but another way is to express the state in terms of eigenstates of σ_x. However, maybe that's more complicated. Let's stick with the matrix calculation.

Expressed as vectors:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]^T.

σ_x|ψ⟩ = [ [0,1;1,0] ] * [0.5; √3/2] = [√3/2; 0.5].

Then ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. 

Thus, total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. 

But let me check if the question said up to one decimal place. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7. So the answer should be -0.7. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's another method. For example, expressing the operator in terms of the state's components. But I think the method I used is correct. Alternatively, maybe using the Bloch sphere representation. The expectation values of σ_z and σ_x can be related to the components of the Bloch vector.

Given the state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. The general form of a spin-1/2 state is cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. Here, since there's no phase factor (all coefficients are real and positive), φ=0. So θ is such that cos(θ/2) = 0.5, sin(θ/2) = √3/2. 

So cos(θ/2) = 0.5, which implies θ/2 = π/3, so θ = 2π/3. Therefore, the polar angle is 120 degrees. The Bloch vector points in the direction with polar angle θ = 2π/3 and azimuthal angle φ=0. 

The expectation value of σ_z is cosθ = cos(2π/3) = -0.5, which matches our previous result. The expectation value of σ_x is sinθ cosφ = sin(2π/3)*cos(0) = (√3/2)*1 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, which also matches. Therefore, ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2 ≈ -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670, so -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **State Normalization Check**:
   The given state is normalized since:
   \[
   (0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
   \]

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 - \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Therefore, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5\).

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   The operator \(\sigma_x\) swaps the components of the state vector. Applying \(\sigma_x\) to the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\) gives \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle + 0.5|\downarrow\rangle\). The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \times 0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   Therefore, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times 0.866 \approx 4.33\).

4. **Total Expectation Value**:
   Adding the contributions from \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\):
   \[
   \text{Expectation Value} = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounded to one decimal place, this is \(-0.7\).

The final expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

Adding the two results together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, actually, the formula for ⟨σ_x⟩ is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩, which is a*b* + b*a* since σ_x flips the spin. Since the coefficients are real here, this becomes 2ab. So substituting a = 0.5 and b = √3/2, then 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = (1)*(√3/2) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. That\'s correct.\n\nAdding them gives -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Hmm, but wait, the question says "up to one decimal place," so -0.7.

If we compute this exactly, (5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33. So yes, same result. So the exact expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. If they want the decimal to one place, it\'s -0.7. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign? Let me check σ_x. The matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when it acts on |↑⟩ = [1,0]^T, it gives [0,1]^T which is |↓⟩, and on |↓⟩ = [0,1]^T, it gives [1,0]^T which is |↑⟩. Therefore, σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x*(0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩) = 0.5 |↓⟩ + √3/2 |↑⟩. Then, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2⟨↓|)(0.5|↓⟩ + √3/2 |↑⟩). Multiplying this out: 0.5*√3/2 ⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ + √3/2 *0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩ + √3/2 *√3/2 ⟨↓|↑⟩. Since ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0 and ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0, the cross terms vanish. The remaining terms are 0.5*(√3/2)*1 + (√3/2)*0.5*1. So 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = same as before, √3/2. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. The expectation value is indeed -5 + 5*(√3)/2 ≈ -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670, which rounds to -0.7. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-0.7}\n\nBut let me check once again if I made a mistake in the operator coefficients. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x, so 10 times σ_z and 5 times σ_x. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. All steps seem correct. So, I think the answer is indeed -0.7.\n\nWait, but let me compute it in another way. Let\'s write the density matrix.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **State Representation**:
   The given state is \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\). The corresponding bra vector is \(\langle\psi| = 0.5\langle\uparrow| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\langle\downarrow|\).

2. **Pauli Matrices**:
   - \(\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)
   - \(\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   \[
   \langle\sigma_z\rangle = |0.5|^2 - \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Multiplying by 10:
   \[
   10 \langle\sigma_z\rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   Applying \(\sigma_x\) to \(|\psi\rangle\) swaps the components:
   \[
   \sigma_x|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle
   \]
   The inner product with \(\langle\psi|\) gives:
   \[
   \langle\psi|\sigma_x|\psi\rangle = 0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   Multiplying by 5:
   \[
   5 \langle\sigma_x\rangle = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33
   \]

5. **Combining Results**:
   \[
   \text{Expectation value} = 10 \langle\sigma_z\rangle + 5 \langle\sigma_x\rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounded to one decimal place:
   \[
   \boxed{-0.7}
   \]

Similarly, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Applying σ_x to |ψ⟩, which swaps the components. So σ_x|ψ⟩ = [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (0.5*√3/2) + (0.5*√3/2) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

Therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩ is √3/2. Multiplying that by 5 gives approximately 5*(0.866) ≈ 4.33.

Adding the two results together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.

Wait a second, let me verify my calculations again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck ⟨σ_z⟩:

The expectation value is |a|^2 - |b|^2 where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Here, |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Therefore, 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's correct. So 10*(-0.5) = -5. That's right.

For σ_x, the expectation value is 2*Re(a*b*) where a and b are the coefficients. Wait, actually, the formula for ⟨σ_x⟩ is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩, which is a*b* + b*a* since σ_x flips the spin. Since the coefficients are real here, this becomes 2ab. So substituting a = 0.5 and b = √3/2, then 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = (1)*(√3/2) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. That's correct.

Adding them gives -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Hmm, but wait, the question says "up to one decimal place," so -0.7. But let me check if √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. Then 5*0.8660 = 4.330. Then 4.330 - 5 = -0.670. So yes, -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact value? Let me check. The exact value would be 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. If we compute this exactly, (5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33. So yes, same result. So the exact expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. If they want the decimal to one place, it's -0.7. But let me confirm once more.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign? Let me check σ_x. The matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when it acts on |↑⟩ = [1,0]^T, it gives [0,1]^T which is |↓⟩, and on |↓⟩ = [0,1]^T, it gives [1,0]^T which is |↑⟩. Therefore, σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x*(0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩) = 0.5 |↓⟩ + √3/2 |↑⟩. Then, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2⟨↓|)(0.5|↓⟩ + √3/2 |↑⟩). Multiplying this out: 0.5*√3/2 ⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ + √3/2 *0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩ + √3/2 *√3/2 ⟨↓|↑⟩. Since ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0 and ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0, the cross terms vanish. The remaining terms are 0.5*(√3/2)*1 + (√3/2)*0.5*1. So 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = same as before, √3/2. So that's correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct. The expectation value is indeed -5 + 5*(√3)/2 ≈ -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670, which rounds to -0.7. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-0.7}

But let me check once again if I made a mistake in the operator coefficients. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x, so 10 times σ_z and 5 times σ_x. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. All steps seem correct. So, I think the answer is indeed -0.7.

Wait, but let me compute it in another way. Let's write the density matrix. The state |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| = [0.25, 0.5*sqrt(3)/2; 0.5*sqrt(3)/2, 3/4]. Then, compute 10σ_z +5σ_x. The operator is [[10*1 +5*0, 10*0 +5*1], [10*0 +5*1, 10*(-1) +5*0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Then, the expectation value is trace(ρ * operator).

Calculating each element:

The operator matrix:
[[10, 5],
 [5, -10]]

Density matrix ρ:
[[0.25, (sqrt(3)/4)],
 [(sqrt(3)/4), 0.75]]

Multiplying ρ and operator:

First element: 0.25*10 + (sqrt(3)/4)*5 = 2.5 + (5*sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 2.5 + (5*1.732)/4 ≈ 2.5 + 2.165 ≈ 4.665

Second element: 0.25*5 + (sqrt(3)/4)*(-10) = 1.25 - (10*sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 1.25 - (17.32)/4 ≈ 1.25 - 4.33 ≈ -3.08

Third element: (sqrt(3)/4)*10 + 0.75*5 = (10*sqrt(3))/4 + 3.75 ≈ (17.32)/4 + 3.75 ≈ 4.33 + 3.75 ≈ 8.08

Fourth element: (sqrt(3)/4)*5 + 0.75*(-10) = (5*sqrt(3))/4 - 7.5 ≈ 2.165 - 7.5 ≈ -5.335

But wait, actually, when calculating trace(ρ * operator), we need to compute the sum of the diagonal elements of the product matrix. So the trace is the first element plus the fourth element:

4.665 + (-5.335) = 4.665 - 5.335 ≈ -0.67 ≈ -0.7. So that's the same result.

Therefore, this confirms that the expectation value is approximately -0.7. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}
