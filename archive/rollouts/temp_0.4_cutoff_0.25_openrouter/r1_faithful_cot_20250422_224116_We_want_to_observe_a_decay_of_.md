# Original Question

We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Given that the decay probability of an atom within 100 minutes is 32%, we need to determine the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

1. **Exponential Distribution Assumption**:
   - The decay process is modeled using an exponential distribution with the survival function \( S(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \).
   - The probability of decay within 100 minutes is given as 32%, so \( 1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32 \).
   - Solving for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
     \]

2. **Conditional Probability Calculation**:
   - We need the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes.
   - Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this is equivalent to the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time 0:
     \[
     P(T \leq 150) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
     \]
   - Substituting \(\lambda\):
     \[
     e^{-150\lambda} = e^{-150 \left( -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \right)} = e^{\frac{150}{100} \ln(0.68)} = 0.68^{1.5}
     \]
   - Calculating \( 0.68^{1.5} \):
     \[
     0.68^{1.5} \approx 0.561
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439
     \]

3. **Final Result**:
   - The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The initial information is that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, right. I need to figure out the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200) given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

First, I remember that radioactive decay is usually modeled using an exponential distribution. The key property of the exponential distribution is that it's memoryless, which means the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. But wait, does that apply here? The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. If the process is exponential, then the survival probability S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Then the probability of decay within time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Let me solve for λ. So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. 

First, ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, ln(0.69) is about -0.3711, and ln(0.68) should be a bit more negative. Maybe around -0.38566? Let me check with a calculator. Hmm, 0.68 is e^x, so x = ln(0.68). Let's approximate. Since e^-0.4 ≈ 0.6703, which is less than 0.68. So maybe ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Let me confirm. e^-0.385 = 0.6805? Let's compute 0.385: e^-0.385 ≈ 1 - 0.385 + (0.385^2)/2 - (0.385^3)/6. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, use a calculator. But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can just keep it as ln(0.68) for now. 

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. So the decay rate is λ. Then, the survival probability after time t is e^(-λt). So, the probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-50λ). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability that it decays before 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed before 50 minutes, divided by the probability it survived until 50 minutes. 

Wait, since we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to compute the conditional probability. So, the conditional probability P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived until 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(survived until 50). 

But since the exponential distribution is memoryless, this should be equivalent to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from time 0. Wait, is that right? Because memoryless means that the remaining time to decay has the same distribution as a new atom. So, if it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. Hmm, so maybe the memoryless property still applies here. 

But let's check. Let's compute it both ways. First, using the definition. 

The conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50). Since S(t) = e^(-λt), S(200)/S(50) = e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150). Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ150). But λ was determined from the 100-minute decay probability: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100). Therefore, e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5. 

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. Let me compute 0.68^1.5. 

Alternatively, 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)). Let me compute ln(0.68) first. As before, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Then 1.5 * (-0.38566) ≈ -0.57849. Then e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56. Let me check: e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. So -0.57849 is between -0.5 and -0.6. Let's interpolate. 

At x = -0.5: 0.6065

At x = -0.6: 0.5488

Difference of 0.1 in x corresponds to difference of about -0.0577 in e^x.

So, from x = -0.5 to x = -0.57849, that's a delta x of -0.07849. So delta e^x ≈ (-0.0577 / 0.1) * (-0.07849) ≈ 0.0577 * 0.7849 ≈ 0.0453. So subtract that from 0.6065: 0.6065 - 0.0453 ≈ 0.5612. So approximately 0.5612. Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561. Therefore, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439. So approximately 43.9% probability. 

Alternatively, maybe compute 0.68^1.5. Since 0.68^1 = 0.68, 0.68^2 = 0.4624. So 0.68^1.5 is between 0.4624 and 0.68. Let's take the square root of 0.68^3. Wait, 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3). 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624 * 0.68. Let's compute that: 0.4624 * 0.68. 0.4 * 0.68 = 0.272, 0.0624 * 0.68 = 0.042432, so total 0.272 + 0.042432 = 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432). The square root of 0.314432. Since 0.56^2 = 0.3136, which is very close. So sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.561. So same result. Therefore, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439. So approximately 43.9%.

But let's check if this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not exponential? The question says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If we are not told the distribution, maybe we should assume it's a single atom with a fixed probability? Wait, but decay probabilities over time are typically modeled as exponential. However, sometimes people might model it with a fixed probability per unit time, but that's essentially the exponential distribution.

Alternatively, if it's a single atom, maybe the problem is using a geometric distribution? But in continuous time, the exponential is the equivalent. So I think the exponential assumption is safe here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a uniform distribution? For example, if the decay is equally likely to happen at any time within the 100 minutes, but that doesn't make sense because the probability is 32% within 100 minutes, but then after 100 minutes, the probability would be 32%? That doesn't align with typical decay models. So I think the exponential is the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a deterministic decay time? But that's not probabilistic then. So, given that the problem mentions decay probability, it's likely an exponential distribution.

Therefore, proceeding with the exponential model.

So, given that λ = -ln(0.68)/100, then the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 43.9%.

But let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute λ first.

Given that 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}

So, e^{-100λ} = 0.68

Take natural logarithm:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-150λ} = 1 - e^{-150 * 0.0038566} = 1 - e^{-0.57849}

We already approximated e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.561, so 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, so 43.9%.

Alternatively, using a calculator for better precision. Let's compute 0.57849.

But perhaps using the exact value. Let's use the fact that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.

So λ = 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.003856625 per minute.

Then, 150 minutes: 150 * 0.003856625 ≈ 0.57849375.

Compute e^{-0.57849375}:

Using a Taylor series expansion around 0:

e^{-x} = 1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 - x^5/120 + ...

But x = 0.57849375

Compute up to x^5:

1 - 0.57849375 + (0.57849375)^2 / 2 - (0.57849375)^3 / 6 + (0.57849375)^4 / 24 - (0.57849375)^5 / 120

First term: 1

Second term: -0.57849375

Third term: (0.57849375)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.3347) / 2 ≈ 0.16735

Fourth term: -(0.57849375)^3 / 6 ≈ -(0.57849^3) ≈ 0.57849 * 0.3347 ≈ 0.1934; 0.1934 * 0.57849 ≈ 0.1117; then /6 ≈ -0.0186

Fifth term: (0.57849375)^4 /24 ≈ (0.1117 * 0.57849) ≈ 0.0646; /24 ≈ 0.00269

Sixth term: -(0.57849375)^5 /120 ≈ -(0.0646 * 0.57849) ≈ -0.0373; /120 ≈ -0.000311

Adding up all terms:

1 - 0.57849375 = 0.42150625

+ 0.16735 = 0.58885625

- 0.0186 = 0.57025625

+ 0.00269 = 0.57294625

- 0.000311 = 0.57263525

So e^{-0.57849375} ≈ 0.5726. Hmm, but this is conflicting with the previous estimate of 0.561. Wait, maybe the Taylor series approximation isn't sufficient here because x is not that small. Alternatively, perhaps the error accumulates. Alternatively, use a better approximation.

Alternatively, use the fact that e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, e^{-0.6} ≈ 0.5488. So at x=0.5, e^{-x}=0.6065; at x=0.6, e^{-x}=0.5488. The difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, leading to a difference of about -0.0577 in e^{-x}. So for x=0.57849, which is 0.57849 - 0.5 = 0.07849 above x=0.5. So linearly interpolating, the decrease from x=0.5 to x=0.57849 would be (0.07849 / 0.1) * (-0.0577) ≈ 0.7849 * (-0.0577) ≈ -0.0453. Therefore, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 ≈ 0.5612, which matches our previous estimate. 

But according to the Taylor series up to the fifth term, we get 0.5726. That's a discrepancy. Maybe the Taylor series isn't converging well here. Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is needed. Let's try another approach.

We can use the relationship between e^{-0.57849} and known values. For example, note that 0.57849 is approximately 0.5 + 0.07849. So e^{-0.57849} = e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.07849}. We know e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, and e^{-0.07849} ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 - ... ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + 0.00308 ≈ 0.9246. Therefore, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9246 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0149, so total ≈ 0.54585 + 0.0149 ≈ 0.56075. So approximately 0.5608. That's closer to the linear interpolation. So maybe the Taylor series approach wasn't accurate enough. Therefore, taking e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.561, so 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, so 43.9%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.

But let's think again. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. But if the process is exponential, then the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so λ is set accordingly. Then, given that the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-λ*150}, which we calculated as ~43.9%. 

Alternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but follows some other distribution, the result could be different. For example, if the decay must happen exactly at some fixed time, but that's not probabilistic. Or if the decay has a uniform probability over the 100 minutes, but that would mean that after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 100%, which contradicts the idea of probability 32% within 100 minutes. So, uniform distribution doesn't make sense here. 

Alternatively, maybe the decay follows a geometric distribution in discrete time intervals. But the problem is in continuous time. So, I think the exponential assumption is the only viable one here. 

Alternatively, maybe the 32% probability within 100 minutes is a one-time probability, not a rate. For example, if the atom has a 32% chance to decay at some point in the first 100 minutes, and if it doesn't decay, then it never will. But that seems unrealistic for atomic decay, which is typically a continuous process. So, I think that's not the case here.

Therefore, sticking with the exponential model, the answer should be approximately 43.9%. 

But let me check once again. Let's compute λ precisely. If 1 - e^{-100λ} = 0.32, then e^{-100λ} = 0.68, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let's compute ln(0.68) precisely. 

Using a calculator (approximating):

ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667

ln(0.69) ≈ -0.37106

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566

Yes, so λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, 150λ ≈ 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849

Then, e^{-0.57849} ≈ e^{-0.57} ≈ ?

e^{-0.5} = 0.6065

e^{-0.6} = 0.5488

Difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, leading to a difference of -0.0577 in e^{-x}

0.57 is 0.07 above 0.5, so e^{-0.57} ≈ 0.6065 - 0.07*(0.0577)/0.1 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.07*0.577 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0404 ≈ 0.5661

Similarly, 0.57849 is 0.07849 above 0.5, so e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.6065 - 0.07849*(0.0577)/0.1 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.07849*0.577 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 ≈ 0.5612

So, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, so approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 43.9%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check if there's another approach. Suppose we model it using the exponential distribution, the survival function S(t) = e^{-λt}. The conditional probability we need is P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)] / P(T > 50) = [F(200) - F(50)] / [1 - F(50)], where F(t) is the CDF, which is 1 - S(t). 

So substituting, [ (1 - e^{-200λ}) - (1 - e^{-50λ}) ] / (e^{-50λ}) ) = [e^{-50λ} - e^{-200λ}]/e^{-50λ} = 1 - e^{-150λ}, which is the same result as before. Therefore, the memoryless property gives us that the conditional probability is the same as the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. Wait, but in this case, the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay probability within 150 minutes would be different. Wait, but according to the memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. But in this case, the original atom had a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. So if we use the same λ, then the decay probability within 150 minutes would be 1 - e^{-150λ} ≈ 43.9%, which is higher than 32%, which makes sense because 150 minutes is longer than 100 minutes. 

But the problem is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes (from now, which is after 50 minutes have already passed), so total time from the start would be 200 minutes. Wait, but the original data is only about 100 minutes. So we have to be careful here. If the process is exponential, then the λ is constant, so the probability of decaying within any interval only depends on the length of the interval, not on the starting point. However, the problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, but we don't have information about longer times. However, assuming the exponential model, we can extrapolate. 

But if we didn't assume the exponential model, and instead, for example, the decay can only happen within the first 100 minutes with 32% probability, and after that, it never decays, then the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes would be the probability that it decays between 50 and 100 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. In that case, since the total decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, the conditional probability would be (0.32 - P(decay in first 50 minutes)) / (1 - P(decay in first 50 minutes)). But we don't know P(decay in first 50 minutes) unless we assume a distribution. 

This is a critical point. The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we don't assume exponential decay, we can't determine the probability for other time intervals. But given that it's a single atom, the exponential distribution is the standard model. So I think the question expects us to use the exponential model. 

Therefore, under the exponential assumption, the answer is approximately 43.9%. 

But let me check once more with precise calculation. 

Given:

Probability of decay within 100 minutes: P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}

Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.385662/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute

Then, the probability of decay within 150 minutes is P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^{-150λ} ≈ 1 - e^{-0.578493} ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, so 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or 0.439. Depending on the required precision, maybe we need to compute it more accurately. 

Alternatively, use the exact expression: 1 - 0.68^(150/100) = 1 - 0.68^1.5. 

Compute 0.68^1.5:

First, take natural log: ln(0.68^1.5) = 1.5 * ln(0.68) ≈ 1.5 * (-0.385662) ≈ -0.578493

Exponentiate: e^{-0.578493} ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388. 

Alternatively, using logarithm base 10:

log10(0.68) ≈ -0.1675 (since 10^-0.1675 ≈ 0.68)

Then, 0.68^1.5 = 10^(1.5 * log10(0.68)) ≈ 10^(1.5 * -0.1675) ≈ 10^(-0.25125) ≈ 10^(-0.25 - 0.00125) ≈ 10^-0.25 * 10^-0.00125 ≈ 0.5623 * 0.9971 ≈ 0.5609, so 1 - 0.5609 ≈ 0.4391. 

So again, approximately 43.9%. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. Rounded to one decimal place, 43.9%, which is 43.9%. 

Alternatively, if the problem expects an exact expression, it might be 1 - (0.68)^(3/2). But as a numerical value, approximately 43.9%. 

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%. 

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The initial information is that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, right. I need to figure out the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200) given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

First, I remember that radioactive decay is usually modeled using an exponential distribution. The key property of the exponential distribution is that it's memoryless, which means the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. But wait, does that apply here? The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. If the process is exponential, then the survival probability S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Then the probability of decay within time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Let me solve for λ. So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. 

First, ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, ln(0.69) is about -0.3711, and ln(0.68) should be a bit more negative. Maybe around -0.38566? Let me check with a calculator. Hmm, 0.68 is e^x, so x = ln(0.68). Let's approximate. Since e^-0.4 ≈ 0.6703, which is less than 0.68. So maybe ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Let me confirm. e^-0.385 = 0.6805? Let's compute 0.385: e^-0.385 ≈ 1 - 0.385 + (0.385^2)/2 - (0.385^3)/6. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, use a calculator. But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can just keep it as ln(0.68) for now. 

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. So the decay rate is λ. Then, the survival probability after time t is e^(-λt). So, the probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-50λ). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability that it decays before 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed before 50 minutes, divided by the probability it survived until 50 minutes. 

Wait, since we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to compute the conditional probability. So, the conditional probability P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived until 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(survived until 50). 

But since the exponential distribution is memoryless, this should be equivalent to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from time 0. Wait, is that right? Because memoryless means that the remaining time to decay has the same distribution as a new atom. So, if it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. Hmm, so maybe the memoryless property still applies here. 

But let's check. Let's compute it both ways. First, using the definition. 

The conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50). Since S(t) = e^(-λt), S(200)/S(50) = e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150). Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ150). But λ was determined from the 100-minute decay probability: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100). Therefore, e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5. 

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. Let me compute 0.68^1.5. 

Alternatively, 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)). Let me compute ln(0.68) first. As before, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Then 1.5 * (-0.38566) ≈ -0.57849. Then e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56. Let me check: e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. So -0.57849 is between -0.5 and -0.6. Let's interpolate. 

At x = -0.5: 0.6065

At x = -0.6: 0.5488

Difference of 0.1 in x corresponds to difference of about -0.0577 in e^x.

So, from x = -0.5 to x = -0.57849, that's a delta x of -0.07849. So delta e^x ≈ (-0.0577 / 0.1) * (-0.07849) ≈ 0.05

Alright, let me analyze this problem about radioactive decay probability. I need to determine the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed during the first 50 minutes. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.

I need to calculate the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200), conditional on no decay occurring in the first 50 minutes.

Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which has the memoryless property. This means the probability of future decay doesn't depend on how long the atom has already survived. The survival probability function is S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, and the probability of decay within time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, I can write: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Solving for λ: e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so -100λ = ln(0.68), and λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

I'll estimate ln(0.68). Since ln(0.7) ≈ -0.3567 and ln(0.69) ≈ -0.3711, ln(0.68) should be around -0.38566.

Using the conditional probability formula: P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived until 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(survived until 50).

Due to the memoryless property, this equals the probability that a fresh atom decays within 150 minutes. Mathematically: [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50) = 1 - e^(-λ150).

Since e^(-100λ) = 0.68, then e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100), so e^(-150λ) = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. Computing 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) ≈ e^(1.5 * (-0.38566)) ≈ e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.56.

Between e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065 and e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488, with interpolation for -0.57849, I estimate the value to be approximately 0.56.

Sure, let's look at this. The problem involves finding the probability that an atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Initially, we know that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, I need to determine the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200) given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

I recall that radioactive decay is often modeled using an exponential distribution, characterized by its memoryless property. This means the probability of decaying in a future time interval is independent of the elapsed time. But does that apply here? The problem specifies a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. If it's an exponential process, the survival probability S(t) = e^(-λt), with λ being the decay constant. Thus, the probability of decay within time t equals 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Since the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32, we have 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Solving for λ, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. By taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let's calculate that.

First, ln(0.68). Remembering that ln(0.7) is roughly -0.3567 and ln(0.69) about -0.3711, ln(0.68) should be marginally more negative, perhaps around -0.38566? A calculator can confirm, but without one, I'll approximate it here. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. That's the decay rate λ. Then, survival probability after time t is e^(-λt). So, the survival probability after 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-50λ). Thus, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is the difference in survival probabilities before 200 and 50 minutes, divided by the survival probability at 50 minutes.

But given that it hasn’t decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need the conditional probability. Thus, the conditional probability P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived to 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(survived to 50).

Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this should equal the probability for an atom to decay within 150 minutes from the present. Is this right? Because the memoryless trait means that the remaining time to decay is distributed like that for a new atom. Therefore, if it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes equals the original probability for a new atom over 150 minutes. But hold on, the original decay probability was provided for 100 minutes. But, the memoryless property should suit our scenario.

Let's verify by computing both ways. Initially, using the definition:

The conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50). Given S(t) = e^(-λt), S(200)/S(50) equals e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150). Therefore, the conditional probability equals 1 - e^(-λ150). We determined λ from the 100-minute decay rate: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Thus, e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100). Consequently, e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5.

Thus, the conditional probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. Let's calculate 0.68^1.5.

Alternatively, compute 0.68^1.5 as e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)). Determine ln(0.68) first. As before, ln(0.68) is around -0.38566. Then 1.5 * (-0.38566) is approximately -0.57849. Thus, e^-0.57849 is close to 0.56.

Verify: e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065, e^-0.6 equals 0.5488. Thus, -0.57849 is situated between -0.5 and -0.6. Let's interpolate.

For x = -0.5: 0.6065

For x = -0.6: 0.5488

A 0.1 change in x nets a change of about -0.0577 in e^x.

So, transitioning from x = -0.5 to x = -0.57849 results in a delta x of -0.07849. Hence, delta e^x ≈ (-0.0577 / 0.1) * (-0.07849) ≈ 0.05.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.05 ≈ 0.5565. Wait, but actually, since the slope of e^x at x is e^x. The derivative is e^x. So, perhaps a linear approximation is not the best here. Alternatively, use Taylor series around x = -0.5.\n\nLet me take x = -0.5, f(x) = e^x = e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065\n\nf\'(x) = e^x ≈ 0.6065\n\nWe want to approximate f(x + Δx) where Δx = -0.07849\n\nSo f(-0.5 -0.07849) ≈ f(-0.5) + f\'(-0.5)(Δx) = 0.6065 + 0.6065*(-0.07849) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.6065*0.07849 ≈ 0.6065*(1 - 0.07849) ≈ 0.6065*0.9215 ≈ 0.6065*0.9 + 0.6065*0.0215 ≈ 0.54585 + 0.01303 ≈ 0.55888. So approximately 0.5589. Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5589. Therefore, 1 - 0.5589 ≈ 0.4411. So approximately 44.11% probability. \n\nBut wait, let\'s check if that\'s correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 0.68^1.5 directly. 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3). Let\'s compute 0.68^3: 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432). The square root of 0.3144. Let\'s see, sqrt(0.25) = 0.5, sqrt(0.36) = 0.6, so sqrt(0.3144) ≈ 0.56. Because 0.56^2 = 0.3136, which is very close to 0.3144. So sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So 44%. \n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 44%. But wait, the answer needs to be exact? The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So maybe we can compute it more precisely. Let\'s try.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute λ. Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. Therefore, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm: -100λ = ln(0.68). Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. \n\nThen, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes is equal to 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let\'s compute this value.\n\nFirst, compute λ*150: (-ln(0.68)/100)*150 = -1.5*ln(0.68). Therefore, the probability is 1 - e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) = 1 - 0.68^1.5. \n\nAs above, 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)).\n\nAlternatively, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). Let\'s compute sqrt(0.68). sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167, total ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%. \n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%. The problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, so 44%, or maybe 43.9%. But let me check if there\'s another approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. So, if we model this as an exponential distribution, then the half-life can be computed, but maybe we don\'t need to. The key is that after 50 minutes, due to memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. Wait, but the original data is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps we need to compute based on the same λ. \n\nWait, no. The memoryless property states that the remaining lifetime is the same as the original distribution. So, if the original distribution is exponential with decay constant λ, then the remaining time after 50 minutes is also exponential with the same λ. Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which is exactly what we computed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 - 0.68^(1.5). Let me compute 0.68^1.5 more accurately. Let\'s use logarithms. \n\nCompute ln(0.68):\n\nWe can use a calculator-like approach. Since ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, ln(0.69) ≈ -0.37106, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Let\'s take ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. Then 1.5 * ln(0.68) ≈ -0.578493. Then e^-0.578493. \n\nTo compute e^-0.578493:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around x = -0.5. Let me set x = -0.578493. Let\'s write x = -0.5 - 0.078493. Let me compute e^(-0.5 - 0.078493) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.078493. \n\nWe know e^-0.5 ≈ 0.60653066, and e^-0.078493 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + (0.078493^2)/2 - (0.078493^3)/6. \n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: -0.078493\n\nThird term: (0.078493)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.006161)/2 ≈ 0.0030805\n\nFourth term: -(0.078493)^3 / 6 ≈ - (0.000483)/6 ≈ -0.0000805\n\nAdding these up: 1 - 0.078493 + 0.0030805 - 0.0000805 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 = 0.921507 + 0.0030805 = 0.9245875 - 0.0000805 ≈ 0.924507. \n\nTherefore, e^-0.078493 ≈ 0.924507. Therefore, e^-0.578493 ≈ e^-0.5 * e^-0.078493 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.924507 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.9 = 0.5458776, 0.60653066 * 0.024507 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.02 = 0.0121306, 0.60653066 * 0.004507 ≈ 0.002733. So total ≈ 0.5458776 + 0.0121306 + 0.002733 ≈ 0.560741. Therefore, e^-0.578493 ≈ 0.560741. Therefore, 1 - 0.560741 ≈ 0.439259. So approximately 43.926%. \n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s another way to approach this problem without assuming the exponential distribution. The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we don\'t assume exponential distribution, maybe it\'s a different distribution? But usually, nuclear decay is modeled as exponential. However, the problem doesn\'t specify the distribution, so maybe we need to assume exponential. \n\nAlternatively, if we model it as a uniform distribution? But that\'s not typical. For a single atom, the decay is memoryless, so exponential is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a discrete time model? For example, treating each minute as a trial with constant probability. But that\'s more complicated and the problem doesn\'t specify that. \n\nGiven that in the problem statement, it\'s mentioned that we can obtain the atom from a beta decay of another atom and start monitoring right away. So, it\'s a single atom, so continuous time, so exponential distribution is appropriate. \n\nTherefore, proceeding with the exponential model, the probability is approximately 43.9%, which is 44% when rounded. \n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose we use exact computation. \n\nGiven that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Then the probability is 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - e^( (150/100)*ln(0.68) ) = 1 - 0.68^(1.5). \n\nSo 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) ≈ e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.56074. Therefore, 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926, so 0.43926, which is 43.926%, approximately 43.93%. \n\nBut since the original probability was given as 32%, which is two significant figures, maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures as well, so 44%. \n\nAlternatively, if we use more precise calculation for 0.68^1.5. Let\'s use logarithms. \n\nTake log base 10: log10(0.68) ≈ -0.1675 (since 10^(-0.1675) ≈ 0.68). Then 1.5 * log10(0.68) ≈ 1.5 * (-0.1675) ≈ -0.25125. Then 10^(-0.25125) ≈ 10^(-0.25) * 10^(-0.00125). 10^(-0.25) is 1 / 10^(0.25) ≈ 1 / 1.778 ≈ 0.5623. 10^(-0.00125) ≈ 1 - 0.00125 * ln(10) ≈ 1 - 0.00125*2.3026 ≈ 1 - 0.002878 ≈ 0.99712. Therefore, 0.5623 * 0.99712 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which is 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number, or 43.9% if one decimal place is acceptable. However, since the original data was given as 32% (two significant figures), perhaps 44% is appropriate. \n\nBut let me check again if there\'s another approach. Suppose we model it using the exponential distribution formula. \n\nThe formula for the conditional probability is:\n\nP(T ≤ t + s | T > s) = P(s < T ≤ t + s) / P(T > s) = [F(t + s) - F(s)] / [1 - F(s)] \n\nFor exponential distribution, F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Therefore,\n\n[ (1 - e^{-λ(t + s)}) - (1 - e^{-λ s}) ] / e^{-λ s} = [ -e^{-λ(t + s)} + e^{-λ s} ] / e^{-λ s} = 1 - e^{-λ t} \n\nTherefore, the conditional probability only depends on t, not on s. That\'s the memoryless property. Therefore, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it has survived 50 minutes is equal to the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. \n\nBut wait, in our case, the original data was given for 100 minutes. So if we compute the decay probability for 150 minutes from scratch, what is that?\n\nWait, but according to the exponential model, the decay probability in time t is 1 - e^{-λ t}. We know that 1 - e^{-100 λ} = 0.32. Therefore, λ is fixed. Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-150 λ} = 1 - (e^{-100 λ})^{1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393. \n\nSo regardless of the conditioning, due to memoryless property, it\'s the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 44%. However, to confirm, let\'s think if the problem expects a different approach. For example, maybe using conditional probability without assuming exponential distribution. \n\nBut the problem states that "we know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we don\'t assume exponential distribution, we don\'t have enough information to compute the conditional probability. Because in general, the conditional probability P(T < t + s | T > s) depends on the distribution. Without knowing the distribution, except for the probability at 100 minutes, we can\'t compute it. \n\nBut in the case of an atom\'s decay, the standard model is the exponential distribution, which is memoryless. Therefore, the problem expects us to use the exponential model. Hence, the answer is 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 43.9%, which is approximately 44%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use a different approach, such as geometric distribution in discrete time? For example, if we model time in minutes, and each minute the atom has a constant probability p of decaying. Then, the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 32%. Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes. \n\nBut this would be a different model. Let\'s explore this. \n\nIn the geometric distribution, the probability that the atom decays in minute k is (1 - p)^{k - 1} p. The probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 1 - (1 - p)^100 = 0.32. Therefore, (1 - p)^100 = 0.68. Therefore, 1 - p = 0.68^(1/100). Then p = 1 - 0.68^(1/100). Then, given that it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - (1 - p)^150. \n\nBut wait, in the geometric distribution, the memoryless property also holds. So, similar to the exponential case, the probability is 1 - (1 - p)^150. But since (1 - p) = 0.68^(1/100), then (1 - p)^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5, same as before.

Given that the decay probability of the atom within 100 minutes is 32%, we need to determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

1. **Exponential Distribution Model**:
   - The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so we have:
     \[
     1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32
     \]
   - Solving for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
     \]

2. **Conditional Probability**:
   - The probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is calculated using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution:
     \[
     P(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
     \]
   - Substituting \(\lambda\):
     \[
     \lambda \cdot 150 = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \cdot 150 = -1.5 \ln(0.68)
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     1 - e^{-1.5 \ln(0.68)} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}
     \]

3. **Calculation**:
   - Compute \(0.68^{1.5}\):
     \[
     0.68^{1.5} = e^{1.5 \ln(0.68)} \approx e^{-0.578493} \approx 0.5607
     \]
   - Thus, the probability is:
     \[
     1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.05 ≈ 0.5565. Wait, but actually, since the slope of e^x at x is e^x. The derivative is e^x. So, perhaps a linear approximation is not the best here. Alternatively, use Taylor series around x = -0.5.

Let me take x = -0.5, f(x) = e^x = e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065

f'(x) = e^x ≈ 0.6065

We want to approximate f(x + Δx) where Δx = -0.07849

So f(-0.5 -0.07849) ≈ f(-0.5) + f'(-0.5)(Δx) = 0.6065 + 0.6065*(-0.07849) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.6065*0.07849 ≈ 0.6065*(1 - 0.07849) ≈ 0.6065*0.9215 ≈ 0.6065*0.9 + 0.6065*0.0215 ≈ 0.54585 + 0.01303 ≈ 0.55888. So approximately 0.5589. Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5589. Therefore, 1 - 0.5589 ≈ 0.4411. So approximately 44.11% probability. 

But wait, let's check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 0.68^1.5 directly. 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3). Let's compute 0.68^3: 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432). The square root of 0.3144. Let's see, sqrt(0.25) = 0.5, sqrt(0.36) = 0.6, so sqrt(0.3144) ≈ 0.56. Because 0.56^2 = 0.3136, which is very close to 0.3144. So sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So 44%. 

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%. But wait, the answer needs to be exact? The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So maybe we can compute it more precisely. Let's try.

First, let's compute λ. Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. Therefore, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm: -100λ = ln(0.68). Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. 

Then, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is equal to 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let's compute this value.

First, compute λ*150: (-ln(0.68)/100)*150 = -1.5*ln(0.68). Therefore, the probability is 1 - e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) = 1 - 0.68^1.5. 

As above, 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)).

Alternatively, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). Let's compute sqrt(0.68). sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167, total ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%. 

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%. The problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, so 44%, or maybe 43.9%. But let me check if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since the problem mentions that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. So, if we model this as an exponential distribution, then the half-life can be computed, but maybe we don't need to. The key is that after 50 minutes, due to memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. Wait, but the original data is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps we need to compute based on the same λ. 

Wait, no. The memoryless property states that the remaining lifetime is the same as the original distribution. So, if the original distribution is exponential with decay constant λ, then the remaining time after 50 minutes is also exponential with the same λ. Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which is exactly what we computed. 

Therefore, the answer is 1 - 0.68^(1.5). Let me compute 0.68^1.5 more accurately. Let's use logarithms. 

Compute ln(0.68):

We can use a calculator-like approach. Since ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, ln(0.69) ≈ -0.37106, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. Let's take ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. Then 1.5 * ln(0.68) ≈ -0.578493. Then e^-0.578493. 

To compute e^-0.578493:

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x = -0.5. Let me set x = -0.578493. Let's write x = -0.5 - 0.078493. Let me compute e^(-0.5 - 0.078493) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.078493. 

We know e^-0.5 ≈ 0.60653066, and e^-0.078493 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + (0.078493^2)/2 - (0.078493^3)/6. 

Compute each term:

First term: 1

Second term: -0.078493

Third term: (0.078493)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.006161)/2 ≈ 0.0030805

Fourth term: -(0.078493)^3 / 6 ≈ - (0.000483)/6 ≈ -0.0000805

Adding these up: 1 - 0.078493 + 0.0030805 - 0.0000805 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 = 0.921507 + 0.0030805 = 0.9245875 - 0.0000805 ≈ 0.924507. 

Therefore, e^-0.078493 ≈ 0.924507. Therefore, e^-0.578493 ≈ e^-0.5 * e^-0.078493 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.924507 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.9 = 0.5458776, 0.60653066 * 0.024507 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.02 = 0.0121306, 0.60653066 * 0.004507 ≈ 0.002733. So total ≈ 0.5458776 + 0.0121306 + 0.002733 ≈ 0.560741. Therefore, e^-0.578493 ≈ 0.560741. Therefore, 1 - 0.560741 ≈ 0.439259. So approximately 43.926%. 

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%. 

But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem without assuming the exponential distribution. The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we don't assume exponential distribution, maybe it's a different distribution? But usually, nuclear decay is modeled as exponential. However, the problem doesn't specify the distribution, so maybe we need to assume exponential. 

Alternatively, if we model it as a uniform distribution? But that's not typical. For a single atom, the decay is memoryless, so exponential is the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a discrete time model? For example, treating each minute as a trial with constant probability. But that's more complicated and the problem doesn't specify that. 

Given that in the problem statement, it's mentioned that we can obtain the atom from a beta decay of another atom and start monitoring right away. So, it's a single atom, so continuous time, so exponential distribution is appropriate. 

Therefore, proceeding with the exponential model, the probability is approximately 43.9%, which is 44% when rounded. 

But let me check once more. Suppose we use exact computation. 

Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Then the probability is 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - e^( (150/100)*ln(0.68) ) = 1 - 0.68^(1.5). 

So 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) ≈ e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.56074. Therefore, 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926, so 0.43926, which is 43.926%, approximately 43.93%. 

But since the original probability was given as 32%, which is two significant figures, maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures as well, so 44%. 

Alternatively, if we use more precise calculation for 0.68^1.5. Let's use logarithms. 

Take log base 10: log10(0.68) ≈ -0.1675 (since 10^(-0.1675) ≈ 0.68). Then 1.5 * log10(0.68) ≈ 1.5 * (-0.1675) ≈ -0.25125. Then 10^(-0.25125) ≈ 10^(-0.25) * 10^(-0.00125). 10^(-0.25) is 1 / 10^(0.25) ≈ 1 / 1.778 ≈ 0.5623. 10^(-0.00125) ≈ 1 - 0.00125 * ln(10) ≈ 1 - 0.00125*2.3026 ≈ 1 - 0.002878 ≈ 0.99712. Therefore, 0.5623 * 0.99712 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, same as before. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which is 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number, or 43.9% if one decimal place is acceptable. However, since the original data was given as 32% (two significant figures), perhaps 44% is appropriate. 

But let me check again if there's another approach. Suppose we model it using the exponential distribution formula. 

The formula for the conditional probability is:

P(T ≤ t + s | T > s) = P(s < T ≤ t + s) / P(T > s) = [F(t + s) - F(s)] / [1 - F(s)] 

For exponential distribution, F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Therefore,

[ (1 - e^{-λ(t + s)}) - (1 - e^{-λ s}) ] / e^{-λ s} = [ -e^{-λ(t + s)} + e^{-λ s} ] / e^{-λ s} = 1 - e^{-λ t} 

Therefore, the conditional probability only depends on t, not on s. That's the memoryless property. Therefore, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it has survived 50 minutes is equal to the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. 

But wait, in our case, the original data was given for 100 minutes. So if we compute the decay probability for 150 minutes from scratch, what is that?

Wait, but according to the exponential model, the decay probability in time t is 1 - e^{-λ t}. We know that 1 - e^{-100 λ} = 0.32. Therefore, λ is fixed. Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-150 λ} = 1 - (e^{-100 λ})^{1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.4393. 

So regardless of the conditioning, due to memoryless property, it's the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. 

Therefore, the answer is 44%. However, to confirm, let's think if the problem expects a different approach. For example, maybe using conditional probability without assuming exponential distribution. 

But the problem states that "we know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we don't assume exponential distribution, we don't have enough information to compute the conditional probability. Because in general, the conditional probability P(T < t + s | T > s) depends on the distribution. Without knowing the distribution, except for the probability at 100 minutes, we can't compute it. 

But in the case of an atom's decay, the standard model is the exponential distribution, which is memoryless. Therefore, the problem expects us to use the exponential model. Hence, the answer is 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 43.9%, which is approximately 44%. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use a different approach, such as geometric distribution in discrete time? For example, if we model time in minutes, and each minute the atom has a constant probability p of decaying. Then, the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 32%. Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. 

But this would be a different model. Let's explore this. 

In the geometric distribution, the probability that the atom decays in minute k is (1 - p)^{k - 1} p. The probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 1 - (1 - p)^100 = 0.32. Therefore, (1 - p)^100 = 0.68. Therefore, 1 - p = 0.68^(1/100). Then p = 1 - 0.68^(1/100). Then, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - (1 - p)^150. 

But wait, in the geometric distribution, the memoryless property also holds. So, similar to the exponential case, the probability is 1 - (1 - p)^150. But since (1 - p) = 0.68^(1/100), then (1 - p)^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5, same as before. Therefore, the probability is again 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 43.9%. 

Therefore, regardless of whether we model it in continuous time (exponential) or discrete time (geometric), the result is the same, because both have the memoryless property. Therefore, the answer is approximately 44%. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{44\%}

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

Using a calculator: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.38566248 * 1.5 ≈ -0.57849372.\n\nCompute e^(-0.57849372). Let\'s compute this step by step.\n\nWe know that e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.57) = e^(-0.5 -0.07) ≈ e^(-0.5)*e^(-0.07) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9324 ≈ 0.5653. Similarly, e^(-0.57849) is slightly lower. Let\'s compute:\n\n0.57849 - 0.57 = 0.00849. The derivative of e^(-x) at x=0.57 is -e^(-0.57) ≈ -0.5653. So, the linear approximation: e^(-0.57 - 0.00849) ≈ e^(-0.57) - 0.00849 * e^(-0.57) ≈ 0.5653 - 0.00849*0.5653 ≈ 0.5653 - 0.0048 ≈ 0.5605. So approximately 0.5605.\n\nTherefore, e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5605, so 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395, or approximately 43.95%. So about 44%.\n\nAlternatively, since the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. So, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68. The memoryless property tells us that the survival probability for another 150 minutes after already surviving 50 minutes is the same as surviving 150 minutes from the start. Wait, but 150 minutes is longer than the original 100 minutes. Hmm, perhaps the model needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. The problem states that from previous experiments, the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, that\'s the cumulative probability up to t=100. So, the survival probability at t=100 is 0.68. If we model this as an exponential distribution, then S(t) = e^(-λt). So, S(100) = 0.68, which gives us λ as previously. But the question is, after 50 minutes of survival, what\'s the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., up to t=200). So, the conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50). But S(200)/S(50) = e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150). So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ150). Since we know e^(-λ100) = 0.68, then e^(-λ150) = (e^(-λ100))^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5. So, 1 - 0.68^1.5. That\'s the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn\'t use the exponential model, but another distribution? The problem doesn\'t specify the distribution, but since it\'s a single atom, the exponential distribution is typically used (memoryless property). However, if the decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes, but we are to compute for 150 minutes, perhaps we can model it as a general survival function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use a simple probability approach without calculus. Let me think.\n\nIf the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes, then the survival probability at 100 minutes is 68%. If it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, we want the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (total time from start: 200 minutes). If we assume exponential decay, the memoryless property applies, so the remaining time is the same as starting fresh. Therefore, the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But we only have data for 100 minutes. So how can we relate 150 minutes to the given 32% decay probability?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay is modeled as a constant probability per unit time, which would imply a geometric distribution if time is discrete, or exponential if continuous. Since it\'s about continuous time, exponential is the way to go.\n\nSo, using the exponential model:\n\nGiven that P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32, so S(100) = 0.68. Then, S(t) = e^(-λt).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

Given that the decay probability of an atom within 100 minutes is 32%, we need to determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes.

1. **Exponential Distribution and Memoryless Property**:
   - The decay of an atom follows an exponential distribution, which has the memoryless property. This means the probability of decay in the future is independent of how long the atom has already survived.
   - The survival probability function is \( S(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \), where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

2. **Determine the Decay Constant \( \lambda \)**:
   - Given the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, we have:
     \[
     0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\lambda}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \lambda \):
     \[
     e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
     \]

3. **Conditional Probability Calculation**:
   - We need the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes:
     \[
     P(50 < T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = \frac{P(50 < T \leq 200)}{P(T > 50)} = \frac{S(50) - S(200)}{S(50)}
     \]
   - Using the memoryless property, this simplifies to:
     \[
     1 - \frac{S(200)}{S(50)} = 1 - e^{-\lambda (200 - 50)} = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
     \]

4. **Simplify Using Known Value**:
   - Since \( e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \), we have:
     \[
     e^{-150\lambda} = (e^{-100\lambda})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5}
     \]
   - Calculating \( 0.68^{1.5} \):
     \[
     0.68^{1.5} = \sqrt{0.68^3} \approx \sqrt{0.314432} \approx 0.5607
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393 \approx 43.93\%
     \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the probability is approximately 44%.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

So, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, or 44%.

But let me check this calculation more precisely.

First, calculate ln(0.68). Using a calculator: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

Multiply by 1.5: -0.38566248 * 1.5 ≈ -0.57849372.

Compute e^(-0.57849372). Let's compute this step by step.

We know that e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.57) = e^(-0.5 -0.07) ≈ e^(-0.5)*e^(-0.07) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9324 ≈ 0.5653. Similarly, e^(-0.57849) is slightly lower. Let's compute:

0.57849 - 0.57 = 0.00849. The derivative of e^(-x) at x=0.57 is -e^(-0.57) ≈ -0.5653. So, the linear approximation: e^(-0.57 - 0.00849) ≈ e^(-0.57) - 0.00849 * e^(-0.57) ≈ 0.5653 - 0.00849*0.5653 ≈ 0.5653 - 0.0048 ≈ 0.5605. So approximately 0.5605.

Therefore, e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5605, so 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395, or approximately 43.95%. So about 44%.

Alternatively, since the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. So, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 0.68. The memoryless property tells us that the survival probability for another 150 minutes after already surviving 50 minutes is the same as surviving 150 minutes from the start. Wait, but 150 minutes is longer than the original 100 minutes. Hmm, perhaps the model needs to be adjusted.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The problem states that from previous experiments, the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, that's the cumulative probability up to t=100. So, the survival probability at t=100 is 0.68. If we model this as an exponential distribution, then S(t) = e^(-λt). So, S(100) = 0.68, which gives us λ as previously. But the question is, after 50 minutes of survival, what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., up to t=200). So, the conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50). But S(200)/S(50) = e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150). So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ150). Since we know e^(-λ100) = 0.68, then e^(-λ150) = (e^(-λ100))^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5. So, 1 - 0.68^1.5. That's the same as before.

Alternatively, if we didn't use the exponential model, but another distribution? The problem doesn't specify the distribution, but since it's a single atom, the exponential distribution is typically used (memoryless property). However, if the decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes, but we are to compute for 150 minutes, perhaps we can model it as a general survival function.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use a simple probability approach without calculus. Let me think.

If the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes, then the survival probability at 100 minutes is 68%. If it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, we want the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (total time from start: 200 minutes). If we assume exponential decay, the memoryless property applies, so the remaining time is the same as starting fresh. Therefore, the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But we only have data for 100 minutes. So how can we relate 150 minutes to the given 32% decay probability?

Alternatively, perhaps the decay is modeled as a constant probability per unit time, which would imply a geometric distribution if time is discrete, or exponential if continuous. Since it's about continuous time, exponential is the way to go.

So, using the exponential model:

Given that P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32, so S(100) = 0.68. Then, S(t) = e^(-λt). So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it survived until 50 minutes, is:

P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)] / P(T > 50) = [1 - S(200) - (1 - S(50))] / S(50) = [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50).

Since S(200)/S(50) = e^(-λ200)/e^(-λ50) = e^(-λ150) = [e^(-λ100)]^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5}.

Calculating 0.68 raised to the power of 1.5:

First, take the natural logarithm: ln(0.68^1.5) = 1.5 * ln(0.68) ≈ 1.5 * (-0.385662) ≈ -0.578493.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5615.

Therefore, 1 - 0.5615 ≈ 0.4385, so approximately 43.85%.

Alternatively, compute 0.68^1.5 directly:

0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3) = sqrt(0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68). Let's compute 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624. Then, 0.4624 * 0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.

So, approximately 44%.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after already 50 minutes have passed. So, total time from the start would be 200 minutes. However, the original information is that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. If the decay process isn't memoryless, then we cannot directly extrapolate. However, the problem doesn't specify any other distribution, so assuming exponential decay is the way to go here. Hence, the answer is approximately 44%.

Alternatively, if we model it as a uniform distribution over 100 minutes? Wait, but that would not be appropriate for a single atom. The uniform distribution would imply a constant hazard rate, but in reality, for a single atom, the decay time is exponentially distributed. So, the exponential assumption is correct here.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

But let me check again. If I compute 0.68^1.5 more accurately.

0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln 0.68) ≈ e^(-0.578493). Let's compute this exponent:

We can write -0.578493 = -0.5 -0.078493. So, e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.078493). e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066, e^(-0.078493) ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 - ... Using Taylor series approximation:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6, where x = -0.078493.

Compute:

1 + (-0.078493) + (0.0061613)/2 + (-0.000483)/6 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + 0.0030806 - 0.0000805 ≈ 1 - 0.078493 = 0.921507 + 0.0030806 = 0.9245876 - 0.0000805 ≈ 0.9245071.

Therefore, e^(-0.078493) ≈ 0.9245071.

Multiply by e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.9245071 ≈ Let's compute:

0.6 * 0.9245071 ≈ 0.554704

0.00653066 * 0.9245071 ≈ approximately 0.00605

Total ≈ 0.554704 + 0.00605 ≈ 0.560754.

Thus, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.560754, so 1 - 0.560754 ≈ 0.439246, which is approximately 43.92%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%, which is 43.9% or roughly 44%.

Alternatively, using a calculator for more precise calculation:

0.68^1.5:

First, 0.68^1 = 0.68

0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246211

Then, 0.68 * 0.8246211 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544; 0.68 * 0.0246211 ≈ 0.016742. So total ≈ 0.544 + 0.016742 ≈ 0.560742.

Therefore, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.560742, so 1 - 0.560742 ≈ 0.439258, so 43.9258%, which is 43.93%.

Rounding to two decimal places, 43.9%, but the question might expect rounding to whole number percentage, so 44%.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's think again.

Suppose the decay is not exponential. Suppose it's a fixed probability per unit time, but not memoryless. However, without more information, we can't assume another distribution. The problem states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If we have no other information, perhaps it's a uniform distribution over 100 minutes? But that would mean the probability density is constant from t=0 to t=100, and zero afterward. But then the survival function would decrease linearly. However, this is not typical for atomic decay, which is memoryless. But let's check.

If the decay time is uniformly distributed over 0 to T, where T is such that P(t ≤ 100) = 0.32. Wait, but if it's uniform, then the cumulative distribution function (CDF) would be F(t) = t / T for 0 ≤ t ≤ T. Then, F(100) = 100 / T = 0.32, so T = 100 / 0.32 ≈ 312.5 minutes. Then, the survival function S(t) = 1 - t / 312.5 for t ≤ 312.5. Then, given that the atom survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is:

P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [F(200) - F(50)] / S(50).

But F(200) = 200 / 312.5 ≈ 0.64, F(50) = 50 / 312.5 = 0.16, S(50) = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84.

Thus, [0.64 - 0.16]/0.84 = 0.48 / 0.84 ≈ 0.5714, or 57.14%.

But this contradicts the exponential model. However, the problem does not specify the distribution, so unless specified, we should assume the standard model for radioactive decay, which is exponential. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 44%.

But since the problem mentions "decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes", maybe they consider non-exponential? Hmm, but for a single atom, exponential is standard. If it were a large number of atoms, you could model it differently, but for a single atom, the exponential distribution is the only one with constant hazard rate, which is typical for quantum processes like decay.

Therefore, I think the intended answer is 44%.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

So yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln 0.68). Let me compute ln(0.68) precisely. Using calculator-like steps: ln(0.68) ≈ ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - ... but that's a Taylor series for ln(1 - x) around x=0. But 0.32 is not that small. Alternatively, use exact value.\n\nBut perhaps better to use exact computation. Let me recall that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248. So, 1.5 * (-0.38566248) ≈ -0.5784937. Then, e^-0.5784937 ≈ 0.561. Therefore, 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, so approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Let's check with another approach. Suppose we model the decay with the exponential distribution. The key is that the 32% decay probability in 100 minutes gives us the parameter λ. Then, given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from a new atom. Wait, but 150 minutes is longer than 100 minutes. So, if the original 100-minute decay probability is 32%, then the 150-minute decay probability would be higher. However, due to memorylessness, even though we've already waited 50 minutes, the remaining time is still exponential with the same rate. Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as a new atom decaying in 150 minutes. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But wait, the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Therefore, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68, so e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(1.5) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.561, so decay probability is 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the process is not exponential, but follows some other distribution, the answer would be different. But the problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, but doesn't specify the distribution. However, in physics, radioactive decay is typically modeled as a Poisson process, which leads to the exponential distribution. So assuming that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay had a different distribution, like a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes, but that's not physical. So, I think the intended answer is 44%. But let's check.\n\nWait, but if the decay was uniform over 100 minutes, which is not realistic, but suppose hypothetically, then the probability density function would be constant. But since the total probability is 32% over 100 minutes, the pdf would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining 50 minutes would have a total probability of 0.32 - 0.0032*50 = 0.32 - 0.16 = 0.16. But since the atom didn't decay in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability would be 0.16 / (1 - 0.16) = 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 0.1905, or 19.05%. But that's under a uniform distribution, which isn't the case here. So, the answer would be different. But the problem doesn't mention uniform distribution.\n\nSince the problem mentions decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes, and given that radioactive decay is memoryless, we should proceed with the exponential model. Therefore, the answer is approximately 44%.\n\nWait, but let's check the calculation again. Let me compute 0.68^1.5 more accurately.\n\n0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln 0.68). Let's compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.38566248 * 1.5 = -0.57849372.\n\nThen e^-0.57849372 ≈ ?\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x = -0.5:\n\ne^(-0.5 - 0.07849372) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849372.\n\nWe know e^-0.5 ≈ 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.07849372 ≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.07849372)^2 / 2 - (0.07849372)^3 / 6 + ...\n\nCalculating up to the second term:\n\n≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.00616)/2 ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + 0.00308 ≈ 0.92459.\n\nThird term: -(0.07849372)^3 / 6 ≈ - (0.000483) / 6 ≈ -0.0000805.\n\nSo, e^-0.07849372 ≈ 0.92459 - 0.0000805 ≈ 0.92451.\n\nTherefore, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.92451 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.9 ≈ 0.5458776, plus 0.60653066 * 0.02451 ≈ 0.01486. Total ≈ 0.5458776 + 0.01486 ≈ 0.56073.\n\nThus, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%, which is 43.9%, so 44% when rounded.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 44%.\n\nAlternatively, if we use a calculator for e^-0.57849372, let's check:\n\nWe know that ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is higher than e^-0.6931 = 0.5. Let's compute e^-0.5785:\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5612. Therefore, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 44%.\n\nBut another way to approach this problem is to use the fact that if the decay follows an exponential distribution, then the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is equal to the unconditional probability that it decays in 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property. Wait, but the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if the process is memoryless, then the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a new atom, so we need to compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. But how is that related to the given 100-minute decay probability?\n\nWait, the key is that the decay constant λ is determined from the 100-minute data.

Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ*150).

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we use the exponential decay model, which is characterized by its memoryless property. 

1. **Decay Probability Calculation**:
   - The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability \( S(100) = 0.68 \).
   - The survival function for an exponential distribution is \( S(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \).
   - Solving for the decay constant \( \lambda \):
     \[
     0.68 = e^{-100\lambda} \implies \ln(0.68) = -100\lambda \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \text{ per minute}
     \]

2. **Conditional Probability Calculation**:
   - The survival probability after 50 minutes is \( S(50) = e^{-50\lambda} \).
   - The survival probability after 200 minutes (50 + 150 minutes) is \( S(200) = e^{-200\lambda} \).
   - The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{S(50) - S(200)}{S(50)} = 1 - \frac{S(200)}{S(50)} = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
     \]
   - Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):
     \[
     1 - e^{-150 \times 0.0038566} = 1 - e^{-0.57849} \approx 1 - 0.5612 \approx 0.4388
     \]

3. **Final Probability**:
   - Converting this to a percentage, the probability is approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 44%.

Thus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \(\boxed{44\%}\).

Wait, no. The derivative of e^x is e^x. So, the linear approximation at x = -0.5:

e^(-0.5 - delta) ≈ e^-0.5 - e^-0.5 * delta. Let delta = 0.07849.

Thus, e^-0.57849 ≈ e^-0.5 * (1 - 0.07849). Since e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, 0.6065*(1 - 0.07849) ≈ 0.6065*0.9215 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.6065*0.0785 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0476 ≈ 0.5589.

Similarly, using x = -0.57849, e^x ≈ 0.56. Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56, so 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%.

But wait, let's check with exact calculation. If we have λ = -ln(0.68)/100, so λ = 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. Then, the decay rate over 150 minutes is λ*150 ≈ 0.0038566*150 ≈ 0.57849. Therefore, the survival probability is e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56 as before. Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, so 44%.

But wait, the original decay probability over 100 minutes was 32%. So, over 150 minutes, would the decay probability be higher? Let's see. If we have 0.68^1.5, which is sqrt(0.68^3). 0.68^3 is 0.68*0.68=0.4624, 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314. Then sqrt(0.314) ≈ 0.56. So yes, that's consistent.

Alternatively, let's compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln 0.68). Let me compute ln(0.68) precisely. Using calculator-like steps: ln(0.68) ≈ ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - ... but that's a Taylor series for ln(1 - x) around x=0. But 0.32 is not that small. Alternatively, use exact value.

But perhaps better to use exact computation. Let me recall that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248. So, 1.5 * (-0.38566248) ≈ -0.5784937. Then, e^-0.5784937 ≈ 0.561. Therefore, 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, so approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

But wait, is this correct? Let's check with another approach. Suppose we model the decay with the exponential distribution. The key is that the 32% decay probability in 100 minutes gives us the parameter λ. Then, given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from a new atom. Wait, but 150 minutes is longer than 100 minutes. So, if the original 100-minute decay probability is 32%, then the 150-minute decay probability would be higher. However, due to memorylessness, even though we've already waited 50 minutes, the remaining time is still exponential with the same rate. Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as a new atom decaying in 150 minutes. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But wait, the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Therefore, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68, so e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(1.5) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.561, so decay probability is 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, as before.

Alternatively, if the process is not exponential, but follows some other distribution, the answer would be different. But the problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, but doesn't specify the distribution. However, in physics, radioactive decay is typically modeled as a Poisson process, which leads to the exponential distribution. So assuming that is correct.

Alternatively, if the decay had a different distribution, like a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes, but that's not physical. So, I think the intended answer is 44%. But let's check.

Wait, but if the decay was uniform over 100 minutes, which is not realistic, but suppose hypothetically, then the probability density function would be constant. But since the total probability is 32% over 100 minutes, the pdf would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining 50 minutes would have a total probability of 0.32 - 0.0032*50 = 0.32 - 0.16 = 0.16. But since the atom didn't decay in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability would be 0.16 / (1 - 0.16) = 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 0.1905, or 19.05%. But that's under a uniform distribution, which isn't the case here. So, the answer would be different. But the problem doesn't mention uniform distribution.

Since the problem mentions decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes, and given that radioactive decay is memoryless, we should proceed with the exponential model. Therefore, the answer is approximately 44%.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again. Let me compute 0.68^1.5 more accurately.

0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln 0.68). Let's compute ln(0.68):

Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.

Multiply by 1.5: -0.38566248 * 1.5 = -0.57849372.

Then e^-0.57849372 ≈ ?

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x = -0.5:

e^(-0.5 - 0.07849372) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849372.

We know e^-0.5 ≈ 0.60653066.

e^-0.07849372 ≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.07849372)^2 / 2 - (0.07849372)^3 / 6 + ...

Calculating up to the second term:

≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.00616)/2 ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + 0.00308 ≈ 0.92459.

Third term: -(0.07849372)^3 / 6 ≈ - (0.000483) / 6 ≈ -0.0000805.

So, e^-0.07849372 ≈ 0.92459 - 0.0000805 ≈ 0.92451.

Therefore, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.92451 ≈ 0.60653066 * 0.9 ≈ 0.5458776, plus 0.60653066 * 0.02451 ≈ 0.01486. Total ≈ 0.5458776 + 0.01486 ≈ 0.56073.

Thus, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%, which is 43.9%, so 44% when rounded.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%.

Alternatively, if we use a calculator for e^-0.57849372, let's check:

We know that ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is higher than e^-0.6931 = 0.5. Let's compute e^-0.5785:

Using a calculator, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5612. Therefore, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 44%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 44%.

But another way to approach this problem is to use the fact that if the decay follows an exponential distribution, then the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is equal to the unconditional probability that it decays in 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property. Wait, but the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if the process is memoryless, then the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a new atom, so we need to compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. But how is that related to the given 100-minute decay probability?

Wait, the key is that the decay constant λ is determined from the 100-minute data. Once we have λ, we can compute the probability for any time. So, if we have:

Probability of decay within t minutes: P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that for t=100, P(100)=0.32, so λ = -ln(1 - 0.32)/100 = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, the probability of decay within 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.57849) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, so 43.88%.

But since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from the start, but adjusted by the survival up to 50 minutes. Wait, no. Wait, the memoryless property says that the remaining lifetime after surviving 50 minutes is the same as the original. Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But that would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But in this case, we have data for 100 minutes. Wait, but 150 minutes is longer than 100 minutes. So, the original data only tells us about the first 100 minutes, but the model (exponential) extrapolates beyond that.

Alternatively, if we didn't assume the exponential distribution, but only knew the 32% decay probability at 100 minutes, but nothing else, we might not have enough information. However, since the problem is likely assuming the exponential decay model, given that it's a standard approach in such problems, the answer should be 1 - 0.68^(150/100) ≈ 44%.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using conditional probability without assuming the exponential model. But how?

If we don't assume exponential decay, we need to model the decay process with some survival function S(t), where S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. But without knowing the form of S(t), we can't compute the conditional probability. However, in the absence of specific information, one might assume constant hazard rate (i.e., exponential distribution). Therefore, the answer is 44%.

Alternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but we have a different distribution. For example, if all decays happen exactly at 100 minutes, then the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes would be 100%, since it would decay at 100 minutes. But that's a degenerate case.

Alternatively, if the decay is uniform in 0 to 100 minutes, as I considered earlier, but that's not physical. So, given that the problem is about atomic decay, which is memoryless, the answer is 44%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.
