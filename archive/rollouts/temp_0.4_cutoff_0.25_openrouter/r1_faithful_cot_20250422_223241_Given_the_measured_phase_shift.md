To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts and partial wave analysis. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ = 0° is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l)
\]

Given phase shifts:
- \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\)
- \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\)
- \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\)
- \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\)
- \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\)

First, we calculate \(\sin^2(\delta_l)\) for each \(l\):

- For \(l = 0\): \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\)
- For \(l = 1\): \(\sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.847\)
- For \(l = 2\): \(\sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.671\)
- For \(l = 3\): \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\)
- For \(l = 4\): \(\sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.0506\)

Next, we compute each term \((2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\):

- \(l = 0\): \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l = 1\): \(3 \cdot 0.847 \approx 2.541\)
- \(l = 2\): \(5 \cdot 0.671 \approx 3.355\)
- \(l = 3\): \(7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\)
- \(l = 4\): \(9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.455\)

Summing these terms:

\[
1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.101
\]

The wave number \(k\) is calculated using the relativistic momentum \(p\) of 50 MeV electrons. Using \(E \approx 50\) MeV and \(\hbar c \approx 197.33\) MeV·fm:

\[
k \approx \frac{E}{\hbar c} \approx \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2534 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Thus, \(1/k \approx 3.946\) fm. Multiplying the sum by \(1/k\):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 9.101 \times 3.946 \approx 35.9 \text{ fm}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\boxed{36 \text{ fm}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest of the phase shifts can be ignored. Hmm, let me recall what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts.

First, I remember that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states (each with a specific angular momentum quantum number l). The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Since the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, that would be when θ = 0°, right? Because the incident beam direction is the forward direction.

So, first, I need to evaluate the scattering amplitude at θ = 0°, and then take its imaginary part. Let me write down the formula again for f(0°):

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(1) )

Because cosθ = cos0° = 1, and P_l(1) is the value of the Legendre polynomial at 1. I remember that P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So that simplifies things. Then, f(0) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l.

But we are supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So the sum will only go up to l=4. So we have l=0,1,2,3,4. Each term contributes (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l. Then multiply by 1/k.

But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0). So let's compute Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * Im[ e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l ]

Since e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, so multiplying by sinδ_l gives:

e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l = sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l

Therefore, the imaginary part of each term is sin²δ_l. Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l

Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So if you have e^{iδ} * sinδ, then:

e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ

Multiply by sinδ:

sinδ * cosδ + i sin²δ

Therefore, the imaginary part is sin²δ. So yes, the imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l. Therefore, the total imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l.

Okay, so now I need to compute this sum for l=0 to 4, using the given phase shifts. Then divide by k. But what is k here?

The problem states that the electrons have energy 50 MeV. Since electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV (their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV), so we need to use relativistic kinematics to find k, the wave number.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p / ħ. But in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k is just the momentum. However, perhaps we need to compute k in terms of the energy.

Wait, but for electrons, the relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, solving for p:

p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) / c

But since the energy given is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), so we can approximate p ≈ E / c. But maybe we need to be precise here.

Let me compute p exactly. Let's convert everything to SI units for clarity, but maybe that's tedious. Alternatively, use MeV and c as a unit.

Given E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV. Then,

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(50² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.9974 MeV

Therefore, p ≈ 49.9974 MeV / c. Therefore, k = p / ħ. But here, we need to express k in terms of inverse meters or something, but since the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has units of length (since the scattering amplitude has units of length), we need to compute 1/k, which would have units of length.

But maybe in nuclear physics, when dealing with MeV, they use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so that 1/(MeV) ≈ 197.33 fm / (MeV * fm) )? Wait, perhaps we can use the relation k = p / ħ = (E / c) / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c) when E >> m c².

Wait, but if E is 50 MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, so indeed E >> m c², so p ≈ E / c. Then k = p / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c). So k ≈ E / (197.33 MeV fm) since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Therefore, k ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

But the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So, after computing the sum Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l, we need to multiply by 1/k (which is ~3.946 fm) to get the imaginary part.

But perhaps the answer is expected in fm or in some other unit? The problem doesn't specify, but given that phase shifts are given in degrees and energy in MeV, maybe we can proceed with the formula and just write the numerical factor times 1/k, but maybe the 1/k is to be expressed in terms of the given energy.

Wait, but let me check again. The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l.

So, the key is to compute Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l for l=0 to 4, then multiply by 1/k. So first, compute each term:

For l=0: 2*0 + 1 = 1; δ₀=90°, sinδ₀ = sin90°=1; so sin²δ₀=1. Term = 1*1=1.

For l=1: 2*1 +1=3; δ₁=67°, sin67°≈0.9205; sin²67≈0.847. Term=3*0.847≈2.541.

For l=2: 2*2 +1=5; δ₂=55°, sin55≈0.8192; sin²55≈0.671. Term=5*0.671≈3.355.

For l=3: 2*3 +1=7; δ₃=30°, sin30°=0.5; sin²30=0.25. Term=7*0.25=1.75.

For l=4: 2*4 +1=9; δ₄=13°, sin13≈0.2249; sin²13≈0.0506. Term=9*0.0506≈0.455.

Now, summing all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.541 (l=1) + 3.355 (l=2) + 1.75 (l=3) + 0.455 (l=4) =

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896

6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646

8.646 + 0.455 = 9.101

So the sum Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l ≈ 9.101.

Then Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 9.101.

Now, compute 1/k. Earlier, I found that k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, so 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

But let me verify the calculation of k again. The electrons are 50 MeV. Since they are electrons, we need to compute their momentum.

The total energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. Then, the relativistic momentum p is given by:

E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)²

So, pc = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2) = sqrt(50² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV

Therefore, p = 49.9974 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (49.9974 MeV / c) / ħ

But ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm / c

Therefore, k = (49.9974 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) = 49.9974 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹

Thus, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

Therefore, Im[f(0)] ≈ 9.101 * 3.946 fm ≈ 35.91 fm.

But let's check the exact value step by step.

First, compute the sum:

l=0: 1*1=1

l=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). 67 degrees. sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660; sin(67.5°)=≈0.9239. So 67° is slightly less than 67.5°, so sin(67°)≈0.9205. Then sin²(67°)=0.9205²≈0.847. So 3*0.847≈2.541.

l=2: 5*sin²(55°). sin(55°)=≈0.8192. Squared is≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355.

l=3:7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*sin²(13°). sin(13°)≈0.22495, squared≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541=3.541; 3.541 +3.355=6.896; 6.896 +1.75=8.646; 8.646 +0.4554≈9.1014.

So the sum is approximately 9.1014.

1/k ≈3.946 fm.

Thus, Im[f(0)]≈9.1014 *3.946≈35.91 fm.

But let's compute 9.1014 *3.946:

First, 9 *3.946 =35.514

0.1014 *3.946≈0.1014*3=0.3042; 0.1014*0.946≈0.0958. Total≈0.3042+0.0958=0.4.

So total≈35.514 +0.4≈35.914 fm. So approximately 35.9 fm.

But let me check with more precise calculation:

3.946 *9.1014:

3.946*9 =35.514

3.946*0.1014≈3.946*0.1=0.3946; 3.946*0.0014≈0.00552. Total≈0.3946+0.00552≈0.4001.

Total≈35.514 +0.4001≈35.9141 fm.

So approximately 35.9 fm.

But maybe we need to keep more decimal places in the calculation. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, without plugging in the numbers? But the problem says "calculate", so probably expects a numerical answer.

But maybe there is a different approach. Wait, in the optical theorem, the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The optical theorem states that σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. But we aren't asked about the cross-section here, just the imaginary part of f(0). But maybe this is a way to check our result?

Wait, if we computed Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, but according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. But the total cross-section is also equal to the sum of all partial cross-sections: σ_total = Σ σ_l = Σ (4π/k²)(2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, (4π/k²)(sum terms) = (4π/k) Im[f(0)], which implies that Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. So our formula is consistent with the optical theorem. So that's correct.

Therefore, our calculation seems okay.

But let me check if the phase shifts are given in degrees, which we converted properly. Yes, we used sin(degrees) correctly, assuming that the calculator or sine function is in degrees. Since the problem gives δ in degrees, we need to compute the sine of those degrees. So 90 degrees is sin(90°)=1, which is correct. 67 degrees is sin(67°)= approx 0.9205, which is correct. So all the sines are calculated correctly in degrees.

Therefore, the sum is approximately 9.101, times 1/k ≈3.946 fm, gives Im[f(0)]≈35.9 fm.

But perhaps we need to be more precise with the sine values. Let me use more accurate values for the sines.

Compute each term again with more precision:

l=0: δ=90°, sin(90°)=1, sin²=1. Term=1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67°). Let's compute sin(67°):

Using calculator: 67 degrees.

sin(67°) ≈0.9205048535. So sin²≈0.847329. Multiply by 3: 3*0.847329≈2.541987.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55°)≈0.8191520443, sin²≈0.671. Multiply by 5: 5*0.671≈3.355.

Wait, let's compute sin(55°):

55 degrees: sin(55)=0.8191520443. Squared: (0.8191520443)^2≈0.671. Let's compute it exactly:

0.8191520443^2 = (0.8)^2 + 2*0.8*0.01915 + (0.01915)^2 ≈0.64 + 0.03064 + 0.000367 ≈0.671. So 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3: δ=30°, sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13°)= approx 0.2249510543. Squared: (0.2249510543)^2≈0.0506. Multiply by 9: 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is:

1 + 2.541987 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 ≈

1 + 2.541987 =3.541987

3.541987 +3.355=6.896987

6.896987 +1.75=8.646987

8.646987 +0.4554≈9.102387

So sum≈9.1024

Then 1/k≈3.946 fm.

Multiply: 9.1024*3.946.

Let me compute 9*3.946=35.514

0.1024*3.946≈0.1024*3=0.3072; 0.1024*0.946≈0.0968. Total≈0.3072+0.0968≈0.404.

Total≈35.514 +0.404≈35.918 fm.

So approximately 35.9 fm. Let's round to three significant figures. The given phase shifts are all given to two significant figures except δ₂=55°, which is two, δ₃=30°, two, δ₄=13°, two. So all phase shifts are given to two significant figures. But in the sum, we have multiple terms. However, when multiplying and adding, the precision might be around two or three significant figures. Given that 9.1 is two significant figures, times 3.946 (four significant figures), but since k is calculated from 50 MeV (two significant figures?), wait, the energy is 50 MeV, which is two significant figures. So actually, the momentum p is calculated from E=50 MeV. Let's check that.

E is 50 MeV (two significant figures), m_e c²=0.511 MeV (three significant figures). So p c= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2). Since 50 has two sig figs, the uncertainty in E is about ±0.5 MeV. Then p c≈sqrt(2500 -0.26)≈49.9974 MeV. But with E=50±0.5 MeV, p c= sqrt( (50±0.5)^2 -0.511^2 )≈sqrt(2500±50 +0.25 -0.26)≈sqrt(2500±50 -0.01)≈sqrt(2500±50). So sqrt(2500)=50, sqrt(2550)=~50.497, sqrt(2450)=~49.497. So p c is 50±0.5 (approximately). Therefore, k = p / ħ = (50±0.5 MeV)/ (197.33 MeV fm) ≈0.2534 ±0.0025 fm⁻¹, so 1/k≈3.946 ±0.039 fm.

Therefore, the uncertainty in 1/k is about 0.039 fm, so 1/k≈3.95 fm ±0.04 fm. Then, multiplying 9.10 (sum) *3.95 (1/k) gives 35.9, with an uncertainty of roughly 0.04/3.95≈1%, so 0.36 fm. So total Im[f(0)]≈35.9 ±0.4 fm. But since the original data (phase shifts) have two significant figures, and the energy also two, the answer should be given to two significant figures. So 36 fm.

Wait, but the sum was 9.10, which is three significant figures? Wait, the phase shifts are given as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°. These are all two significant figures except 55°, which is two as well. So when we computed the sum, each term was calculated with two significant figures (since sin^2 of an angle given to two significant figures). So the sum 9.1 is two significant figures? Wait, 9.1 is two significant figures. So 9.1 *3.946. But 9.1 is two sig figs, 3.946 is four. The result should be two sig figs: 9.1*3.946≈35.9, which rounds to 36.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 36 fm.

But let me check once more. If the phase shifts are given as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°, each has two significant figures. Then, when calculating sin²δ_l, those would have two significant figures as well. Then each term (2l+1) sin²δ_l would have two significant figures. Adding them up, the sum would have an uncertainty corresponding to the least precise term, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the sum is 9.1 (two sig figs), multiplied by 1/k=3.9 (two sig figs, since 1/k was calculated from E=50 MeV (two sig figs)), so 9.1*3.9≈35.5, which would be 36 with two sig figs.

Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

But wait, let me check, the original calculation gave 35.9, which is 36 when rounded to two significant figures. But some might argue that 9.1 is two significant figures, 3.946 is three or four, but since the energy is two, 1/k is two, so 3.9. Then 9.1*3.9=35.49≈35. So 35 fm. But now I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of 1/k without plugging in the value? But the problem says "calculate", so numerical value is expected.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a different approach where the imaginary part is calculated using the optical theorem. Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. But if we can compute σ_total as the sum of the partial cross-sections, which is σ_total = Σ σ_l = Σ [4π(2l +1)/k² sin²δ_l]. Therefore, setting equal:

(4π/k) Im[f(0)] = 4π/k² Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Cancel 4π from both sides:

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Which is the same formula as before. So our calculation is consistent. Therefore, the answer is (sum)/k.

But if we have to give the numerical value, then as per above, approximately 35.9 fm, which is 36 fm with two significant figures.

But let me check if the given phase shifts are all exact. The problem states "measured phase shifts", so they are experimental values, likely given to the precision of the measurement. The problem gives δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. These are all whole numbers, probably implying they're given to the nearest degree. So δ₀=90°±0.5°, δ₁=67±0.5°, etc. Therefore, the sines would have a certain precision. For example, sin(90°)=1 exactly. sin(67°)=0.9205±0.0005 (since 67±0.5° would vary sin by about cos(67°)*0.5°*π/180≈0.9205*0.0087≈0.008, so sin² would have an error of about 2*0.008*0.9205≈0.015. So sin²(67°)=0.847±0.015. Then 3*sin²=2.54±0.05.

Similarly, sin(55°)=0.8192±0.0005 (error similar). Wait, but actually, the error in δ is ±0.5°, which translates to an error in sinδ. Let's compute the error propagation.

For a small error Δδ in degrees, converted to radians: Δδ (rad) = Δδ * π / 180.

The error in sinδ is approximately cosδ * Δδ (rad).

So for δ=67°, cos(67°)=0.3907. Δδ=0.5°=0.008727 rad. So Δ(sinδ)=0.3907*0.008727≈0.00341. Therefore, sinδ=0.9205±0.0034. Then sin²δ=0.847±2*0.9205*0.0034≈0.847±0.0063. So 3*sin²δ=2.541±0.019.

Similarly for l=2, δ=55°, cos(55°)=0.5736. Δδ=0.5°=0.008727 rad. Δ(sinδ)=0.5736*0.008727≈0.00500. So sinδ=0.8192±0.0050, sin²δ=0.671±2*0.8192*0.005≈0.671±0.0082. 5*sin²δ=3.355±0.041.

For l=3, δ=30°, cos(30°)=0.8660. Δδ=0.5°, Δ(sinδ)=0.8660*0.008727≈0.00756. So sinδ=0.5±0.00756, sin²δ=0.25±2*0.5*0.00756=0.25±0.00756. 7*sin²δ=1.75±0.053.

For l=4, δ=13°, cos(13°)=0.9744. Δδ=0.5°, Δ(sinδ)=0.9744*0.008727≈0.00853. sinδ=0.22495±0.00853, sin²δ=0.0506±2*0.22495*0.00853≈0.0506±0.0038. 9*sin²δ=0.455±0.034.

Adding up all the terms with their uncertainties:

Term l=0: 1 ±0 (exact)

Term l=1: 2.541 ±0.019

Term l=2: 3.355 ±0.041

Term l=3:1.75 ±0.053

Term l=4:0.455 ±0.034

Total sum: 1 +2.541 +3.355 +1.75 +0.455=9.101

Total uncertainty: sqrt(0.019² +0.041² +0.053² +0.034²)≈sqrt(0.000361 +0.001681 +0.002809 +0.001156)=sqrt(0.006007)≈0.0775.

So the sum is 9.10 ±0.08.

Then 1/k is 3.946 ±0.039 fm.

So the total Im[f(0)] is (9.10 ±0.08) * (3.946 ±0.039) fm.

The uncertainty is calculated by sqrt( (0.08/9.10)^2 + (0.039/3.946)^2 ) * 35.9 ≈ sqrt( (0.00879)^2 + (0.00988)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.000077 +0.000098)=sqrt(0.000175)=0.0132. So 35.9 fm *0.0132≈0.474 fm. So Im[f(0)]=35.9±0.5 fm. So even with uncertainties, it's 35.9±0.5, which is 36±0.5 fm. So with two significant figures, it's 36 fm.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest of the phase shifts can be ignored. Hmm, let me recall what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts.

First, I remember that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states (each with a specific angular momentum quantum number l). The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Since the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, that would be when θ = 0°, right? Because the incident beam direction is the forward direction.

So, first, I need to evaluate the scattering amplitude at θ = 0°, and then take its imaginary part. Let me write down the formula again for f(0°):

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(1) )

Because cosθ = cos0° = 1, and P_l(1) is the value of the Legendre polynomial at 1. I remember that P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So that simplifies things. Then, f(0) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l.

But we are supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So the sum will only go up to l=4. So we have l=0,1,2,3,4. Each term contributes (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l. Then multiply by 1/k.

But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0). So let's compute Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * Im[ e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l ]

Since e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, so multiplying by sinδ_l gives:

e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l = sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l

Therefore, the imaginary part of each term is sin²δ_l. Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l

Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So if you have e^{iδ} * sinδ, then:

e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ

Multiply by sinδ:

sinδ * cosδ + i sin²δ

Therefore, the imaginary part is sin²δ. So yes, the imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l. Therefore, the total imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l.

Okay, so now I need to compute this sum for l=0 to 4, using the given phase shifts. Then divide by k. But what is k here?

The problem states that the electrons have energy 50 MeV. Since electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV (their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV), so we need to use relativistic kinematics to find k, the wave number.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p / ħ. But in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k is just the momentum. However, perhaps we need to compute k in terms of the energy.

Wait, but for electrons, the relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, solving for p:

p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) / c

But since the energy given is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), so we can approximate p ≈ E / c. But maybe we need to be precise here.

Let me compute p exactly. Let's convert everything to SI units for clarity, but maybe that's tedious. Alternatively, use MeV and c as a unit.

Given E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV. Then,

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(50² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.9974 MeV

Therefore, p ≈ 49.9974 MeV / c. Therefore, k = p / ħ. But here, we need to express k in terms of inverse meters or something, but since the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has units of length (since the scattering amplitude has units of length), we need to compute 1/k, which would have units of length.

But maybe in nuclear physics, when dealing with MeV, they use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so that 1/(MeV) ≈ 197.33 fm / (MeV * fm) )? Wait, perhaps we can use the relation k = p / ħ = (E / c) / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c) when E >> m c².

Wait, but if E is 50 MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, so indeed E >> m c², so p ≈ E / c. Then k = p / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c). So k ≈ E / (197.33 MeV fm) since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Therefore, k ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

I need to compute the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The provided phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, with all other phase shifts being negligible.

In partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is expressed as a sum over angular momentum states: f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ), where k represents the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Since I'm looking for the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, I need to evaluate f(θ) at θ = 0°. At this angle, cosθ = 1, and P_l(1) = 1 for all values of l. So the expression simplifies to:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l

Considering only the phase shifts up to l=4, I need to calculate:
Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * Im[ e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l ]

Since e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, when multiplied by sinδ_l, I get:
e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l = sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l

Therefore, the imaginary part of each term is sin²δ_l, and Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l

To calculate k for 50 MeV electrons, I need to account for relativistic effects. The relativistic relationship between energy and momentum is:
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

Solving for momentum:
pc = √(E² - (mc²)²) = √(50² - 0.511²) ≈ √(2500 - 0.26) ≈ √2499.74 ≈ 49.9974 MeV

Since E >> mc², I can approximate p ≈ E/c. Therefore:
k = p/ħ ≈ E/(ħc)

Using the conversion factor ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm:
k ≈ 50 MeV/(197.33 MeV·fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹

Thus, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

Alright, I need to determine the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The specified phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, and the remaining phase shifts should be neglected. Let me recall how scattering amplitudes and phase shifts fit into this.

In partial wave analysis, I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over all angular momentum states, each corresponding to a different angular momentum quantum number l. The formula seems to resemble f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ), where k represents the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Since the problem requests the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam, this is when θ = 0°, as the incident beam is along the forward direction.

First, I need to compute the scattering amplitude at θ = 0°, and then extract its imaginary part. So I reformulate f(0°) as:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(1) )

Here, cosθ = cos0° = 1, and I recall that P_l(1) = 1 for all l, which simplifies things. Thus, f(0) becomes (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l.

However, since we are to disregard phase shifts beyond l=4, the sum will only extend up to l=4, covering l=0,1,2,3,4. Every term contributes (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l, and this is multiplied by 1/k.

Given that the problem specifies finding the imaginary part of f(0), let's calculate Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * Im[ e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l ].

Knowing that e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, we find multiplying by sinδ_l gives:

e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l = sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l

Thus, the imaginary part of each term is sin²δ_l, resulting in Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l.

Double-checking this, if e^{iδ} * sinδ yields:

e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ

Multiplying by sinδ results in:

sinδ * cosδ + i sin²δ

So, the imaginary part is indeed sin²δ. Therefore, the imaginary component of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l, leading to the total imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 being (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l.

Now, I need to calculate this sum for l=0 to 4 using the provided phase shifts, then divide by k. But what is the value of k?

The problem notes that the electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. Given that electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV (since their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV), I should apply relativistic kinematics to find the wave number k.

Typically, wave number k is related to momentum p by k = p / ħ, but in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k simply represents the momentum. I may need to express k in terms of energy.

For electrons, the relationship between energy and momentum is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Solving for p gives:

p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) / c

Given that the provided energy is 50 MeV, which significantly exceeds the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), I can approximate p ≈ E / c. Nonetheless, precision might be necessary.

To calculate p accurately, unless I convert units to SI, which might be cumbersome, it's simplist to use MeV and c as the unit. 

With E = 50 MeV and m c² = 0.511 MeV, then:

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) = sqrt(50² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.9974 MeV

Thus, p ≈ 49.9974 MeV / c, so k = p / ħ. For expressing k, given that the imaginary part involves units of length (as the scattering amplitude uses length units), I need to find 1/k, which will produce length units.

In nuclear physics, dealing with MeV commonly utilizes natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, implying 1/(MeV) ≈ 197.33 fm / (MeV * fm). Recognizing that k = p / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c) when E >> m c²,

Given E at 50 MeV and m c² at 0.511 MeV, thus E >> m c², thus p ≈ E / c, then k = p / ħ ≈ E / (ħ c), leading to k ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, and hence 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

So the scattering amplitude has units of length, and the imaginary part will be in fm.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Let\'s compute sin²δ_l for each l:\n\nFor l=0: sin²(90°) = 1\n\nl=1: sin²(67°). Let\'s compute sin(67°). Let me use calculator values.\n\nsin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so sin²(67°) ≈ 0.8473\n\nl=2: sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, sin² ≈ 0.6710\n\nl=3: sin(30°) = 0.5, sin² = 0.25\n\nl=4: sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, sin² ≈ 0.0506\n\nNow, multiply each by (2l +1):\n\nFor l=0: 2*0 +1=1, so term1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nl=1: 2*1 +1=3, term2 = 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419\n\nl=2: 2*2 +1=5, term3 = 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355\n\nl=3: 2*3 +1=7, term4 = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75\n\nl=4: 2*4 +1=9, term5 = 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554\n\nNow sum all these terms:\n\n1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 ≈\n\n1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419\n\n3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969\n\n6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469\n\n8.6469 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023\n\nSo the sum Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ≈ 9.1023\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 9.1023 ≈ (3.946 fm) * 9.1023 ≈ let\'s compute that.\n\nFirst, 3.946 * 9 = 35.514\n\n3.946 * 0.1023 ≈ 0.4036\n\nTotal ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm\n\nSo approximately 35.9 fm. But wait, let me check the exact value of 1/k. Earlier, we approximated 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Let\'s compute 1/k more accurately.\n\nGiven k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.2534 ≈ 3.946 fm. So that\'s correct.\n\nSo the total Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 3.946 * 9.1023.\n\nLet me compute 3.946 * 9 = 35.514\n\n3.946 * 0.1023 = approx 0.4036\n\nTotal ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm, so approximately 35.9 fm.\n\nBut wait, the problem is stated in units of MeV for energy. Is there a chance that they expect the answer in some other unit? Or maybe in terms of inverse MeV? Wait, no, the scattering amplitude has units of length, so fm is appropriate.\n\nBut let me double-check if the formula is correct. Because sometimes, depending on conventions, the scattering amplitude might have different factors. The formula I used was f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the imaginary part is using the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_tot. But I don\'t know if that\'s helpful here, since we don\'t have the total cross-section. But maybe I can use this to check.\n\nWait, if I compute Im[f(0)] via the partial wave formula and via the optical theorem, they should give the same result. But since we don\'t have σ_tot, maybe it\'s not useful here. But let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since σ_tot = (4π / k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. So according to the optical theorem, Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) * σ_tot = (k / 4π) * (4π / k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Which matches the previous result. So that\'s a good consistency check. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 35.9 fm.\n\nBut let me check if the sum is indeed 9.1023. Let\'s recalculate the individual terms:\n\nl=0: 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let me compute sin(67°). 67 degrees.\n\nsin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(67.5°)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.9239. So 67° is a bit less than 67.5°, so sin(67°)≈0.9205 as before. So sin²≈0.8473. 3*0.8473≈2.5419.\n\nl=2: 5*sin²(55°). sin(55°)=sqrt( (1 - cos110°)/2 ). Wait, cos(55°)=approx 0.5736, so sin(55°)=sqrt(1 - 0.5736²)=sqrt(1 - 0.329)=sqrt(0.671)=approx0.8192. So sin²≈0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.\n\nl=3: 7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.\n\nl=4:9*sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.22495, so sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.\n\nAdding all up:\n\n1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419\n\n3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969\n\n6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469\n\n8.6469 + 0.4554 = 9.1023. Yes, that\'s correct.\n\nSo the sum is 9.1023. Then 1/k ≈3.946 fm. So 9.1023 * 3.946 ≈\n\nLet me compute 9 * 3.946 = 35.514\n\n0.1023 * 3.946 ≈ 0.4036\n\nTotal ≈35.514 + 0.4036≈35.9176 fm. So approximately 35.9 fm.\n\nBut maybe we need to keep more decimal places for accuracy? Let\'s see.\n\nCompute 3.946 * 9.1023:\n\nFirst, 3.946 * 9 = 35.514\n\n3.946 * 0.1023:\n\nCompute 3.946 * 0.1 = 0.3946\n\n3.946 * 0.0023 = 0.0090758\n\nSo total is 0.3946 + 0.0090758 ≈0.4036758\n\nTherefore, total Im[f(0)] ≈35.514 +0.4036758≈35.9176758 fm. So approximately 35.918 fm.\n\nBut the problem says "Calculate the imaginary part...". The answer is around 35.9 fm, but maybe the exact value is 35.9 fm. But let me check if the phase shifts were given in degrees, which they are. So all steps are correct.\n\nWait, but just to confirm once more that we didn\'t miss any factors. The formula for the scattering amplitude in partial waves is:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) )\n\nBut wait, that\'s another form. Let me check.\n\nYes, another form is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Which is equivalent.\n\nBecause e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So (1/(2ik))*(2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l) = (1/k) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So both forms are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the formula I used is correct.\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But since the problem gives phase shifts with δ₀=90°, etc., maybe we need to express the answer with more precise decimal places or in terms of 1/k?\n\nWait, the problem says "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude...". The answer should be in units of length, which is 1/k multiplied by the sum. Since k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is in fm, so the answer is in fm.\n\nBut let me check if the sum is indeed 9.1023 and 1/k is 3.946, so 9.1023 * 3.946 ≈35.9 fm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an answer in terms of 1/k, but I think no, they probably want a numerical value. Since they gave the energy, 50 MeV, which allows us to compute k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check that again.\n\nGiven E = 50 MeV, electron rest mass m = 0.511 MeV/c².\n\nThe momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nSo (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = 50² - 0.511² ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739\n\nSo pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.9974 MeV\n\nTherefore, p = 49.9974 MeV / c\n\nThen, k = p / ħ = (49.9974 MeV / c) / ħ\n\nBut ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm\n\nTherefore, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c\n\nTherefore, k = (49.9974 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 49.9974 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈3.946 fm. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.9 fm.\n\nBut let me check if the phase shifts are in degrees. The problem says δ₀=90°, etc., so yes, degrees. So converting them to radians would be necessary if we were using them in trigonometric functions where the calculator is in radians, but since we are just taking sine of degrees, as long as the calculator is set to degrees, which I did (by using approximate degree values for sine), so the calculation is okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But let me check with more precise calculation for the sum.\n\nSum:\n\nl=0: 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let\'s compute sin(67°):\n\nUsing calculator: sin(67°) ≈0.9205048535\n\nsin²≈0.8473\n\n3*0.8473≈2.5419\n\nl=2: 5*sin²(55°). sin(55°)=0.8191520443, sin²≈0.6710, 5*0.6710≈3.355\n\nl=3:7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=1.75\n\nl=4:9*sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.2249510543, sin²≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nAdding all together: 1 +2.5419 +3.355 +1.75 +0.4554=1 +2.5419=3.5419; 3.5419+3.355=6.8969; 6.8969+1.75=8.6469; 8.6469+0.4554=9.1023. Correct.\n\nSo sum is 9.1023. Multiply by 1/k=3.946 fm: 9.1023*3.946≈35.918 fm.\n\nSince the given phase shifts are all in whole degrees except δ₂=55 (maybe 55.0°?), but assuming they are exact, then the answer is 35.9 fm. But maybe we need to round to two decimal places? 35.92 fm? But the problem doesn\'t specify. Alternatively, maybe keep three significant figures. The given phase shifts have two significant figures (90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°), except 90° is exact. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures? 36 fm? Wait, 9.1023 is approximately 9.1, and 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm. 9.1 * 3.95 ≈35.9, which is three significant figures. But given that the phase shifts are given to two significant figures (except δ₀=90° which is exact), but δ₁=67° is two, δ₂=55° is two, δ₃=30° is two, δ₄=13° is two. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures. So 36 fm. But 35.9 is three significant figures. Wait, 9.1 * 4.0 = 36.4, but 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49. So depending on precision. Alternatively, since 1/k is 3.946, which is approximately 3.95 (three significant figures), and the sum is 9.1023, which is approx 9.10 (three significant figures). So 9.10 * 3.95 = 35.9. So 35.9 fm with three significant figures. But the given phase shifts are:\n\nδ₀=90° (exact, maybe infinite sig figs), δ₁=67° (two), δ₂=55° (two), δ₃=30° (two), δ₄=13° (two). So the least number of significant figures in the phase shifts is two (except δ₀). However, when we compute sin²δ_l for δ₀=90°, sin²90°=1 (exact), so that term is exact. The other terms have two sig figs. So the sum would have two sig figs. Wait, but when adding, the number of decimal places is determined by the least precise term. But here, all terms except the first are approximate. Let me see:\n\nThe sum is 1 (exact) + 2.5419 (approx) +3.355 (approx) +1.75 (approx) +0.4554 (approx). So 1 is exact, the others are approx. The approximate terms have different decimal places. But in terms of significant figures:\n\n1 is exact, 2.5419 is approx 2.5 (two sig figs), 3.355 is approx 3.4 (two sig figs), 1.75 is approx 1.8 (two sig figs), 0.4554 is approx 0.46 (two sig figs). Then adding them:\n\n1 + 2.5 +3.4 +1.8 +0.46 =1 +2.5=3.5; 3.5+3.4=6.9; 6.9+1.8=8.7; 8.7+0.46=9.16. So approximately 9.2 (two sig figs). Then 9.2 * 3.946 ≈36.3 fm. So with two sig figs, it\'s 36 fm.\n\nBut in our precise calculation, it was 35.9, which is 36 when rounded to two sig figs. So maybe the answer is 36 fm. But the question says "Calculate the imaginary part...". Since in exams, sometimes they expect the answer as is, with the given decimal places. But here, since the phase shifts are given in whole degrees (except maybe δ₂=55 is exact?), but likely, we can assume all are two sig figs except δ₀=90°, which is exact. Therefore, the sum has two sig figs in the approximate terms, but the exact term is 1. So the total sum would have an uncertainty dominated by the two sig fig terms. Therefore, the sum is 9.1 (with two sig figs: 9.1). Then 9.1 * 3.946 ≈35.9, which is 36 with two sig figs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact answer without considering significant figures, just compute with the given numbers as exact. Then the answer is 35.9 fm. But given that in experiments, phase shifts are often given with some precision, but here they are given as whole numbers, so maybe the answer is 36 fm.\n\nBut to check, let\'s see if 35.9 is 35.9176, which is roughly 35.9 fm. So depending on the convention, maybe we write 36 fm. But since the problem is from a textbook or an exam question, perhaps the exact answer is expected. Let me check if 9.1023 * 3.946 is exactly 35.9176 fm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach. Wait, the optical theorem says Im f(0) = k/(4π) σ_total. But σ_total is the total cross-section. But σ_total can also be computed from the sum of all partial cross-sections. The cross-section for each l is σ_l = (4π/k²)(2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, σ_total = Σ σ_l = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Then, Im f(0) = k/(4π) * σ_total = k/(4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. Since the problem gives the phase shifts as whole degrees, it\'s acceptable to present the answer as 36 fm. But maybe the precise calculation gives 35.9, so it\'s better to write 35.9 fm. However, let me check the exact multiplication:\n\n3.946 * 9.1023:\n\nLet me compute 3.946 * 9 = 35.514\n\n3.946 * 0.1023 = ?\n\n3.946 * 0.1 = 0.3946\n\n3.946 * 0.0023 = 0.0090758\n\nSo total 0.3946 +0.0090758 =0.4036758\n\nTherefore, total Im[f(0)] =35.514 +0.4036758=35.9176758 fm≈35.918 fm.\n\nRounded to three decimal places, 35.918 fm. If we round to three significant figures, it\'s 35.9 fm. Given the phase shifts have two significant figures (except δ₀=90°), but the leading term (l=0) is exact. However, the other terms contribute more, so the precision is dominated by the two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 36 fm.\n\nBut I think since the problem gives δ₂=55°, which is two sig figs, and others similar, so the answer should be given to two sig figs: 36 fm. But maybe 35.9 is acceptable if they consider δ₀=90° as exact. It\'s a bit ambiguous. But in experimental physics, usually, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise measurement. Here, the phase shifts are given as 90, 67, 55, 30, 13 degrees. Assuming these are all measured values, 90° is two sig figs (if it\'s exactly 90, maybe it\'s infinitely precise, but in reality, 90° is likely two sig figs). 67, 55, 30, 13 are two sig figs. So the sum would have two sig figs. Therefore, 9.1 (sum) * 3.946 ≈36. So 36 fm.\n\nBut the question says "Calculate the imaginary part...". If we write 36 fm, that\'s two sig figs. If we write 35.9 fm, that\'s three. Maybe the answer is 36 fm. But in the calculation, we have 35.918 fm. Let me check if 35.918 is closer to 36 or 35.9. 35.918 is 35.92, which is 35.9 when rounded to three sig figs, and 36 when rounded to two. Since the input data is two sig figs, 36 is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, so maybe they want it as (sum)/(k). But since they asked for the imaginary part, which is a numerical value. So 36 fm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach. Wait, but all steps seem correct. The key steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.\n\n2. Calculate each sin²δ_l and multiply by (2l +1).\n\n3. Sum them up.\n\n4. Multiply by 1/k, which is calculated from the given energy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 35.9 or 36 fm.\n\nBut let me check for possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, another thought: electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so does that affect the partial wave expansion? Hmm, in the partial wave expansion for electrons, since they are spin-1/2, but if the target is spin-0 (which is common in some nuclear targets), then the scattering amplitude can still be expressed in terms of orbital angular momentum l, and the spin can be neglected if the interaction is spin-independent. However, electron scattering does involve electromagnetic interactions, which are spin-dependent (due to magnetic interactions), but at high energies (50 MeV), the spin effects might be negligible compared to the charge scattering. However, the problem states it\'s an elastic scattering experiment, and they give only orbital phase shifts δ_l, so maybe we can ignore the spin. Therefore, the formula remains valid.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the answer is approximately 36 fm.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \\boxed{36} femtometers.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386709, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6000, prompt_tokens=1444, total_tokens=7444, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts and partial wave analysis. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Scattering Amplitude Formula**:
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ = 0° is given by:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l)
   \]
   where \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts and \( k \) is the wave number.

2. **Phase Shifts**:
   The given phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), and \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \).

3. **Calculate \( \sin^2(\delta_l) \)**:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   \sin^2(90^\circ) &= 1, \\
   \sin^2(67^\circ) &\approx 0.8473, \\
   \sin^2(55^\circ) &\approx 0.6710, \\
   \sin^2(30^\circ) &= 0.25, \\
   \sin^2(13^\circ) &\approx 0.0506.
   \end{aligned}
   \]

4. **Sum the Terms**:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   \sum (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l) &= 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0.8473 + 5 \cdot 0.6710 + 7 \cdot 0.25 + 9 \cdot 0.0506 \\
   &= 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \\
   &\approx 9.1023.
   \end{aligned}
   \]

5. **Wave Number \( k \)**:
   Using the relativistic relation for momentum \( p \) and \( k = \frac{p}{\hbar} \):
   \[
   k \approx \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}} \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{1}{k} \approx 3.946 \, \text{fm} \).

6. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \times 9.1023 \approx 3.946 \, \text{fm} \times 9.1023 \approx 35.9176 \, \text{fm}
   \]

7. **Rounding**:
   Considering significant figures from the given phase shifts, the result is rounded to two significant figures.

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36} femtometers.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

But let me check:

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so k = E / (ħ c) when E = pc. So if E = 50 MeV, then k = E / (ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. So 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm ≈ 3.95 x 10⁻¹⁵ m. So the scattering amplitude has units of length, and the imaginary part will be in fm.

But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So perhaps we can just compute the sum Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l and then multiply by 1/k. So let's compute the sum first.

Given δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. Let's compute sin²δ_l for each l:

For l=0: sin²(90°) = 1

l=1: sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). Let me use calculator values.

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so sin²(67°) ≈ 0.8473

l=2: sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, sin² ≈ 0.6710

l=3: sin(30°) = 0.5, sin² = 0.25

l=4: sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, sin² ≈ 0.0506

Now, multiply each by (2l +1):

For l=0: 2*0 +1=1, so term1 = 1 * 1 = 1

l=1: 2*1 +1=3, term2 = 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419

l=2: 2*2 +1=5, term3 = 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355

l=3: 2*3 +1=7, term4 = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75

l=4: 2*4 +1=9, term5 = 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 ≈

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469

8.6469 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023

So the sum Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ≈ 9.1023

Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 9.1023 ≈ (3.946 fm) * 9.1023 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 3.946 * 9 = 35.514

3.946 * 0.1023 ≈ 0.4036

Total ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm

So approximately 35.9 fm. But wait, let me check the exact value of 1/k. Earlier, we approximated 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Let's compute 1/k more accurately.

Given k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.2534 ≈ 3.946 fm. So that's correct.

So the total Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 3.946 * 9.1023.

Let me compute 3.946 * 9 = 35.514

3.946 * 0.1023 = approx 0.4036

Total ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm, so approximately 35.9 fm.

But wait, the problem is stated in units of MeV for energy. Is there a chance that they expect the answer in some other unit? Or maybe in terms of inverse MeV? Wait, no, the scattering amplitude has units of length, so fm is appropriate.

But let me double-check if the formula is correct. Because sometimes, depending on conventions, the scattering amplitude might have different factors. The formula I used was f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. That seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute the imaginary part is using the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_tot. But I don't know if that's helpful here, since we don't have the total cross-section. But maybe I can use this to check.

Wait, if I compute Im[f(0)] via the partial wave formula and via the optical theorem, they should give the same result. But since we don't have σ_tot, maybe it's not useful here. But let me see.

Alternatively, since σ_tot = (4π / k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. So according to the optical theorem, Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) * σ_tot = (k / 4π) * (4π / k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Which matches the previous result. So that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the formula is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.9 fm.

But let me check if the sum is indeed 9.1023. Let's recalculate the individual terms:

l=0: 1*1=1

l=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let me compute sin(67°). 67 degrees.

sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(67.5°)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.9239. So 67° is a bit less than 67.5°, so sin(67°)≈0.9205 as before. So sin²≈0.8473. 3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: 5*sin²(55°). sin(55°)=sqrt( (1 - cos110°)/2 ). Wait, cos(55°)=approx 0.5736, so sin(55°)=sqrt(1 - 0.5736²)=sqrt(1 - 0.329)=sqrt(0.671)=approx0.8192. So sin²≈0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3: 7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.22495, so sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Adding all up:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469

8.6469 + 0.4554 = 9.1023. Yes, that's correct.

So the sum is 9.1023. Then 1/k ≈3.946 fm. So 9.1023 * 3.946 ≈

Let me compute 9 * 3.946 = 35.514

0.1023 * 3.946 ≈ 0.4036

Total ≈35.514 + 0.4036≈35.9176 fm. So approximately 35.9 fm.

But maybe we need to keep more decimal places for accuracy? Let's see.

Compute 3.946 * 9.1023:

First, 3.946 * 9 = 35.514

3.946 * 0.1023:

Compute 3.946 * 0.1 = 0.3946

3.946 * 0.0023 = 0.0090758

So total is 0.3946 + 0.0090758 ≈0.4036758

Therefore, total Im[f(0)] ≈35.514 +0.4036758≈35.9176758 fm. So approximately 35.918 fm.

But the problem says "Calculate the imaginary part...". The answer is around 35.9 fm, but maybe the exact value is 35.9 fm. But let me check if the phase shifts were given in degrees, which they are. So all steps are correct.

Wait, but just to confirm once more that we didn't miss any factors. The formula for the scattering amplitude in partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) )

But wait, that's another form. Let me check.

Yes, another form is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Which is equivalent.

Because e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So (1/(2ik))*(2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l) = (1/k) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the formula I used is correct.

Therefore, the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But since the problem gives phase shifts with δ₀=90°, etc., maybe we need to express the answer with more precise decimal places or in terms of 1/k?

Wait, the problem says "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude...". The answer should be in units of length, which is 1/k multiplied by the sum. Since k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is in fm, so the answer is in fm.

But let me check if the sum is indeed 9.1023 and 1/k is 3.946, so 9.1023 * 3.946 ≈35.9 fm.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects an answer in terms of 1/k, but I think no, they probably want a numerical value. Since they gave the energy, 50 MeV, which allows us to compute k.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check that again.

Given E = 50 MeV, electron rest mass m = 0.511 MeV/c².

The momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

So (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = 50² - 0.511² ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739

So pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.9974 MeV

Therefore, p = 49.9974 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (49.9974 MeV / c) / ħ

But ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm

Therefore, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c

Therefore, k = (49.9974 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 49.9974 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 1/k ≈3.946 fm. Correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.9 fm.

But let me check if the phase shifts are in degrees. The problem says δ₀=90°, etc., so yes, degrees. So converting them to radians would be necessary if we were using them in trigonometric functions where the calculator is in radians, but since we are just taking sine of degrees, as long as the calculator is set to degrees, which I did (by using approximate degree values for sine), so the calculation is okay.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But let me check with more precise calculation for the sum.

Sum:

l=0: 1*1=1

l=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°):

Using calculator: sin(67°) ≈0.9205048535

sin²≈0.8473

3*0.8473≈2.5419

l=2: 5*sin²(55°). sin(55°)=0.8191520443, sin²≈0.6710, 5*0.6710≈3.355

l=3:7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=1.75

l=4:9*sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.2249510543, sin²≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554

Adding all together: 1 +2.5419 +3.355 +1.75 +0.4554=1 +2.5419=3.5419; 3.5419+3.355=6.8969; 6.8969+1.75=8.6469; 8.6469+0.4554=9.1023. Correct.

So sum is 9.1023. Multiply by 1/k=3.946 fm: 9.1023*3.946≈35.918 fm.

Since the given phase shifts are all in whole degrees except δ₂=55 (maybe 55.0°?), but assuming they are exact, then the answer is 35.9 fm. But maybe we need to round to two decimal places? 35.92 fm? But the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe keep three significant figures. The given phase shifts have two significant figures (90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°), except 90° is exact. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures? 36 fm? Wait, 9.1023 is approximately 9.1, and 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm. 9.1 * 3.95 ≈35.9, which is three significant figures. But given that the phase shifts are given to two significant figures (except δ₀=90° which is exact), but δ₁=67° is two, δ₂=55° is two, δ₃=30° is two, δ₄=13° is two. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures. So 36 fm. But 35.9 is three significant figures. Wait, 9.1 * 4.0 = 36.4, but 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49. So depending on precision. Alternatively, since 1/k is 3.946, which is approximately 3.95 (three significant figures), and the sum is 9.1023, which is approx 9.10 (three significant figures). So 9.10 * 3.95 = 35.9. So 35.9 fm with three significant figures. But the given phase shifts are:

δ₀=90° (exact, maybe infinite sig figs), δ₁=67° (two), δ₂=55° (two), δ₃=30° (two), δ₄=13° (two). So the least number of significant figures in the phase shifts is two (except δ₀). However, when we compute sin²δ_l for δ₀=90°, sin²90°=1 (exact), so that term is exact. The other terms have two sig figs. So the sum would have two sig figs. Wait, but when adding, the number of decimal places is determined by the least precise term. But here, all terms except the first are approximate. Let me see:

The sum is 1 (exact) + 2.5419 (approx) +3.355 (approx) +1.75 (approx) +0.4554 (approx). So 1 is exact, the others are approx. The approximate terms have different decimal places. But in terms of significant figures:

1 is exact, 2.5419 is approx 2.5 (two sig figs), 3.355 is approx 3.4 (two sig figs), 1.75 is approx 1.8 (two sig figs), 0.4554 is approx 0.46 (two sig figs). Then adding them:

1 + 2.5 +3.4 +1.8 +0.46 =1 +2.5=3.5; 3.5+3.4=6.9; 6.9+1.8=8.7; 8.7+0.46=9.16. So approximately 9.2 (two sig figs). Then 9.2 * 3.946 ≈36.3 fm. So with two sig figs, it's 36 fm.

But in our precise calculation, it was 35.9, which is 36 when rounded to two sig figs. So maybe the answer is 36 fm. But the question says "Calculate the imaginary part...". Since in exams, sometimes they expect the answer as is, with the given decimal places. But here, since the phase shifts are given in whole degrees (except maybe δ₂=55 is exact?), but likely, we can assume all are two sig figs except δ₀=90°, which is exact. Therefore, the sum has two sig figs in the approximate terms, but the exact term is 1. So the total sum would have an uncertainty dominated by the two sig fig terms. Therefore, the sum is 9.1 (with two sig figs: 9.1). Then 9.1 * 3.946 ≈35.9, which is 36 with two sig figs.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects an exact answer without considering significant figures, just compute with the given numbers as exact. Then the answer is 35.9 fm. But given that in experiments, phase shifts are often given with some precision, but here they are given as whole numbers, so maybe the answer is 36 fm.

But to check, let's see if 35.9 is 35.9176, which is roughly 35.9 fm. So depending on the convention, maybe we write 36 fm. But since the problem is from a textbook or an exam question, perhaps the exact answer is expected. Let me check if 9.1023 * 3.946 is exactly 35.9176 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a different approach. Wait, the optical theorem says Im f(0) = k/(4π) σ_total. But σ_total is the total cross-section. But σ_total can also be computed from the sum of all partial cross-sections. The cross-section for each l is σ_l = (4π/k²)(2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, σ_total = Σ σ_l = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Then, Im f(0) = k/(4π) * σ_total = k/(4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. Since the problem gives the phase shifts as whole degrees, it's acceptable to present the answer as 36 fm. But maybe the precise calculation gives 35.9, so it's better to write 35.9 fm. However, let me check the exact multiplication:

3.946 * 9.1023:

Let me compute 3.946 * 9 = 35.514

3.946 * 0.1023 = ?

3.946 * 0.1 = 0.3946

3.946 * 0.0023 = 0.0090758

So total 0.3946 +0.0090758 =0.4036758

Therefore, total Im[f(0)] =35.514 +0.4036758=35.9176758 fm≈35.918 fm.

Rounded to three decimal places, 35.918 fm. If we round to three significant figures, it's 35.9 fm. Given the phase shifts have two significant figures (except δ₀=90°), but the leading term (l=0) is exact. However, the other terms contribute more, so the precision is dominated by the two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 36 fm.

But I think since the problem gives δ₂=55°, which is two sig figs, and others similar, so the answer should be given to two sig figs: 36 fm. But maybe 35.9 is acceptable if they consider δ₀=90° as exact. It's a bit ambiguous. But in experimental physics, usually, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise measurement. Here, the phase shifts are given as 90, 67, 55, 30, 13 degrees. Assuming these are all measured values, 90° is two sig figs (if it's exactly 90, maybe it's infinitely precise, but in reality, 90° is likely two sig figs). 67, 55, 30, 13 are two sig figs. So the sum would have two sig figs. Therefore, 9.1 (sum) * 3.946 ≈36. So 36 fm.

But the question says "Calculate the imaginary part...". If we write 36 fm, that's two sig figs. If we write 35.9 fm, that's three. Maybe the answer is 36 fm. But in the calculation, we have 35.918 fm. Let me check if 35.918 is closer to 36 or 35.9. 35.918 is 35.92, which is 35.9 when rounded to three sig figs, and 36 when rounded to two. Since the input data is two sig figs, 36 is appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, so maybe they want it as (sum)/(k). But since they asked for the imaginary part, which is a numerical value. So 36 fm.

Alternatively, maybe there is a different approach. Wait, but all steps seem correct. The key steps are:

1. Recognize that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.

2. Calculate each sin²δ_l and multiply by (2l +1).

3. Sum them up.

4. Multiply by 1/k, which is calculated from the given energy.

Therefore, the answer should be 35.9 or 36 fm.

But let me check for possible miscalculations.

Wait, another thought: electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so does that affect the partial wave expansion? Hmm, in the partial wave expansion for electrons, since they are spin-1/2, but if the target is spin-0 (which is common in some nuclear targets), then the scattering amplitude can still be expressed in terms of orbital angular momentum l, and the spin can be neglected if the interaction is spin-independent. However, electron scattering does involve electromagnetic interactions, which are spin-dependent (due to magnetic interactions), but at high energies (50 MeV), the spin effects might be negligible compared to the charge scattering. However, the problem states it's an elastic scattering experiment, and they give only orbital phase shifts δ_l, so maybe we can ignore the spin. Therefore, the formula remains valid.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the answer is approximately 36 fm.

**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36} femtometers.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes a non-relativistic calculation, but since the energy is high (50 MeV), relativistic is correct. However, perhaps the exact value of k isn\'t necessary if the answer is to be given in terms of inverse MeV or something else. Wait, but the problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length (fm). But since the phase shifts are given, and the sum is over (2l+1) sin²δ_l, multiplied by 1/k. So the answer would be (1/k) multiplied by the sum.\n\nBut let me check if I need to compute k numerically. Let\'s proceed.\n\nFirst, compute the sum S = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) sin²δ_l\n\nGiven δ₀=90°, sin²90° = 1, so term l=0: (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1=1\n\nl=1: δ₁=67°, sin²67° ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.847, so (2*1 +1)*0.847 ≈ 3*0.847 ≈ 2.541\n\nl=2: δ₂=55°, sin²55° ≈ (0.8192)^2 ≈ 0.671, so (5)*0.671 ≈ 3.355\n\nl=3: δ₃=30°, sin²30° = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so (7)*0.25 = 1.75\n\nl=4: δ₄=13°, sin²13° ≈ (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.0506, so (9)*0.0506 ≈ 0.455\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355 = 6.896; +1.75 = 8.646; +0.455 = 9.101\n\nSo S ≈ 9.101\n\nThen Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.101 ≈ 35.91 fm\n\nBut wait, if k is in fm⁻¹, then 1/k is in fm. So the answer is approximately 35.91 fm. But let me check if the calculation of k is correct.\n\nWait, the electron mass is 0.511 MeV/c². The kinetic energy is 50 MeV. So the total energy E is the kinetic plus rest energy: E = K + mc² = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV\n\nThen, the relativistic momentum is p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2)/c = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²)/c ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261)/c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈ 50.508/c\n\nThus, p ≈ 50.508 MeV/c / c = 50.508 MeV/(c²) * c? Wait, units are confusing.\n\nWait, in natural units, c=1, but here, to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹), we use the relation p = ħk. So p = ħk => k = p/ħ. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore, k = p / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) * c. Wait, perhaps better to compute in SI units.\n\nAlternatively, use the practical formula:\n\nFor an electron with kinetic energy K, the momentum p can be found using:\n\np = sqrt( (K + mc²)^2 - (mc²)^2 ) / c\n\nBut let\'s compute p in MeV/c units.\n\nK = 50 MeV\n\nmc² = 0.511 MeV\n\nE = K + mc² = 50.511 MeV\n\nThen, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈ 50.508 / c MeV/c\n\nWait, that\'s a bit confusing. Let me write:\n\np c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 )\n\nSo p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.508 MeV\n\nThus, p = 50.508 MeV / c\n\nThen, k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm\n\nSo then, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.101 ≈ 35.54 fm\n\nBut maybe my calculation of S is approximate. Let\'s check the individual terms more accurately.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nl=0: δ₀=90°, sin²90°=1.0, term=1*1=1\n\nl=1: δ₁=67°, sin(67°)=sin(67)= approx 0.9205, so sin²=0.8473, term=3*0.8473≈2.5419\n\nl=2: δ₂=55°, sin(55)=0.8192, sin²=0.6710, term=5*0.6710≈3.355\n\nl=3: δ₃=30°, sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25, term=7*0.25=1.75\n\nl=4: δ₄=13°, sin(13)=approx 0.22495, sin²≈0.0506, term=9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nSum: 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554≈9.1023\n\nSo S≈9.1023\n\nThen 1/k≈3.906 fm, so Im[f(0)]≈3.906*9.1023≈35.54 fm\n\nBut perhaps we need more precise values for sin²δ_l:\n\nFor l=1, δ₁=67°: sin(67°)=sin(67)= using calculator: 0.92050485345, so sin²≈0.8473\n\nl=2: sin(55°)=0.81915204428, sin²≈0.6710\n\nl=3: sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25\n\nl=4: sin(13°)=0.2249510543, sin²≈0.0506\n\nSo the sum is accurate.\n\nBut let\'s check the value of k again:\n\nE = 50.511 MeV\n\np c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) = sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) = sqrt(2551.099) ≈ 50.508 MeV\n\nTherefore, p = 50.508 / c in units where c=1 in natural units. Then, converting to inverse femtometers:\n\nk = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV) / (ħ c) ) since p c = 50.508 MeV, so p = 50.508 MeV / c\n\nBut ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c\n\nTherefore, k = (50.508 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nThus, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.256 ≈ 3.906 fm\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)] = 3.906 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 35.54 fm\n\nBut the problem might expect an answer in terms of inverse MeV or another unit, but since the phase shifts are given in degrees and the energy is given, but the answer is just the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has dimensions of length (fm). So the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. But let\'s check if there\'s a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section: Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ_total\n\nBut since it\'s elastic scattering, σ_total = σ_elastic. But in that case, if we use the optical theorem, we can compute Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ_total. But if we have the phase shifts, perhaps using partial wave expansion is more direct.\n\nWait, but the problem gives phase shifts and asks for Im f(0). The partial wave expansion gives f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Then Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l, which is exactly what I computed. So 35.5 fm is the answer.\n\nBut let me check again the calculation of k. Maybe I made a mistake in relativistic vs. non-relativistic.\n\nFor electrons at 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic. The momentum p ≈ E/c = 50 MeV / c. Then k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = 50 / (197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, so 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Then Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 * 9.102 ≈ 35.91 fm. But earlier when considering total energy E = 50.511 MeV, we got 1/k ≈3.906 fm. Which is correct?\n\nThe momentum should be calculated using the total energy, not just kinetic. So p c = sqrt( (E_total)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (50 + 0.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(50.511² - 0.511² ) ≈ 50.508 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.508 / c. Then k = p / ħ = (50.508 / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.256 fm⁻¹, so 1/k≈3.906 fm. Thus, the more accurate calculation gives 3.906 *9.102≈35.54 fm.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects a non-relativistic calculation, where K = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mK). But for 50 MeV electrons, the non-relativistic approximation is invalid because K ≈ 50 MeV >> m c²=0.511 MeV, so relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the relativistic calculation is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 35.5 fm. But let me check the exact value.\n\nWait, let\'s compute 50.508 / 197.33:\n\n50.508 divided by 197.33 is approximately:\n\n197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325\n\n50.508 - 49.3325 = 1.1755\n\nSo 0.25 + 1.1755/197.33 ≈ 0.25 + 0.00596 ≈ 0.25596 ≈0.256\n\nThus, 1/k=1/0.256≈3.90625 fm\n\nMultiply by S=9.1023:\n\n3.90625 *9.1023≈ 3.90625*9=35.15625; 3.90625*0.1023≈0.3996; total≈35.5558 fm≈35.56 fm\n\nSo approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding, maybe 36 fm. But let\'s check the sum again:\n\nl=0: 1\n\nl=1: 3*sin²(67°)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473≈2.5419\n\nl=2:5*sin²(55°)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710≈3.355\n\nl=3:7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.25)=1.75\n\nl=4:9*sin²(13°)=9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nTotal sum:1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554≈9.1023\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So 9.1023 *3.90625≈35.56 fm. Rounding to two decimal places:35.56 fm. But the problem may expect an answer in a different unit or perhaps expressed in terms of inverse MeV, but since the unit wasn\'t specified, and the calculation leads to femtometers, the answer is approximately 35.6 fm.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s an error in the approach. The scattering amplitude\'s imaginary part at θ=0 is indeed given by the sum over (2l+1) sin²δ_l divided by k. That seems correct. The optical theorem also states that Im f(0) = (k/4π) σ_total, but since we\'re given phase shifts, the partial wave method is direct.\n\nAlternatively, if all phase shifts are real, then the total cross-section is σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l. Then, using the optical theorem, Im f(0) = (k/4π) σ = (k/4π)(4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ), which matches the earlier expression. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately 35.6 fm.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The scattering amplitude \(f(0)\) at \(\theta = 0^\circ\) is given by:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l
\]
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]

We calculate the sum \(S\) for the given phase shifts:
\[
S = \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]
- For \(l = 0\): \(\sin^2 90^\circ = 1\), contribution is \(1 \times 1 = 1\)
- For \(l = 1\): \(\sin^2 67^\circ \approx 0.8473\), contribution is \(3 \times 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\)
- For \(l = 2\): \(\sin^2 55^\circ \approx 0.6710\), contribution is \(5 \times 0.6710 \approx 3.355\)
- For \(l = 3\): \(\sin^2 30^\circ = 0.25\), contribution is \(7 \times 0.25 = 1.75\)
- For \(l = 4\): \(\sin^2 13^\circ \approx 0.0506\), contribution is \(9 \times 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\)

Summing these contributions:
\[
S = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \(k\). For relativistic electrons with energy 50 MeV:
\[
pc = \sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2} \approx 50.508 \text{ MeV}
\]
Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}\):
\[
k = \frac{50.508}{197.33} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]
Thus, \(1/k \approx 3.906 \text{ fm}\).

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \times S \approx 3.906 \text{ fm} \times 9.1023 \approx 35.56 \text{ fm}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, since the problem doesn't specify units, and the answer is likely to be unitless or in terms of fm, but perhaps only the numerical coefficient is needed. Alternatively, if the problem assumes a non-relativistic calculation, but since the energy is high (50 MeV), relativistic is correct. However, perhaps the exact value of k isn't necessary if the answer is to be given in terms of inverse MeV or something else. Wait, but the problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length (fm). But since the phase shifts are given, and the sum is over (2l+1) sin²δ_l, multiplied by 1/k. So the answer would be (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

But let me check if I need to compute k numerically. Let's proceed.

First, compute the sum S = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

Given δ₀=90°, sin²90° = 1, so term l=0: (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1=1

l=1: δ₁=67°, sin²67° ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.847, so (2*1 +1)*0.847 ≈ 3*0.847 ≈ 2.541

l=2: δ₂=55°, sin²55° ≈ (0.8192)^2 ≈ 0.671, so (5)*0.671 ≈ 3.355

l=3: δ₃=30°, sin²30° = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so (7)*0.25 = 1.75

l=4: δ₄=13°, sin²13° ≈ (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.0506, so (9)*0.0506 ≈ 0.455

Adding these up: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355 = 6.896; +1.75 = 8.646; +0.455 = 9.101

So S ≈ 9.101

Then Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.101 ≈ 35.91 fm

But wait, if k is in fm⁻¹, then 1/k is in fm. So the answer is approximately 35.91 fm. But let me check if the calculation of k is correct.

Wait, the electron mass is 0.511 MeV/c². The kinetic energy is 50 MeV. So the total energy E is the kinetic plus rest energy: E = K + mc² = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV

Then, the relativistic momentum is p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2)/c = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²)/c ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261)/c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈ 50.508/c

Thus, p ≈ 50.508 MeV/c / c = 50.508 MeV/(c²) * c? Wait, units are confusing.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, but here, to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹), we use the relation p = ħk. So p = ħk => k = p/ħ. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore, k = p / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) * c. Wait, perhaps better to compute in SI units.

Alternatively, use the practical formula:

For an electron with kinetic energy K, the momentum p can be found using:

p = sqrt( (K + mc²)^2 - (mc²)^2 ) / c

But let's compute p in MeV/c units.

K = 50 MeV

mc² = 0.511 MeV

E = K + mc² = 50.511 MeV

Then, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈ 50.508 / c MeV/c

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write:

p c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 )

So p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.508 MeV

Thus, p = 50.508 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm

So then, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.101 ≈ 35.54 fm

But maybe my calculation of S is approximate. Let's check the individual terms more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: δ₀=90°, sin²90°=1.0, term=1*1=1

l=1: δ₁=67°, sin(67°)=sin(67)= approx 0.9205, so sin²=0.8473, term=3*0.8473≈2.5419

l=2: δ₂=55°, sin(55)=0.8192, sin²=0.6710, term=5*0.6710≈3.355

l=3: δ₃=30°, sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25, term=7*0.25=1.75

l=4: δ₄=13°, sin(13)=approx 0.22495, sin²≈0.0506, term=9*0.0506≈0.4554

Sum: 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554≈9.1023

So S≈9.1023

Then 1/k≈3.906 fm, so Im[f(0)]≈3.906*9.1023≈35.54 fm

But perhaps we need more precise values for sin²δ_l:

For l=1, δ₁=67°: sin(67°)=sin(67)= using calculator: 0.92050485345, so sin²≈0.8473

l=2: sin(55°)=0.81915204428, sin²≈0.6710

l=3: sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25

l=4: sin(13°)=0.2249510543, sin²≈0.0506

So the sum is accurate.

But let's check the value of k again:

E = 50.511 MeV

p c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) = sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) = sqrt(2551.099) ≈ 50.508 MeV

Therefore, p = 50.508 / c in units where c=1 in natural units. Then, converting to inverse femtometers:

k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV) / (ħ c) ) since p c = 50.508 MeV, so p = 50.508 MeV / c

But ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c

Therefore, k = (50.508 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Thus, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.256 ≈ 3.906 fm

Therefore, Im[f(0)] = 3.906 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 35.54 fm

But the problem might expect an answer in terms of inverse MeV or another unit, but since the phase shifts are given in degrees and the energy is given, but the answer is just the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has dimensions of length (fm). So the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. But let's check if there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section: Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ_total

But since it's elastic scattering, σ_total = σ_elastic. But in that case, if we use the optical theorem, we can compute Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ_total. But if we have the phase shifts, perhaps using partial wave expansion is more direct.

Wait, but the problem gives phase shifts and asks for Im f(0). The partial wave expansion gives f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Then Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l, which is exactly what I computed. So 35.5 fm is the answer.

But let me check again the calculation of k. Maybe I made a mistake in relativistic vs. non-relativistic.

For electrons at 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic. The momentum p ≈ E/c = 50 MeV / c. Then k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = 50 / (197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, so 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Then Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 * 9.102 ≈ 35.91 fm. But earlier when considering total energy E = 50.511 MeV, we got 1/k ≈3.906 fm. Which is correct?

The momentum should be calculated using the total energy, not just kinetic. So p c = sqrt( (E_total)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (50 + 0.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(50.511² - 0.511² ) ≈ 50.508 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.508 / c. Then k = p / ħ = (50.508 / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.256 fm⁻¹, so 1/k≈3.906 fm. Thus, the more accurate calculation gives 3.906 *9.102≈35.54 fm.

But perhaps the question expects a non-relativistic calculation, where K = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mK). But for 50 MeV electrons, the non-relativistic approximation is invalid because K ≈ 50 MeV >> m c²=0.511 MeV, so relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the relativistic calculation is necessary.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.5 fm. But let me check the exact value.

Wait, let's compute 50.508 / 197.33:

50.508 divided by 197.33 is approximately:

197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325

50.508 - 49.3325 = 1.1755

So 0.25 + 1.1755/197.33 ≈ 0.25 + 0.00596 ≈ 0.25596 ≈0.256

Thus, 1/k=1/0.256≈3.90625 fm

Multiply by S=9.1023:

3.90625 *9.1023≈ 3.90625*9=35.15625; 3.90625*0.1023≈0.3996; total≈35.5558 fm≈35.56 fm

So approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding, maybe 36 fm. But let's check the sum again:

l=0: 1

l=1: 3*sin²(67°)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473≈2.5419

l=2:5*sin²(55°)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710≈3.355

l=3:7*sin²(30°)=7*(0.25)=1.75

l=4:9*sin²(13°)=9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554

Total sum:1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554≈9.1023

Yes, that's correct. So 9.1023 *3.90625≈35.56 fm. Rounding to two decimal places:35.56 fm. But the problem may expect an answer in a different unit or perhaps expressed in terms of inverse MeV, but since the unit wasn't specified, and the calculation leads to femtometers, the answer is approximately 35.6 fm.

But let me check if there's an error in the approach. The scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is indeed given by the sum over (2l+1) sin²δ_l divided by k. That seems correct. The optical theorem also states that Im f(0) = (k/4π) σ_total, but since we're given phase shifts, the partial wave method is direct.

Alternatively, if all phase shifts are real, then the total cross-section is σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l. Then, using the optical theorem, Im f(0) = (k/4π) σ = (k/4π)(4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ), which matches the earlier expression. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on the precision of the given phase shifts (which are given to the nearest degree), maybe the answer should be given with two significant figures, so 36 fm. But let's see:

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. These are all given to the nearest degree, except δ₂=55 (presumably 55.0°). So two significant figures? Let's check the sum:

If we use more precise sine values:

l=0: 1

l=1: sin(67°) = sin(67) ≈0.92050485345, squared≈0.8473 (four decimal places)

l=2: sin(55°)=0.81915204428, squared≈0.6710

l=3: sin(30°)=0.5, squared=0.25

l=4: sin(13°)=0.2249510543, squared≈0.0506

Therefore, the sum is 1 + 3*0.8473 +5*0.6710 +7*0.25 +9*0.0506

Compute each term:

3*0.8473=2.5419

5*0.6710=3.355

7*0.25=1.75

9*0.0506=0.4554

Summing:

1 + 2.5419=3.5419

+3.355=6.8969

+1.75=8.6469

+0.4554=9.1023

So S=9.1023

Then 1/k=3.90625 fm

Multiply: 9.1023*3.90625≈35.5558 fm≈35.56 fm

So with the given data, the answer is 35.56 fm. Depending on the problem's expectation, maybe round to two decimal places (35.56), one decimal (35.6), or integer (36). Since phase shifts are given to the nearest degree, which is two significant figures for δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, but δ₂=55 is two as well. So the sum S is 9.1 (two significant figures?), but let's see:

If δ₀=90° (exact?), if 90° is exact, then sin²90=1 exact. The other phases:

δ₁=67°: two sig figs

δ₂=55°: two

δ₃=30°: two

δ₄=13°: two

So all terms have two significant figures except l=0, which is exact. Then the sum would be:

l=0: 1 (exact)

l=1: 3*0.85 (since sin²67≈0.85 with two sig figs)

l=2:5*0.67

l=3:7*0.25

l=4:9*0.051

Then:

l=0:1

l=1:3*0.85=2.55

l=2:5*0.67=3.35

l=3:7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9*0.051=0.459

Sum:1+2.55=3.55+3.35=6.9+1.75=8.65+0.459=9.109

So S≈9.1 (two sig figs). Then 1/k≈3.9 fm (two sig figs from k≈0.256≈0.26, so 1/k≈3.85≈3.9)

Thus, Im[f(0)]≈3.9*9.1≈35.5 fm, which is two sig figs:36 fm.

But since the problem gave δ₂=55, which could be two or maybe three sig figs (if 55.0), but since others are given as whole numbers, likely two. So the answer should be 36 fm.

But in the initial calculation, the precise value is ~35.56, which rounds to 36 when using two sig figs. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{36} fm.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer without units, but since the units are femtometers, and scattering amplitude has units of length, it's appropriate. However, sometimes scattering amplitudes are given in terms of the nuclear radius or other units, but here with the given data, femtometers are correct.

But to confirm, let's check if 1/k is indeed about 3.9 fm.

Given that k = p/ħ, and p = sqrt(E² - m²)/c ≈ E/c for high energy.

E=50 MeV, so p≈50 MeV/c.

But ħc≈197.33 MeV·fm, so k = p/ħ = (50 MeV/c)/(ħ) = 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹, so 1/k≈3.95 fm. If we use this approximate value, then 3.95 *9.1≈35.9≈36 fm. Therefore, rounding to two significant figures, the answer is \boxed{36} fm.

**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36} femtometers.

Therefore, k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. However, the scattering amplitude f(0) is in units of length (fm), as the differential cross-section is |f|² in fm²/sr. So, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, so units are (fm) * (dimensionless) = fm. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) will also be in fm.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn\'t need the actual numerical value in terms of fm? Wait, but the question says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So, perhaps they just want the expression in terms of the phase shifts, multiplied by 1/k. But since the problem gives the energy, 50 MeV, and the phase shifts, perhaps we need to compute the numerical value.\n\nBut let me check. If the problem is phrased as "calculate the imaginary part," and it\'s from a physics problem, they likely expect a numerical answer, so we need to compute the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l +1) sin²δ_l, multiply by 1/k, and express the result in appropriate units.\n\nTherefore, first, compute each term (2l +1) sin²δ_l for each l:\n\nGiven phase shifts:\n\nl=0: δ₀=90°, so sinδ₀=sin90°=1. Therefore, (2*0 +1)*sin²90°=1*1=1.\n\nl=1: δ₁=67°, sin67°≈0.9205, sin²≈0.8473. Then, (2*1 +1)=3, so 3*0.8473≈2.5419.\n\nl=2: δ₂=55°, sin55≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. (2*2 +1)=5, so 5*0.6710≈3.355.\n\nl=3: δ₃=30°, sin30°=0.5, sin²=0.25. (2*3 +1)=7, so 7*0.25=1.75.\n\nl=4: δ₄=13°, sin13°≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. (2*4 +1)=9, so 9*0.0506≈0.4554.\n\nNow, summing all these terms:\n\nl=0: 1\n\nl=1: ~2.5419\n\nl=2: ~3.355\n\nl=3: 1.75\n\nl=4: ~0.4554\n\nTotal sum ≈ 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; plus 3.355 = 6.8969; plus 1.75 = 8.6469; plus 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023.\n\nSo, the sum S = Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ≈ 9.1023.\n\nThen, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ (1/k) * 9.1023.\n\nNow, compute 1/k. As above, k = E / (ħ c) ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.\n\nHence, Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 3.946 * 9.1023 ≈ let\'s compute:\n\n3.946 * 9 = 35.514,\n\n3.946 * 0.1023 ≈ 0.4036.\n\nTotal ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm.\n\nTherefore, approximately 35.9 fm. But let me check the calculations again step by step to verify.\n\nFirst, the sum S:\n\nl=0: 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3*(sin67°)^2. Let me compute sin67° more accurately. 67 degrees. sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(67.5°)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2≈0.9239. So 67° is a bit less. Using calculator input:\n\nsin(67°) ≈ sin(1.16937 radians) ≈ 0.9205. So sin²≈0.8473. Then 3*0.8473≈2.5419. Correct.\n\nl=2: sin55°≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. 5*0.6710≈3.355. Correct.\n\nl=3: sin30°=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75. Correct.\n\nl=4: sin13°≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.\n\nSumming:\n\n1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419\n\n3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969\n\n6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469\n\n8.6469 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023. Correct.\n\nThen, 1/k. Let me recalculate k. The exact formula is:\n\nk = sqrt( (E/(ħ c))² - (m c²/(ħ c))² )\n\nBut since E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV, and ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nExpressed in inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹):\n\nk = sqrt( (50 / 197.33)^2 - (0.511 / 197.33)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (0.2534)^2 - (0.00259)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0642 - 0.0000067) ≈ sqrt(0.06419) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Thus, Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 35.9176 fm ≈ 35.9 fm.\n\nBut wait, the problem states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons." Electrons are spin-1/2 particles. However, in the partial wave expansion for electrons, since they are spin-1/2, their scattering amplitude might involve additional terms due to spin-orbit coupling. However, the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, so perhaps those already account for the necessary spin considerations. If the problem provides phase shifts δ_l, then regardless of spin, the given formula should hold. But in reality, electrons would have both spin and orbital angular momentum contributing, but perhaps in this problem, the phase shifts are given as if for a spinless particle. However, since the problem doesn\'t mention spin, and in many cases with electrons, especially at high energies, the spin effects might be incorporated into the phase shifts. Therefore, proceeding with the given phase shifts as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that the electrons are treated as spinless particles, or that their spin effects are negligible, allowing the use of the standard partial wave expansion for spinless particles. Given that the problem provides phase shifts δ_l, I think the standard formula applies.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is approximately 35.9 fm. However, let\'s check if there\'s a possible error in the calculation.\n\nWait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. When calculating the sine of the phase shifts, we have to ensure that we use degrees, not radians. For example, sin(90°) is 1, which is correct. Similarly, sin(67°), sin(55°), etc., are calculated correctly in degrees. So, as long as the calculator or sine function is set to degrees, the values are correct.\n\nYes, the sine values were computed in degrees. For example, sin(67 degrees) is approximately 0.9205, which is correct. So, the calculation of each term is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum S ≈ 9.1023, multiplied by 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm, gives approximately 35.9 fm. So, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is about 35.9 fm.\n\nBut let me check once more the formula for the imaginary part. The scattering amplitude\'s imaginary part at θ=0 is (1/k) * Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. But in some references, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. Therefore, if I recall, the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. So, according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. Therefore, if the problem is asking for Im[f(0)], then Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total. But here, we have calculated Im[f(0)] directly from the partial wave expansion as (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. However, according to the optical theorem, this should also equal (k / 4π) σ_total, but σ_total would be the sum of all partial cross-sections. Let me check.\n\nIn partial wave analysis, the total cross-section is σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, substituting into the optical theorem:\n\nσ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)] => Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total = (k / 4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.\n\nThus, the formula used is consistent with the optical theorem. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. However, depending on the precision of the sine squared terms, perhaps a more accurate calculation is required. Let me recalculate the sum with more precise values.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1.\n\nl=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let\'s compute sin(67°). Using a calculator:\n\nsin(67°) ≈ 0.9205048535. Then sin²(67°) ≈ 0.8473291. Multiply by 3: 3 * 0.8473291 ≈ 2.5419873.\n\nl=2: 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°) ≈ 0.8191520443. sin²≈0.6710100707. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.6710100707 ≈ 3.35505035.\n\nl=3: 7 * sin²(30°). sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.\n\nl=4: 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)≈0.2249510543. sin²≈0.05060417. Multiply by 9: 9*0.05060417≈0.4554375.\n\nNow, sum these more precise values:\n\n1 (l=0)\n\n+2.5419873 (l=1) = 3.5419873\n\n+3.35505035 (l=2) = 6.89703765\n\n+1.75 (l=3) = 8.64703765\n\n+0.4554375 (l=4) = 9.10247515.\n\nSo, S = 9.10247515.\n\nThen, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Let\'s compute 9.10247515 * 3.946.\n\nFirst, 9 * 3.946 = 35.514\n\n0.10247515 * 3.946 ≈ 0.102475 * 3.946 ≈ approx. 0.1024 * 3.946 ≈ 0.4043\n\nTotal ≈ 35.514 + 0.4043 ≈ 35.9183 fm.\n\nThus, approximately 35.918 fm. Rounding to three significant figures, since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees except δ₂=55 (which is also a whole number). The given energy is 50 MeV (two significant figures). However, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, each with two significant figures except 90° and 55°, which are exact. The energy is 50 MeV, which could be two significant figures. But the answer is around 36 fm. However, given that in the calculation we had up to four decimal places in the sum, but the phase shifts are given to two significant figures (except 90°, which is exact), the precision of the answer is limited by the input data. For example, δ₁=67°, which is two significant figures, δ₄=13°, two significant figures. Therefore, the sum S is approximately 9.1, and 1/k is approximately 3.9 fm. Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.5, which is roughly 36 fm. But given the exactness of δ₀=90°, which contributes 1, and the others are approximate, perhaps the answer should be given as 36 fm. But in the calculation, it\'s approximately 35.9, which is 35.9 fm, which is three significant figures. However, since the given phase shifts have two significant figures (except 90°), maybe we should present two significant figures. Let\'s see:\n\nThe phase shifts:\n\nδ₀=90° (exact, two significant figures)\n\nδ₁=67° (two significant figures)\n\nδ₂=55° (two significant figures)\n\nδ₃=30° (two significant figures)\n\nδ₄=13° (two significant figures)\n\nThe energy is 50 MeV (two significant figures). Therefore, the final answer should be given to two significant figures. 35.9 rounds to 36. So, 36 fm.\n\nBut let me check the exact multiplication:\n\n9.10247515 * 3.946.\n\nCompute 9.10247515 * 3.946:\n\nFirst, multiply 9.1 * 3.946:\n\n9 * 3.946 = 35.514\n\n0.1 * 3.946 = 0.3946\n\nTotal: 35.514 + 0.3946 = 35.9086\n\nThen, the remaining 0.00247515 * 3.946 ≈ ~0.00976\n\nTotal ≈ 35.9086 + 0.00976 ≈ 35.9183 fm.\n\nSo, approximately 35.918 fm, which is 35.9 fm if we take three significant figures, or 36 fm with two. Given that all inputs (except δ₀=90°) are two significant figures, and the energy is two significant figures, the answer should be 36 fm. However, in some contexts, 90° is considered exact, so maybe that term is exact. But even then, other phase shifts are two sig figs, so the sum S has a precision limited by two sig figs. Let\'s check:\n\nIf δ₁=67° (two sig figs), so sin²(67°) is approximate. If δ₁ was 67.0°, then sin²(67.0°) is precise, but since it\'s given as 67°, there\'s an uncertainty in the sine. For example, 67° ± 0.5° would lead to sin²(67°) ± some error. Similarly for the others.\n\nAssuming all phase shifts are given to the nearest degree, except δ₀=90°, which is exact. Then, the errors would propagate. But since the problem doesn\'t specify uncertainties, we can take the given phase shifts as exact. Therefore, the answer is 35.9 fm, which can be written as 36 fm with two sig figs, but since 50 MeV is two sig figs, and the phase shifts are given as whole numbers (except δ₀=90°, which is exact), perhaps 36 fm is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, but since the problem gives numerical phase shifts and energy, it expects a numerical answer. So, 36 fm. However, let me check the value of 1/k again.\n\nk = sqrt( (50/197.33)^2 - (0.511/197.33)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2534² - 0.00259²) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, so 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. So, 3.946 is four significant figures, but since 50 MeV is two sig figs, perhaps 1/k is 3.9 fm (two sig figs). Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.49 ≈ 35 fm. But this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is given as 50.0 MeV, implying three sig figs, but the problem states 50 MeV, which is ambiguous. In many contexts, 50 could be one or two sig figs, but in physics problems, typically trailing zeros without decimals are ambiguous. However, given that it\'s 50 MeV, likely two sig figs. Therefore, 1/k would be 3.9 fm (two sig figs), and the sum S is 9.1 (two sig figs). Then, 3.9 * 9.1 ≈ 35.49, which rounds to 35 fm. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, but 9.1 is two sig figs? Wait, the sum S was calculated as 9.1023, but given the phase shifts are two sig figs (except δ₀=90°), the sum S can only be known to two sig figs. So S ≈ 9.1 (two sig figs). Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.5, which rounds to 36 (two sig figs). Wait, 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49, which is approximately 35.5, which is three sig figs, but since both factors have two sig figs, the answer should be 35 (or 36?) with two sig figs. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let\'s recall the rules for significant figures:\n\nWhen multiplying, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise value. Here, 9.1 (two sig figs) * 3.9 (two sig figs) = 35.49, which should be rounded to 35 (two sig figs). But 35.49 is closer to 35 than to 36. Wait, 35.49 is 35.5 when rounded to one decimal place, but as two sig figs, 35.49 becomes 35. So perhaps 35 fm.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the earlier calculation where 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49 ≈ 35.5 ≈ 36 if we round to two sig figs. Wait, no. 35.49 has two sig figs: the first two digits are 3 and 5. The third digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it would round down. Therefore, 35.49 to two sig figs is 35. Therefore, 35 fm. But this contradicts the initial calculation of approximately 35.9 fm. This discrepancy arises from the ambiguity in the number of significant figures in the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us not to worry about significant figures and just compute the numerical value as is. Since the phase shifts are given as whole numbers, and the energy as 50 MeV, which is likely two sig figs, but the calculation of 1/k is 3.946 fm, which is four sig figs. However, if we take 1/k as 3.946 fm and S as 9.1023, the product is 35.918 fm. If the problem expects an exact answer, perhaps 36 fm is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the answer is supposed to be in terms of 1/k, but with k expressed via the given energy. Wait, but the problem says "calculate the imaginary part," so they need a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a different approach. Wait, the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target." Electrons at 50 MeV are high-energy, so the wavelength is small, and the partial wave expansion would require many terms, but the problem states to ignore phase shifts beyond l=4. However, given that the calculation is straightforward, and the answer is around 36 fm, which is plausible.\n\nBut let me check again if the formula for the imaginary part is correct. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). At θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. The imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 35.9 fm, which can be reasonably rounded to 36 fm. Therefore, I think the answer is 36 fm, and the problem expects this boxed as \\boxed{36 \\text{ fm}}.\n\nHowever, to ensure, let me check another approach. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. If I compute the total cross-section using the partial wave formula and then apply the optical theorem, I should get the same result. The total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Then, according to the optical theorem, Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total = (k / 4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the calculation is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm, which rounds to 36 fm. Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is \\boxed{36 \\text{ fm}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{36 \\text{ fm}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387211, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5546, prompt_tokens=1321, total_tokens=6867, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is given by:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

First, we calculate each term in the sum:
- For \( l = 0 \): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2 90^\circ = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- For \( l = 1 \): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2 67^\circ \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419 \)
- For \( l = 2 \): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2 55^\circ \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355 \)
- For \( l = 3 \): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2 30^\circ = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- For \( l = 4 \): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2 13^\circ \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554 \)

Summing these contributions:
\[
1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \( k \). For 50 MeV electrons:
\[
k \approx \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50 \text{ MeV}}{197.33 \text{ MeV fm}} \approx 0.2534 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]
Thus, \( \frac{1}{k} \approx 3.946 \text{ fm} \).

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = 3.946 \text{ fm} \times 9.1023 \approx 35.918 \text{ fm}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures (consistent with the given data), the result is:
\[
\boxed{36 \text{ fm}}
\]

But let's check.

Wait, if ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, then k = p / ħ = (E / c) / ħ = E / (ħ c). Therefore, k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. However, the scattering amplitude f(0) is in units of length (fm), as the differential cross-section is |f|² in fm²/sr. So, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, so units are (fm) * (dimensionless) = fm. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) will also be in fm.

But perhaps the problem doesn't need the actual numerical value in terms of fm? Wait, but the question says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So, perhaps they just want the expression in terms of the phase shifts, multiplied by 1/k. But since the problem gives the energy, 50 MeV, and the phase shifts, perhaps we need to compute the numerical value.

But let me check. If the problem is phrased as "calculate the imaginary part," and it's from a physics problem, they likely expect a numerical answer, so we need to compute the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l +1) sin²δ_l, multiply by 1/k, and express the result in appropriate units.

Therefore, first, compute each term (2l +1) sin²δ_l for each l:

Given phase shifts:

l=0: δ₀=90°, so sinδ₀=sin90°=1. Therefore, (2*0 +1)*sin²90°=1*1=1.

l=1: δ₁=67°, sin67°≈0.9205, sin²≈0.8473. Then, (2*1 +1)=3, so 3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: δ₂=55°, sin55≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. (2*2 +1)=5, so 5*0.6710≈3.355.

l=3: δ₃=30°, sin30°=0.5, sin²=0.25. (2*3 +1)=7, so 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ₄=13°, sin13°≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. (2*4 +1)=9, so 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, summing all these terms:

l=0: 1

l=1: ~2.5419

l=2: ~3.355

l=3: 1.75

l=4: ~0.4554

Total sum ≈ 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; plus 3.355 = 6.8969; plus 1.75 = 8.6469; plus 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023.

So, the sum S = Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ≈ 9.1023.

Then, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * S ≈ (1/k) * 9.1023.

Now, compute 1/k. As above, k = E / (ħ c) ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm.

Hence, Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 3.946 * 9.1023 ≈ let's compute:

3.946 * 9 = 35.514,

3.946 * 0.1023 ≈ 0.4036.

Total ≈ 35.514 + 0.4036 ≈ 35.9176 fm.

Therefore, approximately 35.9 fm. But let me check the calculations again step by step to verify.

First, the sum S:

l=0: 1*1=1

l=1: 3*(sin67°)^2. Let me compute sin67° more accurately. 67 degrees. sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(67.5°)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2≈0.9239. So 67° is a bit less. Using calculator input:

sin(67°) ≈ sin(1.16937 radians) ≈ 0.9205. So sin²≈0.8473. Then 3*0.8473≈2.5419. Correct.

l=2: sin55°≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. 5*0.6710≈3.355. Correct.

l=3: sin30°=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75. Correct.

l=4: sin13°≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.

Summing:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469

8.6469 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023. Correct.

Then, 1/k. Let me recalculate k. The exact formula is:

k = sqrt( (E/(ħ c))² - (m c²/(ħ c))² )

But since E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV, and ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Expressed in inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹):

k = sqrt( (50 / 197.33)^2 - (0.511 / 197.33)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (0.2534)^2 - (0.00259)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0642 - 0.0000067) ≈ sqrt(0.06419) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Thus, Im[f(0)] ≈ 3.946 fm * 9.1023 ≈ 35.9176 fm ≈ 35.9 fm.

But wait, the problem states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons." Electrons are spin-1/2 particles. However, in the partial wave expansion for electrons, since they are spin-1/2, their scattering amplitude might involve additional terms due to spin-orbit coupling. However, the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, so perhaps those already account for the necessary spin considerations. If the problem provides phase shifts δ_l, then regardless of spin, the given formula should hold. But in reality, electrons would have both spin and orbital angular momentum contributing, but perhaps in this problem, the phase shifts are given as if for a spinless particle. However, since the problem doesn't mention spin, and in many cases with electrons, especially at high energies, the spin effects might be incorporated into the phase shifts. Therefore, proceeding with the given phase shifts as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that the electrons are treated as spinless particles, or that their spin effects are negligible, allowing the use of the standard partial wave expansion for spinless particles. Given that the problem provides phase shifts δ_l, I think the standard formula applies.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is approximately 35.9 fm. However, let's check if there's a possible error in the calculation.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. When calculating the sine of the phase shifts, we have to ensure that we use degrees, not radians. For example, sin(90°) is 1, which is correct. Similarly, sin(67°), sin(55°), etc., are calculated correctly in degrees. So, as long as the calculator or sine function is set to degrees, the values are correct.

Yes, the sine values were computed in degrees. For example, sin(67 degrees) is approximately 0.9205, which is correct. So, the calculation of each term is correct.

Therefore, the sum S ≈ 9.1023, multiplied by 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm, gives approximately 35.9 fm. So, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is about 35.9 fm.

But let me check once more the formula for the imaginary part. The scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is (1/k) * Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. But in some references, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. Therefore, if I recall, the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. So, according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)]. Therefore, if the problem is asking for Im[f(0)], then Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total. But here, we have calculated Im[f(0)] directly from the partial wave expansion as (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. However, according to the optical theorem, this should also equal (k / 4π) σ_total, but σ_total would be the sum of all partial cross-sections. Let me check.

In partial wave analysis, the total cross-section is σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, substituting into the optical theorem:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)] => Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total = (k / 4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.

Thus, the formula used is consistent with the optical theorem. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. However, depending on the precision of the sine squared terms, perhaps a more accurate calculation is required. Let me recalculate the sum with more precise values.

First, compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). Using a calculator:

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205048535. Then sin²(67°) ≈ 0.8473291. Multiply by 3: 3 * 0.8473291 ≈ 2.5419873.

l=2: 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°) ≈ 0.8191520443. sin²≈0.6710100707. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.6710100707 ≈ 3.35505035.

l=3: 7 * sin²(30°). sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)≈0.2249510543. sin²≈0.05060417. Multiply by 9: 9*0.05060417≈0.4554375.

Now, sum these more precise values:

1 (l=0)

+2.5419873 (l=1) = 3.5419873

+3.35505035 (l=2) = 6.89703765

+1.75 (l=3) = 8.64703765

+0.4554375 (l=4) = 9.10247515.

So, S = 9.10247515.

Then, 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. Let's compute 9.10247515 * 3.946.

First, 9 * 3.946 = 35.514

0.10247515 * 3.946 ≈ 0.102475 * 3.946 ≈ approx. 0.1024 * 3.946 ≈ 0.4043

Total ≈ 35.514 + 0.4043 ≈ 35.9183 fm.

Thus, approximately 35.918 fm. Rounding to three significant figures, since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees except δ₂=55 (which is also a whole number). The given energy is 50 MeV (two significant figures). However, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, each with two significant figures except 90° and 55°, which are exact. The energy is 50 MeV, which could be two significant figures. But the answer is around 36 fm. However, given that in the calculation we had up to four decimal places in the sum, but the phase shifts are given to two significant figures (except 90°, which is exact), the precision of the answer is limited by the input data. For example, δ₁=67°, which is two significant figures, δ₄=13°, two significant figures. Therefore, the sum S is approximately 9.1, and 1/k is approximately 3.9 fm. Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.5, which is roughly 36 fm. But given the exactness of δ₀=90°, which contributes 1, and the others are approximate, perhaps the answer should be given as 36 fm. But in the calculation, it's approximately 35.9, which is 35.9 fm, which is three significant figures. However, since the given phase shifts have two significant figures (except 90°), maybe we should present two significant figures. Let's see:

The phase shifts:

δ₀=90° (exact, two significant figures)

δ₁=67° (two significant figures)

δ₂=55° (two significant figures)

δ₃=30° (two significant figures)

δ₄=13° (two significant figures)

The energy is 50 MeV (two significant figures). Therefore, the final answer should be given to two significant figures. 35.9 rounds to 36. So, 36 fm.

But let me check the exact multiplication:

9.10247515 * 3.946.

Compute 9.10247515 * 3.946:

First, multiply 9.1 * 3.946:

9 * 3.946 = 35.514

0.1 * 3.946 = 0.3946

Total: 35.514 + 0.3946 = 35.9086

Then, the remaining 0.00247515 * 3.946 ≈ ~0.00976

Total ≈ 35.9086 + 0.00976 ≈ 35.9183 fm.

So, approximately 35.918 fm, which is 35.9 fm if we take three significant figures, or 36 fm with two. Given that all inputs (except δ₀=90°) are two significant figures, and the energy is two significant figures, the answer should be 36 fm. However, in some contexts, 90° is considered exact, so maybe that term is exact. But even then, other phase shifts are two sig figs, so the sum S has a precision limited by two sig figs. Let's check:

If δ₁=67° (two sig figs), so sin²(67°) is approximate. If δ₁ was 67.0°, then sin²(67.0°) is precise, but since it's given as 67°, there's an uncertainty in the sine. For example, 67° ± 0.5° would lead to sin²(67°) ± some error. Similarly for the others.

Assuming all phase shifts are given to the nearest degree, except δ₀=90°, which is exact. Then, the errors would propagate. But since the problem doesn't specify uncertainties, we can take the given phase shifts as exact. Therefore, the answer is 35.9 fm, which can be written as 36 fm with two sig figs, but since 50 MeV is two sig figs, and the phase shifts are given as whole numbers (except δ₀=90°, which is exact), perhaps 36 fm is appropriate.

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, but since the problem gives numerical phase shifts and energy, it expects a numerical answer. So, 36 fm. However, let me check the value of 1/k again.

k = sqrt( (50/197.33)^2 - (0.511/197.33)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2534² - 0.00259²) ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹, so 1/k ≈ 3.946 fm. So, 3.946 is four significant figures, but since 50 MeV is two sig figs, perhaps 1/k is 3.9 fm (two sig figs). Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.49 ≈ 35 fm. But this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the energy is given as 50.0 MeV, implying three sig figs, but the problem states 50 MeV, which is ambiguous. In many contexts, 50 could be one or two sig figs, but in physics problems, typically trailing zeros without decimals are ambiguous. However, given that it's 50 MeV, likely two sig figs. Therefore, 1/k would be 3.9 fm (two sig figs), and the sum S is 9.1 (two sig figs). Then, 3.9 * 9.1 ≈ 35.49, which rounds to 35 fm. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, but 9.1 is two sig figs? Wait, the sum S was calculated as 9.1023, but given the phase shifts are two sig figs (except δ₀=90°), the sum S can only be known to two sig figs. So S ≈ 9.1 (two sig figs). Then, 9.1 * 3.9 ≈ 35.5, which rounds to 36 (two sig figs). Wait, 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49, which is approximately 35.5, which is three sig figs, but since both factors have two sig figs, the answer should be 35 (or 36?) with two sig figs. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's recall the rules for significant figures:

When multiplying, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise value. Here, 9.1 (two sig figs) * 3.9 (two sig figs) = 35.49, which should be rounded to 35 (two sig figs). But 35.49 is closer to 35 than to 36. Wait, 35.49 is 35.5 when rounded to one decimal place, but as two sig figs, 35.49 becomes 35. So perhaps 35 fm.

But this is conflicting with the earlier calculation where 9.1 * 3.9 = 35.49 ≈ 35.5 ≈ 36 if we round to two sig figs. Wait, no. 35.49 has two sig figs: the first two digits are 3 and 5. The third digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it would round down. Therefore, 35.49 to two sig figs is 35. Therefore, 35 fm. But this contradicts the initial calculation of approximately 35.9 fm. This discrepancy arises from the ambiguity in the number of significant figures in the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us not to worry about significant figures and just compute the numerical value as is. Since the phase shifts are given as whole numbers, and the energy as 50 MeV, which is likely two sig figs, but the calculation of 1/k is 3.946 fm, which is four sig figs. However, if we take 1/k as 3.946 fm and S as 9.1023, the product is 35.918 fm. If the problem expects an exact answer, perhaps 36 fm is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the answer is supposed to be in terms of 1/k, but with k expressed via the given energy. Wait, but the problem says "calculate the imaginary part," so they need a numerical answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target." Electrons at 50 MeV are high-energy, so the wavelength is small, and the partial wave expansion would require many terms, but the problem states to ignore phase shifts beyond l=4. However, given that the calculation is straightforward, and the answer is around 36 fm, which is plausible.

But let me check again if the formula for the imaginary part is correct. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). At θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. The imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 35.9 fm, which can be reasonably rounded to 36 fm. Therefore, I think the answer is 36 fm, and the problem expects this boxed as \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

However, to ensure, let me check another approach. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. If I compute the total cross-section using the partial wave formula and then apply the optical theorem, I should get the same result. The total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Then, according to the optical theorem, Im[f(0)] = (k / 4π) σ_total = (k / 4π) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the calculation is consistent.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm, which rounds to 36 fm. Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{36 \text{ fm}}
