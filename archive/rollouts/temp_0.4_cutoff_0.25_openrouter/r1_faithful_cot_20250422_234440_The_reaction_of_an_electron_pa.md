# Original Question

The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).
Arrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity of the given species is determined by factors such as charge, polarizability, solvation, and steric effects. Here's the analysis:

1. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: Sulfur's larger size and lower electronegativity make it highly polarizable and less solvated in polar protic solvents like water. This makes ethanethiolate the strongest nucleophile in the list.

2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base with a localized negative charge. Despite being highly solvated, its smaller size allows it to attack electrophilic centers more effectively than bulkier nucleophiles.

3. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A bulky alkoxide. While its steric hindrance reduces nucleophilicity compared to hydroxide, its localized negative charge (unlike resonance-stabilized carboxylates) makes it more reactive than propionate.

4. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: The negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms via resonance, reducing its nucleophilicity compared to alkoxides and hydroxide.

5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Neutral and protonated in aqueous solution, making it the poorest nucleophile due to the lack of a negative charge.

**Order of reactivity (most to least):**  
**5. Ethanethiolate > 2. Hydroxide > 1. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate > 3. Propionate > 4. Methanol**

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to arrange these nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. The options are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. Hmm. 

First, I remember that nucleophilicity is about how well a nucleophile can attack an electrophilic center. But in polar protic solvents, like water, the nucleophilicity is related to the ability to donate electrons, but also affected by solvation. The more the nucleophile is solvated, the less reactive it is because it's surrounded by solvent molecules. 

So in polar protic solvents, the trend for nucleophilicity is opposite to basicity? Wait, no. Wait, basicity is the ability to accept a proton, which relates to the stability of the conjugate acid. But nucleophilicity is about attacking a positive or electron-deficient atom. In polar protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. For example, in a protic solvent, iodide is a better nucleophile than fluoride because it's less solvated. But in polar aprotic solvents, the order reverses because basicity (which correlates with nucleophilicity there) becomes more important. 

So in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the nucleophilicity depends on how well the nucleophile can avoid being solvated. Larger, more polarizable ions with lower charge density are better nucleophiles. Let me list the nucleophiles here:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: that's a cyclohexoxide ion with a methyl group. So it's a bulky alkoxide.
2. Hydroxide: OH⁻
3. Propionate: CH2CH2COO⁻ (maybe it's CH2CH2COO⁻? Wait, propionate is CH3CH2COO⁻)
4. Methanol: CH3OH, which is a neutral molecule, not a charged species.
5. Ethanethiolate: HS⁻? Wait, ethanethiolate would be CH3CH2S⁻, right? Because ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH, so the deprotonated form is CH3CH2S⁻.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, the actual species present would depend on their pKa. For example, hydroxide is a strong base, pKa around 15.5 for water. Methanol has a pKa around 19-20, so in aqueous solution, methanol would be mostly protonated, as the solution is less basic than its pKa. Similarly, propionic acid has a pKa around 4.87, so propionate is its conjugate base, which would be deprotonated in aqueous solution (since water's pH is around 7, which is higher than 4.87). Ethanethiol has a pKa around 10, so ethanethiolate (its conjugate base) would exist in solution if the pH is higher than 10. But in neutral aqueous solution (pH 7), ethanethiol would be mostly protonated. Wait, but the question says "in aqueous solution"—but does it specify the pH? Maybe we can assume it's in a solution where all the possible deprotonation has occurred, or maybe the nucleophiles are given as their conjugate bases. Let me check the list again.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: that's already the deprotonated form, so it's an alkoxide ion.
2. Hydroxide: OH⁻
3. Propionate: CH3CH2COO⁻
4. Methanol: CH3OH (neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate: CH3CH2S⁻

So, assuming all are present in their deprotonated forms where applicable. Methanol is neutral, so it's not deprotonated (since its pKa is ~19.7, so in neutral water, it remains as CH3OH). Ethanethiolate's conjugate acid (ethanethiol) has a pKa around 10, so in aqueous solution at pH 7, it would be mostly protonated. But the question lists "ethanethiolate" as the nucleophile, so maybe we are considering them in their anionic forms regardless of the solution pH? That might be a key point here. If the problem states that these are the nucleophiles in aqueous solution, but perhaps under conditions where they are deprotonated. Otherwise, methanol and ethanethiolate might not be in their deprotonated forms. Wait, but hydroxide is a strong base. If the solution is aqueous, and we have hydroxide ions, then the solution is basic. So maybe the presence of hydroxide suggests a high pH. If the solution is basic enough to deprotonate ethanethiol (pKa ~10), then ethanethiolate would exist. Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa is probably around 19-20 (similar to other alcohols), so in a solution where hydroxide is present (pH ~14), the 4-methylcyclohexanol would be deprotonated to form the cyclohexoxide. Propionic acid has a pKa of ~4.87, so in a basic solution (pH 14), propionate is definitely deprotonated. Methanol, with a pKa of ~19.7, would still be mostly protonated even at pH 14, so methanol would be present as CH3OH. Ethanethiolate would be deprotonated at pH 14. So in this scenario, the nucleophiles are: 1. cyclohexoxide (deprotonated), 2. OH⁻, 3. propionate (deprotonated), 4. methanol (protonated), 5. ethanethiolate (deprotonated). 

Now, considering their nucleophilicity in aqueous (polar protic) solution. The factors here are charge, polarizability, and steric hindrance. 

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the solvation. Larger, less electronegative atoms are less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. For example, in water, the order for some common nucleophiles is RS⁻ > I⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ > Cl⁻ > CH3O⁻ (but this can vary based on specific structures). 

Wait, but here we have different nucleophiles. Let's list them again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: a bulky alkoxide ion (RO⁻)
2. Hydroxide (HO⁻)
3. Propionate (RCOO⁻)
4. Methanol (ROH, neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻)

So, comparing these: 

Ethanethiolate (RS⁻) is a sulfur nucleophile. Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so its electrons are more polarizable. In polar protic solvents, RS⁻ is a better nucleophile than RO⁻ because it's less solvated (due to larger size and lower charge density). So ethanethiolate should be more reactive than hydroxide or alkoxides. 

Then, among the oxygen-based nucleophiles, hydroxide (HO⁻) is less bulky than the cyclohexoxide. However, in polar protic solvents, smaller, more charged ions are more solvated. So a bulky alkoxide like 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate might be less solvated than hydroxide because the bulky groups can hinder solvation. Wait, but bulky groups can also hinder the nucleophile's approach to the electrophilic center. So there's a balance between solvation and steric hindrance. 

In general, in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for oxygen nucleophiles is: weaker bases (less solvated) are better nucleophiles. Wait, but hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate (since propionic acid is a weaker acid than water). Wait, the conjugate base of a weak acid is a strong base. Wait, propionic acid has a pKa of ~4.87, so propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide (since water has pKa 15.7, so hydroxide is the conjugate base of water). Wait, no: the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. Propionic acid is a stronger acid than water (pKa 4.87 vs 15.7 for water), so propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide. Therefore, hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate. 

In polar protic solvents, stronger bases are poorer nucleophiles because they are more solvated. Wait, but that's not exactly right. For example, in polar protic solvents, iodide is a better nucleophile than fluoride because it's less solvated. But fluoride is a stronger base. So the trend is that in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity decreases with increasing basicity because the stronger bases are more solvated. Wait, but that's for the same atom. For different atoms, like oxygen vs sulfur, it's different. 

So comparing the same type of nucleophiles: among the oxygen-based ones, hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate (since propionate is the conjugate base of a stronger acid). So in polar protic solvent, the weaker base (propionate) would be a better nucleophile than the stronger base (hydroxide) because it's less solvated. Wait, but propionate is a larger ion compared to hydroxide, so maybe it's less solvated. But propionate is also resonance-stabilized, which delocalizes the charge, making it a weaker base and less solvated. So propionate (RCOO⁻) is a weaker base than hydroxide, so it's less solvated and a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. 

But wait, in reality, carboxylate ions like propionate are generally poor nucleophiles in substitution reactions because the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, making them less nucleophilic compared to hydroxide or alkoxides. So even though propionate is a weaker base, its nucleophilicity might be lower because the charge is delocalized. 

Hmm, maybe I need to think about specific examples. For instance, in SN2 reactions in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity might be: 

RS⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ (for less bulky alkoxides) > RCOO⁻ > ROH

But bulky alkoxides, like tert-butoxide, are less nucleophilic because of steric hindrance. So 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide, which would be less nucleophilic than hydroxide. 

So putting it all together:

1. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻) is the best nucleophile here because sulfur is larger, less electronegative, and less solvated in polar protic solvents. 

Next, hydroxide (HO⁻) is a stronger base than propionate but more solvated. However, propionate (RCOO⁻) has a delocalized charge, making it a weaker nucleophile. Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity, even though propionate is a weaker base, its nucleophilicity might be lower because the negative charge is spread out. For example, in SN2 reactions, carboxylate ions are not great nucleophiles because the lone pairs are delocalized, so they can't attack as effectively. So hydroxide would be a better nucleophile than propionate. 

Then, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Bulky groups hinder the nucleophilic attack, making it less reactive. So even though it's an alkoxide (RO⁻), the steric hindrance reduces its nucleophilicity. So hydroxide is more nucleophilic than the bulky alkoxide. 

Methanol is neutral, so it's a much poorer nucleophile compared to the anions. 

So the order from most to least reactive would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4)

Wait, but wait. Let's check again. 

Ethanethiolate (5) is the best. Then among the oxygen nucleophiles: hydroxide (2) is next. But what about the bulky alkoxide (1)? If the alkoxide is bulky, its nucleophilicity is lower. So hydroxide would be more reactive than the bulky alkoxide. Then propionate (3), which is a carboxylate, less nucleophilic than hydroxide. Then methanol (4) is the worst. 

So order: 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4.

But wait, another angle: in aqueous solution, the solvation plays a big role. Bulky groups can reduce solvation because they can't be surrounded by solvent as effectively. For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than hydroxide because of its bulky groups, making it a stronger base, but in terms of nucleophilicity, the steric hindrance might make it less reactive. Wait, but in SN2 reactions, a bulky nucleophile is worse because the backside attack is hindered. However, if the reaction is not SN2 (but the question is about general nucleophilicity in aqueous solution), maybe it's more about solvation. 

So, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Because of the bulky cyclohexyl group, it's less solvated than hydroxide. Less solvation would mean it's a better nucleophile. But steric hindrance would make it worse. Which effect dominates? 

In polar protic solvents, solvation is a major factor. So if the bulky group reduces solvation, making the nucleophile more available, but steric hindrance makes the attack harder. For example, in protic solvents, tert-butoxide is a weaker nucleophile than ethoxide because even though it's less solvated, the steric hindrance is more significant. Wait, but I'm not sure. In some cases, bulky nucleophiles can be better in polar aprotic solvents where solvation isn't as strong. 

Alternatively, maybe in polar protic solvents, the solvation is so strong that even a bulky alkoxide is more solvated than hydroxide? No, I think bulky groups would hinder solvation. For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than methoxide because the bulky groups make it harder for solvent molecules to approach. Therefore, tert-butoxide is a stronger base (less solvated, more available) but a poorer nucleophile in SN2 reactions because of steric hindrance. 

But nucleophilicity can depend on the reaction. For example, in SN1 reactions, where the nucleophile attacks a carbocation, steric hindrance is less important, so a bulky but strong base might be a good nucleophile. But in SN2, steric hindrance is bad. 

But the question is about general nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. So considering both solvation and steric effects, which is more important? 

If 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is less solvated than hydroxide, it might be a better nucleophile. But if steric hindrance makes it harder to attack, then it's worse. 

In aqueous solution, for SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles are worse. So hydroxide would be a better nucleophile than the bulky alkoxide. 

So maybe the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (most reactive)

2. Hydroxide

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate

3. Propionate

4. Methanol (least reactive)

Wait, but why is propionate below the bulky alkoxide? Propionate is a carboxylate with a delocalized charge, so it's a weaker nucleophile. The bulky alkoxide, even with steric hindrance, has a localized charge on oxygen. So perhaps the bulky alkoxide is a better nucleophile than propionate. 

Yes, because even though it's bulky, the oxygen has a more localized negative charge compared to the resonance-stabilized propionate. So the alkoxide's nucleophilicity is higher than propionate. 

So the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate

2. Hydroxide

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate

3. Propionate

4. Methanol

But wait, another thought: between hydroxide and the bulky alkoxide. If hydroxide is more solvated, but less bulky, which effect wins? For example, in aqueous solution, the solvation of hydroxide is very strong, making it less nucleophilic than a less solvated but more bulky alkoxide. Wait, but I think that in reality, hydroxide is a better nucleophile than bulky alkoxides in polar protic solvents. For example, in water, the order might be RS⁻ > HO⁻ > smaller RO⁻ > larger RO⁻ > RCOO⁻ > ROH. 

Wait, maybe the key is that ethanethiolate is the best, then hydroxide, then the bulky alkoxide, then propionate, then methanol. 

Alternatively, maybe the bulky alkoxide is less nucleophilic than hydroxide because of steric hindrance, even if it's less solvated. 

Let me check a reference example. For instance, compare tert-butoxide vs hydroxide in water. Which is a better nucleophile? Tert-butoxide is a stronger base (pKa of tert-butanol is around 19, so in a solution where both are deprotonated, like in a very basic solution), but in terms of nucleophilicity in SN2 reactions, hydroxide is a better nucleophile because tert-butoxide is too bulky. 

So in aqueous solution, hydroxide is a better nucleophile than bulky alkoxides. Therefore, in the given list, hydroxide (2) would be more reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1). 

Then, propionate (3) is a carboxylate, which is a weaker nucleophile than alkoxides. 

So the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate

2. Hydroxide

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate

3. Propionate

4. Methanol

Wait, but why is the bulky alkoxide more reactive than propionate? Because even though it's bulky, as an alkoxide, it's a stronger base and the charge is localized, making it a better nucleophile than the resonance-stabilized propionate. 

Yes, propionate has a delocalized charge over two oxygen atoms, so each oxygen has a partial negative charge, making the nucleophilicity lower compared to an alkoxide where the charge is localized on a single oxygen. 

Therefore, the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻)

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (bulky RO⁻)

3. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)

4. Methanol (CH3OH)

But I need to confirm if ethanethiolate is indeed more nucleophilic than hydroxide in aqueous solution. For example, in water, is HS⁻ a better nucleophile than OH⁻? Yes, because sulfur is larger and less electronegative, making its electrons more polarizable and less solvated. So ethanethiolate (RS⁻) would be more reactive than hydroxide. 

Then hydroxide comes next. Then the bulky alkoxide. Then propionate. Then methanol. 

Yes, this seems plausible. 

So the final order from most to least reactive is: 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4.

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I need to determine the order of nucleophile reactivity in aqueous solution. My options are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate.

Nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents like water is influenced by electron-donating ability and solvation effects. Higher solvation reduces reactivity by surrounding the nucleophile with solvent molecules.

In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity trends don't directly follow basicity. While basicity concerns proton acceptance and conjugate acid stability, nucleophilicity involves attacking electron-deficient atoms. Larger, less solvated ions make better nucleophiles in protic solvents - for example, iodide outperforms fluoride due to reduced solvation. However, in polar aprotic solvents, this order reverses as basicity becomes more influential.

For aqueous solutions, nucleophilicity depends largely on avoiding solvation. Nucleophiles that are larger, more polarizable, and have lower charge density perform better. Let me review each option:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: A bulky alkoxide ion
2. Hydroxide: OH⁻
3. Propionate: CH₃CH₂COO⁻
4. Methanol: CH₃OH (neutral molecule)
5. Ethanethiolate: CH₃CH₂S⁻

The presence of these species in solution depends on their pKa values. Water has a pKa around 15.5, while methanol's is approximately 19-20, meaning methanol would remain protonated in water. Propionic acid's pKa is around 4.87, so propionate would be deprotonated at neutral pH. Ethanethiol has a pKa of approximately 10, so ethanethiolate would only predominate above pH 10.

Since the question specifies "ethanethiolate" rather than ethanethiol, we might assume we're considering all species in their stated forms regardless of normal aqueous equilibria. Alternatively, the presence of hydroxide could indicate a basic solution where deprotonation of ethanethiol would occur. Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19-20) would require strongly basic conditions to exist significantly as its alkoxide form.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me arrange these nucleophiles from most to least reactive in aqueous solution. The options are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate.

I need to recall that nucleophilicity concerns how well a nucleophile can attack an electrophilic center. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile can donate electrons and its degree of solvation. More solvation means less reactivity, as the nucleophile becomes surrounded by solvent molecules.

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity trend is often opposite to basicity, which measures the ability to accept a proton related to the stability of the conjugate acid. With polar protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. For example, iodide surpasses fluoride as a nucleophile in polar protic solvents due to less solvation. However, in polar aprotic solvents, the order reverses because basicity aligns more with nucleophilicity there.

Thus, in aqueous solution (a polar protic solvent), nucleophilicity hinges on the nucleophile's ability to avoid solvation. Larger, more polarizable ions with lower charge density make better nucleophiles. Now, let's list the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion derived from cyclohexoxide with a methyl group, making it bulky.
2. Hydroxide: OH⁻
3. Propionate: CH3CH2COO⁻ (my earlier uncertainty addressed, as it's CH3CH2COO⁻)
4. Methanol: CH3OH, a neutral molecule.
5. Ethanethiolate: CH3CH2S⁻, the deprotonated form of ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH).

In aqueous solution, the actual species depend on their pKa values. For instance, hydroxide, a strong base, has a water pKa of around 15.5. Methanol's pKa is about 19-20, meaning it remains mostly protonated in water. Propionic acid, with a pKa around 4.87, would have its conjugate base (propionate) mostly deprotonated in water, given water's pH is around 7. Ethanethiol's pKa is roughly 10, so ethanethiolate would primarily exist if pH exceeds 10. However, in neutral water (pH 7), ethanethiol would likely stay protonated. But as the problem lists "ethanethiolate," it implies consideration under deprotonated forms, maybe due to high enough pH.

Let me reiterate the list, assuming they are present in deprotonated forms where appropriate. Methanol remains neutral since its pKa is ~19.7. With the focus on anionic forms in aqueous solution:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (deprotonated).
2. Hydroxide: OH⁻
3. Propionate: CH3CH2COO⁻
4. Methanol: CH3OH (neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate: CH3CH2S⁻ (assuming it's present based on listed conditions). 

So, if hydroxide is present, suggesting a basic solution, ethanethiolate could exist due to basicity (pKa of ~10), allowing its anionic form presence.

Let\'s proceed under that assumption.\n\nIn polar protic solvents (like water), nucleophilicity is inversely related to the solvation. The more the ion is solvated, the less nucleophilic it is. Larger, more polarizable ions are less solvated and hence better nucleophiles. \n\nSo, the order in polar protic solvents (like water) is typically: \n\nRS⁻ > I⁻ > RO⁻ > HO⁻ > RCOO⁻ (carboxylate) > ROH (neutral alcohols) \n\nBut let\'s check each of the given nucleophiles:\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a bulky alkoxide ion (RO⁻). Bulky groups can hinder nucleophilicity because of steric hindrance. So even though it\'s an alkoxide, the bulky substituent might make it less nucleophilic compared to a less hindered alkoxide. \n\n2. Hydroxide (HO⁻): Small, highly charged anion. In polar protic solvents, it\'s heavily solvated, so nucleophilicity is lower compared to less solvated ions like RS⁻.\n\n3. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻): A carboxylate anion. These are resonance-stabilized and have lower nucleophilicity compared to alkoxides or thiolates. They are weaker bases and less nucleophilic.\n\n4. Methanol (CH3OH): Neutral molecule. Since it\'s not charged, it\'s a much weaker nucleophile compared to the anions. In polar protic solvents, the anions are better nucleophiles than neutral molecules.\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻): Thiolate ion. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, so thiolate ions are less solvated in polar protic solvents and thus better nucleophiles compared to alkoxides. Also, S⁻ is a stronger base than O⁻, but in terms of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the polarizability plays a bigger role.\n\nSo, the order from most to least reactive should consider:\n\nEthanethiolate (5) is the most reactive (since S⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated), followed by the alkoxide ions. However, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a bulky alkoxide, which might be less reactive than a less hindered alkoxide. But compared to hydroxide (2), which is a smaller and more solvated alkoxide, the cyclohexoxide might be less nucleophilic. Wait, but in general, alkoxide ions are stronger nucleophiles than hydroxide in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, the solvation is more important. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for some common nucleophiles is: \n\nRS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ (in water)\n\nBut where do alkoxides (RO⁻) fit in here? For example, in water, the solvation of RO⁻ would be significant. If RO⁻ is more bulky, it might be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic. But in general, even bulky RO⁻ may not be as nucleophilic as RS⁻. For example, in polar protic solvents, thiolate ions (RS⁻) are better nucleophiles than alkoxides (RO⁻) because sulfur is larger and less electronegative, so the negative charge is more diffuse, leading to less solvation and higher nucleophilicity.\n\nSo between 1 (cyclohexoxide) and 2 (hydroxide), which is a better nucleophile? In polar protic solvents, more bulky RO⁻ would be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic compared to smaller RO⁻. Wait, because bulky groups can reduce solvation? For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than hydroxide because of its bulky structure, making it a stronger base and better nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents. But in polar protic solvents, solvation is key. If the ion is bulky, maybe it\'s harder to solvate, making it a better nucleophile. For example, in water, tert-butoxide (bulky) is less solvated than hydroxide, so it\'s a stronger base but maybe not necessarily a better nucleophile. Wait, but in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents depends more on how well the nucleophile can escape solvation. So larger ions with lower charge density (like I⁻) are better. \n\nSo comparing hydroxide (HO⁻) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (RO⁻). The cyclohexoxide is a larger ion, so it should be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic than hydroxide. So 1 should be more reactive than 2. Then, propionate (3) is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized and less nucleophilic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so least reactive. Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive. \n\nSo the order from most to least should be: 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol). \n\nWait, but wait. Thiolate (RS⁻) is more nucleophilic than alkoxide (RO⁻) in polar protic solvents. Then comes the alkoxide. Between different alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated, so more nucleophilic. So cyclohexoxide (1) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). Then propionate (3) is less than hydroxide. Then methanol (4). \n\nBut wait, is propionate a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide? Propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance stabilized. Its conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a pKa around 4.87, so propionate is a weaker base compared to hydroxide (which has a conjugate acid pKa ~15.7). Generally, weaker bases are poorer nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, the solvation effects can invert some trends. However, carboxylates are still considered poor nucleophiles even in polar protic solvents because they are resonance-stabilized and have lower charge density. So hydroxide is a stronger base and more nucleophilic than propionate.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (most reactive)\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol (least reactive)\n\nBut wait, is there a chance that hydroxide is less nucleophilic than the cyclohexoxide? Because cyclohexoxide is a larger, more hindered alkoxide. Wait, but larger ions are less solvated, so more nucleophilic. For example, in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for RO⁻ would be: more bulky RO⁻ (like tert-butoxide) are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic than smaller RO⁻ (like hydroxide). So in that case, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the order would be:\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (S⁻ is more polarizable, less solvated)\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (bulky RO⁻, less solvated)\n2. Hydroxide (small RO⁻, more solvated)\n3. Propionate (resonance stabilized, weaker base)\n4. Methanol (neutral, poor nucleophile)\n\nSo the final order is 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.\n\nBut let me verify with another angle. For example, comparing ethanethiolate and alkoxide. In water, thiolate ions are indeed better nucleophiles than alkoxide ions. For example, in SN2 reactions, RS⁻ reacts faster than RO⁻ in aqueous solution. Then among the alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated, so more reactive. So cyclohexoxide is more nucleophilic than hydroxide. Then propionate is a carboxylate, which is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide. Methanol is the worst.\n\nTherefore, the order should be: 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390911, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2365, prompt_tokens=1246, total_tokens=3611, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution (a polar protic solvent) is influenced by their polarizability, solvation, and steric effects. Here's the arrangement from most to least reactive:

1. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: Sulfur's larger size and higher polarizability make it less solvated, enhancing its nucleophilicity despite being a weaker base compared to alkoxides.  
2. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: The bulky cyclohexane ring reduces solvation, making this alkoxide more nucleophilic than smaller alkoxides like hydroxide.  
3. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: Highly solvated due to its small size and high charge density, reducing its nucleophilic strength in water.  
4. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: Resonance stabilization delocalizes the negative charge, weakening nucleophilicity compared to hydroxide.  
5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Neutral and protonated in water, making it the poorest nucleophile.  

**Final Order**:  
**5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4**  
(Ethanethiolate > 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Hydroxide > Propionate > Methanol)

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

present (pH ~14), the cyclohexanol would be deprotonated to form the cyclohexoxide. Propionic acid's pKa is ~4.87, so in basic solution, propionate is present. Methanol's pKa is ~19.7, so in a solution with pH 14 (due to hydroxide), methanol would still be mostly protonated. So methanol would be present as CH3OH. 

So in this scenario, nucleophiles 1, 2, 3, and 5 are anions (since solution is basic), and 4 is neutral. But maybe the question is considering all as their conjugate bases regardless of solution? Hmm. The problem says "in aqueous solution"—so perhaps we need to consider their actual state in water. But if the solution is not specified as acidic or basic, then maybe some of these would be protonated. However, since the problem lists them as the nucleophiles (e.g., hydroxide is already the deprotonated form), perhaps we can assume they are in their anionic forms where possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering their inherent nucleophilicity, not considering whether they are protonated or not. But that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects us to just compare the nucleophilicity based on their basicity and polarizability, assuming they are all present as the nucleophilic species. Let's proceed under that assumption.

In polar protic solvents (like water), nucleophilicity is inversely related to the solvation. The more the ion is solvated, the less nucleophilic it is. Larger, more polarizable ions are less solvated and hence better nucleophiles. 

So, the order in polar protic solvents (like water) is typically: 

RS⁻ > I⁻ > RO⁻ > HO⁻ > RCOO⁻ (carboxylate) > ROH (neutral alcohols) 

But let's check each of the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a bulky alkoxide ion (RO⁻). Bulky groups can hinder nucleophilicity because of steric hindrance. So even though it's an alkoxide, the bulky substituent might make it less nucleophilic compared to a less hindered alkoxide. 

2. Hydroxide (HO⁻): Small, highly charged anion. In polar protic solvents, it's heavily solvated, so nucleophilicity is lower compared to less solvated ions like RS⁻.

3. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻): A carboxylate anion. These are resonance-stabilized and have lower nucleophilicity compared to alkoxides or thiolates. They are weaker bases and less nucleophilic.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): Neutral molecule. Since it's not charged, it's a much weaker nucleophile compared to the anions. In polar protic solvents, the anions are better nucleophiles than neutral molecules.

5. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻): Thiolate ion. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, so thiolate ions are less solvated in polar protic solvents and thus better nucleophiles compared to alkoxides. Also, S⁻ is a stronger base than O⁻, but in terms of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the polarizability plays a bigger role.

So, the order from most to least reactive should consider:

Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive (since S⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated), followed by the alkoxide ions. However, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a bulky alkoxide, which might be less reactive than a less hindered alkoxide. But compared to hydroxide (2), which is a smaller and more solvated alkoxide, the cyclohexoxide might be less nucleophilic. Wait, but in general, alkoxide ions are stronger nucleophiles than hydroxide in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, the solvation is more important. 

Wait, maybe I need to think again. In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for some common nucleophiles is: 

RS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ (in water)

But where do alkoxides (RO⁻) fit in here? For example, in water, the solvation of RO⁻ would be significant. If RO⁻ is more bulky, it might be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic. But in general, even bulky RO⁻ may not be as nucleophilic as RS⁻. For example, in polar protic solvents, thiolate ions (RS⁻) are better nucleophiles than alkoxides (RO⁻) because sulfur is larger and less electronegative, so the negative charge is more diffuse, leading to less solvation and higher nucleophilicity.

So between 1 (cyclohexoxide) and 2 (hydroxide), which is a better nucleophile? In polar protic solvents, more bulky RO⁻ would be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic compared to smaller RO⁻. Wait, because bulky groups can reduce solvation? For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than hydroxide because of its bulky structure, making it a stronger base and better nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents. But in polar protic solvents, solvation is key. If the ion is bulky, maybe it's harder to solvate, making it a better nucleophile. For example, in water, tert-butoxide (bulky) is less solvated than hydroxide, so it's a stronger base but maybe not necessarily a better nucleophile. Wait, but in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents depends more on how well the nucleophile can escape solvation. So larger ions with lower charge density (like I⁻) are better. 

So comparing hydroxide (HO⁻) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (RO⁻). The cyclohexoxide is a larger ion, so it should be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic than hydroxide. So 1 should be more reactive than 2. Then, propionate (3) is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized and less nucleophilic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so least reactive. Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive. 

So the order from most to least should be: 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol). 

Wait, but wait. Thiolate (RS⁻) is more nucleophilic than alkoxide (RO⁻) in polar protic solvents. Then comes the alkoxide. Between different alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated, so more nucleophilic. So cyclohexoxide (1) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). Then propionate (3) is less than hydroxide. Then methanol (4). 

But wait, is propionate a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide? Propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance stabilized. Its conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a pKa around 4.87, so propionate is a weaker base compared to hydroxide (which has a conjugate acid pKa ~15.7). Generally, weaker bases are poorer nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, the solvation effects can invert some trends. However, carboxylates are still considered poor nucleophiles even in polar protic solvents because they are resonance-stabilized and have lower charge density. So hydroxide is a stronger base and more nucleophilic than propionate.

So putting it all together:

5. Ethanethiolate (most reactive)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol (least reactive)

But wait, is there a chance that hydroxide is less nucleophilic than the cyclohexoxide? Because cyclohexoxide is a larger, more hindered alkoxide. Wait, but larger ions are less solvated, so more nucleophilic. For example, in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for RO⁻ would be: more bulky RO⁻ (like tert-butoxide) are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic than smaller RO⁻ (like hydroxide). So in that case, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (S⁻ is more polarizable, less solvated)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (bulky RO⁻, less solvated)
2. Hydroxide (small RO⁻, more solvated)
3. Propionate (resonance stabilized, weaker base)
4. Methanol (neutral, poor nucleophile)

So the final order is 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.

But let me verify with another angle. For example, comparing ethanethiolate and alkoxide. In water, thiolate ions are indeed better nucleophiles than alkoxide ions. For example, in SN2 reactions, RS⁻ reacts faster than RO⁻ in aqueous solution. Then among the alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated, so more reactive. So cyclohexoxide is more nucleophilic than hydroxide. Then propionate is a carboxylate, which is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide. Methanol is the worst.

Therefore, the order should be: 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol).

So in aqueous solution, the actual nucleophiles would be the deprotonated species where possible.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a deprotonated alcohol. The conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol) has a pKa around 19-20. In aqueous solution, unless the pH is very high (like hydroxide concentration), it would not be deprotonated. However, if it's given as the olate, maybe we consider it as the anion.\n\n2. Hydroxide: OH⁻ is a strong base and nucleophile, but in polar protic solvents like water, it's highly solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity.\n\n3. Propionate: The conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.87). In neutral or basic aqueous solution, it's deprotonated. It's a weaker base than hydroxide but less solvated?\n\n4. Methanol: Neutral molecule. Since its pKa is ~19-20, in neutral water, it's protonated (as CH3OH). As a neutral molecule, it's a poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species.\n\n5. Ethanethiolate: The conjugate base of ethanethiol (pKa ~10). In aqueous solution, unless the pH is above 10, it would be protonated. But if given as ethanethiolate, perhaps under basic conditions. Thiolate ions (RS⁻) are generally better nucleophiles than their oxygen counterparts because sulfur is larger, more polarizable, and holds its charge less tightly, leading to less solvation and higher nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents.\n\nSo, considering all as their given forms in aqueous solution (assuming they are deprotonated where specified), the order would be:\n\nEthanethiolate (5) is the most reactive because S⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated than O⁻. Then, the alkoxide (1) and hydroxide (2). But which is more reactive between alkoxide and hydroxide? In polar protic solvents, more bulky anions are less solvated, so 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) might be less solvated than hydroxide (2), making it a better nucleophile. But wait, hydroxide is a stronger base than cyclohexanol. However, nucleophilicity doesn't always correlate with basicity in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide even though it's a weaker base. So maybe the more polarizable and less solvated species is better. The cyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Bulky groups can hinder solvation, making the nucleophile more accessible. So maybe 1 is more reactive than hydroxide (2). Then propionate (3) is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized and thus less basic and less nucleophilic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so the least reactive.\n\nBut wait, comparing ethanethiolate (5) to the others. Thiolates are generally better nucleophiles than alkoxides in polar protic solvents. So order would be:\n\n5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol).\n\nBut wait, propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized. So propionate is less nucleophilic than hydroxide? For example, acetate (similar to propionate) is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide. But in polar protic solvents, perhaps the solvation effects make hydroxide less nucleophilic than thiolate and alkoxide. Let me check some references. For example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity (when considering solvation) is typically: RS⁻ > I⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ (for bulky R) or not? Wait, maybe it's RS⁻ > RO⁻ (if R is bulky and less solvated) > HO⁻. For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than hydroxide, so even though it's a weaker base, it's a better nucleophile in some cases. Wait, but in reality, the basicity and nucleophilicity can be different. For example, in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is usually: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (reverse of basicity) because of solvation. Similarly, thiolate (RS⁻) is more nucleophilic than RO⁻ in polar protic solvents. So, ethanethiolate (5) would be more nucleophilic than alkoxide (1). Then, between the alkoxide (1) and hydroxide (2), the bulkier alkoxide (1) is less solvated and thus a better nucleophile. So 1 > 2. Then hydroxide (2) is more nucleophilic than propionate (3) because propionate is resonance-stabilized and less basic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so least.\n\nSo the order would be: 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure about the comparison between the cyclohexan-1-olate and hydroxide. Let's think: in aqueous solution, hydroxide is very solvated. If the cyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide, maybe it's less solvated because the bulky groups hinder the solvent molecules from approaching. So, even though hydroxide is a stronger base, the cyclohexan-1-olate might be a better nucleophile. For example, tert-butoxide is a weaker base than hydroxide but a better nucleophile in some contexts. Wait, but in SN2 reactions, hydroxide is a better nucleophile than tert-butoxide because of less steric hindrance. Wait, but that's in the mechanism where steric effects matter. If the nucleophilicity is about the ability to attack, then maybe in a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable and less solvated species is better. So, ethanethiolate (5) is best. Then, the bulky alkoxide (1) is next, then hydroxide (2), then propionate (3), then methanol (4).\n\nAlternatively, hydroxide might be more nucleophilic than the cyclohexan-1-olate because it's a stronger base, but in aqueous solution, solvation reduces its nucleophilicity. So maybe in aqueous solution, the order is 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (Bulky alkoxide) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol). But I need to confirm.\n\nAnother angle: resonance stabilization. Propionate is resonance-stabilized, making the negative charge delocalized, which reduces nucleophilicity. Hydroxide has a localized charge. The cyclohexan-1-olate's charge is localized, but it's bulky, which may reduce solvation. Ethanethiolate has a charge on sulfur, which is more polarizable than oxygen, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base (since S is less electronegative than O). Wait, but thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide? Wait, the conjugate acid of ethanethiolate is ethanethiol (pKa ~10), while the conjugate acid of hydroxide is water (pKa ~15.7). So ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide? Wait, no. Wait, the lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. Since ethanethiol has a pKa of ~10, its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than hydroxide (conjugate acid pKa 15.7). Wait, no. Wait, if the conjugate acid (like ethanethiol) has a lower pKa, that means it's a weaker acid, so the conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a stronger base. Wait, no. The lower the pKa of the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. Wait, for example, HCl is a strong acid (low pKa), so Cl⁻ is a weak base. Acetic acid (pKa ~5) is weaker than HCl, so acetate is a stronger base than Cl⁻. So ethanethiol (pKa ~10) is a weaker acid than water (pKa ~15.7), so ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. Wait, that's correct. Because if HA has a lower pKa, it's a stronger acid, so A⁻ is a weaker base. Conversely, a higher pKa for HA means weaker acid, so A⁻ is a stronger base. So ethanethiol (pKa ~10) is a weaker acid than water (pKa ~15.7), so ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in reality, hydroxide is a stronger base than ethanethiolate? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, ethanethiol's pKa is around 10, so its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) would have a higher basicity than hydroxide, whose conjugate acid (water) has a pKa of 15.7. So ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, despite being a stronger base, the thiolate is more nucleophilic because of polarizability and solvation. But since it's a stronger base, maybe in aqueous solution, it's more reactive. But in practice, thiolates are better nucleophiles than alkoxides in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions, RS⁻ is a better nucleophile than RO⁻ in polar protic solvents. So even though RS⁻ is a stronger base, its higher polarizability makes it a better nucleophile. So in the given list, ethanethiolate (5) is the most nucleophilic. Then, the cyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a bulky alkoxide. Bulky groups can hinder solvation, making the nucleophile more available. So even though alkoxides are less nucleophilic than thiolates in polar protic solvents, among alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated and thus more reactive. So 1 would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). Then hydroxide (2) is next. Then propionate (3), which is resonance-stabilized and a weaker base, so less nucleophilic. Finally, methanol (4) is neutral and a poor nucleophile. So the order would be 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.\n\nBut I need to verify if propionate is indeed less nucleophilic than hydroxide. Since propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized, the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, making it less nucleophilic compared to hydroxide, where the charge is localized. So hydroxide should be more nucleophilic than propionate.\n\nTherefore, the order would be:\n\n5. Ethanethiolate (most reactive)\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n\n2. Hydroxide\n\n3. Propionate\n\n4. Methanol (least reactive)\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me just check if there's any other factor. For example, steric hindrance in the cyclohexan-1-olate. If the 4-methyl group creates steric hindrance around the oxygen, that might hinder its approach to the electrophilic center, making it less reactive. But in terms of solvation, bulky groups can reduce solvation, making the nucleophile more available. However, steric hindrance can also impede the nucleophilic attack. So which effect dominates?\n\nIn SN2 reactions, bulky groups around the nucleophile can hinder the backside attack, making the reaction slower. But if the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, not in a specific reaction mechanism, perhaps it's more about the inherent ability to donate electrons. But in solution, solvation is a major factor. A bulky alkoxide like 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate would be less solvated than hydroxide, making it a better nucleophile. So even if steric hindrance exists, the reduced solvation might make it more reactive. For example, tert-butoxide (bulky) is a weaker base than hydroxide but a stronger nucleophile in some contexts because it's less solvated. Wait, but in aqueous solution, tert-butoxide would be protonated, but if we consider the species as given (the olate), then it's deprotonated. So in that case, the cyclohexan-1-olate might be a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

To determine the reactivity order of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider factors such as solvation effects, polarizability, resonance stabilization, and steric hindrance. Here's the analysis:

1. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: Sulfur's larger atomic size and higher polarizability compared to oxygen make thiolates less solvated and more nucleophilic in polar protic solvents like water. Despite being a stronger base than hydroxide, its nucleophilicity is enhanced due to reduced solvation.

2. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: Bulky substituents reduce solvation, making this alkoxide less stabilized by water molecules compared to hydroxide. Although steric hindrance might slightly impede attack, the reduced solvation dominates, enhancing its nucleophilicity over hydroxide.

3. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base but highly solvated in water, which diminishes its nucleophilicity. Its localized charge makes it less effective than the less-solvated thiolate and bulky alkoxide.

4. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: Resonance stabilization delocalizes the negative charge over two oxygen atoms, reducing its nucleophilic strength compared to hydroxide. The charge is less available for attack.

5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Neutral and protonated in water, methanol lacks a negative charge, making it the poorest nucleophile in this list.

**Reactivity Order**:  
**5. Ethanethiolate > 1. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate > 2. Hydroxide > 3. Propionate > 4. Methanol**

**Answer**:  
\boxed{5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, if the solution is aqueous and the species are given as they are, then perhaps we should take their actual charges in aqueous solution.

Wait, but methanol is a neutral molecule here. So in aqueous solution, the actual nucleophiles would be the deprotonated species where possible.

But let's see:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a deprotonated alcohol. The conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol) has a pKa around 19-20. In aqueous solution, unless the pH is very high (like hydroxide concentration), it would not be deprotonated. However, if it's given as the olate, maybe we consider it as the anion.

2. Hydroxide: OH⁻ is a strong base and nucleophile, but in polar protic solvents like water, it's highly solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity.

3. Propionate: The conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.87). In neutral or basic aqueous solution, it's deprotonated. It's a weaker base than hydroxide but less solvated?

4. Methanol: Neutral molecule. Since its pKa is ~19-20, in neutral water, it's protonated (as CH3OH). As a neutral molecule, it's a poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species.

5. Ethanethiolate: The conjugate base of ethanethiol (pKa ~10). In aqueous solution, unless the pH is above 10, it would be protonated. But if given as ethanethiolate, perhaps under basic conditions. Thiolate ions (RS⁻) are generally better nucleophiles than their oxygen counterparts because sulfur is larger, more polarizable, and holds its charge less tightly, leading to less solvation and higher nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents.

So, considering all as their given forms in aqueous solution (assuming they are deprotonated where specified), the order would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive because S⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated than O⁻. Then, the alkoxide (1) and hydroxide (2). But which is more reactive between alkoxide and hydroxide? In polar protic solvents, more bulky anions are less solvated, so 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) might be less solvated than hydroxide (2), making it a better nucleophile. But wait, hydroxide is a stronger base than cyclohexanol. However, nucleophilicity doesn't always correlate with basicity in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide even though it's a weaker base. So maybe the more polarizable and less solvated species is better. The cyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Bulky groups can hinder solvation, making the nucleophile more accessible. So maybe 1 is more reactive than hydroxide (2). Then propionate (3) is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized and thus less basic and less nucleophilic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so the least reactive.

But wait, comparing ethanethiolate (5) to the others. Thiolates are generally better nucleophiles than alkoxides in polar protic solvents. So order would be:

5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol).

But wait, propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized. So propionate is less nucleophilic than hydroxide? For example, acetate (similar to propionate) is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide. But in polar protic solvents, perhaps the solvation effects make hydroxide less nucleophilic than thiolate and alkoxide. Let me check some references. For example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity (when considering solvation) is typically: RS⁻ > I⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ (for bulky R) or not? Wait, maybe it's RS⁻ > RO⁻ (if R is bulky and less solvated) > HO⁻. For example, tert-butoxide is less solvated than hydroxide, so even though it's a weaker base, it's a better nucleophile in some cases. Wait, but in reality, the basicity and nucleophilicity can be different. For example, in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is usually: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (reverse of basicity) because of solvation. Similarly, thiolate (RS⁻) is more nucleophilic than RO⁻ in polar protic solvents. So, ethanethiolate (5) would be more nucleophilic than alkoxide (1). Then, between the alkoxide (1) and hydroxide (2), the bulkier alkoxide (1) is less solvated and thus a better nucleophile. So 1 > 2. Then hydroxide (2) is more nucleophilic than propionate (3) because propionate is resonance-stabilized and less basic. Methanol (4) is neutral, so least.

So the order would be: 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the comparison between the cyclohexan-1-olate and hydroxide. Let's think: in aqueous solution, hydroxide is very solvated. If the cyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide, maybe it's less solvated because the bulky groups hinder the solvent molecules from approaching. So, even though hydroxide is a stronger base, the cyclohexan-1-olate might be a better nucleophile. For example, tert-butoxide is a weaker base than hydroxide but a better nucleophile in some contexts. Wait, but in SN2 reactions, hydroxide is a better nucleophile than tert-butoxide because of less steric hindrance. Wait, but that's in the mechanism where steric effects matter. If the nucleophilicity is about the ability to attack, then maybe in a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable and less solvated species is better. So, ethanethiolate (5) is best. Then, the bulky alkoxide (1) is next, then hydroxide (2), then propionate (3), then methanol (4).

Alternatively, hydroxide might be more nucleophilic than the cyclohexan-1-olate because it's a stronger base, but in aqueous solution, solvation reduces its nucleophilicity. So maybe in aqueous solution, the order is 5 (Ethanethiolate) > 1 (Bulky alkoxide) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol). But I need to confirm.

Another angle: resonance stabilization. Propionate is resonance-stabilized, making the negative charge delocalized, which reduces nucleophilicity. Hydroxide has a localized charge. The cyclohexan-1-olate's charge is localized, but it's bulky, which may reduce solvation. Ethanethiolate has a charge on sulfur, which is more polarizable than oxygen, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base (since S is less electronegative than O). Wait, but thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide? Wait, the conjugate acid of ethanethiolate is ethanethiol (pKa ~10), while the conjugate acid of hydroxide is water (pKa ~15.7). So ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide? Wait, no. Wait, the lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. Since ethanethiol has a pKa of ~10, its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than hydroxide (conjugate acid pKa 15.7). Wait, no. Wait, if the conjugate acid (like ethanethiol) has a lower pKa, that means it's a weaker acid, so the conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a stronger base. Wait, no. The lower the pKa of the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. Wait, for example, HCl is a strong acid (low pKa), so Cl⁻ is a weak base. Acetic acid (pKa ~5) is weaker than HCl, so acetate is a stronger base than Cl⁻. So ethanethiol (pKa ~10) is a weaker acid than water (pKa ~15.7), so ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. Wait, that's correct. Because if HA has a lower pKa, it's a stronger acid, so A⁻ is a weaker base. Conversely, a higher pKa for HA means weaker acid, so A⁻ is a stronger base. So ethanethiol (pKa ~10) is a weaker acid than water (pKa ~15.7), so ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in reality, hydroxide is a stronger base than ethanethiolate? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, ethanethiol's pKa is around 10, so its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) would have a higher basicity than hydroxide, whose conjugate acid (water) has a pKa of 15.7. So ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, despite being a stronger base, the thiolate is more nucleophilic because of polarizability and solvation. But since it's a stronger base, maybe in aqueous solution, it's more reactive. But in practice, thiolates are better nucleophiles than alkoxides in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions, RS⁻ is a better nucleophile than RO⁻ in polar protic solvents. So even though RS⁻ is a stronger base, its higher polarizability makes it a better nucleophile. So in the given list, ethanethiolate (5) is the most nucleophilic. Then, the cyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a bulky alkoxide. Bulky groups can hinder solvation, making the nucleophile more available. So even though alkoxides are less nucleophilic than thiolates in polar protic solvents, among alkoxides, the more bulky ones are less solvated and thus more reactive. So 1 would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2). Then hydroxide (2) is next. Then propionate (3), which is resonance-stabilized and a weaker base, so less nucleophilic. Finally, methanol (4) is neutral and a poor nucleophile. So the order would be 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.

But I need to verify if propionate is indeed less nucleophilic than hydroxide. Since propionate is a carboxylate, which is resonance-stabilized, the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, making it less nucleophilic compared to hydroxide, where the charge is localized. So hydroxide should be more nucleophilic than propionate.

Therefore, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (most reactive)

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate

2. Hydroxide

3. Propionate

4. Methanol (least reactive)

Yes, that seems right. Let me just check if there's any other factor. For example, steric hindrance in the cyclohexan-1-olate. If the 4-methyl group creates steric hindrance around the oxygen, that might hinder its approach to the electrophilic center, making it less reactive. But in terms of solvation, bulky groups can reduce solvation, making the nucleophile more available. However, steric hindrance can also impede the nucleophilic attack. So which effect dominates?

In SN2 reactions, bulky groups around the nucleophile can hinder the backside attack, making the reaction slower. But if the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, not in a specific reaction mechanism, perhaps it's more about the inherent ability to donate electrons. But in solution, solvation is a major factor. A bulky alkoxide like 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate would be less solvated than hydroxide, making it a better nucleophile. So even if steric hindrance exists, the reduced solvation might make it more reactive. For example, tert-butoxide (bulky) is a weaker base than hydroxide but a stronger nucleophile in some contexts because it's less solvated. Wait, but in aqueous solution, tert-butoxide would be protonated, but if we consider the species as given (the olate), then it's deprotonated. So in that case, the cyclohexan-1-olate might be a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution. So I think the order I have is correct: 5 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4.

Let\'s compare the anions:\n\n- Ethanethiolate (S⁻) is larger and more polarizable than oxygen-based nucleophiles. Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so S⁻ holds electrons less tightly, making it a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base. Wait, but basicity and nucleophilicity can differ. For example, in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is typically I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (opposite of basicity) because larger ions are less solvated. Similarly, comparing O⁻ and S⁻, S⁻ is larger and more polarizable, so in polar protic solvents, S⁻ would be a better nucleophile than O⁻. \n\nBut wait, hydroxide (OH⁻) is a stronger base than ethanethiolate (since thiols are weaker acids than water: pKa of H2O ~15.5 vs. ethanethiol ~10, so conjugate base strength is inverse. Wait, ethanethiol has pKa ~10, so its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is weaker base than OH⁻, which is from H2O (pKa ~15.5). So OH⁻ is a stronger base than ethanethiolate. But in nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the weaker base (ethanethiolate) might be a better nucleophile because it\'s less solvated. Wait, but in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity trend is opposite to basicity. So stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. So if ethanethiolate is a weaker base than OH⁻, it would be less solvated and hence a better nucleophile. Wait, but I thought S⁻ is a better nucleophile than O⁻ in polar protic solvents. Let me check.\n\nFor example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for halides is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, which is inverse of their basicity. Similarly, comparing RO⁻ and RS⁻: RS⁻ is a weaker base (since RSH is more acidic than ROH), so RS⁻ would be a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions in aqueous solution, RS⁻ would react faster than RO⁻. So ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH⁻) or the cyclohexoxide.\n\nBut wait, cyclohexan-1-olate is an alkoxide (O⁻) but bulky. Steric hindrance can affect nucleophilicity. Bulky nucleophiles might have lower nucleophilicity in SN2 reactions because they can\'t approach the electrophilic center as easily. So 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. So even though it\'s an O⁻, its bulkiness might make it a poorer nucleophile compared to less hindered ones. But in this list, the other O⁻ nucleophiles are hydroxide and propionate. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is a carboxylate. Carboxylates are resonance-stabilized, making them weaker bases and less nucleophilic. For example, the pKa of propionic acid is ~4.87, so propionate is a weaker base compared to hydroxide (pKa ~15.5) and the cyclohexan-1-olate (which, being an alkoxide, would have a higher pKa, maybe around 18-20, similar to other alcohols). Wait, but cyclohexanol\'s pKa is around 19-20, so its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) would be a stronger base than hydroxide (pKa ~15.5). Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, if cyclohexanol\'s pKa is 19, then its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a weaker base than hydroxide (since the conjugate base strength is inversely related to the acid\'s pKa). Wait, no. The conjugate base strength is stronger when the acid is weaker. So a higher pKa (weaker acid) means a stronger conjugate base. For example, H2O has pKa ~15.5, so OH⁻ is the conjugate base. If cyclohexanol has pKa ~19, then it\'s a weaker acid than water, meaning its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH⁻. But that\'s conflicting with the initial assumption. Wait, no: stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases. If cyclohexanol is a weaker acid (higher pKa) than water, its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH⁻. So the order of basicity would be 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > propionate (since propionic acid is stronger acid, pKa ~4.87, so propionate is weaker base than OH⁻). Ethanethiolate, from ethanethiol (pKa ~10), so its conjugate base is weaker than OH⁻ but stronger than propionate. Methanol is neutral.\n\nSo basicity order: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest) > OH⁻ > ethanethiolate > propionate > methanol (weakest, as it\'s neutral).\n\nBut in nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the trend is opposite to basicity because stronger bases are more solvated. So nucleophilicity order would be: ethanethiolate (weaker base than cyclohexoxide and hydroxide but more polarizable) might be better nucleophile. Wait, but how does solvation affect this? Let me think again. In polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize charges through solvation. Stronger bases (higher charge density) are more stabilized (more solvated), making them less reactive. So weaker bases would be less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. So in aqueous solution:\n\nNucleophilicity order: ethanethiolate (weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide) > propionate (weaker base than ethanethiolate) > hydroxide (strong base, more solvated) > cyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base, most solvated)? Wait, but that can\'t be right. Wait, if cyclohexan-1-olate is the strongest base, then it\'s the most solvated and thus poorest nucleophile. Then ethanethiolate, being a weaker base, would be less solvated and better nucleophile. Similarly, propionate is weaker base than ethanethiolate? Wait, propionic acid pKa ~4.87, so propionate is conjugate base of a stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). Therefore, propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate. So the order of basicity from strongest to weakest: cyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > ethanethiolate > propionate. Methanol is neutral, so not a base here.\n\nTherefore, nucleophilicity in polar protic solvent (water) should be inversely related to basicity. So the weakest base would be the best nucleophile. Wait, but propionate is weaker base than ethanethiolate, so propionate would be a better nucleophile than ethanethiolate? No, because ethanethiolate is a stronger base than propionate but weaker than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide. So perhaps the order is ethanethiolate (S⁻) is a better nucleophile than O⁻ nucleophiles here because sulfur is more polarizable. Wait, maybe the key here is that sulfur\'s larger size and higher polarizability make its anion a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide.\n\nSo even though cyclohexoxide is a stronger base, its O⁻ is more solvated and less able to attack. Ethanethiolate (S⁻) is less basic but more polarizable, leading to better nucleophilicity. Then propionate (O⁻ but resonance-stabilized, weaker base) would be next. Then hydroxide (O⁻, strong base, more solvated). Then cyclohexoxide (most basic, most solvated, poorest nucleophile). Wait, but cyclohexoxide is bulky. Steric hindrance might also reduce its nucleophilicity. For example, tert-butoxide is a strong base but a poor nucleophile due to steric hindrance.\n\nSo combining these factors:\n\n1. Ethanethiolate (S⁻, less solvated, more polarizable, weaker base than O⁻ but stronger than propionate)\n2. Propionate (O⁻, resonance-stabilized, weaker base, less solvated than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide)\n3. Hydroxide (O⁻, strong base, more solvated)\n4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (bulky and strong base, most solvated)\nBut wait, methanol is neutral. How does that fit in? Methanol is a neutral molecule. In aqueous solution, it\'s a poor nucleophile compared to the deprotonated species. So the order would be:\n\nEthanethiolate (best) > propionate > hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > methanol (worst). But wait, methanol is a neutral molecule, which is a much poorer nucleophile than the anions. So methanol should be the poorest. But where does propionate stand?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is:\n\n1. Ethanethiolate (best nucleophile)\n2. Hydroxide (but wait, hydroxide is a strong base but more solvated. If in aqueous solution, maybe S⁻ is better)\n3. Propionate (weaker base than hydroxide, but resonance-stabilized)\n4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base but bulky and solvated)\n5. Methanol (neutral)\n\nBut I need to check the actual nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Let\'s recall some data. For example, in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents:\n\nRS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ (where RO⁻ is alkoxide)\n\nWait, but RO⁻ (alkoxide) is a stronger base than HO⁻. For example, in ethanol, the pKa is ~19, so ethoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in aqueous solution, hydroxide is less basic than alkoxides. So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be RS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ (but alkoxides are stronger bases than HO⁻, so their nucleophilicity would be lower than HO⁻?)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let\'s try to break it down.\n\nIn polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity order (from best to worst) is typically:\n\nLarger, softer ions with lower charge density (less solvation) are better nucleophiles. For example:\n\nFor halides: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (in polar protic solvents)\n\nFor oxygen nucleophiles: Maybe the same trend. But oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. So between S⁻ and O⁻, S⁻ is a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. For example, in water, SH⁻ (if it exists) would be better than OH⁻. But ethanethiolate (RS⁻) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide (HO⁻) in water.\n\nThen, among O⁻ nucleophiles, the more stabilized (weaker base) would be better nucleophiles. For example, propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is resonance-stabilized, making it a weaker base compared to hydroxide and cyclohexoxide. Therefore, propionate would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide in aqueous solution.\n\nBut cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide (since cyclohexanol has a higher pKa than water), so cyclohexoxide is a stronger base, more solvated, and thus a poorer nucleophile than hydroxide. Wait, cyclohexanol\'s pKa is around 19, so its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is stronger than hydroxide (from water, pKa ~15.5). Therefore, cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide, meaning it\'s more solvated and less nucleophilic. So in aqueous solution, hydroxide would be a better nucleophile than cyclohexoxide.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNucleophilicity in aqueous solution:\n\n1. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) – best\n2. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) – next, because it\'s a weaker base than hydroxide (due to resonance stabilization), so less solvated\n3. Hydroxide (OH⁻) – stronger base than propionate, more solvated\n4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate – strongest base, most solvated, hence poorest nucleophile among the anions\n5. Methanol (CH3OH) – neutral, very poor nucleophile compared to anions\n\nBut I need to verify the position of propionate. Since propionate is a carboxylate, resonance stabilization delocalizes the negative charge, making it a weaker base compared to hydroxide and cyclohexoxide. In aqueous solution, weaker bases are less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. Therefore, propionate should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide.\n\nWait, but hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate, so hydroxide is more solvated, making propionate a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So the order would be:\n\nEthanethiolate > propionate > hydroxide > cyclohexoxide > methanol.\n\nBut wait, ethanethiolate (pKa ~10) is present as the conjugate base in solution if the pH is higher than 10. If the solution is aqueous (pH 7), then ethanethiol (pKa ~10) would be mostly protonated, so ethanethiolate might not be present. However, the question lists the nucleophiles as given, so perhaps we\'re to assume they are all present in their deprotonated forms regardless of pH. Otherwise, methanol would be neutral, and ethanethiolate would be protonated (as ethanethiol) at pH 7, making it a neutral molecule (poor nucleophile). But the problem states "in aqueous solution," so maybe the pH is such that all the listed species are present as their deprotonated forms. However, that\'s not realistic because propionate (from propionic acid, pKa ~4.87) would be deprotonated at pH >4.87, which is true in neutral water. Ethanethiol (pKa ~10) would be mostly protonated at pH 7, so ethanethiolate would be a minor species. But the question lists ethanethiolate as a nucleophile, so perhaps we have to consider them as their deprotonated forms regardless of pH. Alternatively, maybe the solution is under basic conditions where all are deprotonated. But that complicates things.\n\nAssuming all nucleophiles are present in their deprotonated forms (anions except methanol, which is neutral), then:\n\n1. Ethanethiolate (S⁻, most nucleophilic in polar protic)\n2. Propionate (O⁻, resonance-stabilized)\n3. Hydroxide (O⁻, stronger base than propionate, more solvated)\n4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (O⁻, strongest base, most solvated)\n5. Methanol (neutral, worst nucleophile)\n\nBut I\'m not sure if propionate is more nucleophilic than hydroxide. Since propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide, it\'s less solvated and thus a better nucleophile. For example, in SN2 reactions, carboxylates are better nucleophiles than hydroxide in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, maybe not. Wait, in polar protic solvents, the solvation effect is more pronounced. So even if propionate is a weaker base, its lower charge density (due to resonance) might make it less solvated and better nucleophile than hydroxide. For example, acetate (similar to propionate) is a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa of acetic acid is ~4.76 vs. water\'s ~15.5), so acetate\'s conjugate base is weaker. Therefore, acetate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar protic solvents because it\'s less solvated. So yes, propionate would be more reactive than hydroxide.\n\nThus, the order would be:\n\n1. Ethanethiolate\n2. Propionate\n3. Hydroxide\n4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n5. Methanol\n\nBut wait, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Even though it\'s a stronger base than hydroxide, its bulkiness would hinder its nucleophilicity more than hydroxide. So even though hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate, the propionate is a better nucleophile. Similarly, the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide but more bulky, making it a worse nucleophile. So maybe the order is:\n\nEthanethiolate > propionate > hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > methanol.\n\nAlternatively, if the cyclohexoxide\'s bulkiness makes it a worse nucleophile than hydroxide, despite being a stronger base.

In aqueous solution (a polar protic solvent), nucleophilicity is influenced by solvation and polarizability. Stronger bases are more solvated, reducing their nucleophilic reactivity, while larger, more polarizable ions (e.g., sulfur-based) are less solvated and more reactive. Steric hindrance also plays a role, as bulky groups impede nucleophilic attack. Here's the ranked order of nucleophilicity:

1. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**  
   Sulfur's high polarizability and lower solvation make it the best nucleophile despite being a weaker base than oxygen nucleophiles.

2. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**  
   Resonance stabilization reduces its basicity, leading to less solvation compared to hydroxide. This makes it more nucleophilic than hydroxide.

3. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**  
   A strong base but heavily solvated in water, reducing its nucleophilicity. It is more reactive than the bulky alkoxide due to steric effects.

4. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**  
   A strong base (alkoxide) but steric hindrance from the bulky cyclohexane ring and high solvation diminish its nucleophilicity.

5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**  
   Neutral and not deprotonated in aqueous solution, making it the poorest nucleophile.

**Final Order:**  
**Ethanethiolate > Propionate > Hydroxide > 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Methanol**

Similarly, propionate (pKa ~4.87) would be deprotonated in neutral or basic solution.

Now, nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (like water) is better for softer, larger, less solvated nucleophiles. Let's compare the anions:

- Ethanethiolate (S⁻) is larger and more polarizable than oxygen-based nucleophiles. Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so S⁻ holds electrons less tightly, making it a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base. Wait, but basicity and nucleophilicity can differ. For example, in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is typically I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (opposite of basicity) because larger ions are less solvated. Similarly, comparing O⁻ and S⁻, S⁻ is larger and more polarizable, so in polar protic solvents, S⁻ would be a better nucleophile than O⁻. 

But wait, hydroxide (OH⁻) is a stronger base than ethanethiolate (since thiols are weaker acids than water: pKa of H2O ~15.5 vs. ethanethiol ~10, so conjugate base strength is inverse. Wait, ethanethiol has pKa ~10, so its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is weaker base than OH⁻, which is from H2O (pKa ~15.5). So OH⁻ is a stronger base than ethanethiolate. But in nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the weaker base (ethanethiolate) might be a better nucleophile because it's less solvated. Wait, but in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity trend is opposite to basicity. So stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. So if ethanethiolate is a weaker base than OH⁻, it would be less solvated and hence a better nucleophile. Wait, but I thought S⁻ is a better nucleophile than O⁻ in polar protic solvents. Let me check.

For example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for halides is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, which is inverse of their basicity. Similarly, comparing RO⁻ and RS⁻: RS⁻ is a weaker base (since RSH is more acidic than ROH), so RS⁻ would be a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. For example, in SN2 reactions in aqueous solution, RS⁻ would react faster than RO⁻. So ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH⁻) or the cyclohexoxide.

But wait, cyclohexan-1-olate is an alkoxide (O⁻) but bulky. Steric hindrance can affect nucleophilicity. Bulky nucleophiles might have lower nucleophilicity in SN2 reactions because they can't approach the electrophilic center as easily. So 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. So even though it's an O⁻, its bulkiness might make it a poorer nucleophile compared to less hindered ones. But in this list, the other O⁻ nucleophiles are hydroxide and propionate. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is a carboxylate. Carboxylates are resonance-stabilized, making them weaker bases and less nucleophilic. For example, the pKa of propionic acid is ~4.87, so propionate is a weaker base compared to hydroxide (pKa ~15.5) and the cyclohexan-1-olate (which, being an alkoxide, would have a higher pKa, maybe around 18-20, similar to other alcohols). Wait, but cyclohexanol's pKa is around 19-20, so its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) would be a stronger base than hydroxide (pKa ~15.5). Wait, that can't be. Wait, if cyclohexanol's pKa is 19, then its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a weaker base than hydroxide (since the conjugate base strength is inversely related to the acid's pKa). Wait, no. The conjugate base strength is stronger when the acid is weaker. So a higher pKa (weaker acid) means a stronger conjugate base. For example, H2O has pKa ~15.5, so OH⁻ is the conjugate base. If cyclohexanol has pKa ~19, then it's a weaker acid than water, meaning its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH⁻. But that's conflicting with the initial assumption. Wait, no: stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases. If cyclohexanol is a weaker acid (higher pKa) than water, its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH⁻. So the order of basicity would be 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > propionate (since propionic acid is stronger acid, pKa ~4.87, so propionate is weaker base than OH⁻). Ethanethiolate, from ethanethiol (pKa ~10), so its conjugate base is weaker than OH⁻ but stronger than propionate. Methanol is neutral.

So basicity order: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest) > OH⁻ > ethanethiolate > propionate > methanol (weakest, as it's neutral).

But in nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the trend is opposite to basicity because stronger bases are more solvated. So nucleophilicity order would be: ethanethiolate (weaker base than cyclohexoxide and hydroxide but more polarizable) might be better nucleophile. Wait, but how does solvation affect this? Let me think again. In polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize charges through solvation. Stronger bases (higher charge density) are more stabilized (more solvated), making them less reactive. So weaker bases would be less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. So in aqueous solution:

Nucleophilicity order: ethanethiolate (weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide) > propionate (weaker base than ethanethiolate) > hydroxide (strong base, more solvated) > cyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base, most solvated)? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if cyclohexan-1-olate is the strongest base, then it's the most solvated and thus poorest nucleophile. Then ethanethiolate, being a weaker base, would be less solvated and better nucleophile. Similarly, propionate is weaker base than ethanethiolate? Wait, propionic acid pKa ~4.87, so propionate is conjugate base of a stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). Therefore, propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate. So the order of basicity from strongest to weakest: cyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > ethanethiolate > propionate. Methanol is neutral, so not a base here.

Therefore, nucleophilicity in polar protic solvent (water) should be inversely related to basicity. So the weakest base would be the best nucleophile. Wait, but propionate is weaker base than ethanethiolate, so propionate would be a better nucleophile than ethanethiolate? No, because ethanethiolate is a stronger base than propionate but weaker than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide. So perhaps the order is ethanethiolate (S⁻) is a better nucleophile than O⁻ nucleophiles here because sulfur is more polarizable. Wait, maybe the key here is that sulfur's larger size and higher polarizability make its anion a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexoxide.

So even though cyclohexoxide is a stronger base, its O⁻ is more solvated and less able to attack. Ethanethiolate (S⁻) is less basic but more polarizable, leading to better nucleophilicity. Then propionate (O⁻ but resonance-stabilized, weaker base) would be next. Then hydroxide (O⁻, strong base, more solvated). Then cyclohexoxide (most basic, most solvated, poorest nucleophile). Wait, but cyclohexoxide is bulky. Steric hindrance might also reduce its nucleophilicity. For example, tert-butoxide is a strong base but a poor nucleophile due to steric hindrance.

So combining these factors:

1. Ethanethiolate (S⁻, less solvated, more polarizable, weaker base than O⁻ but stronger than propionate)
2. Propionate (O⁻, resonance-stabilized, weaker base, less solvated than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide)
3. Hydroxide (O⁻, strong base, more solvated)
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (bulky and strong base, most solvated)
But wait, methanol is neutral. How does that fit in? Methanol is a neutral molecule. In aqueous solution, it's a poor nucleophile compared to the deprotonated species. So the order would be:

Ethanethiolate (best) > propionate > hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > methanol (worst). But wait, methanol is a neutral molecule, which is a much poorer nucleophile than the anions. So methanol should be the poorest. But where does propionate stand?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Ethanethiolate (best nucleophile)
2. Hydroxide (but wait, hydroxide is a strong base but more solvated. If in aqueous solution, maybe S⁻ is better)
3. Propionate (weaker base than hydroxide, but resonance-stabilized)
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base but bulky and solvated)
5. Methanol (neutral)

But I need to check the actual nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Let's recall some data. For example, in SN2 reactions, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents:

RS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ > RO⁻ (where RO⁻ is alkoxide)

Wait, but RO⁻ (alkoxide) is a stronger base than HO⁻. For example, in ethanol, the pKa is ~19, so ethoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide. But in aqueous solution, hydroxide is less basic than alkoxides. So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be RS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > HO⁻ (but alkoxides are stronger bases than HO⁻, so their nucleophilicity would be lower than HO⁻?)

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's try to break it down.

In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity order (from best to worst) is typically:

Larger, softer ions with lower charge density (less solvation) are better nucleophiles. For example:

For halides: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (in polar protic solvents)

For oxygen nucleophiles: Maybe the same trend. But oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. So between S⁻ and O⁻, S⁻ is a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. For example, in water, SH⁻ (if it exists) would be better than OH⁻. But ethanethiolate (RS⁻) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide (HO⁻) in water.

Then, among O⁻ nucleophiles, the more stabilized (weaker base) would be better nucleophiles. For example, propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is resonance-stabilized, making it a weaker base compared to hydroxide and cyclohexoxide. Therefore, propionate would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide in aqueous solution.

But cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide (since cyclohexanol has a higher pKa than water), so cyclohexoxide is a stronger base, more solvated, and thus a poorer nucleophile than hydroxide. Wait, cyclohexanol's pKa is around 19, so its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is stronger than hydroxide (from water, pKa ~15.5). Therefore, cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide, meaning it's more solvated and less nucleophilic. So in aqueous solution, hydroxide would be a better nucleophile than cyclohexoxide.

So putting it all together:

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution:

1. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) – best
2. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) – next, because it's a weaker base than hydroxide (due to resonance stabilization), so less solvated
3. Hydroxide (OH⁻) – stronger base than propionate, more solvated
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate – strongest base, most solvated, hence poorest nucleophile among the anions
5. Methanol (CH3OH) – neutral, very poor nucleophile compared to anions

But I need to verify the position of propionate. Since propionate is a carboxylate, resonance stabilization delocalizes the negative charge, making it a weaker base compared to hydroxide and cyclohexoxide. In aqueous solution, weaker bases are less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. Therefore, propionate should be more nucleophilic than hydroxide and cyclohexoxide.

Wait, but hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate, so hydroxide is more solvated, making propionate a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So the order would be:

Ethanethiolate > propionate > hydroxide > cyclohexoxide > methanol.

But wait, ethanethiolate (pKa ~10) is present as the conjugate base in solution if the pH is higher than 10. If the solution is aqueous (pH 7), then ethanethiol (pKa ~10) would be mostly protonated, so ethanethiolate might not be present. However, the question lists the nucleophiles as given, so perhaps we're to assume they are all present in their deprotonated forms regardless of pH. Otherwise, methanol would be neutral, and ethanethiolate would be protonated (as ethanethiol) at pH 7, making it a neutral molecule (poor nucleophile). But the problem states "in aqueous solution," so maybe the pH is such that all the listed species are present as their deprotonated forms. However, that's not realistic because propionate (from propionic acid, pKa ~4.87) would be deprotonated at pH >4.87, which is true in neutral water. Ethanethiol (pKa ~10) would be mostly protonated at pH 7, so ethanethiolate would be a minor species. But the question lists ethanethiolate as a nucleophile, so perhaps we have to consider them as their deprotonated forms regardless of pH. Alternatively, maybe the solution is under basic conditions where all are deprotonated. But that complicates things.

Assuming all nucleophiles are present in their deprotonated forms (anions except methanol, which is neutral), then:

1. Ethanethiolate (S⁻, most nucleophilic in polar protic)
2. Propionate (O⁻, resonance-stabilized)
3. Hydroxide (O⁻, stronger base than propionate, more solvated)
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (O⁻, strongest base, most solvated)
5. Methanol (neutral, worst nucleophile)

But I'm not sure if propionate is more nucleophilic than hydroxide. Since propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide, it's less solvated and thus a better nucleophile. For example, in SN2 reactions, carboxylates are better nucleophiles than hydroxide in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic solvents, maybe not. Wait, in polar protic solvents, the solvation effect is more pronounced. So even if propionate is a weaker base, its lower charge density (due to resonance) might make it less solvated and better nucleophile than hydroxide. For example, acetate (similar to propionate) is a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa of acetic acid is ~4.76 vs. water's ~15.5), so acetate's conjugate base is weaker. Therefore, acetate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. So yes, propionate would be more reactive than hydroxide.

Thus, the order would be:

1. Ethanethiolate
2. Propionate
3. Hydroxide
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
5. Methanol

But wait, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky alkoxide. Even though it's a stronger base than hydroxide, its bulkiness would hinder its nucleophilicity more than hydroxide. So even though hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate, the propionate is a better nucleophile. Similarly, the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide but more bulky, making it a worse nucleophile. So maybe the order is:

Ethanethiolate > propionate > hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > methanol.

Alternatively, if the cyclohexoxide's bulkiness makes it a worse nucleophile than hydroxide, despite being a stronger base. For example, tert-butoxide is a strong base but poor nucleophile in SN2 due to steric hindrance. Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is bulky, so even though it's a stronger base than hydroxide, its nucleophilicity is lower. Therefore, hydroxide would be more nucleophilic than the bulky alkoxide.

So final order:

1. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻)
2. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)
3. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
4. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
5. Methanol (CH3OH)

Yes, this seems correct. Ethanethiolate is the best nucleophile here due to sulfur's polarizability and being a weaker base than the alkoxides. Propionate is next as a resonance-stabilized weaker base than hydroxide. Hydroxide follows, then the bulky alkoxide, and finally methanol as the neutral molecule.
