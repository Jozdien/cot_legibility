To determine the speed of light in a moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam. 

1. **Speed of light in stationary glass**: The speed of light in a stationary glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.
2. **Relativistic velocity addition**: When the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), we use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The formula is:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass's rest frame), \( v \) is the velocity of the glass, and \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum).

3. **Substitute values**: Plugging \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \) into the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the laboratory, when the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. 

First, the speed of light in a medium like glass is usually given by c divided by the refractive index n. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is taken as c = 1, then the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary should be 1/n. But here, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, so we need to account for the motion of the medium. 

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light relative to the observer isn't just the simple sum of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium. Instead, there's a formula from special relativity for adding velocities. Wait, but is this a relativistic scenario? The problem doesn't specify that the velocity v is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but since it's about light speed, maybe we do need to use relativistic velocity addition. 

The standard velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), where u is the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the observer. But in this case, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n when the glass is stationary. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then the speed of the light relative to the lab frame would be the relativistic sum of v and 1/n. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me think carefully. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n = 1/n. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame. So to find the speed u in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. Since both velocities are in the same direction, the formula becomes u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since c = 1, this simplifies to u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ). 

But wait, let me check if this is correct. Let's consider the case where n = 1, which would mean the medium is vacuum. Then the speed should be (0 + v)/(1 + 0) = v, but that's not right because if n = 1, the medium is vacuum, so the speed of light should still be c = 1. Hmm, that seems like a problem. Wait, no. If the medium is vacuum, then the speed of light in the medium is c. So if the "glass" is actually vacuum moving at speed v, then the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c, not v + c. So maybe the formula is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity addition applies to the source or the medium. Wait, there's also the concept of the Fresnel drag coefficient, which describes the speed of light in a moving medium. The formula for that is u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). But I'm not sure if that's the case here. 

Wait, let me check. The Fresnel drag was derived before special relativity, and it accounts for the partial dragging of the light by the moving medium. The formula is indeed u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). Then, when special relativity is applied, the velocity addition formula gives a different result. But which one is correct? 

Hmm, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, so we might need to use the relativistic velocity addition. But let me think again. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. Then, transforming back to the lab frame, the velocity u would be (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). So plugging in u' = 1/n, and c = 1, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But wait, if n = 1, then u = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct. That makes sense because if the medium is vacuum (n=1), then the speed of light should still be c=1 regardless of the frame. So that works. 

But what about the Fresnel drag formula? Let's compute both. The Fresnel drag formula gives u = 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). Let's test n=1 here: u = 1 + v(1 - 1) = 1, which also gives the correct result. But for other values of n, the two formulas give different results. 

Wait, so which one is the correct approach here? Since the problem states that the glass is moving at constant velocity v, which is a relativistic scenario. So the relativistic velocity addition should be the correct method. However, historically, the Fresnel drag was a pre-relativistic formula that was later understood in the context of special relativity. 

But if we use the relativistic velocity addition, then the speed should be (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Let's check another case. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5 (in units where c=1). Then according to velocity addition, u = (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8. According to Fresnel drag, u = 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. These are different. 

But which one is correct? Let me recall that in special relativity, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula. The Fresnel drag formula is an approximation for small velocities v << c. So if the problem doesn't specify that v is small, we should use the relativistic formula. 

But wait, let me check some references. The Fresnel drag coefficient is given by u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which is valid to first order in v/c. The relativistic formula, according to some sources, gives u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [1 + (v/(n c)) ] which, when expanded to first order in v/c, gives u ≈ c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), matching the Fresnel drag. So the relativistic formula is more accurate for any velocity v, while the Fresnel drag is the first-order approximation. 

Since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Therefore, the speed of light in the moving glass as observed in the lab frame is (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). 

But let me make sure. Let's think about another way. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame). To transform the velocity back to the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v). Since c=1, we can ignore the c² denominator. 

Yes, so that's the formula. So plugging in u' = 1/n, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). 

Alternatively, if we use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. Let me recall that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The correct formula is indeed (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). 

Therefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let's check the units. Since c=1, all velocities are in terms of c. So v is a fraction of c, and 1/n is also a fraction. So the formula is dimensionally consistent. 

For example, if the glass is stationary (v=0), then u = 1/n, which is correct. If the glass is moving at v, then the observed speed is higher than 1/n but less than c. For example, if n=2 and v=0.5, as before, (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8, which is less than 1, so it's valid. 

Alternatively, if v approaches 1 (the speed of light), then u approaches (1/n + 1)/(1 + 1/n) = (1 + n)/ (n + 1) * 1/n *n? Wait, let me compute that. 

Wait, if v approaches 1, then u = (1/n + 1)/(1 + (1/n)*1) = (1 + n)/n / ( (n + 1)/n ) ) = ( (1 + n)/n ) * (n/(n + 1)) ) = 1. So as v approaches c, the speed of light in the medium approaches c, which is consistent with special relativity, since nothing can exceed c. That makes sense. 

Therefore, the formula (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) seems correct. 

But wait, let's also consider the case where the medium is moving in the opposite direction. If v is negative, then the formula still holds. For example, if the glass is moving opposite to the light, then v is negative, and the speed would be (1/n - |v|)/(1 - |v|/n). If |v| is small, this would give a speed slightly less than 1/n. 

But in our problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, so v is positive. 

Therefore, after going through these checks, I believe the correct formula to use is the relativistic velocity addition, leading to the speed u = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

So the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + (v/n)), which can also be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v) if we multiply numerator and denominator by n. 

Alternatively, it's sometimes presented in the form (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c)) but since c=1 here, it's the same as above. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

I need to determine the speed of light in glass as observed from a laboratory reference frame, when the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Let me consider the fundamentals of this problem.

The speed of light in a stationary medium like glass is calculated as c divided by the refractive index n. Since the problem defines the speed of light in vacuum as c = 1, the light speed in stationary glass would be 1/n. However, in this scenario, the glass medium is moving, which complicates the calculation.

When dealing with a moving medium, we can't simply add the medium's velocity to the light's speed in that medium. This situation requires special relativity's velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), where u represents the velocity of an object relative to the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the observer. In our case, u corresponds to the light's speed in the glass, which is 1/n in the glass's rest frame.

So, to find the speed of light as observed in the laboratory frame, I need to apply this formula. The light moves at speed u' = 1/n in the glass's rest frame, and the glass moves at speed v relative to the lab. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed u in the lab frame would be u = ((1/n) + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v), since c = 1.

Let me verify this with a simple case: if n = 1 (representing vacuum), the speed should be calculated as (0 + v)/(1 + 0)

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the speed of light in glass as seen by an observer in the laboratory, when the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Let's begin by reviewing some fundamental concepts.

Typically, the speed of light in a medium like glass is expressed as c divided by the refractive index n. Given that the speed of light in a vacuum is c = 1 in this scenario, the speed of light in stationary glass should be 1/n. However, since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, we must consider the medium's motion.

I recall that when a medium is in motion, the speed of light relative to the observer isn't merely the direct sum of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium. Instead, special relativity provides a formula for combining velocities. But is this a relativistic situation? The problem doesn't make it clear if v is a substantial fraction of the speed of light, but given the involvement of light speeds, we might need to apply relativistic velocity addition.

The conventional velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), where u is the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the observer. In this case, the speed of light in the glass, when stationary, is 1/n. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then the light's speed relative to the lab frame is the relativistic combination of v and 1/n.

Let’s think it through. In the rest frame of the glass, light travels at speed u' = c/n = 1/n. The glass itself moves at speed v relative to the lab frame. To find the speed u in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Given both velocities are in the same direction, this becomes u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). With c = 1, this reduces to u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)v ).

Let’s verify. Consider n = 1, reflecting the scenario where the medium is vacuum. The speed would then be (0 + v)/(1 + 0), which checks out as expected.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Speed of Light in Stationary Glass**: The speed of light in glass when the glass is stationary is \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.
2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: When the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory frame, the speed of light in the laboratory frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass's rest frame), \( v \) is the velocity of the glass, and \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum).

3. **Substitute Values**: Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \) into the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

4. **Verification**: The formula is verified by checking edge cases such as when \( n = 1 \) (vacuum) and \( v = 0 \) (stationary glass), both of which yield consistent results with known physics. Additionally, the formula reduces to the Fresnel drag coefficient in the non-relativistic limit.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}

= v, but that's not right. Wait, if n = 1, the speed of light in the medium is c = 1. So plugging n = 1 into the formula gives u = (1 + v)/(1 + v*1) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. Which is correct, because if the medium is vacuum, moving at v, the speed of light should still be c = 1 in the lab frame. That makes sense because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So that checks out. 

Another check: if the glass is stationary, v = 0, then u = (1/n + 0)/(1 + 0) = 1/n, which is correct. So the formula seems to hold in these cases. 

But wait, there's another way to think about this. In the frame of the moving glass, the light is moving at 1/n. To transform this velocity back to the lab frame where the glass is moving at v, we use the Lorentz transformation. The velocity addition formula is indeed (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since u' is 1/n and c = 1, the formula becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Let me compute this expression. 

Alternatively, if we didn't use relativity and just added the velocities classically, we would get v + 1/n. But that would be incorrect because velocities don't add linearly when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. However, in the non-relativistic limit where v is much smaller than c (which is 1 here), the denominator becomes approximately 1, and the expression reduces to v + 1/n, which is the classical result. But since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, we have to use the relativistic formula. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Let me write that as (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). 

Wait, but let's see if this makes sense dimensionally. Since we're taking c = 1, all velocities are in units where c = 1. So v is a fraction of the speed of light. For example, if v = 0.5c, then v = 0.5. If n = 2, then the speed in the medium when stationary is 0.5. Then the observed speed would be (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*0.5) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than c, as required. That seems okay. 

Alternatively, if v approaches 1 (c), then the observed speed would be (1/n + 1)/(1 + 1/n) = (1 + n)/n / ( (n + 1)/n ) = 1. So even if the medium is moving at c, the observed speed of light is still c. That's consistent with relativity, as nothing can exceed c. 

Therefore, the formula seems to hold up in these test cases. 

So, putting it all together, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check if there's another approach. For example, considering the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. Wait, the Doppler effect is about frequency and wavelength, but here we're dealing with the speed of light. The speed of light in a moving medium is a classic problem.

If we expand this for small v, (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n. Neglecting terms of order v², this is 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which matches the Fresnel drag coefficient. So the relativistic formula reduces to Fresnel's formula in the low velocity limit, which is a good consistency check. 

Therefore, the correct general formula is indeed the relativistic addition (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). So I think this is the right answer. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me verify this with another perspective. Suppose we have a medium moving at velocity v. In the rest frame of the medium, the light speed is u' = c/n. Then, using the Lorentz transformation for velocity, the speed in the lab frame is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since c = 1, u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Yep, that's the same as before. 

Therefore, this must be the correct answer. 

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}.

The speed of light in glass as observed from the laboratory frame is derived using the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \). The glass itself moves at velocity \( v \) relative to the lab. Applying the formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}} = \frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

**Answer:**  
The observed speed of light in the laboratory frame is \(\boxed{\dfrac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}}\).

= v, but since n = 1, the speed in the medium is 1, so applying the formula gives (1 + v)/(1 + v*1) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct. If the medium is moving at velocity v, but since it's vacuum, the light speed remains c = 1. That check makes sense.

Another check: if the glass is stationary (v = 0), then the speed is (1/n + 0)/(1 + 0) = 1/n, which is correct. If v is very small compared to c (which is 1 here), then the classical approximation would suggest the speed is approximately 1/n + v, but the relativistic formula ensures that even at high velocities, the speed doesn't exceed c.

So even if the medium is moving at speed v approaching c, the observed speed of light doesn't exceed c. That's consistent with relativity.

Therefore, the correct formula for the observed speed of light in the lab frame when the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/n) ). Since c = 1, this simplifies to (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).

I should also consider if there's another approach, like using the relativistic Doppler effect or considering the medium's motion affecting the refractive index. However, the problem states that the glass is moving, so the refractive index n is given in the rest frame of the glass. Hence, the velocity addition formula should suffice here.

In conclusion, applying the relativistic velocity addition formula to the speed of light in the moving glass medium gives the observed speed as (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).

So, yes, the formula would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nWait, let me check with some example values. Suppose n = 2 (so speed in glass is 0.5), and the glass is moving at v = 0.5. Then, the relativistic sum would be (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than c. If we use classical addition, it would be 1.0, which is c. However, if the glass is moving at v = 0.9, then relativistic sum is (0.5 + 0.9)/(1 + 0.45) = 1.4 / 1.45 ≈ 0.9655, which is still less than c. Whereas classical would be 1.4, which exceeds c.

Simplifying this expression:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n to get (v n + 1)/(n + v). But maybe that\'s not necessary. The problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1," so all speeds are in units where c=1. Therefore, the answer is (v + (1/n))/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nAlternatively, writing it as (n v + 1)/(n + v) by multiplying numerator and denominator by n. Let\'s check if that\'s equivalent:\n\nOriginal: (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) = [ (v n + 1)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (v n + 1)/ (n + v). So yes, equivalent. So, the answer can be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v).\n\nBut let me check if this formula makes sense. If the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at speed 1/n in the glass\'s frame, then in the lab frame, it\'s (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Alternatively, (n v +1)/(n + v). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s think about the Fresnel drag coefficient, which describes the speed of light in a moving medium. The Fresnel drag formula is c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). But wait, that\'s a different expression. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps there\'s a conflict here. Let\'s recall that Fresnel\'s formula is a pre-relativistic result, which was later confirmed by special relativity. The Fresnel drag coefficient is given by u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). However, in the limit of low velocities (v << c), the relativistic addition formula should approximate the Fresnel result. Let\'s check.\n\nUsing the relativistic formula:\n\nu = (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)).\n\nIf we take v << c, then we can approximate the denominator as 1 + (v)/(n c) ≈ 1 - (v)/(n c) when expanding in a Taylor series for small v. So,\n\nu ≈ (v + c/n)(1 - v/(n c)) ≈ (c/n + v) - (v + c/n)(v/(n c)).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n≈ c/n + v - (v^2/(n c) + v/(n^2)).\n\nBut since v << c, terms with v^2/c are negligible. So,\n\n≈ c/n + v - v/(n^2) = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²).\n\nWhich is exactly the Fresnel drag coefficient. Therefore, the relativistic formula reduces to the Fresnel formula in the low velocity limit. Thus, the correct formula for arbitrary velocities is the relativistic addition (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)). Since in this problem, c=1, this becomes (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) or equivalently (n v + 1)/(n + v). So, I need to confirm which form is preferable. Since the problem states c=1, the first form is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which is acceptable. Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n gives (n v + 1)/(n + v). Both are equivalent.\n\nLet me check with an example. If n=1 (vacuum), then the speed is (v + 1)/(1 + v), which is 1, as expected. If v=0, the speed is 1/n, as expected. If n approaches infinity (opaque medium), the speed approaches v, which also makes sense. If v approaches 1 (speed of light), then (1 + 1/n)/(1 + 1/n) = 1. So, even if the medium is moving at c, the speed of light in the lab frame is c, as required by relativity. So all the edge cases check out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + (v/n)), which can be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). Either form is acceptable, but I think the first form is more insightful as it directly shows the relativistic addition of velocities. However, the problem might prefer the answer in terms of n and v without fractions in the numerator or denominator. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem states "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1." So, all velocities are in natural units where c=1. Therefore, expressing the answer as (v + 1/n)/(1 + (v/n)) is correct. Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n gives (n v + 1)/(n + v). Both are correct, but perhaps the latter is neater.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer in terms of c, but since c=1, it\'s already incorporated. Let me check the Fresnel drag coefficient again. The Fresnel formula gives u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). If we take c=1, then u = 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). Compare with the relativistic formula (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Let\'s compute the difference.\n\nTake n=2, v=0.5. Then Fresnel: 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*0.75 = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. Relativistic formula: (0.5 + 0.5)/ (1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8. So they are different. Therefore, which one is correct?\n\nBut in reality, Fresnel\'s formula is an approximation for small v, while the relativistic formula is exact. Therefore, since the problem does not specify that v is small, the correct answer is the relativistic one. Therefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, not necessarily slow, so relativistic effects must be considered. Therefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).\n\nBut let me check another source. For example, according to the relativistic formula for the velocity of light in a moving medium, if the medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in the medium is c/n in its rest frame, then the lab frame speed is (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n c²)) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)). Since c=1 here, it\'s (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). To write this as (n v + 1)/(n + v), we can multiply numerator and denominator by n, which might be a more elegant form. Let me verify with n=2, v=0.5 again: (2*0.5 +1)/(2 + 0.5)= (1 +1)/2.5=2/2.5=0.8, which is the same as before. So both forms are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in the second form. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might not care about the form as long as it\'s correct. Either way, both forms are acceptable, but since the problem uses c=1, writing (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) is more explicit in terms of the given parameters. However, if we write (n v + 1)/(n + v), it\'s also acceptable. I need to check standard conventions.\n\nLooking up similar problems, sometimes the formula is presented as (n v + 1)/(n + v). For example, in some textbooks, when combining the motion of a medium moving at velocity v with the light\'s velocity c/n in the medium, the result is given by that expression. \n\nAlternatively, another way to derive this is by considering the Lorentz transformation. Let\'s try that approach.\n\nIn the rest frame of the glass (S\'), the speed of light is u\' = c/n = 1/n. We want to find the speed u in the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity -v relative to S\' (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). Using the Lorentz velocity transformation:\n\nu = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v/c²)\n\nSince c=1, this becomes:\n\nu = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v) = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v) = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n)\n\nWhich is the same result as before. Therefore, this confirms that the correct formula is indeed (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).\n\nThus, after thorough consideration and verification through different methods (relativistic velocity addition, checking against Fresnel drag in the low-velocity limit, and applying Lorentz transformations), the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which can also be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). Either form is correct, but I will present it in the first form as it directly stems from the velocity addition formula.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{v + \\frac{1}{n}}{1 + \\dfrac{v}{n}}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386187, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2983, prompt_tokens=541, total_tokens=3524, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

The speed of light in the glass when stationary is \( \frac{1}{n} \). When the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), we use the relativistic velocity addition formula to combine the velocities. The formula for combining velocities \( u' \) (velocity of light in the medium's rest frame) and \( v \) (velocity of the medium relative to the lab frame) is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Given \( c = 1 \) (in natural units), the speed of light in the glass's rest frame is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

If the medium is stationary (v = 0), then u = (1/n)/1 = 1/n, which is correct. If the medium moves at speed v and the light is moving through it, the speed in the lab frame is (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, if we were to use classical addition, we would naively add the velocities and get 1/n + v, but relativity corrects this with the denominator. Since the problem didn't specify whether to use classical or relativistic physics, but given that it's about light speed, which is inherently relativistic, the relativistic formula is appropriate.

Since they set c = 1, which is a relativistic convention, it's likely that the answer expects the relativistic velocity addition.

But let me think again. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then in the lab frame, the speed of light in the glass would be the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (1/n) plus the velocity of the glass (v), adjusted relativistically. So, yes, the formula would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

Wait, let me check with some example values. Suppose n = 2 (so speed in glass is 0.5), and the glass is moving at v = 0.5. Then, the relativistic sum would be (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than c. If we use classical addition, it would be 1.0, which is c. However, if the glass is moving at v = 0.9, then relativistic sum is (0.5 + 0.9)/(1 + 0.45) = 1.4 / 1.45 ≈ 0.9655, which is still less than c. Whereas classical would be 1.4, which exceeds c. Since we can't have speeds exceeding c in relativity, the relativistic formula is necessary here.

Therefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Simplifying this expression:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to get (v n + 1)/(n + v). But maybe that's not necessary. The problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1," so all speeds are in units where c=1. Therefore, the answer is (v + (1/n))/(1 + (v/n)).

Alternatively, writing it as (n v + 1)/(n + v) by multiplying numerator and denominator by n. Let's check if that's equivalent:

Original: (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) = [ (v n + 1)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (v n + 1)/ (n + v). So yes, equivalent. So, the answer can be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v).

But let me check if this formula makes sense. If the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at speed 1/n in the glass's frame, then in the lab frame, it's (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). Alternatively, (n v +1)/(n + v). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first is more straightforward.

Alternatively, let's think about the Fresnel drag coefficient, which describes the speed of light in a moving medium. The Fresnel drag formula is c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). But wait, that's a different expression. Which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps there's a conflict here. Let's recall that Fresnel's formula is a pre-relativistic result, which was later confirmed by special relativity. The Fresnel drag coefficient is given by u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). However, in the limit of low velocities (v << c), the relativistic addition formula should approximate the Fresnel result. Let's check.

Using the relativistic formula:

u = (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)).

If we take v << c, then we can approximate the denominator as 1 + (v)/(n c) ≈ 1 - (v)/(n c) when expanding in a Taylor series for small v. So,

u ≈ (v + c/n)(1 - v/(n c)) ≈ (c/n + v) - (v + c/n)(v/(n c)).

Expanding this:

≈ c/n + v - (v^2/(n c) + v/(n^2)).

But since v << c, terms with v^2/c are negligible. So,

≈ c/n + v - v/(n^2) = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²).

Which is exactly the Fresnel drag coefficient. Therefore, the relativistic formula reduces to the Fresnel formula in the low velocity limit. Thus, the correct formula for arbitrary velocities is the relativistic addition (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)). Since in this problem, c=1, this becomes (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) or equivalently (n v + 1)/(n + v). So, I need to confirm which form is preferable. Since the problem states c=1, the first form is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which is acceptable. Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n gives (n v + 1)/(n + v). Both are equivalent.

Let me check with an example. If n=1 (vacuum), then the speed is (v + 1)/(1 + v), which is 1, as expected. If v=0, the speed is 1/n, as expected. If n approaches infinity (opaque medium), the speed approaches v, which also makes sense. If v approaches 1 (speed of light), then (1 + 1/n)/(1 + 1/n) = 1. So, even if the medium is moving at c, the speed of light in the lab frame is c, as required by relativity. So all the edge cases check out.

Therefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + (v/n)), which can be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). Either form is acceptable, but I think the first form is more insightful as it directly shows the relativistic addition of velocities. However, the problem might prefer the answer in terms of n and v without fractions in the numerator or denominator. Let me check.

Take n=2, v=0.5. Then Fresnel: 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*0.75 = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. Relativistic formula: (0.5 + 0.5)/ (1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8. So they are different. Therefore, which one is correct?

But in reality, Fresnel's formula is an approximation for small v, while the relativistic formula is exact. Therefore, since the problem does not specify that v is small, the correct answer is the relativistic one. Therefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).

Alternatively, since the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, not necessarily slow, so relativistic effects must be considered. Therefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).

But let me check another source. For example, according to the relativistic formula for the velocity of light in a moving medium, if the medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in the medium is c/n in its rest frame, then the lab frame speed is (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n c²)) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)). Since c=1 here, it's (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which matches our previous result.

Therefore, the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). To write this as (n v + 1)/(n + v), we can multiply numerator and denominator by n, which might be a more elegant form. Let me verify with n=2, v=0.5 again: (2*0.5 +1)/(2 + 0.5)= (1 +1)/2.5=2/2.5=0.8, which is the same as before. So both forms are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in the second form. 

Alternatively, the problem might not care about the form as long as it's correct. Either way, both forms are acceptable, but since the problem uses c=1, writing (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) is more explicit in terms of the given parameters. However, if we write (n v + 1)/(n + v), it's also acceptable. I need to check standard conventions.

Looking up similar problems, sometimes the formula is presented as (n v + 1)/(n + v). For example, in some textbooks, when combining the motion of a medium moving at velocity v with the light's velocity c/n in the medium, the result is given by that expression. 

Alternatively, another way to derive this is by considering the Lorentz transformation. Let's try that approach.

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is u' = c/n = 1/n. We want to find the speed u in the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity -v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). Using the Lorentz velocity transformation:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v/c²)

Since c=1, this becomes:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v) = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n)

Which is the same result as before. Therefore, this confirms that the correct formula is indeed (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n).

Thus, after thorough consideration and verification through different methods (relativistic velocity addition, checking against Fresnel drag in the low-velocity limit, and applying Lorentz transformations), the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which can also be written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). Either form is correct, but I will present it in the first form as it directly stems from the velocity addition formula.

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \boxed{\dfrac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}.
