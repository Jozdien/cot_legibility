To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first calculate the concentrations of the phosphate species contributed by the salts KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

1. **Calculate moles of each salt:**
   - For KH2PO4:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00\ \text{g}}{136.09\ \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735\ \text{mol}
     \]
   - For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00\ \text{g}}{177.99\ \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618\ \text{mol}
     \]

2. **Calculate concentrations in 0.200 L solution:**
   - Concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4:
     \[
     \frac{0.00735\ \text{mol}}{0.200\ \text{L}} \approx 0.0368\ \text{M}
     \]
   - Concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O:
     \[
     \frac{0.005618\ \text{mol}}{0.200\ \text{L}} \approx 0.0281\ \text{M}
     \]

3. **Determine the pH of the buffer solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**
   - The relevant pKa is pKa2 (6.2x10^-8), which is approximately 7.21.
   - pH calculation:
     \[
     \text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.0281}{0.0368}\right) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 \approx 7.09
     \]

4. **Verify negligible concentrations of other phosphate species:**
   - At pH 7.09, the concentrations of H3PO4 and PO4^3- are negligible due to the pH being far from their respective pKa values (pKa1 ≈ 2.12 and pKa3 ≈ 11.74).

5. **Sum the concentrations of the main phosphate species:**
   - Total orthophosphate concentration:
     \[
     0.0368\ \text{M} + 0.0281\ \text{M} = 0.0649\ \text{M}
     \]

Considering significant figures, the masses of the salts (1.00 g) limit the result to three significant figures. The exact calculation gives 0.0648377 M, which rounds to 0.0648 M.

The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Hmm, orthophosphate ions... I think that refers to the PO4^3- ion. But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, right? Since we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution, those are the salts of the phosphoric acid. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate, which would give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the orthophosphate here would be the combination of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Or maybe even PO4^3-? Wait, but PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form. 

The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is the general term for any of the phosphate ions, but maybe in this context, they just want the total concentration of all phosphate species? Wait, no, the problem mentions "orthophosphate ions," which is HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and maybe PO4^3-? But in solution, depending on pH, the dominant species will be different. So I need to calculate the pH of the solution first, then determine the distribution of the phosphate species.

Alternatively, since we have a solution of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, this is a buffer solution. The phosphate buffer system usually involves H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then, once I know the pH, I can find the fractions of each phosphate species and sum them up to get the total orthophosphate concentration? Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. But orthophosphate is the sum of all the different protonation states? Or is it just the PO4^3-? Hmm.

Wait, the term "orthophosphate" can sometimes refer specifically to the PO4^3- ion, but in analytical chemistry, it's common to refer to the sum of all phosphate species (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) as total phosphate. But maybe in this question, they just want the sum of the ions present in solution, excluding the fully protonated H3PO4. But given that we're dealing with salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, those are the main species in solution. H3PO4 is a weak acid, so if the pH is above its pKa, it would deprotonate. Similarly, if the pH is too low, the HPO4^2- might protonate to H2PO4^-.

But since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their concentrations will depend on the pH. So maybe the first step is to calculate the pH of the buffer solution. Then, using that pH, calculate the distribution of phosphate species.

Alternatively, since both salts are present, their concentrations can be calculated, and then the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (and maybe PO4^3- if the pH is high enough). But at 25°C, with the given Ka values, let's see.

The salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when dissolved in water, KH2PO4 will dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are two different species of orthophosphate. So the total concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (and any other phosphate species present, but in this pH range, probably negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO4^3-).

Wait, but the problem states "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." If orthophosphate refers to all the species derived from H3PO4, then the total concentration would be the sum of [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. However, since we have salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the H3PO4 concentration is probably negligible, as is PO4^3- unless the pH is very high. So maybe the total phosphate concentration is just [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-]. But I need to confirm.

But first, let's calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.200 L.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol. Then concentration in 0.200 L is 0.00735 / 0.200 ≈ 0.03675 M. So approximately 0.0368 M H2PO4^-.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol. Concentration is 0.005618 / 0.200 ≈ 0.02809 M. So HPO4^2- concentration is approximately 0.0281 M.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- at ~0.0368 M and HPO4^2- at ~0.0281 M. These are the two main phosphate species. Now, the question is whether there are other species present in significant amounts.

To determine the pH of the buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is the second one, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. The second dissociation of H3PO4 is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-. So:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.0368)

Calculate the ratio: 0.0281 / 0.0368 ≈ 0.763. Log(0.763) ≈ -0.117. So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09.

So the pH is approximately 7.09. At this pH, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The third dissociation (HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-) has a Ka3 of 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Similarly, the first dissociation (H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-) has a pKa1 of around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 ≈ 2.12). Since pH 7.09 is much higher than pKa1, H3PO4 would be almost entirely deprotonated to H2PO4^-, so [H3PO4] is negligible. Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which are 0.0368 M and 0.0281 M, respectively.

Adding them together: 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. But wait, is that correct? Because each of the salts contributes their respective ions. The total phosphate concentration is the sum of both, since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-. Therefore, total phosphate concentration is indeed the sum of the two concentrations.

But let me verify. The problem states "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate refers to all species derived from H3PO4, then yes, the total would be the sum. But maybe the question is considering that orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. But at pH 7.09, the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible. Let's check.

The concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We know [H+] at pH 7.09 is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M. That's indeed negligible compared to the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Similarly, the concentration of H3PO4 can be calculated using the first dissociation:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

So [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1 = (8.13e-8 * 0.0368) / 7.5e-3 ≈ (3.00e-9) / 7.5e-3 ≈ 4.00e-7 M, which is also negligible.

Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration is approximately 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. But let's do the calculations more precisely.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (exactly 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007349 mol)

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Total volume is 0.200 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007349 / 0.200 = 0.036745 M

Concentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005618 / 0.200 = 0.02809 M

Total phosphate concentration: 0.036745 + 0.02809 = 0.064835 M ≈ 0.0648 M

But wait, the question is in the problem statement. It says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". If they mean the total concentration of all phosphate species (H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- + PO4^3- + H3PO4), then it's approximately 0.0648 M. But considering that H3PO4 and PO4^3- are negligible, it's effectively 0.0648 M. However, maybe the question is asking for the concentration of the PO4^3- ion specifically? But that's 6.22e-7 M, which is way too small, and unlikely to be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering "orthophosphate" as the sum of HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but even then, PO4^3- is negligible. So maybe they just want the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, maybe they are considering that orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion, and we need to calculate its concentration. But given that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is around 7, which is between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, pKa3 is 1.8e-12, which is pKa ≈ 11.74. So pH 7 is way below pKa3, so HPO4^2- is the dominant species over PO4^3-, but even HPO4^2- is less than H2PO4^- in this buffer.

Wait, no. Wait, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-, with pKa3 ≈ 12.35 (since Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). Wait, let's calculate pKa3 properly.

pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74. So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than 11.74, the species HPO4^2- is predominant over PO4^3-; in fact, PO4^3- is negligible. So the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Therefore, the total concentration of phosphate ions is the sum of the two main species. So 0.036745 + 0.02809 ≈ 0.064835 M. Rounding to appropriate significant figures. The given masses are 1.00 g, which is three significant figures, and the volume is 200.00 cm³ which is five significant figures. Molar masses are given with four and five significant figures. So the limiting factor is the masses, which are three significant figures. So the concentrations of each salt would be 0.0367 M and 0.0281 M, which are three and three significant figures. So total concentration is 0.0648 M, which would be 0.0648 M, which is three decimal places, but considering significant figures, the sum of 0.0367 + 0.0281 = 0.0648, which has three significant figures if we consider the original masses as three sig figs. Wait, 1.00 g is three sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses are 136.09 (five) and 177.99 (five). So when calculating moles:

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007349 mol. 1.00 has three sig figs, 136.09 has five, so moles is 0.007349, which we can write as 0.00735 (three sig figs). Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol, which is 0.00562 (three sig figs). Then concentrations:

KH2PO4: 0.00735 / 0.200 = 0.03675 M (three sig figs: 0.0368 M)

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00562 / 0.200 = 0.0281 M (three sig figs)

Then total phosphate is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. But wait, when adding, the number of decimal places is determined by the least number of decimal places. 0.0368 has four decimal places, but as three sig figs, it's 0.0368 (three decimal places here: 0.0368 is three decimal places but actually four digits). Wait, maybe I need to consider significant figures properly.

Wait, 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol:

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007349... which is 0.00735 when rounded to three significant figures.

Similarly, 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618... which is 0.00562 when rounded to three significant figures.

Then concentrations:

0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M, which is 0.0368 M (rounded to three sig figs).

0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M (three sig figs).

Adding 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. Since both have three decimal places (0.0368 is to four decimal places but three sig figs; 0.0281 is four decimal places but three sig figs), the sum should be reported to three decimal places? Wait, no. When adding, you go by the least number of decimal places. 0.0368 has three decimal places (if written as 0.0368), and 0.0281 has four, but in terms of significant figures, perhaps?

Actually, the rule for addition is to round to the least precise measurement. Here, 0.0368 M is three significant figures (the 8 is uncertain), and 0.0281 M is three significant figures (the 1 is uncertain). When adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise number. But both are in the thousandths place (0.0368 is to the thousandth with an extra digit, 0.0281 is to the thousandth with an extra digit). So when adding:

0.0368
+0.0281
=0.0649

So 0.0649 M. Since both original numbers have three significant figures, the sum should also have three significant figures. But 0.0649 is three significant figures (6, 4, 9). Wait, leading zeros don't count, so it's 6.49 x 10^-2, so three sig figs. So 0.0649 M, which is 0.0649 M. But if we have to present it as 0.0649 M, but maybe the answer expects it in mM or something else? Wait, the question says "concentration of orthophosphate ions", so molarity is fine.

Alternatively, the answer might be the sum of the two concentrations, which is approximately 0.0648 M. But considering the precise calculation:

0.007349 + 0.005618 = 0.012967 mol in 0.200 L. So 0.012967 / 0.200 = 0.064835 M. So 0.0648 M when rounded to four significant figures. But given that the original masses are three sig figs, maybe we should round to 0.0648 M, which is four sig figs, but since the masses are three, perhaps 0.065 M? Wait, 0.064835 rounds to 0.0648 with three decimal places, but the significant figures are a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, the total moles is 0.007349 + 0.005618 = 0.012967 mol. 0.012967 mol has four significant figures? Because 0.007349 is four (from 1.00 / 136.09, where 1.00 is three sig figs), but actually, when you divide 1.00 (three) by 136.09 (five), you get three sig figs. Similarly, 0.005618 is three sig figs. So the total moles is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (but actually, adding 0.007349 + 0.005618 = 0.012967). If we consider that each original mole value has three sig figs, then the sum is 0.01297 mol, which would be four sig figs. Wait, but when adding, the number of sig figs is determined by the least precise measurement. If both are three sig figs, then the sum can have three sig figs. So 0.01297 mol is approximately 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M. Wait, but that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply the sum of the two concentrations, each calculated with their own significant figures. The first concentration is 1.00 / 136.09 / 0.200 = 0.03675 M ≈ 0.0368 M (three sig figs). The second is 1.00 / 177.99 / 0.200 ≈ 0.02809 M ≈ 0.0281 M (three sig figs). Adding them gives 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M, which would be 0.0649 M. But since each of the original concentrations is three sig figs, the sum is also three sig figs. 0.0649 has three sig figs (if we consider the leading zeros as not significant), so 0.0649 M is 6.49 x 10^-2, three sig figs. But 0.0649 is written as 0.0649, which is four decimal places but three sig figs. However, usually, trailing zeros after the decimal are significant. Wait, 0.0649 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 9. The zeros are just placeholders. So yes, three sig figs.

But let me check with exact calculation:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00734925347 mol

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00561829288 mol

Total moles: 0.00734925347 + 0.00561829288 = 0.01296754635 mol

Concentration: 0.01296754635 / 0.200 = 0.0648377317 M ≈ 0.0648 M

So 0.0648 M, which is four significant figures. However, the original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), so the result should have three sig figs. Therefore, 0.0648 M rounds to 0.0648, but since three sig figs, it would be 0.0648 -> 0.065? Wait, 0.0648 is 0.0648, three sig figs would be 0.0648, but wait:

The first significant figure is 6, second is 4, third is 8. The fourth is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down. So 0.0648 with three sig figs is 0.0648. But typically, trailing zeros after the decimal are significant. Wait, no, in 0.0648, all non-zero digits are significant, and the zeros in between are also significant. Wait, the rules are:

- All non-zero digits are significant.

- Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.

- Leading zeros are not significant.

- Trailing zeros in a decimal number are significant.

So in 0.0648, the 6, 4, and 8 are significant. The leading zeros are not. So it has three significant figures. Therefore, 0.0648 M is correct with three sig figs. But written as 0.0648 M, which is four decimal places but three sig figs.

Alternatively, expressing it in scientific notation: 6.48 x 10^-2 M, which clearly shows three sig figs.

But the problem might expect the answer in mM or another unit, but it's not specified. The answer should probably be in mol/dm³ or M, which is the same as mol/L.

So, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 0.0648 M. But let's check if the problem considers any other factors.

Wait, another thought: since both salts are strong electrolytes, they dissociate completely. So the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are present in solution. However, H2PO4^- is a weak acid and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. They can react with each other? Wait, no, they are a conjugate acid-base pair. In solution, they establish an equilibrium based on the pH. But since we've already calculated the pH using their concentrations, the amounts should be adjusted based on the pH.

Wait, but actually, when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, the assumption is that their concentrations are approximately equal to the initial concentrations because the buffer resists pH changes. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH based on their ratio, and the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are close to their initial values. Therefore, the total concentration is indeed the sum of the two.

But wait, is there any reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? For example, could they react to form H3PO4 and PO4^3-? But given the pH is around 7, which is between pKa2 and pKa3, the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the other species are negligible. Therefore, the total concentration is just the sum of the two main species.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 0.0648 M, which is 0.0648 M. Rounded to three significant figures, that's 0.0648 M. But if the question expects more precise answer, maybe we need to carry more decimal places. Let's check the exact calculation:

Total moles: 0.00734925347 + 0.00561829288 = 0.01296754635 mol

Concentration: 0.01296754635 / 0.200 = 0.06483773175 M

So approximately 0.0648 M. If we round to three significant figures, it's 0.0648 M. If the system requires four significant figures, it's 0.06484 M. But given the data, three significant figures is appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is presented as 0.065 M, rounding to two decimal places, but that would be two significant figures, which is less precise. Hmm.

Wait, the original problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is five significant figures. The masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs each). The molar masses are given as 136.09 and 177.99, which are five sig figs each. So when calculating moles, the limiting factor is the mass (three sig figs). Therefore, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00562 mol (three sig figs). Then concentrations are 0.00735 / 0.200 = 0.03675 M (but three sig figs: 0.0368 M) and 0.00562 / 0.200 = 0.0281 M (three sig figs). Sum is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. Since both are three sig figs, the sum is three sig figs. But 0.0649 is four digits. However, in terms of significant figures, leading zeros are not counted, so 0.0649 has three significant figures. Therefore, the answer is 0.0649 M. But wait, 0.0649 M is 6.49 x 10^-2 M, which is three significant figures.

But in the exact calculation, it's 0.0648377... which is approximately 0.06484, which would round to 0.0648 if we take four significant figures. But since the original data has three, it's 0.0648 or 0.0649? Let me check with the rules.

When adding 0.0368 and 0.0281:

0.0368 (three decimal places, four sig figs)

0.0281 (three decimal places, three sig figs)

Wait, no. 0.0368 is written as 0.0368, which has four significant figures? Wait, no. Leading zeros are never significant. So 0.0368 has three significant figures: 3, 6, 8. Similarly, 0.0281 has three significant figures: 2, 8, 1. So when adding, the result should be reported to the least number of decimal places. 0.0368 has three decimal places, 0.0281 has three decimal places. So the sum should be reported to three decimal places.

0.0368

+0.0281

=0.0649

So 0.0649 M, which has three decimal places and three significant figures. Therefore, the answer is 0.0649 M. But given that the exact value is 0.0648377..., which is closer to 0.0648 than 0.0649. However, when adding 0.0368 + 0.0281, it's exactly 0.0649. Wait, 0.0368 + 0.0281:

0.0368

+0.0281

=0.0649

Yes, because 8 + 1 = 9 in the fourth decimal place. But if the original numbers were, say, 0.0368 (which is 0.03680?) and 0.0281 (0.02810), then adding gives 0.06490. But in reality, the original concentrations were calculated with three sig figs. So perhaps the answer should be given as 0.0648 M, considering the exact calculation is 0.0648377, which rounds to 0.0648 with four significant figures, but the data supports three, so 0.0648 M. Hmm, this is getting a bit too into the weeds.

In any case, the precise answer is approximately 0.0648 M. Depending on the significant figures, it's either 0.065 M (two decimal places) or 0.0648 M (three sig figs). Given that the problem gives masses as 1.00 g, which is three sig figs, and the volume as 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), the limiting factor is the three sig figs from the masses. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M, which is three sig figs. So, 0.0648 M.

But let me check one more thing. The problem says "orthophosphate ions". If they specifically want the concentration of PO4^3-, then it's 6.22e-7 M, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, if they want the total phosphate concentration, which is the sum of all species, which is approximately 0.0648 M.

Given that the problem provides all three Ka values, maybe they expect us to calculate the exact concentration considering all species. But given the pH is 7.09, which is between pKa2 and pKa3, but pKa3 is 11.74, so at pH 7, the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible. Similarly, H3PO4 is negligible. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is just [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-], which is 0.0648 M.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. To express it properly with three significant figures, it's 0.0648 M or 6.48 x 10^-2 M. Depending on the required format, but probably 0.0648 M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Hmm, orthophosphate ions... I think that refers to the PO4^3- ion. But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, right? Since we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution, those are the salts of the phosphoric acid. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate, which would give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the orthophosphate here would be the combination of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Or maybe even PO4^3-? Wait, but PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form. 

The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is the general term for any of the phosphate ions, but maybe in this context, they just want the total concentration of all phosphate species? Wait, no, the problem mentions "orthophosphate ions," which is HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and maybe PO4^3-? But in solution, depending on pH, the dominant species will be different. So I need to calculate the pH of the solution first, then determine the distribution of the phosphate species.

Alternatively, since we have a solution of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, this is a buffer solution. The phosphate buffer system usually involves H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then, once I know the pH, I can find the fractions of each phosphate species and sum them up to get the total orthophosphate concentration? Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. But orthophosphate is the sum of all the different protonation states? Or is it just the PO4^3-? Hmm.

Wait, the term "orthophosphate" can sometimes refer specifically to the PO4^3- ion, but in analytical chemistry, it's common to refer to the sum of all phosphate species (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) as total phosphate. But maybe in this question, they just want the sum of the ions present in solution, excluding the fully protonated H3PO4. But given that we're dealing with salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, those are the main species in solution. H3PO4 is a weak acid, so if the pH is above its pKa, it would deprotonate. Similarly, if the pH is too low, the HPO4^2- might protonate to H2PO4^-.

But since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their concentrations will depend on the pH. So maybe the first step is to calculate the pH of the buffer solution. Then, using that pH, calculate the distribution of phosphate species.

Alternatively, since both salts are present, their concentrations can be calculated, and then the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (and maybe PO4^3- if the pH is high enough). But at 25°C, with the given Ka values, let's see.

The salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when dissolved in water, KH2PO4 will dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are two different species of orthophosphate. So the total concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (and any other phosphate species present, but in this pH range, probably negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO4^3-).

Wait, but the problem states "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." If orthophosphate refers to all the species derived from H3PO4, then the total concentration would be the sum of [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. However, since we have salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the H3PO4 concentration is probably negligible, as is PO4^3- unless the pH is very high. So maybe the total phosphate concentration is just [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-]. But I need to confirm.

But first, let's calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.200 L.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol. Then concentration in 0.200 L is 0.00735 / 0.200 ≈ 0.03675 M. So approximately 0.0368 M H2PO4^-.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol. Concentration is 0.005618 / 0.200 ≈ 0.02809 M. So HPO4^2- concentration is approximately 0.0281 M.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- at ~0.0368 M and HPO4^2- at ~0.0281 M. These are the two main phosphate species. Now, the question is whether there are other species present in significant amounts.

To determine the pH of the buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is the second one, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. The second dissociation of H3PO4 is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-. So:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.0368)

Calculate the ratio: 0.0281 / 0.0368 ≈ 0.763. Log(0.763) ≈ -0.117. So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09.

So the pH is approximately 7.09. At this pH, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The third dissociation (HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-) has a Ka3 of 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Similarly, the first dissociation (H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-) has a pKa1 of around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 ≈ 2.12). Since pH 7.09 is much higher than pKa1, H3PO4 would be almost entirely deprotonated to H2PO4^-, so [H3

Alright, I need to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. I believe orthophosphate refers to PO4^3- ions, but phosphate can exist in different forms depending on pH. Looking at the solution components, we have KH2PO4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions, and Na2HPO4·2H2O (disodium hydrogen phosphate) which gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

The question asks for orthophosphate ions concentration, which could mean either specifically PO4^3- or the total concentration of all phosphate species. In analytical chemistry, the sum of all phosphate species (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) is often called total phosphate. Given that we have salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, these are likely the main species present.

Let me calculate the concentrations of each salt. With a solution volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L):

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g with molar mass 136.09 g/mol gives 0.00735 mol. In 0.200 L, that's approximately 0.0368 M H2PO4^-.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g with molar mass 177.99 g/mol gives 0.005618 mol. In 0.200 L, that's approximately 0.0281 M HPO4^2-.

To determine if other phosphate species are present in significant amounts, I'll calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The second dissociation constant (Ka2) for phosphoric acid is 6.2×10^-8, so pKa2 ≈ 7.21.

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368) ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09

At pH 7.09, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible since Ka3 is very small (1.8×10^-12). Similarly, H3PO4 would be almost entirely deprotonated to H2PO4^- since pH 7.09 is much higher than pKa1 (2.12).

Alright, let's see. I need to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Orthophosphate ions refer to the PO4^3- ion, correct? But phosphate can exist in various forms depending on the pH, right? Our solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which are salts derived from phosphoric acid. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dissociating into K+ and H2PO4^- ions, while Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate, yielding Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, orthophosphate might be a combination of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Or could it also include PO4^3-? But the PO4^3- ion is fully deprotonated.

The task asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. While "orthophosphate" might refer to any phosphate ion, perhaps here they mean the combined concentration of all phosphate species? No, they specify "orthophosphate ions," which might include HPO4^2-, H2PO4^-, and potentially PO4^3-. However, the dominant species in solution will vary with pH, so I should first determine the pH to figure out the distribution of the phosphate species.

Considering the solution includes both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's a buffer solution involving the phosphate buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. I could use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH, and once I know it, determine the relative amounts of each phosphate species to find their total concentration. But when they ask for orthophosphate ion concentration, does that mean summing all the protonation states? Or just focusing on PO4^3-? It's tricky.

The term "orthophosphate" could specifically mean the PO4^3- ion, but in analytical chemistry, it's often used for the total of all the phosphate forms (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-). Maybe they seek the cumulative ion concentration, excluding the fully protonated form, H3PO4. Since we're dealing with salts like H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, these are likely the main species in solution; H3PO4 is weak and would deprotonate above its pKa. Conversely, if the pH is too low, HPO4^2- might convert to H2PO4^-.

With both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, their concentrations hinge on the pH. So, first step: compute the buffer solution's pH to gauge the phosphate species' distribution.

Alternatively, calculate concentrations for each salt, then determine the pH via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Total phosphate concentration might be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (and potentially PO4^3- at a higher pH). Given 25°C and existing Ka values, let's see.

KH2PO4 dissociates in water into K+ and H2PO4^- ions; a similar process occurs for Na2HPO4·2H2O, dissociating to 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. Thus, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, two key orthophosphate species. The overall orthophosphate concentration would be the sum of these ions (with negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO4^3- due to the pH range).

But the focus is on "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." If "orthophosphate" includes all ions from H3PO4, the sum is [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. Yet, given the salts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, [H3PO4] and [PO4^3-] are negligible unless pH shifts drastically. Thus, the probable total concentration comes from [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-]; however, confirmation is needed.

Let's compute individual salt concentrations. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, or 0.200 L.

For KH2PO4: with 1.00 g and a molar mass of 136.09 g/mol, moles equal mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol. Concentration in 0.200 L is 0.00735 / 0.200 ≈ 0.03675 M, approximating to 0.0368 M H2PO4^-.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g with a 177.99 g/mol molar mass gives moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol. Concentration is 0.005618 / 0.200 ≈ 0.02809 M, thus approximately 0.0281 M HPO4^2-.

Hence, H2PO4^- concentration is ~0.0368 M, and HPO4^2- is ~0.0281 M in solution. These are the primary phosphate species. Now, I must assess other potential species.

Compute the buffer's pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The applicable pKa relates to H2PO4^- as the acid and HPO4^2- as its base. The second dissociation of H3PO4 is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 ≈ 7.21.

Using the equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.0368)

Calculate the ratio: 0.0281 / 0.0368 ≈ 0.763. Log(0.763) ≈ -0.117. Thus, pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09.

So, pH approximates to 7.09. At this pH, major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Since the third dissociation (HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-) has Ka3 at 1.8e-12, PO4^3- concentration is negligible. Similarly, the first dissociation (H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-) and its pKa1 around 2.12 (as Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 ≈ 2.12). With pH 7.09, H3PO4 is largely deprotonated to H2PO4^-.

Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which are 0.0368 M + 0.0281 M ≈ 0.0649 M. But wait, that seems straightforward. Is that correct?\n\nBut wait, the problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate refers to all species, then yes, that\'s the total. But maybe they consider orthophosphate as PO4^3- only? But in that case, the concentration would be negligible. But given that the problem gives both salts, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and asks for orthophosphate ions, which are the same as phosphate ions, so I think the answer is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, let me check. The term "orthophosphate" in chemistry usually refers to the phosphate anion in its simplest form, which is PO4^3-. However, in practice, in aqueous solution, phosphate can exist in different protonation states depending on pH. So sometimes, "orthophosphate" is used to refer to all forms (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), while "phosphate" can also be used similarly. However, in some contexts, orthophosphate specifically refers to PO4^3-. But given that the problem is asking for the concentration in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it\'s more likely that they want the total concentration of all phosphate species, which would be the sum of the two.\n\nBut let me confirm. If you have a solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those are the two species present. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion per formula unit, the total concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) divided by the total volume. Wait, but that would be the total phosphate concentration regardless of the protonation state. Because each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-. So the total phosphate concentration is (0.00735 + 0.005618) mol / 0.200 L = (0.012968 mol) / 0.200 L ≈ 0.0648 M. So that\'s about 0.0648 M. Which is the same as adding the concentrations: 0.0368 + 0.0281 ≈ 0.0649 M. So that seems to be the case.\n\nSo maybe the answer is simply the total concentration of both phosphate ions, regardless of their protonation state. Because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are orthophosphate ions. Therefore, their sum is the total orthophosphate concentration.\n\nBut let me check if that\'s the standard definition. According to IUPAC, orthophosphate is the name for the PO4^3- ion. However, in environmental chemistry and other fields, "orthophosphate" often refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- in solution. So in that case, the answer would be the sum of those three. But in our case, since the pH is around 7, PO4^3- is negligible. So the sum is approximately [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the total concentration of phosphate ions, regardless of protonation, which would be the sum of the concentrations from both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion, the total moles are 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Then, divided by 0.200 L. Let\'s compute that.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n\nTotal moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.06484 M, which is approximately 0.0648 M. So that\'s 0.0648 M orthophosphate ions.\n\nBut wait, why do we need the Ka values then? If the question is just asking for the total concentration, regardless of the species, then the Ka values are irrelevant. But the problem gives us Ka1, Ka2, Ka3. So maybe they expect us to consider the speciation? But if we are to sum all phosphate species, regardless of their protonation, the answer is just the total concentration from both salts. However, if the question is actually asking for the concentration of a specific species, like PO4^3-, then we need to calculate it using the pH and Ka3. But in that case, the concentration would be very low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they give the Ka values to test if you know that the total concentration is just the sum of the two salts. But given that they provided the Ka values, perhaps we need to check if there\'s any protonation or deprotonation that affects the concentration.\n\nWait, but when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in water, they dissociate completely into their respective ions. So the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present in solution. However, they can react with each other and with water. But in reality, since they are a conjugate acid-base pair, they form a buffer, and their concentrations are determined by the amounts added, adjusted by any reactions. But in this case, since we have both added to the solution, the total phosphate concentration would still be the sum of the two, because even if some H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- or vice versa, the total amount of phosphate remains the same. Because each H2PO4^- that loses a proton becomes HPO4^2-, but the total number of phosphate ions remains the same. Similarly, each HPO4^2- that gains a proton becomes H2PO4^-. So the total concentration of phosphate species is conserved. Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration is simply (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) / volume.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99) / 0.200 = approximately 0.0648 M. But let me compute this more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (exactly, let\'s use more decimal places: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007350283 mol).\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618292 mol.\n\nTotal moles: 0.007350283 + 0.005618292 = 0.012968575 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.012968575 / 0.200 = 0.064842875 M ≈ 0.0648 M.\n\nSo, 0.0648 M. But the problem might want more significant figures. Let\'s check the given data. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (5 significant figures). The masses are 1.00 g (3 significant figures), and the molar masses are given with 4 and 5 significant figures. So the moles of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283... with 3 significant figures (since 1.00 has 3), so 0.00735 mol. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292... which would be 0.00562 mol (3 significant figures). Adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Then concentration: 0.01297 / 0.200 = 0.06485 M, which would be 0.0648 M (rounded to 3 significant figures). But given that 0.200 has three significant figures, and the moles have three, the result should be 0.0648 M (four significant figures?), wait.\n\nWait, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (5 significant figures). The masses are 1.00 g (three significant figures). The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol (five significant figures) and 177.99 g/mol (five significant figures). So when calculating moles, the number of significant figures is determined by the mass (three), so moles of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs). Adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs?), but since each has three, the sum is 0.01297 (but the first is 0.00735, three sig figs after the decimal, and the second is 0.00562, three sig figs). Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. The uncertainty here would be ±0.00001 in each, but since the original masses are ±0.01 g, the moles would have higher uncertainty. But perhaps, following significant figure rules, when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But both moles have five decimal places (0.00735 is 0.00735, three decimal places if considering 0.00735 as three sig figs, but actually, 0.00735 has three significant figures, with the decimal places being five). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let\'s recall:\n\nThe number 0.00735 has three significant figures. The number 0.00562 also has three significant figures. When adding, the result is 0.01297, which has four significant figures? Wait, no. The rule is that when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. However, in this case, both numbers are in moles, and their decimal places are determined by the significant figures in the original measurement.\n\nWait, perhaps this is overcomplicating. The original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are given with more, so moles would be 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350... which is 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, 0.005618... is 0.00562 mol (three sig figs). So when adding, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. This is 0.01297, which is five decimal places, but the significant figures? The first number, 0.00735, is three sig figs (7, 3, 5). The second, 0.00562, is three sig figs (5, 6, 2). The sum is 0.01297. The leading zeros are not significant, so the significant figures start at the first non-zero digit. So 0.01297 has four significant figures: 1, 2, 9, 7. But since the original numbers have three sig figs, maybe we should round to three? Wait, when adding, the number of significant figures isn\'t necessarily preserved; it\'s the decimal places that matter. But here, since they are in the same units, and the decimal places are determined by the precision of the measurements. However, since the original masses have three sig figs, the moles have three sig figs, so when adding, the sum should have three sig figs. But 0.01297 rounded to three sig figs is 0.0130. Wait, 0.01297 is 0.0130 when rounded to three sig figs? Wait, 0.01297: the first three significant digits are 1, 2, 9. The next digit is 7, which is more than 5, so round up the 9 to 10. Therefore, 0.0130. So the total moles would be 0.0130 mol. Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000. The volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.20000 is 0.0650. Because 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. But 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five, so the result should have three sig figs. 0.0650 is three sig figs. Wait, 0.0650 has three significant figures (6, 5, 0). So 0.0650 M. So the concentration is 0.0650 M.\n\nBut earlier calculation without considering significant figures was 0.0648 M. But with significant figures, it\'s 0.0650 M. Hmm. There\'s a discrepancy here. Let\'s check:\n\nOriginal moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007350... mol ≈ 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)\n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618... ≈ 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)\n\nSum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. But with three sig figs, this would be 0.0130 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M.\n\nBut the exact value is approximately 0.06484 M, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three decimal places). But in terms of significant figures, since the sum of moles is 0.0130 mol (three sig figs), divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the result is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). So 0.0650 M.\n\nBut why is there a difference? Because when adding 0.00735 and 0.00562, which are both three sig figs, the sum is 0.01297, but when considering significant figures, we need to round to the least precise measurement. However, since these are absolute values, not decimal places, the rule is to look at the number of significant figures. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least number of decimal places in the numbers being added. However, in this case, both numbers are in moles with five decimal places, but their significant figures are three. The first number is 0.00735 (three sig figs, decimal places: five), the second is 0.00562 (three sig figs, decimal places: five). The sum is 0.01297, which has five decimal places. But since the original numbers have three sig figs, the sum should be rounded to three sig figs. Wait, but 0.01297 has three sig figs starting from the first non-zero digit: 1, 2, 9. The next digit is 7, so we round up: 0.0130. So the sum is 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), so 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M.\n\nBut the exact calculation gives 0.06484... which is approximately 0.0648. But with significant figures, it\'s 0.0650. Hmm. That\'s a bit confusing. However, given the problem\'s data, the answer should be given with the correct number of significant figures. Since the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses are given with five and five. So the limiting factor is the three sig figs from the masses. Therefore, the concentration should be reported with three sig figs. But according to the calculation above, it\'s 0.0650 M, which is three sig figs. Wait, 0.0650 has three sig figs: the 6, 5, and 0. The trailing zero is significant because it comes after the decimal and is after a non-zero digit. So yes, 0.0650 M is three sig figs.\n\nBut let\'s check with exact computation:\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283...\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292...\n\nTotal moles: 0.012968575...\n\nConcentration: 0.012968575... / 0.20000 = 0.064842875... M.\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.064842875... is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. But according to the significant figure rules when adding, we had to round the sum to three sig figs (0.0130), leading to 0.0650 M. So which is correct?\n\nI think there\'s a conflict here between two approaches: one is to compute the exact value and round at the end, the other is to round intermediate steps. In real scientific practice, it\'s better to carry extra digits through calculations and round only at the end. However, in exams, sometimes you\'re expected to follow stepwise rounding.\n\nBut let\'s analyze:\n\nIf we don\'t round the moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283 mol\n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292 mol\n\nTotal moles: 0.012968575 mol\n\nConcentration: 0.012968575 / 0.20000 = 0.064842875 M\n\nNow, considering significant figures:\n\nThe mass measurements are 1.00 g (three sig figs). The molar masses are exact (given to five sig figs). Volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So the moles of each salt are:\n\nFor KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09. The mass is three sig figs, so moles are 0.00735 mol (three sig figs).\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00562 mol (three sig figs).\n\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. But if we consider that each has an uncertainty, say ±0.00001, but actually, the uncertainty in moles comes from the mass. The mass of 1.00 g implies ±0.01 g. So the moles of KH2PO4 would be 1.00 ±0.01 g / 136.09 g/mol. The uncertainty in moles is ±0.01 / 136.09 ≈ ±0.0000735 mol. Similarly for the other salt: ±0.01 / 177.99 ≈ ±0.0000562 mol. So the total moles uncertainty is sqrt((0.0000735)^2 + (0.0000562)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0000000054 + 0.0000000032) ≈ sqrt(0.0000000086) ≈ 0.000093 mol. So the total moles is 0.01297 ±0.000093 mol. Therefore, the concentration is 0.06484 ±0.00046 M. So we can write it as 0.0648 ±0.0005 M. Therefore, with three significant figures, it\'s 0.0648 M. But the sum of 0.00735 + 0.00562 is 0.01297, which, when divided by 0.20000, is 0.06485, which would round to 0.0648 with four sig figs. Wait, 0.06485 rounded to three sig figs is 0.0648 (since the fourth digit is 5, round up the third: 8 becomes 9, but 0.06485 is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but sig figs are different). Wait, 0.06485 has four sig figs (6, 4, 8, 5). To three sig figs, it would be 0.0649. Wait, no. Let\'s clarify:\n\nThe number is 0.064842875. To three significant figures: The first three sig figs are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. Therefore, 0.0648 M. So three sig figs: 0.0648 M.\n\nBut earlier, when we considered adding 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which is 0.0130 with three sig figs, leading to 0.0650 M. This discrepancy arises because of when rounding is applied. If we round each mole quantity first, then add, we get 0.0130 mol. If we add first, then round, we get 0.01297 mol ≈ 0.0130 mol. But when calculating concentration, if we use the exact sum (0.012968575 mol) divided by 0.20000 L, we get 0.064842875 M ≈ 0.0648 M (three sig figs). So which is correct?\n\nIn reality, to minimize error propagation, we should avoid rounding intermediate steps. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 0.0648 M, considering that the exact calculation gives 0.064842875, which rounds to 0.0648 with three sig figs. The confusion comes from the fact that adding 0.00735 and 0.00562 gives 0.01297, but if we consider that each of those has an uncertainty in the third decimal place, their sum\'s uncertainty would affect the fourth decimal place. However, when dividing by 0.20000 (which is exact, five sig figs), the result\'s uncertainty is dominated by the moles\' uncertainty.\n\nGiven that, the concentration is 0.0648 M with three significant figures.\n\nBut the problem gives the Ka values. If the answer was simply the sum of the concentrations, why give the Ka values? That makes me think that maybe the question is expecting us to calculate the concentration of a specific species, like PO4^3-, which would require using the Ka3. But at pH ~7, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Let\'s check.\n\nGiven that pH is approximately 7.09, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 expression is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nAt pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0281 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.22e-7 M, which is negligible compared to the other concentrations. So including it would give 0.0648 + 0.000000622 ≈ 0.0648 M. No change. Similarly, if we check [H3PO4], using Ka1:\n\nKa1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]\n\nAt pH 7.09, which is much higher than pKa1 (2.12), [H3PO4] is negligible. So yes, the total phosphate concentration is effectively the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which is 0.0648 M.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. But given that the problem provides the Ka values, maybe they expect us to compute the exact concentration considering the equilibrium? But in this case, since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts added, and their ratio is determined by the pH. However, the total concentration is conserved. Unless there is a reaction that consumes phosphate ions, but in this case, the only reactions are the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which don\'t change the total concentration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where they expect you to realize that the total phosphate concentration is the sum, regardless of the speciation. Hence, the answer is 0.0648 M. Therefore, despite the presence of Ka values, the answer is simply the total concentration from both salts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects you to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the given Ka3, but as we saw, it\'s negligible, so the answer would be approximately 6.2e-7 M. But the question says "orthophosphate ions," which includes all species. So that\'s not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of the dominant species. But since there are two dominant species, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and their sum is 0.0648 M, that\'s the answer.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem gives the Ka values possibly as a distractor, or to confirm that other species are negligible, the answer should be the total concentration of phosphate ions, which is 0.0648 M. Rounded to three significant figures, 0.0648 M is already four sig figs, but given the data, it should be three: 0.0648 ≈ 0.0648, but with three sig figs, it\'s 0.0648. Wait, 0.0648 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 8. The leading zeros are not significant. Yes, so 0.0648 M is three significant figures. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check the exact calculation again:\n\n1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283...\n\n1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292...\n\nTotal = 0.012968575...\n\n0.012968575 / 0.20000 = 0.064842875...\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M.\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, despite the presence of the Ka values, the answer is simply the sum of the concentrations from both salts, as the total orthophosphate concentration. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M, or 0.065 M when properly rounded, but given the exact calculation, it\'s 0.0648 M with three significant figures.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \\boxed{0.0648\\ \\text{M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389431, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6649, prompt_tokens=1874, total_tokens=8523, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first calculate the moles of each phosphate salt present:

1. **Moles of KH2PO4**:
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00\ \text{g}}{136.09\ \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735\ \text{mol}
   \]
   Concentration in 0.200 L:
   \[
   \frac{0.00735\ \text{mol}}{0.200\ \text{L}} \approx 0.0368\ \text{M}
   \]

2. **Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O**:
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00\ \text{g}}{177.99\ \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618\ \text{mol}
   \]
   Concentration in 0.200 L:
   \[
   \frac{0.005618\ \text{mol}}{0.200\ \text{L}} \approx 0.0281\ \text{M}
   \]

The total moles of phosphate ions (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) are the sum of the moles from both salts:
   \[
   0.00735\ \text{mol} + 0.005618\ \text{mol} \approx 0.012968\ \text{mol}
   \]

The total concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is:
   \[
   \frac{0.012968\ \text{mol}}{0.200\ \text{L}} \approx 0.06484\ \text{M}
   \]

Considering significant figures, the masses (1.00 g) and volume (200.00 cm³) give three significant figures. Therefore, the concentration is rounded to three significant figures:
   \[
   0.0648\ \text{M}
   \]

The pH calculation using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation confirms that the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with negligible contributions from H3PO4 and PO4^3- due to the pH being close to the pKa2 of phosphoric acid. Thus, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

\[
\boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

PO4] is negligible. Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions would be the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which are 0.0368 M + 0.0281 M ≈ 0.0649 M. But wait, that seems straightforward. Is that correct?

But wait, the problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate refers to all species, then yes, that's the total. But maybe they consider orthophosphate as PO4^3- only? But in that case, the concentration would be negligible. But given that the problem gives both salts, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and asks for orthophosphate ions, which are the same as phosphate ions, so I think the answer is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, let me check. The term "orthophosphate" in chemistry usually refers to the phosphate anion in its simplest form, which is PO4^3-. However, in practice, in aqueous solution, phosphate can exist in different protonation states depending on pH. So sometimes, "orthophosphate" is used to refer to all forms (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), while "phosphate" can also be used similarly. However, in some contexts, orthophosphate specifically refers to PO4^3-. But given that the problem is asking for the concentration in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's more likely that they want the total concentration of all phosphate species, which would be the sum of the two.

But let me confirm. If you have a solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those are the two species present. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion per formula unit, the total concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) divided by the total volume. Wait, but that would be the total phosphate concentration regardless of the protonation state. Because each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-. So the total phosphate concentration is (0.00735 + 0.005618) mol / 0.200 L = (0.012968 mol) / 0.200 L ≈ 0.0648 M. So that's about 0.0648 M. Which is the same as adding the concentrations: 0.0368 + 0.0281 ≈ 0.0649 M. So that seems to be the case.

So maybe the answer is simply the total concentration of both phosphate ions, regardless of their protonation state. Because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are orthophosphate ions. Therefore, their sum is the total orthophosphate concentration.

But let me check if that's the standard definition. According to IUPAC, orthophosphate is the name for the PO4^3- ion. However, in environmental chemistry and other fields, "orthophosphate" often refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- in solution. So in that case, the answer would be the sum of those three. But in our case, since the pH is around 7, PO4^3- is negligible. So the sum is approximately [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-]. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the total concentration of phosphate ions, regardless of protonation, which would be the sum of the concentrations from both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion, the total moles are 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Then, divided by 0.200 L. Let's compute that.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Total moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol.

Concentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.06484 M, which is approximately 0.0648 M. So that's 0.0648 M orthophosphate ions.

But wait, why do we need the Ka values then? If the question is just asking for the total concentration, regardless of the species, then the Ka values are irrelevant. But the problem gives us Ka1, Ka2, Ka3. So maybe they expect us to consider the speciation? But if we are to sum all phosphate species, regardless of their protonation, the answer is just the total concentration from both salts. However, if the question is actually asking for the concentration of a specific species, like PO4^3-, then we need to calculate it using the pH and Ka3. But in that case, the concentration would be very low.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they give the Ka values to test if you know that the total concentration is just the sum of the two salts. But given that they provided the Ka values, perhaps we need to check if there's any protonation or deprotonation that affects the concentration.

Wait, but when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in water, they dissociate completely into their respective ions. So the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present in solution. However, they can react with each other and with water. But in reality, since they are a conjugate acid-base pair, they form a buffer, and their concentrations are determined by the amounts added, adjusted by any reactions. But in this case, since we have both added to the solution, the total phosphate concentration would still be the sum of the two, because even if some H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- or vice versa, the total amount of phosphate remains the same. Because each H2PO4^- that loses a proton becomes HPO4^2-, but the total number of phosphate ions remains the same. Similarly, each HPO4^2- that gains a proton becomes H2PO4^-. So the total concentration of phosphate species is conserved. Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration is simply (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) / volume.

Therefore, the answer is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99) / 0.200 = approximately 0.0648 M. But let me compute this more accurately.

First, compute moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (exactly, let's use more decimal places: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007350283 mol).

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618292 mol.

Total moles: 0.007350283 + 0.005618292 = 0.012968575 mol.

Concentration: 0.012968575 / 0.200 = 0.064842875 M ≈ 0.0648 M.

So, 0.0648 M. But the problem might want more significant figures. Let's check the given data. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (5 significant figures). The masses are 1.00 g (3 significant figures), and the molar masses are given with 4 and 5 significant figures. So the moles of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283... with 3 significant figures (since 1.00 has 3), so 0.00735 mol. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292... which would be 0.00562 mol (3 significant figures). Adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Then concentration: 0.01297 / 0.200 = 0.06485 M, which would be 0.0648 M (rounded to 3 significant figures). But given that 0.200 has three significant figures, and the moles have three, the result should be 0.0648 M (four significant figures?), wait.

Wait, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (5 significant figures). The masses are 1.00 g (three significant figures). The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol (five significant figures) and 177.99 g/mol (five significant figures). So when calculating moles, the number of significant figures is determined by the mass (three), so moles of KH2PO4 is 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs). Adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs?), but since each has three, the sum is 0.01297 (but the first is 0.00735, three sig figs after the decimal, and the second is 0.00562, three sig figs). Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. The uncertainty here would be ±0.00001 in each, but since the original masses are ±0.01 g, the moles would have higher uncertainty. But perhaps, following significant figure rules, when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But both moles have five decimal places (0.00735 is 0.00735, three decimal places if considering 0.00735 as three sig figs, but actually, 0.00735 has three significant figures, with the decimal places being five). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's recall:

The number 0.00735 has three significant figures. The number 0.00562 also has three significant figures. When adding, the result is 0.01297, which has four significant figures? Wait, no. The rule is that when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. However, in this case, both numbers are in moles, and their decimal places are determined by the significant figures in the original measurement.

Wait, perhaps this is overcomplicating. The original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are given with more, so moles would be 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350... which is 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, 0.005618... is 0.00562 mol (three sig figs). So when adding, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. This is 0.01297, which is five decimal places, but the significant figures? The first number, 0.00735, is three sig figs (7, 3, 5). The second, 0.00562, is three sig figs (5, 6, 2). The sum is 0.01297. The leading zeros are not significant, so the significant figures start at the first non-zero digit. So 0.01297 has four significant figures: 1, 2, 9, 7. But since the original numbers have three sig figs, maybe we should round to three? Wait, when adding, the number of significant figures isn't necessarily preserved; it's the decimal places that matter. But here, since they are in the same units, and the decimal places are determined by the precision of the measurements. However, since the original masses have three sig figs, the moles have three sig figs, so when adding, the sum should have three sig figs. But 0.01297 rounded to three sig figs is 0.0130. Wait, 0.01297 is 0.0130 when rounded to three sig figs? Wait, 0.01297: the first three significant digits are 1, 2, 9. The next digit is 7, which is more than 5, so round up the 9 to 10. Therefore, 0.0130. So the total moles would be 0.0130 mol. Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000. The volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.20000 is 0.0650. Because 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. But 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five, so the result should have three sig figs. 0.0650 is three sig figs. Wait, 0.0650 has three significant figures (6, 5, 0). So 0.0650 M. So the concentration is 0.0650 M.

But earlier calculation without considering significant figures was 0.0648 M. But with significant figures, it's 0.0650 M. Hmm. There's a discrepancy here. Let's check:

Original moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007350... mol ≈ 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618... ≈ 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)

Sum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. But with three sig figs, this would be 0.0130 mol.

Concentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M.

But the exact value is approximately 0.06484 M, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three decimal places). But in terms of significant figures, since the sum of moles is 0.0130 mol (three sig figs), divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the result is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). So 0.0650 M.

But why is there a difference? Because when adding 0.00735 and 0.00562, which are both three sig figs, the sum is 0.01297, but when considering significant figures, we need to round to the least precise measurement. However, since these are absolute values, not decimal places, the rule is to look at the number of significant figures. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Actually, when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least number of decimal places in the numbers being added. However, in this case, both numbers are in moles with five decimal places, but their significant figures are three. The first number is 0.00735 (three sig figs, decimal places: five), the second is 0.00562 (three sig figs, decimal places: five). The sum is 0.01297, which has five decimal places. But since the original numbers have three sig figs, the sum should be rounded to three sig figs. Wait, but 0.01297 has three sig figs starting from the first non-zero digit: 1, 2, 9. The next digit is 7, so we round up: 0.0130. So the sum is 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), so 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M.

But the exact calculation gives 0.06484... which is approximately 0.0648. But with significant figures, it's 0.0650. Hmm. That's a bit confusing. However, given the problem's data, the answer should be given with the correct number of significant figures. Since the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses are given with five and five. So the limiting factor is the three sig figs from the masses. Therefore, the concentration should be reported with three sig figs. But according to the calculation above, it's 0.0650 M, which is three sig figs. Wait, 0.0650 has three sig figs: the 6, 5, and 0. The trailing zero is significant because it comes after the decimal and is after a non-zero digit. So yes, 0.0650 M is three sig figs.

But let's check with exact computation:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283...

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292...

Total moles: 0.012968575...

Concentration: 0.012968575... / 0.20000 = 0.064842875... M.

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.064842875... is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. But according to the significant figure rules when adding, we had to round the sum to three sig figs (0.0130), leading to 0.0650 M. So which is correct?

I think there's a conflict here between two approaches: one is to compute the exact value and round at the end, the other is to round intermediate steps. In real scientific practice, it's better to carry extra digits through calculations and round only at the end. However, in exams, sometimes you're expected to follow stepwise rounding.

But let's analyze:

If we don't round the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283 mol

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292 mol

Total moles: 0.012968575 mol

Concentration: 0.012968575 / 0.20000 = 0.064842875 M

Now, considering significant figures:

The mass measurements are 1.00 g (three sig figs). The molar masses are exact (given to five sig figs). Volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So the moles of each salt are:

For KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09. The mass is three sig figs, so moles are 0.00735 mol (three sig figs).

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00562 mol (three sig figs).

Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. But if we consider that each has an uncertainty, say ±0.00001, but actually, the uncertainty in moles comes from the mass. The mass of 1.00 g implies ±0.01 g. So the moles of KH2PO4 would be 1.00 ±0.01 g / 136.09 g/mol. The uncertainty in moles is ±0.01 / 136.09 ≈ ±0.0000735 mol. Similarly for the other salt: ±0.01 / 177.99 ≈ ±0.0000562 mol. So the total moles uncertainty is sqrt((0.0000735)^2 + (0.0000562)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0000000054 + 0.0000000032) ≈ sqrt(0.0000000086) ≈ 0.000093 mol. So the total moles is 0.01297 ±0.000093 mol. Therefore, the concentration is 0.06484 ±0.00046 M. So we can write it as 0.0648 ±0.0005 M. Therefore, with three significant figures, it's 0.0648 M. But the sum of 0.00735 + 0.00562 is 0.01297, which, when divided by 0.20000, is 0.06485, which would round to 0.0648 with four sig figs. Wait, 0.06485 rounded to three sig figs is 0.0648 (since the fourth digit is 5, round up the third: 8 becomes 9, but 0.06485 is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but sig figs are different). Wait, 0.06485 has four sig figs (6, 4, 8, 5). To three sig figs, it would be 0.0649. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The number is 0.064842875. To three significant figures: The first three sig figs are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. Therefore, 0.0648 M. So three sig figs: 0.0648 M.

But earlier, when we considered adding 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which is 0.0130 with three sig figs, leading to 0.0650 M. This discrepancy arises because of when rounding is applied. If we round each mole quantity first, then add, we get 0.0130 mol. If we add first, then round, we get 0.01297 mol ≈ 0.0130 mol. But when calculating concentration, if we use the exact sum (0.012968575 mol) divided by 0.20000 L, we get 0.064842875 M ≈ 0.0648 M (three sig figs). So which is correct?

In reality, to minimize error propagation, we should avoid rounding intermediate steps. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 0.0648 M, considering that the exact calculation gives 0.064842875, which rounds to 0.0648 with three sig figs. The confusion comes from the fact that adding 0.00735 and 0.00562 gives 0.01297, but if we consider that each of those has an uncertainty in the third decimal place, their sum's uncertainty would affect the fourth decimal place. However, when dividing by 0.20000 (which is exact, five sig figs), the result's uncertainty is dominated by the moles' uncertainty.

Given that, the concentration is 0.0648 M with three significant figures.

But the problem gives the Ka values. If the answer was simply the sum of the concentrations, why give the Ka values? That makes me think that maybe the question is expecting us to calculate the concentration of a specific species, like PO4^3-, which would require using the Ka3. But at pH ~7, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Let's check.

Given that pH is approximately 7.09, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

At pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0281 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Which is 6.22e-7 M, which is negligible compared to the other concentrations. So including it would give 0.0648 + 0.000000622 ≈ 0.0648 M. No change. Similarly, if we check [H3PO4], using Ka1:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

At pH 7.09, which is much higher than pKa1 (2.12), [H3PO4] is negligible. So yes, the total phosphate concentration is effectively the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which is 0.0648 M.

Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. But given that the problem provides the Ka values, maybe they expect us to compute the exact concentration considering the equilibrium? But in this case, since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts added, and their ratio is determined by the pH. However, the total concentration is conserved. Unless there is a reaction that consumes phosphate ions, but in this case, the only reactions are the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which don't change the total concentration.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where they expect you to realize that the total phosphate concentration is the sum, regardless of the speciation. Hence, the answer is 0.0648 M. Therefore, despite the presence of Ka values, the answer is simply the total concentration from both salts.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects you to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the given Ka3, but as we saw, it's negligible, so the answer would be approximately 6.2e-7 M. But the question says "orthophosphate ions," which includes all species. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of the dominant species. But since there are two dominant species, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and their sum is 0.0648 M, that's the answer.

Given that, and considering that the problem gives the Ka values possibly as a distractor, or to confirm that other species are negligible, the answer should be the total concentration of phosphate ions, which is 0.0648 M. Rounded to three significant figures, 0.0648 M is already four sig figs, but given the data, it should be three: 0.0648 ≈ 0.0648, but with three sig figs, it's 0.0648. Wait, 0.0648 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 8. The leading zeros are not significant. Yes, so 0.0648 M is three significant figures. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M.

But wait, let's check the exact calculation again:

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007350283...

1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618292...

Total = 0.012968575...

0.012968575 / 0.20000 = 0.064842875...

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, despite the presence of the Ka values, the answer is simply the sum of the concentrations from both salts, as the total orthophosphate concentration. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M, or 0.065 M when properly rounded, but given the exact calculation, it's 0.0648 M with three significant figures.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.

However, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions. If "orthophosphate" refers to all phosphate species, then the answer is 0.0649 M. But if it\'s specifically PO4^3-, then the concentration would be very low. Given the context, I think they want the total phosphate concentration. Let me check.\n\nWait, orthophosphate usually refers to PO4^3-, but in solution, phosphate exists in various protonated forms. However, sometimes "orthophosphate" is used to refer to all forms. But given the problem mentions Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3, they might want the concentration of the specific form. Alternatively, maybe they just want the sum of all phosphate species. Let\'s think again.\n\nThe problem states "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate is the name for PO4^3-, but in solution, depending on pH, the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- here. Since the third deprotonation (HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+) has a very small Ka3 (1.8×10^-12), the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, maybe the question is a trick, but the answer is the sum of all phosphate species, which is the total concentration from both salts. Let me verify the exact terms.\n\nWait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion, then we need to calculate its concentration. However, given the pH is around 7, which is between pKa2 and pKa3 (but pKa3 is 12.35, wait, wait, wait: the given Ka3 is 1.8×10^-12, so pKa3 is 11.74. Wait, but the pH here is 7.09, which is way below pKa3. Therefore, the dominant species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, and PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. But perhaps the problem considers "orthophosphate" as all phosphate species. Let me check the terminology.\n\nOrthophosphate is the common name for the phosphate ion (PO4^3-), but in aqueous solution, it exists in different protonation states. However, in analytical terms, "orthophosphate" sometimes refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. For example, in environmental chemistry, when they measure orthophosphate, they usually refer to the soluble reactive phosphate, which includes these forms. Therefore, maybe the answer is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations, since PO4^3- is negligible.\n\nAlternatively, if they specifically want PO4^3-, then we need to calculate it using the third dissociation.\n\nGiven that, let\'s calculate both possibilities.\n\nFirst, total phosphate concentration:\n\nTotal moles of phosphate = moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99 ≈ 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol. In 0.200 L, that\'s 0.012968 / 0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M. So approximately 0.0648 M total phosphate.\n\nAlternatively, if they want PO4^3-, then we need to calculate its concentration. Let\'s proceed.\n\nThe pH is 7.09. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8×10^-12. The concentration of PO4^3- can be found by:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nAt pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13×10^-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8×10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13×10^-8\n\nCalculate that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ≈ 5.058e-14\n\n5.058e-14 / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M\n\nSo [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22×10^-7 M, which is negligible compared to the other species.\n\nTherefore, if the question is about the total phosphate concentration (all species), it\'s approximately 0.0648 M, but if it\'s specifically PO4^3-, then it\'s about 6.22e-7 M.\n\nHowever, the problem states "concentration of orthophosphate ions". Let me check the terminology again. According to IUPAC, orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. However, in practice, "orthophosphate" in solution refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- because they are all derived from orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4). But in some contexts, like water quality, "orthophosphate" is the soluble reactive phosphate, which includes H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, as PO4^3- is negligible in typical environmental pH.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a chemistry perspective, probably expecting the sum of all phosphate species. However, the problem might be expecting the answer as the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they are the main components, and PO4^3- is negligible. But the question is about "orthophosphate ions", which could be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a straightforward calculation where they just want the sum of the concentrations from both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion: KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O gives HPO4^2-. So the total phosphate concentration is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99)/0.200 = (0.00735 + 0.005618)/0.200 = 0.012968/0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M.\n\nBut given that the problem gives all three Ka values, maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3-? But that seems very low, and perhaps not the expected answer. Let\'s check the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" Given that they provided all three Ka values, perhaps they expect the concentration of each species. But since the pH is 7.09, most of the phosphate is in H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. However, maybe the answer is the sum of all phosphate species. But in that case, why give the Ka values? Unless they want the concentration of PO4^3- specifically. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a buffer solution, and the total phosphate concentration is the sum of both salts. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would buffer the solution. But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which, as per IUPAC, is PO4^3-. If that\'s the case, then using the third dissociation and the pH calculated, we can find [PO4^3-]. But the problem is, if I use the pH from the buffer solution. Let\'s recast.\n\nWait, I calculated the pH as 7.09 using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pKa2. Then, using Ka3, we can find [PO4^3-]. But perhaps the pH is slightly different. Let\'s check the exact pH.\n\nThe buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH can be calculated via:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nGiven [HPO4^2-] = 0.0281 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.0368 M,\n\npH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.093, so pH ≈7.09.\n\nSo [H+] ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13×10^-8 M.\n\nThen, for the third dissociation:\n\nHPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\n=> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+] = (1.8×10^-12)(0.0281) / (8.13×10^-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ≈ 5.058e-14\n\nDenominator: 8.13e-8\n\nSo 5.058e-14 / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M\n\nSo [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22×10^-7 M, which is 6.22e-7 M. That\'s very low. So if the question is about PO4^3- ions, that\'s the answer. But maybe the question is using "orthophosphate" to refer to all phosphate species. In that case, the answer would be the sum of H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- + PO4^3-, but since PO4^3- is negligible, it\'s approximately 0.0648 M.\n\nBut the problem states "orthophosphate ions". Let me check the terminology again. In chemistry, "orthophosphate" is the PO4^3- ion. However, in some contexts, especially in environmental science, "orthophosphate" refers to the dissolved inorganic phosphate species (H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), which are collectively referred to as orthophosphate. So maybe the answer is the total concentration of all three. But since H3PO4 would be negligible here (pH 7.09 is above pKa1=2.12), so [H3PO4] ≈ 0. The sum would be [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.0368 + 0.0281 + 6.22e-7 ≈ 0.0649 M. So 0.0649 M. But the problem gives all three Ka values, so maybe they expect the student to consider all species. However, given that PO4^3- is so small, maybe they just want the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple one where they just add the two concentrations. The question might be expecting that, given that both salts contribute phosphate ions. So total phosphate concentration is (1.00 g /136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol)/0.200 L = (0.00735 + 0.005618)/0.200 ≈ 0.012968 /0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M.\n\nBut given that the problem mentions Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, maybe they want to check if there\'s any protonation/deprotonation. But given that pH is between pKa2 and pKa3, but wait, pKa3 is 11.74, which is higher than pH 7.09, so actually, pH is between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, no: pKa1=2.12, pKa2=7.21, pKa3=12.35 (wait, the given Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3= -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So pH=7.09 is between pKa2 (7.21) and pKa1 (2.12). Wait, 7.09 is just below pKa2 (7.21). So the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, if pH is 7.09 and pKa2 is 7.21, then pH < pKa2, so the dominant form is H2PO4^-.\n\nBut in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the buffer is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut regardless, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of all species, but given the pH, the majority are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nGiven that, if the answer is 0.0648 M, but let\'s check the exact calculation.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\nTotal moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06484 M ≈ 0.0648 M.\n\nBut maybe the answer should be expressed with more decimal places.

Rounded to three significant figures, since the mass is given as 1.00 g (three sig figs), volume 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses four and five sig figs. So the limiting factor is the masses, which are three sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M (rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 has three decimal places but the leading zeros don\'t count, so 6.48×10^-2 M, which is three sig figs). Wait, 1.00 g is three sig figs, so 0.00735 mol (three sig figs), 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). When adding, the decimal places: 0.00735 (three decimal places) and 0.005618 (three decimal places as well, but fourth digit is 8). So adding 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968. The total would be 0.01297 mol (rounded to five decimal places, but considering significant figures, since the least precise is three sig figs (0.00735), but actually, the number of decimal places when adding is determined by the least number of decimal places. Wait, 0.00735 has three decimal places (assuming the last digit is uncertain), and 0.005618 has three decimal places (since 177.99 is five sig figs, 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005618, which is to five sig figs, but the original mass is 1.00 g (three sig figs). So the moles would have three sig figs. Wait, 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three sig figs, 136.09 has five. The result is 0.007347, which should be rounded to 0.00735 (three sig figs). Similarly, 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005618, rounded to three sig figs is 0.00562. Therefore, total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Then, concentration: 0.01297 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06485 M, which would be 0.0648 M (rounded to three sig figs). So 0.0648 M.\n\nBut the problem says "orthophosphate ions". If they mean all phosphate ions, then that\'s the answer. But if they specifically want PO4^3-, then 6.22e-7 M. However, given the context and the fact that they included all Ka values, maybe they expect the student to realize that PO4^3- is negligible and just report the total phosphate concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick to realize that "orthophosphate" refers to all species and just sum them up. Given that the problem is likely from an introductory chemistry course, I think the answer expected is the total concentration of phosphate ions from both salts, which is approximately 0.0648 M.

The mention of Ka values might be a red herring, or to check that the pH is such that other species are negligible. Since at pH 7.09, H3PO4 and PO4^3- are negligible, so total phosphate is sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first calculate the moles of each phosphate salt present:

1. **KH2PO4** (Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol):
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   Concentration in 0.200 L solution:
   \[
   \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.0368 \, \text{M}
   \]

2. **Na2HPO4·2H2O** (Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol):
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   Concentration in 0.200 L solution:
   \[
   \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.0281 \, \text{M}
   \]

Next, we consider the pH of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation constant (pKa2 = 7.21):
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO4}^{2-}]}{[\text{H2PO4}^-]} \right) = 7.21 + \log \left( \frac{0.0281}{0.0368} \right) \approx 7.09
\]

At pH 7.09, the dominant phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The concentration of PO4^3- is negligible due to the very small Ka3 (1.8×10^-12). Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions (sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) is:
\[
0.0368 \, \text{M} + 0.0281 \, \text{M} = 0.0649 \, \text{M}
\]

Considering significant figures, the final concentration is:
\[
\boxed{0.0648 \, \text{M}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which is 0.0368 M + 0.0281 M = 0.0649 M. However, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions. If "orthophosphate" refers to all phosphate species, then the answer is 0.0649 M. But if it's specifically PO4^3-, then the concentration would be very low. Given the context, I think they want the total phosphate concentration. Let me check.

Wait, orthophosphate usually refers to PO4^3-, but in solution, phosphate exists in various protonated forms. However, sometimes "orthophosphate" is used to refer to all forms. But given the problem mentions Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3, they might want the concentration of the specific form. Alternatively, maybe they just want the sum of all phosphate species. Let's think again.

The problem states "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate is the name for PO4^3-, but in solution, depending on pH, the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- here. Since the third deprotonation (HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+) has a very small Ka3 (1.8×10^-12), the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, maybe the question is a trick, but the answer is the sum of all phosphate species, which is the total concentration from both salts. Let me verify the exact terms.

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion, then we need to calculate its concentration. However, given the pH is around 7, which is between pKa2 and pKa3 (but pKa3 is 12.35, wait, wait, wait: the given Ka3 is 1.8×10^-12, so pKa3 is 11.74. Wait, but the pH here is 7.09, which is way below pKa3. Therefore, the dominant species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, and PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. But perhaps the problem considers "orthophosphate" as all phosphate species. Let me check the terminology.

Orthophosphate is the common name for the phosphate ion (PO4^3-), but in aqueous solution, it exists in different protonation states. However, in analytical terms, "orthophosphate" sometimes refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. For example, in environmental chemistry, when they measure orthophosphate, they usually refer to the soluble reactive phosphate, which includes these forms. Therefore, maybe the answer is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations, since PO4^3- is negligible.

Alternatively, if they specifically want PO4^3-, then we need to calculate it using the third dissociation.

Given that, let's calculate both possibilities.

First, total phosphate concentration:

Total moles of phosphate = moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99 ≈ 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol. In 0.200 L, that's 0.012968 / 0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M. So approximately 0.0648 M total phosphate.

Alternatively, if they want PO4^3-, then we need to calculate its concentration. Let's proceed.

The pH is 7.09. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8×10^-12. The concentration of PO4^3- can be found by:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

At pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13×10^-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8×10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13×10^-8

Calculate that:

1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ≈ 5.058e-14

5.058e-14 / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22×10^-7 M, which is negligible compared to the other species.

Therefore, if the question is about the total phosphate concentration (all species), it's approximately 0.0648 M, but if it's specifically PO4^3-, then it's about 6.22e-7 M.

However, the problem states "concentration of orthophosphate ions". Let me check the terminology again. According to IUPAC, orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. However, in practice, "orthophosphate" in solution refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- because they are all derived from orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4). But in some contexts, like water quality, "orthophosphate" is the soluble reactive phosphate, which includes H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, as PO4^3- is negligible in typical environmental pH.

Given that the problem is from a chemistry perspective, probably expecting the sum of all phosphate species. However, the problem might be expecting the answer as the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they are the main components, and PO4^3- is negligible. But the question is about "orthophosphate ions", which could be ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a straightforward calculation where they just want the sum of the concentrations from both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion: KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O gives HPO4^2-. So the total phosphate concentration is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99)/0.200 = (0.00735 + 0.005618)/0.200 = 0.012968/0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M.

But given that the problem gives all three Ka values, maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3-? But that seems very low, and perhaps not the expected answer. Let's check the problem again.

Original problem: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" Given that they provided all three Ka values, perhaps they expect the concentration of each species. But since the pH is 7.09, most of the phosphate is in H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. However, maybe the answer is the sum of all phosphate species. But in that case, why give the Ka values? Unless they want the concentration of PO4^3- specifically. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a buffer solution, and the total phosphate concentration is the sum of both salts. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would buffer the solution. But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which, as per IUPAC, is PO4^3-. If that's the case, then using the third dissociation and the pH calculated, we can find [PO4^3-]. But the problem is, if I use the pH from the buffer solution. Let's recast.

Wait, I calculated the pH as 7.09 using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pKa2. Then, using Ka3, we can find [PO4^3-]. But perhaps the pH is slightly different. Let's check the exact pH.

The buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH can be calculated via:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Given [HPO4^2-] = 0.0281 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.0368 M,

pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.093, so pH ≈7.09.

So [H+] ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13×10^-8 M.

Then, for the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

=> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+] = (1.8×10^-12)(0.0281) / (8.13×10^-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ≈ 5.058e-14

Denominator: 8.13e-8

So 5.058e-14 / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22×10^-7 M, which is 6.22e-7 M. That's very low. So if the question is about PO4^3- ions, that's the answer. But maybe the question is using "orthophosphate" to refer to all phosphate species. In that case, the answer would be the sum of H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- + PO4^3-, but since PO4^3- is negligible, it's approximately 0.0648 M.

But the problem states "orthophosphate ions". Let me check the terminology again. In chemistry, "orthophosphate" is the PO4^3- ion. However, in some contexts, especially in environmental science, "orthophosphate" refers to the dissolved inorganic phosphate species (H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), which are collectively referred to as orthophosphate. So maybe the answer is the total concentration of all three. But since H3PO4 would be negligible here (pH 7.09 is above pKa1=2.12), so [H3PO4] ≈ 0. The sum would be [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.0368 + 0.0281 + 6.22e-7 ≈ 0.0649 M. So 0.0649 M. But the problem gives all three Ka values, so maybe they expect the student to consider all species. However, given that PO4^3- is so small, maybe they just want the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple one where they just add the two concentrations. The question might be expecting that, given that both salts contribute phosphate ions. So total phosphate concentration is (1.00 g /136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol)/0.200 L = (0.00735 + 0.005618)/0.200 ≈ 0.012968 /0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M.

But given that the problem mentions Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, maybe they want to check if there's any protonation/deprotonation. But given that pH is between pKa2 and pKa3, but wait, pKa3 is 11.74, which is higher than pH 7.09, so actually, pH is between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, no: pKa1=2.12, pKa2=7.21, pKa3=12.35 (wait, the given Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3= -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So pH=7.09 is between pKa2 (7.21) and pKa1 (2.12). Wait, 7.09 is just below pKa2 (7.21). So the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, if pH is 7.09 and pKa2 is 7.21, then pH < pKa2, so the dominant form is H2PO4^-.

But in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the buffer is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But regardless, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of all species, but given the pH, the majority are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Given that, if the answer is 0.0648 M, but let's check the exact calculation.

Molar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.

Total moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol.

Concentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06484 M ≈ 0.0648 M.

But maybe the answer should be expressed with more decimal places. Let's calculate precisely.

1.00 /136.09 = approximately 0.007347 mol.

1.00 /177.99 = approximately 0.005618 mol.

Total = 0.007347 + 0.005618 = 0.012965 mol.

0.012965 / 0.200 = 0.064825 M, so 0.0648 M. Rounded to three significant figures, since the mass is given as 1.00 g (three sig figs), volume 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses four and five sig figs. So the limiting factor is the masses, which are three sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M (rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 has three decimal places but the leading zeros don't count, so 6.48×10^-2 M, which is three sig figs). Wait, 1.00 g is three sig figs, so 0.00735 mol (three sig figs), 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). When adding, the decimal places: 0.00735 (three decimal places) and 0.005618 (three decimal places as well, but fourth digit is 8). So adding 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968. The total would be 0.01297 mol (rounded to five decimal places, but considering significant figures, since the least precise is three sig figs (0.00735), but actually, the number of decimal places when adding is determined by the least number of decimal places. Wait, 0.00735 has three decimal places (assuming the last digit is uncertain), and 0.005618 has three decimal places (since 177.99 is five sig figs, 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005618, which is to five sig figs, but the original mass is 1.00 g (three sig figs). So the moles would have three sig figs. Wait, 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three sig figs, 136.09 has five. The result is 0.007347, which should be rounded to 0.00735 (three sig figs). Similarly, 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005618, rounded to three sig figs is 0.00562. Therefore, total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Then, concentration: 0.01297 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06485 M, which would be 0.0648 M (rounded to three sig figs). So 0.0648 M.

But the problem says "orthophosphate ions". If they mean all phosphate ions, then that's the answer. But if they specifically want PO4^3-, then 6.22e-7 M. However, given the context and the fact that they included all Ka values, maybe they expect the student to realize that PO4^3- is negligible and just report the total phosphate concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick to realize that "orthophosphate" refers to all species and just sum them up. Given that the problem is likely from an introductory chemistry course, I think the answer expected is the total concentration of phosphate ions from both salts, which is approximately 0.0648 M. But to confirm, let me check similar problems.

In buffer solutions made from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the total phosphate concentration is indeed the sum of the two salts' concentrations. Since each contributes one phosphate ion. Therefore, the answer is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99)/0.200 ≈ 0.0648 M. Therefore, I think that's the answer they're looking for. The mention of Ka values might be a red herring, or to check that the pH is such that other species are negligible. Since at pH 7.09, H3PO4 and PO4^3- are negligible, so total phosphate is sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Yes, that makes sense. So the concentration of orthophosphate ions (total phosphate) is approximately 0.0648 M. Rounded to three significant figures, 0.0648 M, which can be written as 6.48×10^-2 M. Alternatively, if the system requires two decimal places in the answer, but given the data, three sig figs are appropriate.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.

But wait, the problem states "orthophosphate ions," which might refer to each individual ion\'s concentration. However, since orthophosphate can exist in different forms, but if the question is asking for the total concentration of all orthophosphate species (regardless of protonation), then it\'s 0.0649 M.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" If orthophosphate refers to the sum of all phosphate species (H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), then the answer is 0.0368 + 0.0281 + negligible PO4^3- ≈ 0.0649 M. However, if they consider "orthophosphate ions" as the fully deprotonated PO4^3-, then its concentration would be negligible. But given that KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are present, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is straightforward, and even if there is a buffer, the total phosphate comes from both salts. So, since both salts contribute phosphate ions, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) divided by volume.\n\nWait, but KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. So, the total moles of phosphate (regardless of protonation) is 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.200 L gives 0.06485 M, which rounds to 0.0649 M. So, that\'s the total phosphate concentration. But the question is whether "orthophosphate ions" refers to all phosphate species or a specific one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps "orthophosphate" is a term referring to the PO4^3- ion. But in reality, orthophosphate is H3PO4 and its conjugate bases. So, the total phosphate (orthophosphate) is the sum of all these species. So, in this case, the answer would be 0.0649 M, but I need to verify.\n\nBut let me check the exact terminology. In chemistry, "orthophosphate" is the PO4^3- ion, but "phosphate" can refer to any of the species. However, in some contexts, "orthophosphate" is used to distinguish from polyphosphates. However, in water treatment and environmental chemistry, "orthophosphate" typically refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- (the monomeric forms), as opposed to condensed phosphates. So, in that case, the total orthophosphate concentration would indeed be the sum of all three, but given the pH is around 7, PO4^3- is negligible.\n\nSo, total orthophosphate concentration is approximately 0.0368 + 0.0281 ≈ 0.0649 M. But let\'s check if there\'s any other consideration.\n\nWait, another approach: when you have a solution containing both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the two. Because each salt contributes one phosphate ion. So, regardless of their protonation state, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol) / 0.200 L.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nTotal moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol\n\nConcentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.06484 M ≈ 0.0648 M\n\nSo, 0.0648 M is the total concentration of phosphate ions, regardless of their protonation state. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. But the problem gives the Ka values, which may indicate that they expect the student to consider the actual distribution of species. However, if the question is about the total concentration of all phosphate ions (orthophosphate), then the answer is simply the sum of the concentrations from each salt, which is 0.0648 M.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is a trick question. Maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3- ion. But given the pH of around 7, which is between pKa2 (7.21) and pKa3 (12.35). Wait, pKa3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 ≈ 11.74 (since pH = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So, at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, PO4^3- is almost non-existent here, so the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Therefore, the total orthophosphate is 0.0648 M.\n\nBut let me check: if the problem says "orthophosphate ions," which might specifically refer to PO4^3-? If so, then the answer is nearly zero, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they want the sum of all phosphate species except H3PO4. If so, then the answer is the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The user might just need to calculate the total concentration of phosphate ions, considering both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion, the total concentration is (1.00 / 136.09 + 1.00 / 177.99) / 0.200. Let me compute that precisely.\n\nFirst, calculate each moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007347 mol\n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nTotal moles = 0.007347 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012965 mol\n\nTotal concentration = 0.012965 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.064825 M\n\nRounded to three significant figures (since 1.00 g is three sig figs, 200.00 cm³ is five, but the masses are given as 1.00 g, so three sig figs). So, 0.0648 M would be 0.0648, which is 6.48 x 10^-2 M. But 1.00 g is three sig figs, so the answer should have three sig figs. Let\'s check:\n\n0.007347 mol (four sig figs) + 0.005618 mol (four sig figs) = 0.012965 mol (five sig figs). Divided by 0.200 L (three sig figs), so 0.064825 / 0.200 = 0.064825 * 5 = 0.324125, wait, no. Wait, 0.012965 / 0.200 = 0.064825. So, 0.064825 M. But since the volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs), but the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs). The calculation is:\n\n1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 (three sig figs: 0.00735)\n\n1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 (three sig figs: 0.00562)\n\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (three decimal places, but since original values have three sig figs, the sum should be 0.01297 ≈ 0.0130 mol, but perhaps with three sig figs, 0.0130 mol). Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M.\n\nWait, that\'s a conflict. Let\'s see:\n\n1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three sig figs, 136.09 has five. So, the moles are 0.00735 (three sig figs).\n\nSimilarly, 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 ≈ 0.00562 (three sig figs).\n\nThen, total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol, which is 0.01297 (four sig figs). But since each term has three, the sum should be three: 0.0130 mol. Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M. So, 0.065 M.\n\nBut the exact calculation gives 0.064825, which is approximately 0.0648, but considering significant figures, it\'s 0.065 M. Alternatively, since 1.00 g and 1.00 g are three sig figs, and 200.00 cm³ is five, but the answer would be limited by the three sig figs from the masses. So, 0.0648 rounds to 0.065.\n\nBut the problem gives the Ka values. Maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3-? Let\'s check that. Even though it\'s negligible, perhaps they expect me to calculate it.\n\nGiven that pH is approximately 7.09, and the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\n[H+] at pH 7.09 is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.0281 M.\n\nThus, [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M. That\'s indeed negligible compared to the other concentrations.\n\nTherefore, PO4^3- is about 6.22e-7 M, which is way below the other concentrations. Hence, the total orthophosphate concentration is still approximately 0.0648 M. So, the answer should be 0.0648 M, or 0.065 M when rounded to three significant figures. But let\'s check if the problem expects more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the total phosphate concentration, but specifically the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-, but that\'s negligible. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they want the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- individually? But the question says "concentration of orthophosphate ions," which, as discussed, is probably the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where they consider that when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they contribute phosphate ions, but perhaps they react with each other? But since they are both salts in solution, they just dissociate into their respective ions. The H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution, and their ratio is determined by the pH, but their total concentration is additive.\n\nWait, but if the solution were just a mixture of the two salts, their concentrations would be additive. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- doesn\'t consume each other, so their concentrations are independent. Therefore, total phosphate is the sum. Therefore, the answer is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99)/0.200 = 0.0648 M. So, 0.0648 M.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the given Ka values to calculate the exact concentration of each phosphate species and then sum them. But given that the pH is calculated using the buffer equation, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found. However, since the solution is a buffer made by mixing the two salts, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts added, not by the dissociation. Because they are both strong electrolytes, they fully dissociate. Therefore, their concentrations are fixed by the amounts added, and the pH adjusts based on their ratio.\n\nTherefore, the total phosphate concentration is indeed the sum of the two concentrations. So, the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. But let\'s compute it precisely:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007347 mol\n\nNa2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nTotal phosphate: 0.007347 + 0.005618 = 0.012965 mol\n\nConcentration: 0.012965 / 0.200 = 0.064825 M, which is 0.0648 M when rounded to three decimal places. But considering significant figures, 1.00 g is three sig figs, so 0.0648 M is four sig figs. But 1.00 / 136.09 (which is 0.007347) is three sig figs, 1.00 / 177.99 (0.005618) is three sig figs. Adding them gives 0.012965, which is four sig figs. Then dividing by 0.200 (three sig figs) gives 0.064825, which would be 0.0648 (four sig figs). But since the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), but the masses are three, so the answer should be three sig figs. Therefore, 0.0648 rounds to 0.065 M. Wait, 0.0648 is already three decimal places. Wait, 0.064825 is approximately 0.0648 (to three decimal places), which is 0.065 when rounded to two decimal places. But significant figures: the initial values are 1.00 g (three), 200.00 cm³ (five). The molar masses are given with five and six sig figs. So, when calculating moles, we have:\n\nFor KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 mol (three sig figs)\n\nFor Na2HPO4: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (three sig figs)\n\nTotal moles: 0.007347 + 0.005618 = 0.012965 (four sig figs)\n\nDivided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs): 0.012965 / 0.20000 = 0.064825 M, which can be written as 0.06483 M (five sig figs). But since the masses are three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. So, 0.06483 becomes 0.0648 (four sig figs) or 0.065 (two sig figs). Wait, no. The rule is that when multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise number. Here, moles are 0.007347 (three sig figs) and 0.005618 (three sig figs). The sum is 0.012965 (which is 0.01297 with three decimal places). However, when adding, the number of decimal places is considered. 0.007347 has six decimal places, 0.005618 has six. But since the original masses are three sig figs, the moles are limited by the mass measurements. However, when adding, the sum is 0.012965, but the uncertainty would be in the third decimal place. So, perhaps 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M (three sig figs). So, 0.065 M.\n\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, since 1.00 g has three sig figs, the moles of KH2PO4 is 0.00735 (three sig figs), Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.00562 (three sig figs). Sum is 0.01297 (0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297). Then, divided by 0.200 (three sig figs), gives 0.06485, which rounds to 0.0649 (three sig figs). Wait, 0.01297 / 0.200 = 0.06485. So, three sig figs would make it 0.0648 or 0.0649? The fourth digit is 5, so 0.06485 rounds to 0.0648 if we take three decimal places? Wait, 0.06485 is approximately 0.0649 when rounded to four significant figures. But since we need three significant figures, the number is 0.06485. The first three significant figures are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 8, which is more than 5, so we round up the third digit: 8 becomes 9. Therefore, 0.0649 M. But 0.0649 is three significant figures? Wait, 0.0649 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 9. The leading zeros are not significant. So, yes, 0.0649 M is three sig figs.\n\nBut let me check: 0.06485 rounded to three sig figs. The first non-zero digit is 6, which is the first sig fig. Then 4, 8. The next digit is 8, which is greater than 5, so round up. So, 0.0649. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0649 M. However, considering that the original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), the limiting factor is the masses. Therefore, the answer should be three sig figs: 0.0649 M, which is 0.0649 or 6.49 x 10^-2 M.\n\nBut let me check once again:\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol (5 sig figs)\n\nMass: 1.00 g (3 sig figs)\n\nMoles: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 (3 sig figs: 0.00735)\n\nSimilarly, molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol (5 sig figs)\n\nMass: 1.00 g (3 sig figs)\n\nMoles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 (3 sig figs: 0.00562)\n\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 (3 sig figs: 0.0130)\n\nWait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. But if we consider that 0.00735 is three sig figs (0.00735) and 0.00562 is three sig figs (0.00562), then when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But in this case, both have five decimal places (0.00735 is to the fifth decimal, 0.00562 is to the fifth decimal). Wait, no. Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places (0.00735), but actually, when written as 0.00735, it\'s three decimal places. Similarly, 0.00562 is three decimal places. Therefore, adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which has five decimal places, but the sum would be expressed to three decimal places, the least precise. Wait, but addition rules are based on decimal places, not sig figs. If both numbers have three decimal places, the sum should also have three decimal places. So, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. But 0.01297 has five decimal places. However, since each term has three decimal places, the sum should be rounded to three decimal places. So, 0.01297 rounded to three decimal places is 0.0130. Therefore, moles = 0.0130 (three decimal places). Then, concentration is 0.0130 mol / 0.200 L = 0.065 M (three sig figs).\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.065 M.\n\nBut wait, 0.0130 mol / 0.200 L = 0.065 M. Yes, because 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065. So, 0.065 M, three sig figs.\n\nBut this seems conflicting with the precise calculation. However, considering the rules of significant figures, this is the correct approach. So, the answer is 0.065 M.\n\nBut, given that the problem provides Ka values, I need to ensure that the answer isn\'t expecting a different approach. If they had asked for the concentration of a specific phosphate species, like HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-, then we would need to use the buffer equation. But since they\'re asking for the total orthophosphate ions, which is the sum of all phosphate species, which are primarily H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- here, the answer is simply the sum of their concentrations, which comes out to 0.0648 M. However, considering significant figures, 0.065 M.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick, expecting the student to realize that "orthophosphate" refers to PO4^3-, but as we calculated, its concentration is negligible. But that seems unlikely, given the context. The term "orthophosphate" usually refers to the entire family of phosphate ions in their various protonation states. Therefore, the answer is 0.065 M.\n\nBut to check, let\'s see if the problem is from a textbook or standard question. Often, in buffer solutions, the total concentration of the acid and conjugate base is considered. Therefore, the answer is 0.065 M.\n\nHence, after thorough consideration, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 0.065 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \\boxed{0.0648 \\, \\text{M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389991, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5376, prompt_tokens=1618, total_tokens=6994, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we need to consider the contributions from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. 

1. **Calculate moles of each salt:**
   - For KH2PO4:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
     \]

2. **Total moles of phosphate ions:**
   \[
   0.00735 \, \text{mol} + 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \approx 0.012968 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Convert total moles to concentration:**
   - The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.200 L.
   \[
   \text{Concentration} = \frac{0.012968 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.06484 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Consider significant figures:**
   - The masses given (1.00 g) have three significant figures, so the final concentration should be rounded to three significant figures.

Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \(\boxed{0.0648 \, \text{M}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, negligible H3PO4.

Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration would be the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], which is 0.0368 + 0.0281 ≈ 0.0649 M. But wait, the problem states "orthophosphate ions," which might refer to each individual ion's concentration. However, since orthophosphate can exist in different forms, but if the question is asking for the total concentration of all orthophosphate species (regardless of protonation), then it's 0.0649 M.

But let me check the problem statement again: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" If orthophosphate refers to the sum of all phosphate species (H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), then the answer is 0.0368 + 0.0281 + negligible PO4^3- ≈ 0.0649 M. However, if they consider "orthophosphate ions" as the fully deprotonated PO4^3-, then its concentration would be negligible. But given that KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are present, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is straightforward, and even if there is a buffer, the total phosphate comes from both salts. So, since both salts contribute phosphate ions, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) divided by volume.

Wait, but KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. So, the total moles of phosphate (regardless of protonation) is 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.200 L gives 0.06485 M, which rounds to 0.0649 M. So, that's the total phosphate concentration. But the question is whether "orthophosphate ions" refers to all phosphate species or a specific one.

Alternatively, perhaps "orthophosphate" is a term referring to the PO4^3- ion. But in reality, orthophosphate is H3PO4 and its conjugate bases. So, the total phosphate (orthophosphate) is the sum of all these species. So, in this case, the answer would be 0.0649 M, but I need to verify.

But let me check the exact terminology. In chemistry, "orthophosphate" is the PO4^3- ion, but "phosphate" can refer to any of the species. However, in some contexts, "orthophosphate" is used to distinguish from polyphosphates. However, in water treatment and environmental chemistry, "orthophosphate" typically refers to the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- (the monomeric forms), as opposed to condensed phosphates. So, in that case, the total orthophosphate concentration would indeed be the sum of all three, but given the pH is around 7, PO4^3- is negligible.

So, total orthophosphate concentration is approximately 0.0368 + 0.0281 ≈ 0.0649 M. But let's check if there's any other consideration.

Wait, another approach: when you have a solution containing both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the two. Because each salt contributes one phosphate ion. So, regardless of their protonation state, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol + 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol) / 0.200 L.

Calculating that:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol

Total moles of phosphate: 0.00735 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012968 mol

Concentration: 0.012968 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.06484 M ≈ 0.0648 M

So, 0.0648 M is the total concentration of phosphate ions, regardless of their protonation state. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. But the problem gives the Ka values, which may indicate that they expect the student to consider the actual distribution of species. However, if the question is about the total concentration of all phosphate ions (orthophosphate), then the answer is simply the sum of the concentrations from each salt, which is 0.0648 M.

But perhaps the problem is a trick question. Maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3- ion. But given the pH of around 7, which is between pKa2 (7.21) and pKa3 (12.35). Wait, pKa3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 ≈ 11.74 (since pH = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So, at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, PO4^3- is almost non-existent here, so the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Therefore, the total orthophosphate is 0.0648 M.

But let me check: if the problem says "orthophosphate ions," which might specifically refer to PO4^3-? If so, then the answer is nearly zero, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they want the sum of all phosphate species except H3PO4. If so, then the answer is the same as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The user might just need to calculate the total concentration of phosphate ions, considering both salts. Since each salt contributes one phosphate ion, the total concentration is (1.00 / 136.09 + 1.00 / 177.99) / 0.200. Let me compute that precisely.

First, calculate each moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007347 mol

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol

Total moles = 0.007347 + 0.005618 ≈ 0.012965 mol

Total concentration = 0.012965 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.064825 M

Rounded to three significant figures (since 1.00 g is three sig figs, 200.00 cm³ is five, but the masses are given as 1.00 g, so three sig figs). So, 0.0648 M would be 0.0648, which is 6.48 x 10^-2 M. But 1.00 g is three sig figs, so the answer should have three sig figs. Let's check:

0.007347 mol (four sig figs) + 0.005618 mol (four sig figs) = 0.012965 mol (five sig figs). Divided by 0.200 L (three sig figs), so 0.064825 / 0.200 = 0.064825 * 5 = 0.324125, wait, no. Wait, 0.012965 / 0.200 = 0.064825. So, 0.064825 M. But since the volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs), but the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs). The calculation is:

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 (three sig figs: 0.00735)

1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 (three sig figs: 0.00562)

Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (three decimal places, but since original values have three sig figs, the sum should be 0.01297 ≈ 0.0130 mol, but perhaps with three sig figs, 0.0130 mol). Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M.

Wait, that's a conflict. Let's see:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three sig figs, 136.09 has five. So, the moles are 0.00735 (three sig figs).

Similarly, 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 ≈ 0.00562 (three sig figs).

Then, total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol, which is 0.01297 (four sig figs). But since each term has three, the sum should be three: 0.0130 mol. Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M. So, 0.065 M.

But the exact calculation gives 0.064825, which is approximately 0.0648, but considering significant figures, it's 0.065 M. Alternatively, since 1.00 g and 1.00 g are three sig figs, and 200.00 cm³ is five, but the answer would be limited by the three sig figs from the masses. So, 0.0648 rounds to 0.065.

But the problem gives the Ka values. Maybe they want the concentration of PO4^3-? Let's check that. Even though it's negligible, perhaps they expect me to calculate it.

Given that pH is approximately 7.09, and the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

[H+] at pH 7.09 is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.0281 M.

Thus, [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M. That's indeed negligible compared to the other concentrations.

Therefore, PO4^3- is about 6.22e-7 M, which is way below the other concentrations. Hence, the total orthophosphate concentration is still approximately 0.0648 M. So, the answer should be 0.0648 M, or 0.065 M when rounded to three significant figures. But let's check if the problem expects more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the total phosphate concentration, but specifically the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-, but that's negligible. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they want the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- individually? But the question says "concentration of orthophosphate ions," which, as discussed, is probably the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where they consider that when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they contribute phosphate ions, but perhaps they react with each other? But since they are both salts in solution, they just dissociate into their respective ions. The H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution, and their ratio is determined by the pH, but their total concentration is additive.

Wait, but if the solution were just a mixture of the two salts, their concentrations would be additive. The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- doesn't consume each other, so their concentrations are independent. Therefore, total phosphate is the sum. Therefore, the answer is (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99)/0.200 = 0.0648 M. So, 0.0648 M.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the given Ka values to calculate the exact concentration of each phosphate species and then sum them. But given that the pH is calculated using the buffer equation, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found. However, since the solution is a buffer made by mixing the two salts, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts added, not by the dissociation. Because they are both strong electrolytes, they fully dissociate. Therefore, their concentrations are fixed by the amounts added, and the pH adjusts based on their ratio.

Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is indeed the sum of the two concentrations. So, the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. But let's compute it precisely:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007347 mol

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol

Total phosphate: 0.007347 + 0.005618 = 0.012965 mol

Concentration: 0.012965 / 0.200 = 0.064825 M, which is 0.0648 M when rounded to three decimal places. But considering significant figures, 1.00 g is three sig figs, so 0.0648 M is four sig figs. But 1.00 / 136.09 (which is 0.007347) is three sig figs, 1.00 / 177.99 (0.005618) is three sig figs. Adding them gives 0.012965, which is four sig figs. Then dividing by 0.200 (three sig figs) gives 0.064825, which would be 0.0648 (four sig figs). But since the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), but the masses are three, so the answer should be three sig figs. Therefore, 0.0648 rounds to 0.065 M. Wait, 0.0648 is already three decimal places. Wait, 0.064825 is approximately 0.0648 (to three decimal places), which is 0.065 when rounded to two decimal places. But significant figures: the initial values are 1.00 g (three), 200.00 cm³ (five). The molar masses are given with five and six sig figs. So, when calculating moles, we have:

For KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 mol (three sig figs)

For Na2HPO4: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (three sig figs)

Total moles: 0.007347 + 0.005618 = 0.012965 (four sig figs)

Divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs): 0.012965 / 0.20000 = 0.064825 M, which can be written as 0.06483 M (five sig figs). But since the masses are three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. So, 0.06483 becomes 0.0648 (four sig figs) or 0.065 (two sig figs). Wait, no. The rule is that when multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise number. Here, moles are 0.007347 (three sig figs) and 0.005618 (three sig figs). The sum is 0.012965 (which is 0.01297 with three decimal places). However, when adding, the number of decimal places is considered. 0.007347 has six decimal places, 0.005618 has six. But since the original masses are three sig figs, the moles are limited by the mass measurements. However, when adding, the sum is 0.012965, but the uncertainty would be in the third decimal place. So, perhaps 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then, concentration is 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065 M (three sig figs). So, 0.065 M.

But this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, since 1.00 g has three sig figs, the moles of KH2PO4 is 0.00735 (three sig figs), Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.00562 (three sig figs). Sum is 0.01297 (0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297). Then, divided by 0.200 (three sig figs), gives 0.06485, which rounds to 0.0649 (three sig figs). Wait, 0.01297 / 0.200 = 0.06485. So, three sig figs would make it 0.0648 or 0.0649? The fourth digit is 5, so 0.06485 rounds to 0.0648 if we take three decimal places? Wait, 0.06485 is approximately 0.0649 when rounded to four significant figures. But since we need three significant figures, the number is 0.06485. The first three significant figures are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 8, which is more than 5, so we round up the third digit: 8 becomes 9. Therefore, 0.0649 M. But 0.0649 is three significant figures? Wait, 0.0649 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 9. The leading zeros are not significant. So, yes, 0.0649 M is three sig figs.

But let me check: 0.06485 rounded to three sig figs. The first non-zero digit is 6, which is the first sig fig. Then 4, 8. The next digit is 8, which is greater than 5, so round up. So, 0.0649. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0649 M. However, considering that the original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), the limiting factor is the masses. Therefore, the answer should be three sig figs: 0.0649 M, which is 0.0649 or 6.49 x 10^-2 M.

But let me check once again:

Molar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol (5 sig figs)

Mass: 1.00 g (3 sig figs)

Moles: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007347 (3 sig figs: 0.00735)

Similarly, molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol (5 sig figs)

Mass: 1.00 g (3 sig figs)

Moles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 (3 sig figs: 0.00562)

Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 (3 sig figs: 0.0130)

Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. But if we consider that 0.00735 is three sig figs (0.00735) and 0.00562 is three sig figs (0.00562), then when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But in this case, both have five decimal places (0.00735 is to the fifth decimal, 0.00562 is to the fifth decimal). Wait, no. Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places (0.00735), but actually, when written as 0.00735, it's three decimal places. Similarly, 0.00562 is three decimal places. Therefore, adding them: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which has five decimal places, but the sum would be expressed to three decimal places, the least precise. Wait, but addition rules are based on decimal places, not sig figs. If both numbers have three decimal places, the sum should also have three decimal places. So, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. But 0.01297 has five decimal places. However, since each term has three decimal places, the sum should be rounded to three decimal places. So, 0.01297 rounded to three decimal places is 0.0130. Therefore, moles = 0.0130 (three decimal places). Then, concentration is 0.0130 mol / 0.200 L = 0.065 M (three sig figs).

Therefore, the answer is 0.065 M.

But wait, 0.0130 mol / 0.200 L = 0.065 M. Yes, because 0.0130 / 0.200 = 0.065. So, 0.065 M, three sig figs.

But this seems conflicting with the precise calculation. However, considering the rules of significant figures, this is the correct approach. So, the answer is 0.065 M.

But, given that the problem provides Ka values, I need to ensure that the answer isn't expecting a different approach. If they had asked for the concentration of a specific phosphate species, like HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-, then we would need to use the buffer equation. But since they're asking for the total orthophosphate ions, which is the sum of all phosphate species, which are primarily H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- here, the answer is simply the sum of their concentrations, which comes out to 0.0648 M. However, considering significant figures, 0.065 M.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick, expecting the student to realize that "orthophosphate" refers to PO4^3-, but as we calculated, its concentration is negligible. But that seems unlikely, given the context. The term "orthophosphate" usually refers to the entire family of phosphate ions in their various protonation states. Therefore, the answer is 0.065 M.

But to check, let's see if the problem is from a textbook or standard question. Often, in buffer solutions, the total concentration of the acid and conjugate base is considered. Therefore, the answer is 0.065 M.

Hence, after thorough consideration, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 0.065 M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648 \, \text{M}}.
