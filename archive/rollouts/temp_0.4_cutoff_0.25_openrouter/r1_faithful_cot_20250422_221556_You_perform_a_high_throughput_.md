# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

From the experimental data, we can deduce the following genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is essential for resistance**: The complete loss of resistance in the g2 mutant (0%) indicates that G2 is indispensable. Any double mutant involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also shows 0% resistance, confirming that G2’s function cannot be compensated by other genes.

2. **G1 and G3 act upstream of G2**: 
   - The partial resistance in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance by enhancing G2’s activity. 
   - The double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) shows a synergistic effect, indicating that G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways to regulate G2. Loss of both leads to near-complete loss of G2 activity, but residual resistance implies minor independent contributions.

3. **Epistatic hierarchy**: 
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The phenotype of g1g2 and g2g3 mirrors g2 alone, placing G2 downstream. 
   - G1 and G3 regulate G2’s activity, with G3 having a stronger influence (as g3 has lower resistance than g1).

**Conclusion**: G2 is the critical gene for anthracnose resistance, functioning downstream of G1 and G3. At least one of G1 or G3 (likely both) acts as a transcription factor(s) upstream of G2, modulating its activity. The hierarchical relationship is **G1 and G3 → G2 → resistance**, with G2’s full activation dependent on inputs from G1 and G3.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the experimental results. So, we have three genes: G1, G2, G3. The wild-type has 100% resistance. The single mutants have reduced resistance, and the double mutants even more so. The question is about how these genes interact, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

First, let's list the data again to make sure I have it right. The resistance percentages are:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So, the wild type is 100%, and all mutants are lower. The key here is to determine the genetic relationships. Since transcription factors often regulate other genes, maybe one gene's product is necessary for the others to function.

Looking at the single mutants: G2 knockout (g2) has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So G2 is crucial. If you knock out G2, resistance is completely gone. Similarly, G3 knockout (g3) is 50%, so G3 also contributes but not as critically as G2. G1 knockout (g1) is 75%, so G1 has a smaller role.

Now, the double mutants. Let's see:

- g1g3: 10%. That's lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining them leads to a more severe effect. But wait, 75% and 50%... if they were additive, maybe 75% * 50% = 37.5%? But it's 10%, which is much lower. So maybe there's an interaction here.

But g2g3: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g3 doesn't change it. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%. So if you have g2 knocked out, adding another knockout (g1 or g3) doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would mask the effects of upstream genes. But if G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would prevent the downstream genes from acting.

Wait, but the problem says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and/or G3. Let's think.

If G2 is upstream, then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. So the resistance would depend entirely on G2. But in the data, g2 alone has 0% resistance, which suggests that without G2, resistance is gone. However, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there's still some resistance left. So maybe G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But in the single mutants, like g1, G2 and G3 are still present. So if G2 activates G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would still be active, but the resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild type. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they function in parallel pathways. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is in a linear pathway with G1 and G3. For example, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. But if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 can't function. But in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which suggests that G1 contributes but isn't the only factor. If G2 is upstream, then in g1, G3 might still be active. Wait, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, which work in parallel. So in the wild type, G1 and G3 are both active. If you knock out G1, you still have G3 active (but at 50%?), but the resistance is 75% here. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 modify its effect. But the data shows that g2 alone is 0%, so without G2, there's no resistance. Then, in the g1 mutant (75%), which is only a partial reduction, maybe G1 enhances the resistance provided by G2. But if G2 is knocked out, G1 can't do anything. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, but the resistance is 75%, so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, G3 contributes 50%. But when you knock out both G1 and G3, the resistance would be 25% (100 - 25 -50 =25?), but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. That doesn't fit additive effects. Maybe they work in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function, leading to a more severe effect. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. If G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would eliminate G3's function. So the resistance would be lower than g3, but here g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That doesn't make sense. So maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then knocking out G3 would prevent G1 from functioning, so g3 would have lower resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe they function in separate pathways. For example, G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, with G2 being part of both pathways. But how?

Wait, let's think about the double mutants. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 were in parallel pathways, then the double mutant would have the product of their individual resistances. For example, if G1 contributes 25% (since 100% -75% =25% loss) and G3 contributes 50% (100% -50% =50% loss), then the combined effect might be 75% *50% =37.5%, but the actual is 10%, which is much lower. So maybe they are in the same pathway. If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single mutant. But here, g3 is 50%, so the double mutant should be 50%, but it's 10%. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the genes have synergistic effects. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Let's assume that one gene is a TF that regulates the others. Let's see which one could it be.

If G2 is the TF, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of G1 and/or G3. So in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants of G1 and G3, their expression is normal, but their function is lost. So in g1, G2 and G3 are active. If G2 is a TF that activates G3, then G3 would be active in g1, so the resistance would be lower than wild type by the loss of G1. Similarly, in g3, G2 and G1 are active, so the resistance is 50%. But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), then even if G2 is active, but its targets G1 and G3 are not, so resistance would be 0%. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is not 0. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. Therefore, the resistance is entirely dependent on G2. But in the data, g2 has 0% resistance. Then, in the single mutants g1 and g3, their own genes are knocked out, but G2 is still active. So for example, in g1, G2 and G3 are active. But the resistance is 75%, which suggests that G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, G3 contributes 50%. But if G2 is required for their expression, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would still be expressed (since G2 is active), so the resistance would be G2's contribution plus G3's, but that doesn't align. Wait, maybe the total resistance is the sum of G1, G2, and G3. But that seems simplistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is a product of multiple steps. For example, G2 is required for the activation of a pathway, and G1 and G3 enhance different parts of it. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the double mutants again: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. That suggests that knocking out G2 along with another gene doesn't make it worse. Which would mean that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the presence of G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3. If G2 is epistatic, then it acts downstream. Wait, no—epistatic genes are those where the phenotype of one masks the other. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of g1g2 would be like g2. Which is the case here: g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is downstream of G1. Because if G1 is upstream, then knocking out G1 would prevent G2 from acting, but here, when G2 is knocked out, the phenotype is the same regardless of G1. So G2 is downstream. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone, so G2 is epistatic to G3, meaning G2 is downstream of G3. So maybe G1 and G3 both act upstream of G2. But how does that fit with the single mutants?

If G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then knocking out G1 or G3 would reduce the activity of G2. But in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, which would mean that G2 is still partially active. But in the data, g2 alone has 0% resistance. So if G1 and G3 regulate G2, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's activity, leading to lower resistance. But in reality, g1 has higher resistance (75%) than g2 (0%). That doesn't fit. So maybe the epistasis is the other way around.

Alternatively, if G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 can't function. Therefore, the resistance is entirely dependent on G2. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, since G2 is still active, their resistance is reduced but not eliminated. For example, G2 might activate both G1 and G3, which then contribute additively to resistance. So in the wild type, G1 and G3 are both active, giving 100% resistance. If G1 is knocked out, then only G3 is active, giving 50% (as per data). If G3 is knocked out, only G1 is active, giving 75%. But wait, the data says g3 is 50%, g1 is 75%. So maybe G1 contributes more than G3. If both are active, they sum up to 100%. So G1 is 75% and G3 is 25%? No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, they function in a multiplicative way. For example, G2 activates both G1 and G3, which work in parallel pathways. So resistance is G1's contribution plus G3's contribution. If G1 is 75% when active, and G3 is 50% when active, then together they would be 75% +50% =125%, which is more than 100%, but that's not possible. So maybe it's not additive.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for both G1 and G3 to function. So in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional. But in the presence of G2, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So in the wild type, G2 is active, and both G1 and G3 are active, leading to 100% resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then resistance is G2 + G3, which might be 50% (as per data, but g3 is 50% alone). Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let's think again. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then:

- In wild type: G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%.

- In g1: G2 and G3 are active. Resistance is 75%. So G3 alone (with G2 active) provides 75% resistance.

- In g3: G2 and G1 are active. Resistance is 50%. So G1 alone provides 50% resistance.

But that would mean that G3 contributes more than G1 when both are active. But in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still active. But if G2's only role is to activate G1 and G3, then in g1g3, even with G2 active, there's no G1 or G3, so resistance should be 0%. But according to the data, g1g3 has 10% resistance. Hmm, that contradicts. Unless G2 itself contributes a little to resistance independently of G1 and G3. But in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, so G2's own contribution is necessary. So maybe G2 is necessary for the basal resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance it. For example:

- Wild type: G2 (provides, say, 50% resistance) plus G1 (25%) and G3 (25%) for a total of 100%.

- g1: G2 (50%) + G3 (25%) =75%

- g3: G2 (50%) + G1 (25%)=75%, but the data says g3 is 50%. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for G1 and G3 to function. So without G2, both G1 and G3 can't work. But in the presence of G2, G1 and G3 add to the resistance. So:

- Wild type: G2 active, G1 and G3 active. Total resistance 100%.

- g1: G2 active, G3 active. Resistance = G2 + G3. If G2 is 50% and G3 is 25%, total 75%.

- g3: G2 active, G1 active. Resistance = G2 + G1. If G2 is 50% and G1 is 25%, total 75%. But data says g3 is 50%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is the main contributor, and G1 and G3 enhance it. For example:

- Wild type: G2 (100%) enhanced by G1 and G3.

- g1: G2 at 100% but without G1's enhancement, so maybe 75%.

- g3: G2 at 100% but without G3's enhancement, so 50%.

But then, what's the role of G1 and G3? They might be modifiers. But then, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 would be at 100% but without both enhancers, so maybe 0%? But data says 10%. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the double mutants again. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) both have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis in this context means that the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as the single mutant of the epistatic gene. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream of G1. Because if G1 is upstream, knocking out G1 would prevent G2 from acting, but here, when you knock out G2, the phenotype is the same regardless of G1. So G2's function is necessary regardless of G1's status. Therefore, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. So the pathway would be G1 → G2 → resistance, and G3 → G2 → resistance. Or maybe G1 and G3 both regulate G2.

Wait, but if G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 or G3 would reduce G2's activity, leading to lower resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, which are both higher than g2's 0%. That doesn't fit. If G2 is downstream, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's activity, leading to lower resistance than G2 alone. But here, g1 has higher resistance than g2. So maybe the epistasis is the other way. If G1 is epistatic to G2, then the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g1. But in reality, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream. But then, why do the single mutants of G1 and G3 have higher resistance than G2?

Alternatively, maybe G2 is part of a separate pathway that is essential, and G1 and G3 are in another pathway that also contributes. But if G2 is essential (0% when knocked out), then the other pathway (G1 and G3) must contribute something. But in the data, when G2 is present (as in g1 and g3 mutants), there's still some resistance, but when G2 is absent, it's 0%.

Wait, maybe G2 is necessary for the basal resistance, and G1 and G3 provide additional layers. So:

- Wild type: G2 (provides 50%) + G1 (25%) + G3 (25%) =100%

- g1: 50% +25% (G3) =75%

- g3:50% +25% (G1) =75%

But data says g3 is 50%, so this doesn't fit. Maybe the contributions are different. If G2 provides 50%, G1 provides 30%, and G3 provides 20%, totaling 100%. Then:

- g1: 50% +20% =70% (but data is 75%)

- g3:50% +30% =80% (data is 50%). Doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the pathways are not additive. For example, G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute. But in the presence of G2, both G1 and G3 can contribute. So:

- Wild type: G2 + G1 + G3 =100%

- g1: G2 + G3 = let's say G2 provides a base level, and G3 adds to it. If g1 is 75%, then G2 + G3 =75%

- g3: G2 + G1 =50%

But then, what's G2's base level? It depends. If G2 alone is, say, 50%, then G3 adds 25% (total 75% in g1) and G1 adds 0% (so g3 would be 50%). But that would mean G1 doesn't contribute, which contradicts the data where g1 has 75% (if G1 isn't contributing, then g1 would be 50% + G3's 25% =75%). Wait, maybe:

- G2 alone provides 50%

- G1 adds 25% (so wild type with G2 and G1 and G3 is 50% +25% +25% =100%)

- G3 adds 25%

But then:

- g1: G2 (50%) + G3 (25%) =75% (matches data)

- g3: G2 (50%) + G1 (25%) =75% (but data says g3 is 50%). So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's consider the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance. If G2 is still active in this mutant, then perhaps G2 alone provides 10% resistance, and G1 and G3 together provide 90%. But in the single mutants, g1 has 75% (so G2 + G3 =75%), and g3 has 50% (G2 + G1 =50%). So if G2 is 10%, then in g1, G3 would be 65% (10% +65% =75%), and in g3, G1 would be 40% (10% +40% =50%). Then, in the double mutant g1g3, it's just G2's 10%, which matches the data. But then, what's the role of G1 and G3? They would be providing 65% and 40% respectively when active. But in the wild type, total would be 10% +65% +40% =115%, which is more than 100%. That doesn't make sense. Maybe they are not additive but multiplicative. For example, G2 provides a base, and G1 and G3 enhance it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is determined by the product of the contributions of each gene. For example, each gene contributes a certain fraction, and the total resistance is the product. So:

- Wild type: G1 * G2 * G3 =100%

- g1: (0.75) * G2 * G3 =75% → So G2 * G3 =100%, which would mean that G2 and G3 together account for 100%. But then, in g2, which is 0%, that would mean G1 * G3 =0%, but G1 is present (wild type G1 in g2?), no. This approach might not work.

Another angle: since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, let's assume G2 is the transcription factor. Then, G2 regulates G1 and G3. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Therefore, the resistance in g2 is 0%. In the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are expressed. The resistance is 75%, which is less than wild type, so G1 contributes 25%. Similarly, in g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), but G2 is still active, but since G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, which are both knocked out, then the resistance would depend only on G2's other functions. But according to the data, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So maybe G2 has a minor role independent of G1 and G3, but the main role is through G1 and G3. But in the g2 mutant, it's 0%, so that minor role isn't enough. This is getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of epistasis. If the double mutant of two genes has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, then the gene whose phenotype is observed is epistatic (downstream). For example, if A is epistatic to B, then the double mutant a b will have the same phenotype as a. So, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (lower than either g1 or g3)

This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when you knock out G2 along with G1 or G3, the phenotype is the same as G2 alone. So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. That would mean that G1 and G3 act upstream of G2. So the pathway is G1 and G3 → G2 → resistance.

But how does that fit with the single mutants? If G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then knocking out G1 or G3 would reduce the activity of G2, leading to lower resistance. For example, if G1 is required for G2's function, then g1 would have lower resistance than wild type. Similarly for g3. But in the data, g1 has 75%, which is a 25% reduction, and g3 has 50%, a 50% reduction. If G2's activity is dependent on both G1 and G3, then knocking out either would reduce G2's activity. But if G2 is completely dependent on both G1 and G3, then knocking out either would reduce G2's activity to zero, making the resistance 0%. But that's not the case here. So maybe G2 is partially dependent on G1 and G3. For example, G1 and G3 each contribute to the activation of G2. So in the absence of G1, G2 is only partially active, leading to 75% resistance. In the absence of G3, G2 is even less active, leading to 50% resistance. And when both G1 and G3 are absent, G2 is only minimally active (10%). But then, in the g2 mutant, G2 is completely inactive, leading to 0%. This scenario fits the data.

So, if G1 and G3 are both required for the full activation of G2, which is the key gene for resistance (since its knockout gives 0%), then:

- Wild type: G1 and G3 activate G2 fully → 100% resistance.

- g1: G2 is partially active due to G3 → 75% resistance.

- g3: G2 is partially active due to G1 → 50% resistance.

- g1g3: G2 is minimally active →10% resistance.

- Any double mutant with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) → G2 is inactive →0% resistance.

This makes sense. So G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are upstream regulators that enhance G2's activity. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Wait, in this scenario, G2 is downstream. Maybe the transcription factor is G1 or G3. But according to this model, G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. If one of them is a transcription factor that regulates G2, then that fits. For example, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, and G3 is another regulator. But according to the data, when G1 is knocked out, G2's activity is reduced but not eliminated (75% resistance), and when G3 is knocked out, G2's activity is more reduced (50%). So maybe both G1 and G3 are transcription factors that activate G2, with G3 having a stronger effect. Therefore, the hierarchy is G1 and G3 → G2 → resistance.

Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, this fits because G1 and/or G3 could be the upstream transcription factors regulating G2. The data suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to the activation of G2, with G3 having a larger role (since g3 has lower resistance than g1). Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is the key gene required for resistance, and it is regulated by both G1 and G3, which act upstream. So the interaction is that G1 and G3 are upstream regulators of G2, which is essential for resistance.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the experimental results. So, we have three genes: G1, G2, G3. The wild-type has 100% resistance. The single mutants have reduced resistance, and the double mutants even more so. The question is about how these genes interact, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

First, let's list the data again to make sure I have it right. The resistance percentages are:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So, the wild type is 100%, and all mutants are lower. The key here is to determine the genetic relationships. Since transcription factors often regulate other genes, maybe one gene's product is necessary for the others to function.

Looking at the single mutants: G2 knockout (g2) has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So G2 is crucial. If you knock out G2, resistance is completely gone. Similarly, G3 knockout (g3) is 50%, so G3 also contributes but not as critically as G2. G1 knockout (g1) is 75%, so G1 has a smaller role.

Now, the double mutants. Let's see:

- g1g3: 10%. That's lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining them leads to a more severe effect. But wait, 75% and 50%... if they were additive, maybe 75% * 50% = 37.5%? But it's 10%, which is much lower. So maybe there's an interaction here.

But g2g3: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g3 doesn't change it. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%. So if you have g2 knocked out, adding another knockout (g1 or g3) doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would mask the effects of upstream genes. But if G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would prevent the downstream genes from acting.

Wait, but the problem says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and/or G3. Let's think.

If G2 is upstream, then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. So the resistance would depend entirely on G2. But in the data, g2 alone has 0% resistance, which suggests that without G2, resistance is gone. However, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there's still some resistance left. So maybe G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But in the single mutants, like g1, G2 and G3 are still present. So if G2 activates G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would still be active, but the resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild type. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they function in parallel pathways. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is in a linear pathway with G1 and G3. For example, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. But if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 can't function. But in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which suggests that G1 contributes but isn't the only factor. If G2 is upstream, then in g1, G3 might still be active. Wait, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, which work in parallel. So in the wild type, G1 and G3 are both active. If you knock out G1, you still have G3 active (but at 50%?), but the resistance is 75% here. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 modify its effect. But the data shows that g2 alone is 0%, so without G2, there's no resistance. Then, in the g1 mutant (75%), which is only a partial reduction, maybe G1 enhances the resistance provided by G2. But if G2 is knocked out, G1 can't do anything. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, but the resistance is 75%, so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, G3 contributes 50%. But when you knock out both G1 and G3, the resistance would be 25% (100 - 25 -50 =25?), but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. That doesn't fit additive effects. Maybe they work in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function, leading to a more severe effect. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. If G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would eliminate G3's function. So the resistance would be lower than g3, but here g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That doesn't make sense. So maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then knocking out G3 would prevent G1 from functioning, so g3 would have lower resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe they function in separate pathways. For example, G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, with G2 being part of both pathways. But how?

Wait, let's think about the double mutants. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 were in parallel pathways, then the double mutant would have the product of their individual resistances. For example, if G1 contributes 25% (since 100% -75% =25% loss) and G3 contributes 50% (100% -50% =50% loss), then the combined effect might be 75% *50% =37.5%, but the actual is 10%, which is much lower. So maybe they are in the same pathway. If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single mutant. But here, g3 is 50%, so the double mutant shoul

Let's examine the gene interactions based on the experimental results. We're dealing with three genes (G1, G2, G3) where the wild-type shows 100% resistance, and we need to determine their relationships, with the knowledge that at least one functions as a transcription factor upstream of others.

To recap the resistance data:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The wild type maintains full resistance while all mutants show reduced levels. We need to determine the genetic relationships, considering that transcription factors typically regulate other genes, potentially making one gene's product necessary for others to function.

Analyzing single mutants: The G2 knockout (g2) has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential. G3 knockout (g3) retains 50% resistance, suggesting G3 contributes significantly but less critically than G2. G1 knockout (g1) maintains 75% resistance, indicating G1 plays a smaller role.

For double mutants: 
- g1g3: 10% - This is lower than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). If the effects were simply additive, we might expect around 37.5% (75% × 50%), but 10% suggests a more complex interaction.
- g2g3: 0% - Since g2 alone is already 0%, adding g3 mutation doesn't worsen the phenotype.
- g1g2: 0% - Similarly, adding g1 to g2 doesn't change the complete loss of resistance.

This suggests G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 - when G2 is knocked out, the effects of G1 or G3 mutations become irrelevant. Epistasis indicates that one gene's effect depends on another. If G2 is downstream, knocking it out would mask upstream genes' effects. If G2 is upstream, its knockout would prevent downstream genes from functioning.

Given that we know at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 might be this transcription factor activating G1 and/or G3. In a g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would express, explaining the complete loss of resistance. The single mutants g1 and g3 still show some resistance because G2 remains functional.

Perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which operate in parallel pathways. Alternatively, G2 could be the primary resistance gene, with G1 and G3 modifying its effect. Since g2 alone shows 0% resistance, G2 appears essential for any resistance.

The g1g3 double mutant's resistance (10%) being lower than either single mutant complicates the picture. If G1 and G3 functioned in completely separate pathways, we might expect their combined effect to be multiplicative, around 37.5%. The observed 10% suggests they may share pathway elements or interact in more complex ways.

Alright, let's analyze the interactions between these genes based on the experimental results. We have three genes: G1, G2, and G3. The wild-type shows 100% resistance, but single mutants have reduced resistance, and double mutants have even lower resistance. We need to explore the interactions among these genes, especially considering that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream.

Let's go over the data to ensure accuracy. The resistance percentages are as follows:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The wild-type has 100% resistance, but all mutants show a drop. The objective is to determine how these genes are genetically related. As transcription factors often regulate other genes, perhaps one gene’s product is essential for the functioning of others.

Examining the single mutants, we see that the G2 knockout (g2) brings resistance down to 0%, a significant drop, indicating G2 is crucial. Knocking out G2 eliminates resistance. Meanwhile, the G3 knockout (g3) results in 50% resistance, showing G3 is important but not as critically as G2. The G1 knockout (g1) results in 75% resistance, indicating that G1 plays a smaller role.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10%. This is lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). Combining them has a more severe effect. If effects were additive, perhaps 75% * 50% = 37.5% could be expected, but it’s 10%, which is much lower, suggesting an interaction.

In g2g3: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g3 doesn’t change it. Similarly, in g1g2, resistance is 0%. Thus, with a g2 knockout, additional knockouts (g1 or g3) don’t worsen resistance. This suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis implies that one gene’s effect depends on another. If G2 is downstream, knocking out G2 masks the effects of upstream genes. However, if G2 is upstream, this knockout prevents downstream genes from acting.

The task mentions at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Possibly, G2 is the transcription factor activating G1 and/or G3. Let’s consider this.

If G2 is upstream, in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would express, making resistance wholly dependent on G2. With g2 alone at 0% resistance, it shows resistance vanishes without G2. Yet, single mutants of G1 and G3 retain some resistance. Therefore, it seems G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 function. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3, then without G2, neither get expressed. However, in single mutants, such as g1, G2 and G3 remain present. If G2 activates G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 remains active, but resistance is 75%, less than the wild type. It suggests G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2 but function in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, G2 might be in a linear pathway with G1 and G3. For instance, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. Yet, with a G2 knockout, G1 and G3 can't function. Conversely, for single mutants, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance at 75% implies G1 contributes but isn’t solely crucial. If G2 is upstream, in g1, G3 might still be active. Thus, if G2 activates G1 and G3 working in parallel, with wild-type having both active. In g1 knockout, G3 remains active (at 50%?), but here resistance is at 75%.

Alternatively, G2 might be the main gene, with G1 and G3 modifying its effect. The data shows g2 alone at 0%, so without G2, no resistance exists. Then, in g1 mutant (75%), suggesting a partial reduction, G1 might enhance G2’s resistance effect. However, if G2 is absent, G1 can't act. Thus in g1 mutant, G2 continues to function, yet resistance is 75%, so G1 contributes 25% of resistance. Similarly, G3 contributes 50%. Yet, knocking out both G1 and G3, the expected resistance would be 25% (100 - 25 - 50 = 25?), but the data shows g1g3 is at 10%, indicating lower resistance than either single mutant. This challenges additive effects assumption. It may be that they act in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3, though the data suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, these genes might function in separate pathways, with G2 being involved in both. But how?

Regarding the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 were in parallel pathways, the double mutant might have a product of their resistances. For example, if G1 contributes 25% (due to a 75% resistance loss) and G3 50% (due to a 50% loss), their combined effect might be 75% * 50% = 37.5%. The actual is 10%, much lower, implying they may act within the same pathway. If G1 and G3 are within the same pathway, the double mutant should match the more severe single mutant. However, g3 is 50%, so the double mutant should have...

Hmm, that\'s conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that requires both to function. So if either is knocked out, the pathway is partially active, but if both are knocked out, it\'s almost gone. But that would mean that the double mutant has lower resistance than either single, which matches the data (g1g3 is 10%). So maybe G1 and G3 work together in a pathway, and G2 is in a separate pathway. But then, why does g2 have 0% resistance? Because G2\'s pathway is completely responsible for resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, the other pathway (G1 and G3) is still active. But in the data, g2 is 0%, so maybe that\'s not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps G2 is required for the function of both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance. Then, in the single mutants of G1 or G3, the other genes (G2 and the remaining) can still function. Let\'s see:\n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%. If G2 is knocked out (g2), then neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, so resistance is 0%. In the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance is 50% (from G3). Wait, but in the data, g3 alone is 50%, so that matches. But in the data, g1 alone is 75%. Hmm, that doesn\'t fit. If G2 is active in g1, then G3 is active, providing 50% resistance, but the data says g1 is 75%. That discrepancy suggests that maybe G1 also contributes when G3 is active. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 both contribute additively when G2 is active. So in the wild type, G2 is active, allowing both G1 and G3 to contribute. So total resistance is G1 + G3. If G1 is knocked out, then only G3 contributes (50%), but in the data, g1 is 75%. That doesn\'t add up. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both require G2. So G2 is upstream of both. Then, in g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is active (50%), and maybe G1\'s pathway is partially active? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is part of a separate pathway. Let\'s consider that there are two pathways: one involving G2, and another involving G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, the G2 pathway is gone (0%), but the G1/G3 pathway is still active. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which would mean that the G1/G3 pathway doesn\'t contribute anything. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, their pathway is partially active. For example, in g1, the G3 part is active (50%), and the G2 pathway is active (100%), so total might be 100% +50% =150%? That doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, the pathways are additive. So wild type has both pathways: G2 (100%) and G1/G3 (say 50% +25% =75%). But the total is 100%, so maybe they are not additive but the maximum of the two. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let\'s approach this systematically. The key is to determine the epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of the A mutant masks the effect of B. So if A is upstream, then knocking out A would mean that B can\'t function. So the double mutant A-B- would have the same phenotype as A-.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- g1g2: 0%. g2 alone is 0%, so adding g1 doesn\'t change it. So g2 is epistatic to g1. That suggests that G2 is downstream of G1, or that G2\'s function is required for G1\'s effect. Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. Because if you knock out G2, the mutation in G1 doesn\'t matter. So the pathway is G1 -> G2. So knocking out G2 would block the pathway regardless of G1. Similarly, in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is downstream.\n\nSimilarly, g2g3: 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. That would suggest that G2 is the terminal gene in a pathway where G1 and G3 act upstream. But how do G1 and G3 interact?\n\nLooking at g1g3: 10%. This is lower than either single mutant (g1=75%, g3=50%). If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2 activation, then the double mutant would have a combined effect. But the wild type is 100%, so maybe each contributes a part. If G1 is responsible for 25% (since g1 is 75%, so 25% loss) and G3 is responsible for 50% (50% loss), together they might account for 75% (25+50), but the double mutant is 10%, which is way lower. Alternatively, maybe they function in a linear pathway where both are required. For example, G1 -> G3 -> G2. So if either G1 or G3 is knocked out, G2 can\'t be activated. But in that case, the single mutants g1 and g3 would both have 0% resistance, which they don\'t. So that\'s not the case.\n\nAlternatively, G1 and G3 might function in separate pathways that both contribute to activating G2. So if either G1 or G3 is active, G2 can be partially activated. But in the double mutant g1g3, neither can activate G2, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. Let\'s see: if in wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to G2\'s activation. So knocking out G1 reduces G2\'s activity to 75%, and knocking out G3 reduces it to 50%. If they are additive, then the double mutant would have 75% *50% =37.5%, but it\'s 10%. Maybe they are multiplicative in another way. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both required for G2\'s full function. So G2\'s activity depends on both G1 and G3. So if either is missing, G2 is partially active, but if both are missing, G2 is barely active. That could explain why g1g3 has 10% resistance (maybe some residual G2 activity). But how does that fit with the single mutants?\n\nWait, but in the single mutants g1 and g3, the resistance is 75% and 50%, which would represent the remaining activity of G2 when either G1 or G3 is missing. If both are missing, G2\'s activity drops to 10%. Then, G2\'s activity is dependent on both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream, and requires both G1 and G3 for its function. But then, why does knocking out G2 alone result in 0%? Because even if G1 and G3 are present, without G2, there\'s no resistance. That makes sense. So G2 is the key gene that requires both G1 and G3 to be active. So the pathway is G1 and G3 both acting upstream of G2. So G2 is the transcription factor that is regulated by both G1 and G3. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Wait, but in this case, G2 would be downstream. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates other genes, but in this case, the data suggests that G2 is essential because its knockout leads to 0% resistance. So perhaps G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are modifiers that enhance its function. For example, G1 and G3 might enhance the expression or activity of G2. So in the wild type, G2 is active, and G1 and G3 make it more effective. If G1 is knocked out, G2 is still active but at 75% efficiency. If G3 is knocked out, G2 is at 50% efficiency. If both are knocked out, G2 is at 10% efficiency. But why would the double mutant of G1 and G3 lead to such a low efficiency? Maybe G1 and G3 have additive effects on G2\'s activity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are co-factors or part of a complex with G2. So knocking out G1 or G3 reduces the effectiveness of G2, and knocking out both severely impairs it. But then, why does g2 alone have 0%? Because without G2, the complex can\'t form. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, the complex is partially functional. That could explain the data. For example, in the wild type, G2 works with G1 and G3. Without G1, G2 and G3 can still work but at 75% efficiency. Without G3, G2 and G1 work at 50%. Without both, G2 alone works at 10%. But without G2, nothing works (0%). This would fit the data. In this case, G2 is the essential transcription factor, and G1 and G3 enhance its activity. So the conclusion would be that G2 is the main transcription factor, and G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways to enhance G2\'s function. Therefore, the interactions are that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2 is downstream and essential, while G1 and G3 modify its effectiveness.\n\nAlternatively, another way: G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. Wait, but in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there\'s still some resistance. If G2 were required for their function, then knocking out G1 would have no effect beyond what G2 provides. But in the data, g1 has 75%, which is less than wild type but more than g2. So maybe G1 and G3 contribute independently of G2. But that doesn\'t fit because g2 is 0%.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let\'s try to map out possible pathways.\n\nOption 1: Linear pathway where G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G1 -> G2 and G3 -> G2. If either G1 or G3 is knocked out, G2\'s activity is reduced. But without G2, resistance is 0%. So in this case:\n\n- g1: G3 can activate G2 partially, leading to 75% resistance.\n- g3: G1 can activate G2 partially, leading to 50% resistance.\n- g1g3: Neither can activate G2, so G2 is not active, leading to 0%. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So this doesn\'t fit.\n\nOption 2: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn contribute to resistance. So the pathway is G2 -> G1 and G2 -> G3. Then:\n\n- In g2 mutant: Both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance is 0%.\n- In g1 mutant: G2 activates G3, so resistance is 50% (from G3).\n- In g3 mutant: G2 activates G1, so resistance is 75% (from G1).\n- In g1g3 mutant: Neither G1 nor G3, so resistance is 0%. But the data says 10%, so this doesn\'t fit.\n\nOption 3: G1 and G3 are in a pathway that requires G2. For example, G1 and G3 function in a pathway that is regulated by G2. So G2 is upstream, activating both G1 and G3. Then:\n\n- g2 mutant: No activation of G1 or G3, so resistance 0%.\n- g1 mutant: G3 is active (50%).\n- g3 mutant: G1 is active (75%).\n- g1g3 mutant: Neither, so 0%. But data says 10%, so again discrepancy.\n\nOption 4: G2 is part of a separate pathway from G1 and G3. So there are two pathways: one involving G2, and another involving G1 and G3. In the wild type, both contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, only the G1/G3 pathway remains. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which would mean the G1/G3 pathway doesn\'t contribute. But in reality, g1 and g3 mutants have reduced resistance, suggesting that those genes do contribute. So this might not fit.\n\nOption 5: G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. For example, G2 encodes a protein that is necessary for G1 and G3 to function. So in g2 mutant, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can\'t work. But in g1 or g3 mutants, the other gene can still function with G2. So:\n\n- g2: 0% (no G1/G3 function)\n- g1: G3 works with G2, so 50%\n- g3: G1 works with G2, so 75%\n- g1g3: Neither works, so 0%, but data says 10%. Hmm, close but not matching.\n\nBut the data shows g1g3 has 10% resistance. Maybe there\'s a residual pathway independent of G1, G2, G3? But the problem states that these are the candidate genes, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe the 10% is due to experimental error or another minor factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 enhance its function through separate mechanisms. So in the absence of G1, G2\'s effectiveness is reduced by 25%, and in the absence of G3, by 50%. If both are absent, G2\'s effectiveness is 10%, which is multiplicative: 75% * 50% =37.5%, but it\'s 10%, so maybe it\'s additive in some other way. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the relationship is that G1 and G3 are both required for the full function of G2. So G2\'s activity is 100% only when both G1 and G3 are present. If G1 is missing, G2\'s activity drops to 75%, if G3 is missing, to 50%, and if both are missing, to 10%. Then, the resistance is directly proportional to G2\'s activity. In this case, G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are co-factors that enhance G2\'s activity. This would explain why g2 is 0% (no G2 at all), and the single mutants have reduced G2 activity. The double mutant g1g3 has very low G2 activity (10%). This would mean that G1 and G3 are both upstream regulators of G2, enhancing its transcription or activity. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, but in this case, G1 and G3 would be upstream of G2. But if G2 is a transcription factor, it would typically regulate other genes, not be regulated by them. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps G1 is the transcription factor that regulates G2 and G3. Let\'s explore this. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates both G2 and G3, then:\n\n- In g1 mutant: Both G2 and G3 are not expressed. So resistance would be 0%. But the data says g1 is 75%, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, G1 activates G2, and G2 activates G3. So pathway G1 -> G2 -> G3. Then:\n\n- g1: No G2 or G3, resistance 0%. But data says 75%.\n- Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2 and G1. But in g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, which would mean G1 and G2 are still active. But g2 mutant is 0%, so if G3 regulates G2, then g3 mutant would have G2 not expressed, leading to 0%, which contradicts the data (g3 is 50%).\n\nThis is tricky. Let\'s go back to the epistasis analysis. The key is that in double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. This means that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. In other words, G2\'s function is downstream of G1 and G3. So the pathway is G1 and G3 both feeding into G2. Therefore, knocking out G2 renders the contributions of G1 and G3 irrelevant, hence the double mutants with g2 have the same phenotype as g2 alone.\n\nNow, for the g1g3 double mutant, which is 10%, lower than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2\'s activity. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, G2\'s activity is almost gone (10%), but not completely. Whereas in the absence of G2, it\'s completely gone (0%). So G1 and G3 each contribute to G2\'s function. For example, G1 and G3 might be co-activators of G2. In the wild type, both are present, so G2 is fully active (100%). If G1 is missing, G2\'s activity is reduced to 75%, and if G3 is missing, to 50%. If both are missing, G2\'s activity is 10%. Therefore, the resistance level corresponds to G2\'s activity, which depends on G1 and G3.\n\nIn this model, G2 is the key gene whose activity is modulated by G1 and G3. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 could be the transcription factor that is regulated by G1 and G3. However, typically, transcription factors are upstream. Alternatively, G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor regulating G2. For example, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, then in g1 mutant, G2 isn\'t expressed, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G2 is still partially active. So maybe G1 and G3 both regulate G2\'s expression. If G1 and G3 are both transcription factors that activate G2\'s expression, then knocking out either would reduce G2\'s expression, and knocking out both would reduce it further. This fits with the data:\n\n- Wild type: G1 and G3 activate G2 fully → 100% resistance.\n- g1: Only G3 activates G2 → G2 expression at 50% → resistance 50%, but data says 75%. Hmm, doesn\'t fit.\n  \nAlternatively, G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are cofactors that enhance its activity. For example, G2 needs to form a complex with G1 and G3 to be active. If G1 is missing, the complex is 75% active; if G3 is missing, 50% active; if both missing, 10%. But how does that work biologically? Maybe G1 and G3 modify G2\'s activity through post-translational modifications or by forming a complex.\n\nAnother angle: the resistance contributed by each gene is additive. So:\n\nWild type: 100% = G1 (25%) + G2 (50%) + G3 (25%)? No, because the single mutants don\'t add up. For example, g1 is 75%, which would mean G2 + G3 contribute 75%, but g2 is 0% and g3 is 50%. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAlternatively, the resistance is multiplicative. For example, each gene contributes a certain percentage, and the total is the product. But 0.75 * 0.5 * 1.0 (assuming G2 is not in this model) doesn\'t make sense.\n\nI think the most plausible explanation is that G2 is the central gene, epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning it\'s downstream. G1 and G3 act in separate pathways that both contribute to the activation or function of G2. So in the absence of G1, G2\'s activity is reduced to 75%, and in the absence of G3, to 50%. When both are absent, G2\'s activity is 10%. And if G2 itself is absent, activity is 0%. Therefore, G2 is the key gene, and G1 and G3 are upstream modulators of G2\'s function. Since at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, it\'s possible that G1 or G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2. But given that G2 is essential (g2 is 0%), and the others are modifiers, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are cofactors or part of the pathway that activates G2.\n\nBut the problem states that "at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)". So G1, G2, or G3 is a transcription factor upstream of the others. If G2 is downstream, then G1 or G3 must be the transcription factor. For example, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2 and G3. Then:\n\n- In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance would be 0%, but data says 75%. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAlternatively, G3 is the transcription factor activating G2. Then g3 mutant would have G2 not expressed, resistance 0%, but data says 50%. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is the transcription factor activating G1 and G3. Then in g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren\'t expressed, resistance 0% (matches data). In g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is higher. But data says g1 is 75%, which would mean that G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50%. So total resistance is G1 (25%) + G3 (50%) + G2 (25%)? Not sure. But if G2 is the transcription factor, then knocking out G2 removes all downstream genes, but the single mutants of G1 and G3 have reduced resistance, implying that G1 and G3 contribute even when G2 is active. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the transcription factor is G1. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2 and G3. Then:\n\n- In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance would be 0%, but data says 75%. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAlternatively, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, and G2 activates G3. Then:\n\n- g1: No G2 or G3 → resistance 0% (doesn\'t match data).\n- g2: No G3 → resistance 0% (matches data).\n- g3: Resistance 50% (but in this model, G3 is downstream of G2, so knocking out G3 would not affect G2. If G2 is active, resistance would be 100% (if G3 is not part of the pathway), but data says 50%. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nI\'m going in circles. Let\'s summarize the key points:\n\n- G2 is essential; its knockout leads to 0% resistance.\n- G1 and G3 contribute additively but not completely; their double mutant has lower resistance than either alone.\n- Double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have the same as g2 alone (0%), indicating G2 is epistatic.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 acts downstream of both. Additionally, G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that contribute to the activation or enhancement of G2\'s function. Therefore, G2 is the key gene required for resistance, and G1 and G3 are upstream components that modulate G2\'s effectiveness. Since at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, it\'s likely that either G1 or G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2. However, based on the data, G2\'s absolute requirement suggests it might be the transcription factor itself, but typically transcription factors are upstream. Alternatively, G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor that regulates G2. Given that knocking out G1 or G3 reduces but doesn\'t eliminate resistance, they might be cofactors or enhancers of G2, which is the main effector gene.\n\nBut the question asks which conclusion can be drawn regarding the genes\' interaction. The key conclusion is the epistatic relationships. Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, G2 must function downstream of both. Therefore, the interaction is that G2 is downstream in the pathway, and both G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2\'s function. Additionally, since the double mutant of G1 and G3 has a synergistic effect (lower than additive), they likely act in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2\'s activity. Hence, the genetic pathway is such that G1 and G3 independently contribute to the activation of G2, which is essential for resistance.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385710, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6157, prompt_tokens=1793, total_tokens=7950, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The experimental results indicate the following genetic interactions and conclusions:

1. **Epistatic Relationships**:  
   - **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**. This is evident because:  
     - Double mutants involving *g2* (*g1g2*, *g2g3*) show **0% resistance**, identical to the *g2* single mutant.  
     - This implies that G2 acts **downstream** of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. If G2 is non-functional, the contributions of G1 and G3 are irrelevant.  

2. **Role of G1 and G3**:  
   - **G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways** that converge to enhance G2's function.  
     - The *g1* mutant retains 75% resistance, and the *g3* mutant retains 50%, suggesting they independently contribute to G2's activity.  
     - The *g1g3* double mutant (10% resistance) shows a **synergistic effect**, indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant but instead work cooperatively to maintain G2's full activity.  

3. **Hierarchy of Function**:  
   - **G2 is the critical gene** for resistance. Its knockout abolishes resistance entirely (0%), suggesting it is indispensable as the terminal effector in the pathway.  
   - **G1 and G3 modulate G2's effectiveness**:  
     - G1 enhances G2's activity by ~25% (wild-type resistance is 100%, *g1* mutant is 75%).  
     - G3 enhances G2's activity by ~50% (wild-type resistance is 100%, *g3* mutant is 50%).  
     - Together, G1 and G3 amplify G2's function, as their combined loss reduces resistance to 10%.  

4. **Transcription Factor Inference**:  
   - The problem states that **at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream**. Given the data:  
     - **G1 or G3 is likely the transcription factor** regulating G2. For example, G1 or G3 could activate G2's expression or modify its activity.  
     - G2 itself is unlikely to be the transcription factor since it acts downstream as the key effector.  

**Conclusion**:  
G2 is the central gene required for anthracnose resistance, functioning downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways to enhance G2's activity, with G2 being epistatic to both. At least one of G1 or G3 is a transcription factor upstream of G2, regulating its function.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

be 50% if they are in the same pathway, but it's 10%. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that requires both to function. So if either is knocked out, the pathway is partially active, but if both are knocked out, it's almost gone. But that would mean that the double mutant has lower resistance than either single, which matches the data (g1g3 is 10%). So maybe G1 and G3 work together in a pathway, and G2 is in a separate pathway. But then, why does g2 have 0% resistance? Because G2's pathway is completely responsible for resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, the other pathway (G1 and G3) is still active. But in the data, g2 is 0%, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps G2 is required for the function of both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance. Then, in the single mutants of G1 or G3, the other genes (G2 and the remaining) can still function. Let's see:

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%. If G2 is knocked out (g2), then neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, so resistance is 0%. In the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance is 50% (from G3). Wait, but in the data, g3 alone is 50%, so that matches. But in the data, g1 alone is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit. If G2 is active in g1, then G3 is active, providing 50% resistance, but the data says g1 is 75%. That discrepancy suggests that maybe G1 also contributes when G3 is active. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 both contribute additively when G2 is active. So in the wild type, G2 is active, allowing both G1 and G3 to contribute. So total resistance is G1 + G3. If G1 is knocked out, then only G3 contributes (50%), but in the data, g1 is 75%. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both require G2. So G2 is upstream of both. Then, in g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is active (50%), and maybe G1's pathway is partially active? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is part of a separate pathway. Let's consider that there are two pathways: one involving G2, and another involving G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, the G2 pathway is gone (0%), but the G1/G3 pathway is still active. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which would mean that the G1/G3 pathway doesn't contribute anything. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, their pathway is partially active. For example, in g1, the G3 part is active (50%), and the G2 pathway is active (100%), so total might be 100% +50% =150%? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the pathways are additive. So wild type has both pathways: G2 (100%) and G1/G3 (say 50% +25% =75%). But the total is 100%, so maybe they are not additive but the maximum of the two. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's approach this systematically. The key is to determine the epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of the A mutant masks the effect of B. So if A is upstream, then knocking out A would mean that B can't function. So the double mutant A-B- would have the same phenotype as A-.

Looking at the data:

- g1g2: 0%. g2 alone is 0%, so adding g1 doesn't change it. So g2 is epistatic to g1. That suggests that G2 is downstream of G1, or that G2's function is required for G1's effect. Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. Because if you knock out G2, the mutation in G1 doesn't matter. So the pathway is G1 -> G2. So knocking out G2 would block the pathway regardless of G1. Similarly, in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is downstream.

Similarly, g2g3: 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. That would suggest that G2 is the terminal gene in a pathway where G1 and G3 act upstream. But how do G1 and G3 interact?

Looking at g1g3: 10%. This is lower than either single mutant (g1=75%, g3=50%). If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2 activation, then the double mutant would have a combined effect. But the wild type is 100%, so maybe each contributes a part. If G1 is responsible for 25% (since g1 is 75%, so 25% loss) and G3 is responsible for 50% (50% loss), together they might account for 75% (25+50), but the double mutant is 10%, which is way lower. Alternatively, maybe they function in a linear pathway where both are required. For example, G1 -> G3 -> G2. So if either G1 or G3 is knocked out, G2 can't be activated. But in that case, the single mutants g1 and g3 would both have 0% resistance, which they don't. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 might function in separate pathways that both contribute to activating G2. So if either G1 or G3 is active, G2 can be partially activated. But in the double mutant g1g3, neither can activate G2, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. Let's see: if in wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to G2's activation. So knocking out G1 reduces G2's activity to 75%, and knocking out G3 reduces it to 50%. If they are additive, then the double mutant would have 75% *50% =37.5%, but it's 10%. Maybe they are multiplicative in another way. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both required for G2's full function. So G2's activity depends on both G1 and G3. So if either is missing, G2 is partially active, but if both are missing, G2 is barely active. That could explain why g1g3 has 10% resistance (maybe some residual G2 activity). But how does that fit with the single mutants?

Wait, but in the single mutants g1 and g3, the resistance is 75% and 50%, which would represent the remaining activity of G2 when either G1 or G3 is missing. If both are missing, G2's activity drops to 10%. Then, G2's activity is dependent on both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream, and requires both G1 and G3 for its function. But then, why does knocking out G2 alone result in 0%? Because even if G1 and G3 are present, without G2, there's no resistance. That makes sense. So G2 is the key gene that requires both G1 and G3 to be active. So the pathway is G1 and G3 both acting upstream of G2. So G2 is the transcription factor that is regulated by both G1 and G3. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Wait, but in this case, G2 would be downstream. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates other genes, but in this case, the data suggests that G2 is essential because its knockout leads to 0% resistance. So perhaps G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are modifiers that enhance its function. For example, G1 and G3 might enhance the expression or activity of G2. So in the wild type, G2 is active, and G1 and G3 make it more effective. If G1 is knocked out, G2 is still active but at 75% efficiency. If G3 is knocked out, G2 is at 50% efficiency. If both are knocked out, G2 is at 10% efficiency. But why would the double mutant of G1 and G3 lead to such a low efficiency? Maybe G1 and G3 have additive effects on G2's activity. But how?

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are co-factors or part of a complex with G2. So knocking out G1 or G3 reduces the effectiveness of G2, and knocking out both severely impairs it. But then, why does g2 alone have 0%? Because without G2, the complex can't form. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, the complex is partially functional. That could explain the data. For example, in the wild type, G2 works with G1 and G3. Without G1, G2 and G3 can still work but at 75% efficiency. Without G3, G2 and G1 work at 50%. Without both, G2 alone works at 10%. But without G2, nothing works (0%). This would fit the data. In this case, G2 is the essential transcription factor, and G1 and G3 enhance its activity. So the conclusion would be that G2 is the main transcription factor, and G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways to enhance G2's function. Therefore, the interactions are that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2 is downstream and essential, while G1 and G3 modify its effectiveness.

Alternatively, another way: G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. Wait, but in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there's still some resistance. If G2 were required for their function, then knocking out G1 would have no effect beyond what G2 provides. But in the data, g1 has 75%, which is less than wild type but more than g2. So maybe G1 and G3 contribute independently of G2. But that doesn't fit because g2 is 0%.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to map out possible pathways.

Option 1: Linear pathway where G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G1 -> G2 and G3 -> G2. If either G1 or G3 is knocked out, G2's activity is reduced. But without G2, resistance is 0%. So in this case:

- g1: G3 can activate G2 partially, leading to 75% resistance.
- g3: G1 can activate G2 partially, leading to 50% resistance.
- g1g3: Neither can activate G2, so G2 is not active, leading to 0%. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So this doesn't fit.

Option 2: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn contribute to resistance. So the pathway is G2 -> G1 and G2 -> G3. Then:

- In g2 mutant: Both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance is 0%.
- In g1 mutant: G2 activates G3, so resistance is 50% (from G3).
- In g3 mutant: G2 activates G1, so resistance is 75% (from G1).
- In g1g3 mutant: Neither G1 nor G3, so resistance is 0%. But the data says 10%, so this doesn't fit.

Option 3: G1 and G3 are in a pathway that requires G2. For example, G1 and G3 function in a pathway that is regulated by G2. So G2 is upstream, activating both G1 and G3. Then:

- g2 mutant: No activation of G1 or G3, so resistance 0%.
- g1 mutant: G3 is active (50%).
- g3 mutant: G1 is active (75%).
- g1g3 mutant: Neither, so 0%. But data says 10%, so again discrepancy.

Option 4: G2 is part of a separate pathway from G1 and G3. So there are two pathways: one involving G2, and another involving G1 and G3. In the wild type, both contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, only the G1/G3 pathway remains. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which would mean the G1/G3 pathway doesn't contribute. But in reality, g1 and g3 mutants have reduced resistance, suggesting that those genes do contribute. So this might not fit.

Option 5: G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. For example, G2 encodes a protein that is necessary for G1 and G3 to function. So in g2 mutant, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't work. But in g1 or g3 mutants, the other gene can still function with G2. So:

- g2: 0% (no G1/G3 function)
- g1: G3 works with G2, so 50%
- g3: G1 works with G2, so 75%
- g1g3: Neither works, so 0%, but data says 10%. Hmm, close but not matching.

But the data shows g1g3 has 10% resistance. Maybe there's a residual pathway independent of G1, G2, G3? But the problem states that these are the candidate genes, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe the 10% is due to experimental error or another minor factor.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 enhance its function through separate mechanisms. So in the absence of G1, G2's effectiveness is reduced by 25%, and in the absence of G3, by 50%. If both are absent, G2's effectiveness is 10%, which is multiplicative: 75% * 50% =37.5%, but it's 10%, so maybe it's additive in some other way. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the relationship is that G1 and G3 are both required for the full function of G2. So G2's activity is 100% only when both G1 and G3 are present. If G1 is missing, G2's activity drops to 75%, if G3 is missing, to 50%, and if both are missing, to 10%. Then, the resistance is directly proportional to G2's activity. In this case, G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are co-factors that enhance G2's activity. This would explain why g2 is 0% (no G2 at all), and the single mutants have reduced G2 activity. The double mutant g1g3 has very low G2 activity (10%). This would mean that G1 and G3 are both upstream regulators of G2, enhancing its transcription or activity. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, but in this case, G1 and G3 would be upstream of G2. But if G2 is a transcription factor, it would typically regulate other genes, not be regulated by them. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G1 is the transcription factor that regulates G2 and G3. Let's explore this. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates both G2 and G3, then:

- In g1 mutant: Both G2 and G3 are not expressed. So resistance would be 0%. But the data says g1 is 75%, which contradicts this.

Alternatively, G1 activates G2, and G2 activates G3. So pathway G1 -> G2 -> G3. Then:

- g1: No G2 or G3, resistance 0%. But data says 75%.
- Not matching.

Alternatively, G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2 and G1. But in g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, which would mean G1 and G2 are still active. But g2 mutant is 0%, so if G3 regulates G2, then g3 mutant would have G2 not expressed, leading to 0%, which contradicts the data (g3 is 50%).

This is tricky. Let's go back to the epistasis analysis. The key is that in double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. This means that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. In other words, G2's function is downstream of G1 and G3. So the pathway is G1 and G3 both feeding into G2. Therefore, knocking out G2 renders the contributions of G1 and G3 irrelevant, hence the double mutants with g2 have the same phenotype as g2 alone.

Now, for the g1g3 double mutant, which is 10%, lower than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2's activity. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, G2's activity is almost gone (10%), but not completely. Whereas in the absence of G2, it's completely gone (0%). So G1 and G3 each contribute to G2's function. For example, G1 and G3 might be co-activators of G2. In the wild type, both are present, so G2 is fully active (100%). If G1 is missing, G2's activity is reduced to 75%, and if G3 is missing, to 50%. If both are missing, G2's activity is 10%. Therefore, the resistance level corresponds to G2's activity, which depends on G1 and G3.

In this model, G2 is the key gene whose activity is modulated by G1 and G3. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 could be the transcription factor that is regulated by G1 and G3. However, typically, transcription factors are upstream. Alternatively, G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor regulating G2. For example, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, then in g1 mutant, G2 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G2 is still partially active. So maybe G1 and G3 both regulate G2's expression. If G1 and G3 are both transcription factors that activate G2's expression, then knocking out either would reduce G2's expression, and knocking out both would reduce it further. This fits with the data:

- Wild type: G1 and G3 activate G2 fully → 100% resistance.
- g1: Only G3 activates G2 → G2 expression at 50% → resistance 50%, but data says 75%. Hmm, doesn't fit.
  
Alternatively, G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are cofactors that enhance its activity. For example, G2 needs to form a complex with G1 and G3 to be active. If G1 is missing, the complex is 75% active; if G3 is missing, 50% active; if both missing, 10%. But how does that work biologically? Maybe G1 and G3 modify G2's activity through post-translational modifications or by forming a complex.

Another angle: the resistance contributed by each gene is additive. So:

Wild type: 100% = G1 (25%) + G2 (50%) + G3 (25%)? No, because the single mutants don't add up. For example, g1 is 75%, which would mean G2 + G3 contribute 75%, but g2 is 0% and g3 is 50%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the resistance is multiplicative. For example, each gene contributes a certain percentage, and the total is the product. But 0.75 * 0.5 * 1.0 (assuming G2 is not in this model) doesn't make sense.

I think the most plausible explanation is that G2 is the central gene, epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream. G1 and G3 act in separate pathways that both contribute to the activation or function of G2. So in the absence of G1, G2's activity is reduced to 75%, and in the absence of G3, to 50%. When both are absent, G2's activity is 10%. And if G2 itself is absent, activity is 0%. Therefore, G2 is the key gene, and G1 and G3 are upstream modulators of G2's function. Since at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, it's possible that G1 or G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2. But given that G2 is essential (g2 is 0%), and the others are modifiers, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are cofactors or part of the pathway that activates G2.

But the problem states that "at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)". So G1, G2, or G3 is a transcription factor upstream of the others. If G2 is downstream, then G1 or G3 must be the transcription factor. For example, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2 and G3. Then:

- In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance would be 0%, but data says 75%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G3 is the transcription factor activating G2. Then g3 mutant would have G2 not expressed, resistance 0%, but data says 50%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is the transcription factor activating G1 and G3. Then in g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, resistance 0% (matches data). In g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is higher. But data says g1 is 75%, which would mean that G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50%. So total resistance is G1 (25%) + G3 (50%) + G2 (25%)? Not sure. But if G2 is the transcription factor, then knocking out G2 removes all downstream genes, but the single mutants of G1 and G3 have reduced resistance, implying that G1 and G3 contribute even when G2 is active. This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the transcription factor is G1. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2 and G3. Then:

- In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are not expressed. Resistance would be 0%, but data says 75%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, and G2 activates G3. Then:

- g1: No G2 or G3 → resistance 0% (doesn't match data).
- g2: No G3 → resistance 0% (matches data).
- g3: Resistance 50% (but in this model, G3 is downstream of G2, so knocking out G3 would not affect G2. If G2 is active, resistance would be 100% (if G3 is not part of the pathway), but data says 50%. Doesn't fit.

I'm going in circles. Let's summarize the key points:

- G2 is essential; its knockout leads to 0% resistance.
- G1 and G3 contribute additively but not completely; their double mutant has lower resistance than either alone.
- Double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have the same as g2 alone (0%), indicating G2 is epistatic.

Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 acts downstream of both. Additionally, G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that contribute to the activation or enhancement of G2's function. Therefore, G2 is the key gene required for resistance, and G1 and G3 are upstream components that modulate G2's effectiveness. Since at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, it's likely that either G1 or G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2. However, based on the data, G2's absolute requirement suggests it might be the transcription factor itself, but typically transcription factors are upstream. Alternatively, G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor that regulates G2. Given that knocking out G1 or G3 reduces but doesn't eliminate resistance, they might be cofactors or enhancers of G2, which is the main effector gene.

But the question asks which conclusion can be drawn regarding the genes' interaction. The key conclusion is the epistatic relationships. Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, G2 must function downstream of both. Therefore, the interaction is that G2 is downstream in the pathway, and both G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2's function. Additionally, since the double mutant of G1 and G3 has a synergistic effect (lower than additive), they likely act in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2's activity. Hence, the genetic pathway is such that G1 and G3 independently contribute to the activation of G2, which is essential for resistance.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn about the genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is a critical upstream regulator (likely the transcription factor)**:
   - The **g2 single mutant** shows **0% resistance**, indicating G2 is essential for resistance. 
   - All double mutants involving **g2 (g1g2, g2g3)** also show **0% resistance**, confirming that G2’s function cannot be bypassed by other genes. This **epistatic relationship** suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3.

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively but are dependent on G2**:
   - **g1 (75%)** and **g3 (50%)** single mutants retain partial resistance, implying they function in pathways partially redundant to each other but still require G2 for activation.
   - The **g1g3 double mutant (10%)** shows a **synergistic reduction in resistance** (much lower than the product of individual effects: 75% × 50% = 37.5%), suggesting G1 and G3 act in overlapping or cooperative pathways downstream of G2. Their combined loss severely compromises residual resistance.

3. **Genetic hierarchy**:
   - **G2** is the master regulator (transcription factor) required to activate resistance pathways involving **G1** and **G3**. 
   - **G1 and G3** act in parallel or partially overlapping pathways downstream of G2 to enhance resistance. Neither can fully compensate for the loss of G2, but their combined loss (g1g3) further diminishes resistance even when G2 is functional.

### Summary of Interactions:
- **G2 → G1** and **G2 → G3**: G2 regulates both G1 and G3.
- **G1 and G3** contribute additively/synergistically to resistance but are non-essential if G2 is absent (epistasis).

This hierarchy explains why knocking out G2 alone abolishes resistance entirely, while knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance proportionally, and their combined knockout exacerbates the phenotype.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, since G2 is already non-functional in the double mutants involving g2, those combinations show 0%.

Putting this together, G2 is likely the key transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. When G2 is non-functional, resistance is entirely lost (0%), indicating G1 and G3 can't compensate. In the absence of G2, the presence or absence of G1/G3 doesn't matter. However, when G2 is present (as in g1, g3, and g1g3 mutants), their individual contributions are additive but not entirely redundant. The g1g3 double mutant's lower resistance (10%) compared to individual mutants suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through partially overlapping pathways, and losing both reduces effectiveness further. However, since the presence of G2 is critical, even the double mutant g1g3 retains some residual resistance (10%) because G2 is still active and might have other downstream targets.

Therefore, the hierarchy likely places G2 as the upstream transcription factor regulating G1 and G3, which themselves act in parallel or additive pathways. The interaction between G1 and G3 might be synergistic or additive, but G2 is essential for any resistance, making it epistatic to both.

This is evident because:\n   - The **g2 single mutant (0% resistance)** abolishes resistance entirely, indicating G2 is indispensable.\n   - Double mutants involving **g2 (g1g2, g2g3)** also show **0% resistance**, identical to the g2 single mutant. This demonstrates that **G2 is epistatic** to G1 and G3; its knockout masks the effects of the other genes, as their contributions depend on G2 being functional.\n\n2. **G1 and G3 modulate G2’s activity** but are not strictly required for its function:\n   - In the **g1 mutant (75% resistance)** and **g3 mutant (50% resistance)**, resistance is reduced but not eliminated. This suggests G1 and G3 enhance G2’s effectiveness but are not essential if G2 is present.\n   - The **g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance)** shows a **synergistic effect**, implying G1 and G3 act in **partially redundant or overlapping pathways** that amplify G2’s function.

Its downstream position and critical role in resistance align with transcriptional regulation of other genes. G1 and G3 may act upstream to regulate G2’s expression or activity.\n\n### Summary:  \n**G2 is the central gene in the pathway**, functioning as a transcription factor required for resistance. **G1 and G3 act upstream** to enhance G2’s activity, but their absence only partially compromises resistance. The epistatic relationship (G2 > G1, G3) and synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 suggest a regulatory hierarchy where G2 integrates inputs from G1 and G3 to confer full resistance.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=" perhaps not. Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways but both contribute, their combined loss would be additive. But 50% (from G3) plus 25% (from G1) equals 75% loss, leading to 25% resistance. But the actual is 10%, which is even lower. This suggests synergistic interaction, meaning their combined effect is more than additive, which might imply they are in the same pathway but in a way that their combined knockout disrupts more steps. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant pathway where each can partially compensate for the other, so when both are absent, the effect is worse than additive.\n\nBut given that in the presence of G1, G3 contributes 50%, and vice versa, but together they contribute 10%, it's possible that the pathways are partially overlapping. Alternatively, G1 might act upstream of G3. If G1 is upstream, then in a g1 mutant, G3 cannot be activated. But in the data, g1 alone has 75% resistance, which is higher than the 50% in g3. If G1 were upstream of G3, then g1 should have lower resistance than g3. That’s not the case here. So maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then knocking out G3 would disable G1. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which is lower than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit either. Therefore, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.\n\nBut the key point here is the interaction between G2 and the others. Since all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis in the sense that the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3. If G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would mean that even if G1 and G3 are functional, their products cannot act because the downstream gene (G2) is missing. However, if G2 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed or activated. But in that case, the single mutants of G1 and G3 would still have some function if they are downstream. Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, but when G1 or G3 are knocked out, resistance is 75% or 50%, respectively. Therefore, if G2 were upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from working. However, when G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are still present, so if G2 activates G3, then G3 could still function. But in the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, so G3 is contributing 50% of the resistance. If G2 is upstream and activates G3, then in the absence of G3, G2's activation can't proceed, leading to 50% resistance. But in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 can't be activated, leading to 0%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is part of a separate pathway. Let's think in terms of gene pathways. Suppose there are two pathways contributing to resistance: one involving G2 and another involving both G1 and G3. If G2 is in a separate pathway, then knocking out G2 (0%) would remove that pathway's contribution. The other pathway (G1 and G3) would contribute the remaining resistance. But in the data, the wild-type has 100% resistance, so if G2's pathway contributes 100% and the G1/G3 pathway contributes 0%, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are a secondary pathway. For example, G2 contributes 50%, and G1 and G3 contribute 50%. But when G2 is knocked out, the remaining resistance would be from G1 and G3. However, in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, which contradicts this. So perhaps G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. That is, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, such that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. Thus, the resistance is entirely dependent on G2. However, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there is still some resistance. That suggests that G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that require G2's function. For example, G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. In the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are still active, so resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, and G2 is required for their activation). Wait, but in this model, if G2 is required for G1 and G3 expression, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is active, leading to G3 contributing 50% resistance, and G1's absence reduces resistance by 25%, resulting in 75%. Similarly, in the g3 mutant, G2 and G1 are active, so G1 contributes 75% (since 100% -25% =75%?), but the data shows g3 has 50% resistance. Hmm, this doesn't quite align. Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3, but they function in a linear pathway. For example, G2 activates G1, which activates G3. If G2 is knocked out, no activation occurs, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out, G2 can't activate G1, so G3 isn't activated, leading to 0% resistance. But this contradicts the data where g1 has 75% resistance. Therefore, this model is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 works in a pathway with G1 and G3 in parallel. Suppose that G2 is part of a primary pathway contributing 50% resistance, and G1 and G3 are part of another pathway contributing 50% resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, the primary pathway is gone, leaving the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) contributing 50%. However, the data shows that g2 has 0% resistance, which doesn't fit. So this model is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is required for both pathways. For example, G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, both pathways fail. If G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing 50% and 25% respectively, then in the absence of G2, both pathways are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But in the presence of G2, knocking out G1 would leave G3's pathway active, leading to 50% resistance (but data says 75% for g1). This inconsistency suggests another approach.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of additive vs. multiplicative effects. For example, if each gene contributes a certain amount, and their effects combine. But the double mutants show lower resistance than expected by additive or multiplicative. For instance, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so if additive, 75% +50% =125% which isn't possible. If multiplicative, 0.75 *0.5= 0.375 or 37.5%, but actual is 10%. This suggests a synergistic effect where the combination is worse than the product. This might indicate that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but in a way that their combined knockout disrupts more steps. However, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the data might suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Since any double mutant with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) results in 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic. In other words, the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of the other genes. If G2 is downstream, then even if G1 and G3 are functional, their effects can't be realized because G2 is missing. Alternatively, if G2 is upstream, disrupting it affects the downstream genes. But how does this explain the single mutants?\n\nWait, if G2 is downstream, then in the g1 mutant, G2 would still be functional. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. If G2 is downstream and is necessary for resistance, then knocking out G1 would reduce resistance only if G1 acts upstream of G2. For example, G1 → G2 → resistance. So in g1, G2 can't be activated, leading to lower resistance. But in this case, g1 would have the same resistance as g2. But in the data, g1 has 75%, while g2 has 0%. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, G2 might be in a separate pathway that's essential. If there are two pathways: one involving G2 (providing 100% resistance) and another involving G1 and G3 (providing some resistance). But if G2 is knocked out, that pathway fails (0% resistance), but the other pathway (G1 and G3) might still function. However, the data shows that g2 has 0% resistance, meaning even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't compensate. So perhaps the other pathway (G1 and G3) requires G2 to function. Therefore, G2 is necessary for both pathways. Hence, if G2 is knocked out, neither pathway works. However, if G1 is knocked out, the G2 pathway works (but provides 0%?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If G2 is part of both pathways, but G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that require G2, then knocking out G2 would disable all pathways. But in the single mutants, knocking out G1 or G3 would disable their respective pathways, but the G2 pathway would still function. However, the data shows that g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%, and g2 has 0%. So perhaps the G2 pathway provides 100% resistance, and the G1 and G3 pathways are redundant or contribute less. But this isn't matching the data.\n\nAlternatively, consider that G2 is the only gene providing resistance, and G1 and G3 somehow modulate its activity. For example, G1 and G3 might enhance G2's function. So in the wild-type, G2 is fully active with the help of G1 and G3. Knocking out G1 reduces G2's efficiency to 75%, knocking out G3 reduces it to 50%, and knocking out both G1 and G3 reduces it further. But in this case, the double mutants g1g3 would have lower resistance than either single mutant. The data shows g1g3 at 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). That seems possible. However, how does this explain the g2 mutant at 0%? Because if G2 is the main gene, then knocking it out would eliminate resistance entirely. So this model could work: G2 is the main gene responsible for resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance its activity. For example, G1 and G3 might be co-factors that boost G2's effectiveness. So in the wild-type, with all three, G2 works at 100%. If G1 is missing, G2 works at 75% efficiency; if G3 is missing, at 50%; and if both are missing, G2 works at 10% efficiency. However, this doesn't explain why g1g3 has 10% resistance. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that works in parallel to G2, but that doesn't fit the data where g2 is 0%.\n\nAlternatively, G2 could be a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance because all three genes (G2 itself and its targets G1 and G3) are non-functional. However, in the single mutants g1 and g3, their respective proteins are missing, but G2 is still present. If G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then knocking out G1 would mean that G2's other targets (like G3) are still active. So in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, leading to resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1, G3 would still be active. But the resistance in g1 is 75%, which is higher than in g3 (50%). This suggests that G3's contribution is more significant. However, if G3 is more important, then why does knocking out G1 reduce resistance less than knocking out G3? \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3. In this case, knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning (0% resistance). Knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from functioning, leading to lower resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%, which contradicts this model. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 should result in lower resistance than knocking out G3. Therefore, this model is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility is that G2 is part of a separate pathway that's essential, and G1 and G3 are in another pathway. If the G2 pathway contributes 50% resistance and the G1/G3 pathway contributes 50%. Then, knocking out G2 would leave the G1/G3 pathway active (50%), but the data shows g2 has 0% resistance. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't function. But in the presence of G2, knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance. For example, G2 is a transcription factor required for G1 and G3 expression. Then, in the wild-type, all three are active. In g1, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is 75% (G3 contributes 75% when G1 is missing). In g3, G2 and G1 are active, contributing 50% resistance. In g2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the double mutants g1g3, even though G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are missing, so resistance is only 10% (maybe a residual function). However, this model requires that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and contribute additively. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not just additive but have a synergistic effect when both are present. Alternatively, there might be a residual function when only one of them is missing, but when both are missing, the pathway is almost entirely disabled. But how does this fit with G2 being upstream?\n\nAlternatively, consider that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3. In this case:\n\n- Wild type: All active, 100% resistance.\n- g2: All inactive, 0% resistance.\n- g1: G2 active, G1 inactive, so G3 inactive. Resistance would be 0%, but data shows 75%, so this doesn't fit.\n- g3: G2 and G1 active, G3 inactive. Resistance would depend on G1 and G2. But data shows 50%, so perhaps G1 alone contributes 50% when G3 is missing. But how?\n\nThis model doesn't fit the data. Therefore, perhaps the pathway is different.\n\nAnother angle: since all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have 0% resistance (same as g2 alone), this suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis here means that the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3. If G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would render the upstream genes irrelevant. For example, if G1 and G3 produce signals that activate G2, which then confers resistance. So:\n\n- G1 and G3 → G2 → Resistance.\n\nIn this pathway, knocking out G2 (g2) would result in 0% resistance regardless of G1 and G3 status. Knocking out G1 (g1) would reduce the signal to G2, leading to lower resistance. Similarly, knocking out G3 (g3) would do the same. The double mutants g1g3 would have even less signal to G2, leading to lower resistance than either single mutant.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- g1: 75%\n- g3: 50%\n- g1g3: 10%\n\nIf G2's activity is dependent on G1 and G3, then in the wild-type, G2 is fully active (100%). In g1, G2's activity is reduced by 25%, leading to 75% resistance. In g3, G2's activity is reduced by 50%, leading to 50% resistance. In g1g3, G2's activity is reduced by 75% (25% + 50%), leading to 25% resistance. But the data shows 10%, which is lower than expected. However, this might be due to non-linear effects. For example, maybe G1 and G3 contribute multiplicatively to G2's activation. So in wild-type, G1 and G3 are both active, so G2 is fully active. In g1, G3 is active, so G2's activity is, say, 75% (hence resistance 75%). In g3, G1 is active, so G2's activity is 50%. In g1g3, with neither G1 nor G3, G2's activity drops to 10%, leading to 10% resistance. Then, G2's activity is the product of G1 and G3 contributions. For example, if G1 contributes 0.75 and G3 contributes 0.5, then 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, but the data shows 0.1. Alternatively, maybe it's additive in log scale or something else. However, this is speculative.\n\nBut according to this model, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, and its activity depends on both. Hence, the conclusion would be that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, acting downstream in the pathway. Therefore, G2 is the gene that, when functional, integrates signals from G1 and G3 to confer resistance. The transcription factor mentioned in the problem is likely G2, acting downstream of G1 and G3, as its knockout completely abolishes resistance, and the double mutants of G1 and G3 have a compounded effect on G2's activity.\n\nAlternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor upstream, activating G1 and G3, but the data shows that knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance, which would make sense if G1 and G3 are downstream effectors. However, in that case, knocking out G2 would eliminate both G1 and G3 function, leading to 0% resistance.

Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn about the genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is essential for resistance** and acts **downstream** of G1 and G3. This is evident because:
   - The **g2 single mutant (0% resistance)** abolishes resistance entirely, indicating G2 is indispensable.
   - Double mutants involving **g2 (g1g2, g2g3)** also show **0% resistance**, identical to the g2 single mutant. This demonstrates that **G2 is epistatic** to G1 and G3; its knockout masks the effects of the other genes, as their contributions depend on G2 being functional.

2. **G1 and G3 modulate G2’s activity** but are not strictly required for its function:
   - In the **g1 mutant (75% resistance)** and **g3 mutant (50% resistance)**, resistance is reduced but not eliminated. This suggests G1 and G3 enhance G2’s effectiveness but are not essential if G2 is present.
   - The **g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance)** shows a **synergistic effect**, implying G1 and G3 act in **partially redundant or overlapping pathways** that amplify G2’s function. Their combined absence severely impairs G2’s residual activity.

3. **G2 is likely the transcription factor** mentioned in the problem. Its downstream position and critical role in resistance align with transcriptional regulation of other genes. G1 and G3 may act upstream to regulate G2’s expression or activity.

### Summary:  
**G2 is the central gene in the pathway**, functioning as a transcription factor required for resistance. **G1 and G3 act upstream** to enhance G2’s activity, but their absence only partially compromises resistance. The epistatic relationship (G2 > G1, G3) and synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 suggest a regulatory hierarchy where G2 integrates inputs from G1 and G3 to confer full resistance.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

perhaps not. Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways but both contribute, their combined loss would be additive. But 50% (from G3) plus 25% (from G1) equals 75% loss, leading to 25% resistance. But the actual is 10%, which is even lower. This suggests synergistic interaction, meaning their combined effect is more than additive, which might imply they are in the same pathway but in a way that their combined knockout disrupts more steps. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant pathway where each can partially compensate for the other, so when both are absent, the effect is worse than additive.

But given that in the presence of G1, G3 contributes 50%, and vice versa, but together they contribute 10%, it's possible that the pathways are partially overlapping. Alternatively, G1 might act upstream of G3. If G1 is upstream, then in a g1 mutant, G3 cannot be activated. But in the data, g1 alone has 75% resistance, which is higher than the 50% in g3. If G1 were upstream of G3, then g1 should have lower resistance than g3. That’s not the case here. So maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then knocking out G3 would disable G1. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which is lower than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit either. Therefore, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

But the key point here is the interaction between G2 and the others. Since all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis in the sense that the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3. If G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would mean that even if G1 and G3 are functional, their products cannot act because the downstream gene (G2) is missing. However, if G2 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed or activated. But in that case, the single mutants of G1 and G3 would still have some function if they are downstream. Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, but when G1 or G3 are knocked out, resistance is 75% or 50%, respectively. Therefore, if G2 were upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from working. However, when G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are still present, so if G2 activates G3, then G3 could still function. But in the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, so G3 is contributing 50% of the resistance. If G2 is upstream and activates G3, then in the absence of G3, G2's activation can't proceed, leading to 50% resistance. But in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 can't be activated, leading to 0%.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is part of a separate pathway. Let's think in terms of gene pathways. Suppose there are two pathways contributing to resistance: one involving G2 and another involving both G1 and G3. If G2 is in a separate pathway, then knocking out G2 (0%) would remove that pathway's contribution. The other pathway (G1 and G3) would contribute the remaining resistance. But in the data, the wild-type has 100% resistance, so if G2's pathway contributes 100% and the G1/G3 pathway contributes 0%, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are a secondary pathway. For example, G2 contributes 50%, and G1 and G3 contribute 50%. But when G2 is knocked out, the remaining resistance would be from G1 and G3. However, in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, which contradicts this. So perhaps G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. That is, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, such that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. Thus, the resistance is entirely dependent on G2. However, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, there is still some resistance. That suggests that G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that require G2's function. For example, G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. In the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are still active, so resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, and G2 is required for their activation). Wait, but in this model, if G2 is required for G1 and G3 expression, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is active, leading to G3 contributing 50% resistance, and G1's absence reduces resistance by 25%, resulting in 75%. Similarly, in the g3 mutant, G2 and G1 are active, so G1 contributes 75% (since 100% -25% =75%?), but the data shows g3 has 50% resistance. Hmm, this doesn't quite align. Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3, but they function in a linear pathway. For example, G2 activates G1, which activates G3. If G2 is knocked out, no activation occurs, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out, G2 can't activate G1, so G3 isn't activated, leading to 0% resistance. But this contradicts the data where g1 has 75% resistance. Therefore, this model is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 works in a pathway with G1 and G3 in parallel. Suppose that G2 is part of a primary pathway contributing 50% resistance, and G1 and G3 are part of another pathway contributing 50% resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, the primary pathway is gone, leaving the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) contributing 50%. However, the data shows that g2 has 0% resistance, which doesn't fit. So this model is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is required for both pathways. For example, G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, both pathways fail. If G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing 50% and 25% respectively, then in the absence of G2, both pathways are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But in the presence of G2, knocking out G1 would leave G3's pathway active, leading to 50% resistance (but data says 75% for g1). This inconsistency suggests another approach.

Let's consider the possibility of additive vs. multiplicative effects. For example, if each gene contributes a certain amount, and their effects combine. But the double mutants show lower resistance than expected by additive or multiplicative. For instance, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so if additive, 75% +50% =125% which isn't possible. If multiplicative, 0.75 *0.5= 0.375 or 37.5%, but actual is 10%. This suggests a synergistic effect where the combination is worse than the product. This might indicate that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but in a way that their combined knockout disrupts more steps. However, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the data might suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Since any double mutant with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) results in 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic. In other words, the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of the other genes. If G2 is downstream, then even if G1 and G3 are functional, their effects can't be realized because G2 is missing. Alternatively, if G2 is upstream, disrupting it affects the downstream genes. But how does this explain the single mutants?

Wait, if G2 is downstream, then in the g1 mutant, G2 would still be functional. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. If G2 is downstream and is necessary for resistance, then knocking out G1 would reduce resistance only if G1 acts upstream of G2. For example, G1 → G2 → resistance. So in g1, G2 can't be activated, leading to lower resistance. But in this case, g1 would have the same resistance as g2. But in the data, g1 has 75%, while g2 has 0%. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 might be in a separate pathway that's essential. If there are two pathways: one involving G2 (providing 100% resistance) and another involving G1 and G3 (providing some resistance). But if G2 is knocked out, that pathway fails (0% resistance), but the other pathway (G1 and G3) might still function. However, the data shows that g2 has 0% resistance, meaning even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't compensate. So perhaps the other pathway (G1 and G3) requires G2 to function. Therefore, G2 is necessary for both pathways. Hence, if G2 is knocked out, neither pathway works. However, if G1 is knocked out, the G2 pathway works (but provides 0%?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If G2 is part of both pathways, but G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that require G2, then knocking out G2 would disable all pathways. But in the single mutants, knocking out G1 or G3 would disable their respective pathways, but the G2 pathway would still function. However, the data shows that g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%, and g2 has 0%. So perhaps the G2 pathway provides 100% resistance, and the G1 and G3 pathways are redundant or contribute less. But this isn't matching the data.

Alternatively, consider that G2 is the only gene providing resistance, and G1 and G3 somehow modulate its activity. For example, G1 and G3 might enhance G2's function. So in the wild-type, G2 is fully active with the help of G1 and G3. Knocking out G1 reduces G2's efficiency to 75%, knocking out G3 reduces it to 50%, and knocking out both G1 and G3 reduces it further. But in this case, the double mutants g1g3 would have lower resistance than either single mutant. The data shows g1g3 at 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). That seems possible. However, how does this explain the g2 mutant at 0%? Because if G2 is the main gene, then knocking it out would eliminate resistance entirely. So this model could work: G2 is the main gene responsible for resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance its activity. For example, G1 and G3 might be co-factors that boost G2's effectiveness. So in the wild-type, with all three, G2 works at 100%. If G1 is missing, G2 works at 75% efficiency; if G3 is missing, at 50%; and if both are missing, G2 works at 10% efficiency. However, this doesn't explain why g1g3 has 10% resistance. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that works in parallel to G2, but that doesn't fit the data where g2 is 0%.

Alternatively, G2 could be a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance because all three genes (G2 itself and its targets G1 and G3) are non-functional. However, in the single mutants g1 and g3, their respective proteins are missing, but G2 is still present. If G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then knocking out G1 would mean that G2's other targets (like G3) are still active. So in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, leading to resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1, G3 would still be active. But the resistance in g1 is 75%, which is higher than in g3 (50%). This suggests that G3's contribution is more significant. However, if G3 is more important, then why does knocking out G1 reduce resistance less than knocking out G3? 

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3. In this case, knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning (0% resistance). Knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from functioning, leading to lower resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%, which contradicts this model. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 should result in lower resistance than knocking out G3. Therefore, this model is invalid.

Another possibility is that G2 is part of a separate pathway that's essential, and G1 and G3 are in another pathway. If the G2 pathway contributes 50% resistance and the G1/G3 pathway contributes 50%. Then, knocking out G2 would leave the G1/G3 pathway active (50%), but the data shows g2 has 0% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't function. But in the presence of G2, knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance. For example, G2 is a transcription factor required for G1 and G3 expression. Then, in the wild-type, all three are active. In g1, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is 75% (G3 contributes 75% when G1 is missing). In g3, G2 and G1 are active, contributing 50% resistance. In g2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the double mutants g1g3, even though G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are missing, so resistance is only 10% (maybe a residual function). However, this model requires that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and contribute additively. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not just additive but have a synergistic effect when both are present. Alternatively, there might be a residual function when only one of them is missing, but when both are missing, the pathway is almost entirely disabled. But how does this fit with G2 being upstream?

Alternatively, consider that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3. In this case:

- Wild type: All active, 100% resistance.
- g2: All inactive, 0% resistance.
- g1: G2 active, G1 inactive, so G3 inactive. Resistance would be 0%, but data shows 75%, so this doesn't fit.
- g3: G2 and G1 active, G3 inactive. Resistance would depend on G1 and G2. But data shows 50%, so perhaps G1 alone contributes 50% when G3 is missing. But how?

This model doesn't fit the data. Therefore, perhaps the pathway is different.

Another angle: since all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have 0% resistance (same as g2 alone), this suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis here means that the phenotype of G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3. If G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would render the upstream genes irrelevant. For example, if G1 and G3 produce signals that activate G2, which then confers resistance. So:

- G1 and G3 → G2 → Resistance.

In this pathway, knocking out G2 (g2) would result in 0% resistance regardless of G1 and G3 status. Knocking out G1 (g1) would reduce the signal to G2, leading to lower resistance. Similarly, knocking out G3 (g3) would do the same. The double mutants g1g3 would have even less signal to G2, leading to lower resistance than either single mutant.

But according to the data:

- g1: 75%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%

If G2's activity is dependent on G1 and G3, then in the wild-type, G2 is fully active (100%). In g1, G2's activity is reduced by 25%, leading to 75% resistance. In g3, G2's activity is reduced by 50%, leading to 50% resistance. In g1g3, G2's activity is reduced by 75% (25% + 50%), leading to 25% resistance. But the data shows 10%, which is lower than expected. However, this might be due to non-linear effects. For example, maybe G1 and G3 contribute multiplicatively to G2's activation. So in wild-type, G1 and G3 are both active, so G2 is fully active. In g1, G3 is active, so G2's activity is, say, 75% (hence resistance 75%). In g3, G1 is active, so G2's activity is 50%. In g1g3, with neither G1 nor G3, G2's activity drops to 10%, leading to 10% resistance. Then, G2's activity is the product of G1 and G3 contributions. For example, if G1 contributes 0.75 and G3 contributes 0.5, then 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, but the data shows 0.1. Alternatively, maybe it's additive in log scale or something else. However, this is speculative.

But according to this model, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, and its activity depends on both. Hence, the conclusion would be that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, acting downstream in the pathway. Therefore, G2 is the gene that, when functional, integrates signals from G1 and G3 to confer resistance. The transcription factor mentioned in the problem is likely G2, acting downstream of G1 and G3, as its knockout completely abolishes resistance, and the double mutants of G1 and G3 have a compounded effect on G2's activity.

Alternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor upstream, activating G1 and G3, but the data shows that knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance, which would make sense if G1 and G3 are downstream effectors. However, in that case, knocking out G2 would eliminate both G1 and G3 function, leading to 0% resistance. But in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 would still be active, so resistance might be due to G3 alone, which is 50%, but the data shows g1 has 75% resistance. This discrepancy suggests that this model isn't accurate.

Perhaps the answer is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, indicating it acts downstream. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor required for resistance, and G1 and G3 modulate its activity. The double mutants g1g3 have a more severe effect than either single mutant, suggesting that both G1 and G3 contribute to G2's function. Therefore, G2 is the key gene downstream, and G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2's activity. This would mean that G2 is a transcription factor whose expression or activity is controlled by G1 and G3. However, the data shows that in the absence of G2, resistance is 0%, and in the absence of G1 or G3, resistance is reduced but not eliminated, implying that G1 and G3 enhance G2's function but are not strictly required. 

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 provide additive support. For example, G2 provides a base level of resistance, and G1 and G3 each add to it. But in the g2 mutant, the base is gone, so resistance is 0%. In g1, the base (G2) is present (providing, say, 75%), and G3 adds 25%, totaling 100%? But the data shows g1 has 75% resistance. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the resistance contributions are additive. For example:

- Wild-type: G1 + G2 + G3 = 100%
- g1: G2 + G3 = 0% + 50% = 50%? But data says 75%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, each gene contributes a certain percentage, and their effects are multiplicative. But this also doesn't align.

Alternatively, the genes may function in a redundant manner. For example, G2 is the main contributor, and G1 and G3 provide backup. So, in the absence of G2, resistance is 0%, but if G2 is present, even without G1 or G3, some resistance remains. For example, G2 provides 75%, G1 provides 25%, and G3 provides 50%. But this is speculative.

Given the complexities, the most consistent conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, acting downstream in the pathway. This means that G2's function is necessary for resistance, and the effects of G1 and G3 are mediated through G2.

However, the data shows that G1 and G3 also contribute to resistance when G2 is present, indicating they act upstream of G2. Therefore, the interaction is that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3, integrating their inputs to confer resistance. Thus, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.
