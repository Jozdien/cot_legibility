**Reaction 1: Butan-2-one → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
**Reagent A: HCl (or another strong acid)**  
The reaction involves cyanohydrin formation. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. A proton source (e.g., HCl) is required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide, forming the hydroxyl group. The final product is the cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
**Reagent B: H₂SO₄ (or another strong acid) with H₂O and heat**  
The nitrile group (-CN) undergoes acidic hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) acts as a catalyst, and water participates in the hydrolysis. Heat is required to drive the reaction to completion, yielding the final product, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

**Summary:**  
- **A = HCl** (acid for cyanohydrin formation)  
- **B = H₂SO₄, H₂O, heat** (acidic hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid)

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the reagents A and B for these two reactions. 

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is also known as methylacetone, right?) reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. 

Butan-2-one is a ketone: 

O
||
CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is actually (CH3)2CO. So structure is:

   O
   ||
CH3-C-CH2-CH3

But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see. The product's structure would be:

          CN
          |
CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CH3

So, the nitrile group (CN) is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group (OH), and there's a methyl group there too. Wait, the formula of the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the carbon chain is four carbons long. The nitrile is on carbon 2, along with the hydroxyl and a methyl group. Let me confirm:

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but here it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

On carbon 2 (the second carbon of the butane chain), there's a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and the nitrile group. Wait, but butane is four carbons. So maybe the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: ?

Wait, maybe I need to count again. The parent chain is butane, so four carbons. The nitrile is at position 2. So the nitrile group is on carbon 2, which also has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CN)(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butane has four carbons, so maybe:

Carbon 1: CH2

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH3? Hmm, that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be pentanenitrile. Wait, maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Let me think. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the ketone group (C=O) is converted into a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. That sounds like a nucleophilic addition. In the presence of a cyanide ion, maybe adding to the carbonyl group. Then, perhaps under acidic or basic conditions. 

Wait, the cyanide ion is a nucleophile. In the case of ketones, the cyanide can add to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Wait, cyanohydrin formation is when a cyanide adds to a carbonyl group, giving a compound with adjacent hydroxyl and nitrile groups. But wait, in the product here, the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon. Wait, that's different. 

Wait, no. In a typical cyanohydrin formation, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -O- which then picks up a proton. So the product would have the hydroxyl and nitrile on adjacent carbons. For example, acetone cyanohydrin is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's a three-carbon compound. But here, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, maybe the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So when we add cyanide, maybe the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to:

(CH3)C(OH)CNCH2CH3?

But that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. The reaction of ketones with HCN (or NaCN with an acid) forms cyanohydrins. The mechanism is nucleophilic addition: the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So for acetone, (CH3)2CO + HCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So in that case, the product has the OH and CN on the same carbon. Wait, yes. So that's a cyanohydrin. So in this case, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)COCH2CH3) would react with HCN to form (CH3)C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentanenitrile? Wait, maybe not. Let me count the carbons.

Butan-2-one: four carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is four carbons. So the nitrile is on carbon 2, which also has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So structure is CH(CH2CH3)(CH3)C(OH)CN? Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me try again.

Butan-2-one structure:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So carbonyl is on carbon 2. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So when adding cyanide, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon (C2), and the oxygen becomes -OH. So the product would be (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons? Let me count:

Original ketone: butan-2-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. So four carbons. Adding CN to the carbonyl carbon (C2) would give:

CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. That's five carbons? Wait, no. The original molecule is four carbons. Carbonyl is on C2. Adding CN to C2 would make the molecule still four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let's number:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C(=O)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

So when adding CN to C2, the structure becomes:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but where is the methyl group on C2? The original C2 in the ketone is (CH3)-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. So when adding CN, the C2 becomes C(OH)(CN) with two CH3 groups? Wait, no. The original C2 is connected to one CH3 (from carbon 1), and the carbonyl group. Then, when adding CN, the structure would be:

(CH3)(CH2CH3)C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, original structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is between CH3 and CH2CH3. Adding HCN would give:

CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-... Wait, the carbon where the OH and CN are attached is connected to CH3 and CH2CH3. So the groups on that carbon are CH3, CH2CH3, OH, and CN. So the name would be 2-hydroxy-2-(propane-2-yl)butanenitrile? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, the name might be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentanenitrile if the carbon chain is extended. Hmm. 

Wait, the product is called 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the parent chain is butane (four carbons), with the hydroxyl and methyl groups on carbon 2, and the nitrile also on carbon 2. So the structure must be:

On carbon 2: OH, CH3, and CN. The parent chain is four carbons. So perhaps:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, but that would make the parent chain four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. But carbon 2 has a methyl group, so maybe the branching is different. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but no, butan-2-one is a straight chain. 

Alternatively, the reaction might involve a different mechanism. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone, followed by some kind of acid workup. But in any case, the reagent A is likely to be an acid. Because in the formation of cyanohydrins, typically you have HCN as the reagent, but since we're using NaCN (which is the sodium salt, so a source of CN-), then we might need an acid to protonate the oxygen. So maybe reagent A is HCl or H2SO4. Wait, in the lab, cyanohydrin formation is usually done with HCN, but sometimes using NaCN and an acid. So perhaps in this case, reagent A is H+ (like HCl), so the reaction is NaCN and HCl. But NaCN is a salt, so maybe the actual reagent is HCN. Wait, but the question lists NaCN and reagent A. So reagent A must be an acid to protonate the intermediate. 

So for the first reaction, the reagents would be NaCN and H+ (like HCl). So A is HCl. Alternatively, maybe H2SO4. But I think in cyanohydrin formation, you can use NaCN and then add a weak acid. So the answer for reagent A is probably HCl or another acid. 

Moving on to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). That’s a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Typically, nitrile to carboxylic acid requires strong acid or base with heat. For example, in acidic conditions (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) or in basic conditions (like NaOH, H2O, heat), followed by acid workup. But since the reagent B is H2O, but likely with an acid or base catalyst. 

However, the problem states that B is (H2O). Wait, the question says "B (H2O)"—maybe B is the reagent, which is H2O along with something else. Wait, the way it's written is "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So B is the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction conditions. So B is probably an acid or a base. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid typically uses either acidic conditions (like concentrated HCl with water and heat) or basic conditions (like NaOH, then acidify). 

But in this case, since the product is the acid, maybe it's done under acidic conditions. So reagent B could be H2SO4 (concentrated) and heat, or HCl (concentrated) and heat. Another possibility is using a catalyst like H3O+ in aqueous solution. Alternatively, maybe it's an enzymatic hydrolysis, but that's less likely here. 

But considering common reagents, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions would require strong acid like H2SO4, H2O, and heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, NaOH, H2O, then H+ workup. But since the product is the acid directly, maybe they are using acidic conditions. So reagent B is likely H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. However, the problem says B is added with H2O, so maybe B is H2SO4. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process, but the question mentions B (H2O), so perhaps B is a dilute acid. Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid generally needs more vigorous conditions. Let me recall: 

Nitrile to amide: can be done with H2O and a catalyst. Nitrile to carboxylic acid: typically, under acidic (H2SO4, H2O, heat) or basic (NaOH, H2O, heat) conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, the nitrile is protonated, then water adds, leading to imidic acid, which tautomerizes to amide, then further hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, the nitrile is attacked by hydroxide, forming an intermediate that eventually becomes the carboxylate, which is then acidified to the carboxylic acid. 

But since in this reaction, the product is the carboxylic acid, and the reagent is B with H2O, perhaps B is H2SO4 (as the acid catalyst) and heat. So the full reagent would be aqueous sulfuric acid with heat. So reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, and heat. But the way the question is phrased, "B (H2O)", maybe B is the acid, and H2O is the solvent. So perhaps B is H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl. 

Alternatively, since the starting material is a cyanohydrin (has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile), maybe the hydrolysis is easier. But regardless, the reagent needed is an acid or base. Since the product is an acid, I think using acidic conditions. So reagent B is H2SO4 (concentrated) and heat. 

So to summarize:

Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The reagent A is likely HCl (or another acid) to protonate the intermediate in the cyanohydrin formation.

Reaction 2: The nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis requires acidic conditions, so reagent B is H2SO4 (or HCl) with water and heat. But as per the question's notation, B is the main reagent, so B is H2SO4.

But let me double-check. For the first reaction, the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone typically uses HCN. However, using NaCN (a source of CN-) would require an acid to generate HCN in situ. So if you have NaCN and add an acid (like HCl), you get HCN. So in that case, reagent A is HCl. So the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl → cyanohydrin. 

Yes, that makes sense. So A is HCl. 

For the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions: H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. So B is H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat, but since H2O is mentioned, maybe B is H2SO4. 

So the answers would be:

A: HCl (or H+)

B: H2SO4 (or another strong acid like HCl) with heat

But the question might expect specific reagents. In many textbooks, the cyanohydrin formation is done with HCN, but if using NaCN, then adding an acid like HCl. So A is HCl. For the hydrolysis, B is H2SO4 (aq) and heat. 

Alternatively, maybe for the hydrolysis, B is aqueous NaOH followed by acid, but since the product is the acid, maybe they just use acidic conditions. 

Yes, I think that's it.

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the reagents A and B for these two reactions. 

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is also known as methylacetone, right?) reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. 

Butan-2-one is a ketone: 

O

CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is actually (CH3)2CO. So structure is:

   O

CH3-C-CH2-CH3

But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see. The product's structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CH3

So, the nitrile group (CN) is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group (OH), and there's a methyl group there too. Wait, the formula of the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the carbon chain is four carbons long. The nitrile is on carbon 2, along with the hydroxyl and a methyl group. Let me confirm:

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but here it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

On carbon 2 (the second carbon of the butane chain), there's a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and the nitrile group. Wait, but butane is four carbons. So maybe the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: ?

Wait, maybe I need to count again. The parent chain is butane, so four carbons. The nitrile is at position 2. So the nitrile group is on carbon 2, which also has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CN)(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butane has four carbons, so maybe:

Carbon 1: CH2

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH3? Hmm, that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be pentanenitrile. Wait, maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Let me think. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the ketone group (C=O) is converted into a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. That sounds like a nucleophilic addition. In the presence of a cyanide ion, maybe adding to the carbonyl group. Then, perhaps under acidic or basic conditions.

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I need to identify reagents A and B for these two reactions.

For the first reaction: butan-2-one (also called methylacetone) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me examine the structures.

Butan-2-one is a ketone with structure:
   O
   ||
CH3-C-CH2-CH3

The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, would have this structure:
          CN
          |
CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CH3

Looking at this transformation, I notice the nitrile group (CN) and hydroxyl group (OH) are on the same carbon as a methyl group. This carbon is position 2 in a four-carbon chain.

Let me verify the structure by analyzing the name:
- Butanenitrile indicates a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group
- The "2-hydroxy" means there's an OH group at position 2
- The "2-methyl" indicates a methyl group also at position 2

So on carbon 2, we have a hydroxyl group, a nitrile group, and a methyl group, with the remaining carbons completing the butane chain.

This reaction appears to be a cyanohydrin formation, where cyanide acts as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon. During this process, the carbonyl oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group while the cyanide attaches to the same carbon.

For butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3, the cyanohydrin formation would give us the structure where the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon where the carbonyl group was originally located.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's see. I need to determine the reagents A and B for these two reactions.

Beginning with the first reaction: butan-2-one, also known as methylacetone, reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize this. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's draw out the structures.

Butan-2-one is a ketone:

   O
   ||
CH3-C-CH2-CH3

The product, however, is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has the structure:

          CN
          |
CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CH3

Here, the nitrile group (CN) is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group (OH), alongside a methyl group. The product's formula is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, indicating a four-carbon chain with the nitrile on carbon 2, with the hydroxyl and methyl group. Let's confirm:

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CN)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, the chain is butane, so there are four carbons. The nitrile group is at position 2 along with the hydroxyl and methyl group. Could the structure be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? But that describes a pentanenitrile rather than a butanenitrile. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. On reacting with NaCN and reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This indicates the carbonyl group (C=O) converts into a hydroxyl and nitrile group, often via nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion, as a nucleophile, could add to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin under either acidic or basic conditions. 

Typically, in cyanohydrin formation, the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, resulting in an oxygen that becomes -O-, which then captures a proton. This way, the product would have the hydroxyl and nitrile groups on adjacent carbons. For example, acetone cyanohydrin is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is three carbons long. However, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is the desired product. 

The starting material must be butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Therefore...

Let me think again. The IUPAC name for butan-2-one is actually incorrect. Because butan-2-one would have a four-carbon chain with the ketone group on C2. But the correct name for (CH3)2CO is propan-2-one (acetone). So butan-2-one would be pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nButanone can be either butan-2-one or butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is not possible because the carbonyl can\'t be on the first carbon of a ketone (since ketones require two alkyl groups). So the correct structure for butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no. Let\'s count. Butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. Butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. So that\'s correct. So the structure is:\n\n       O\n       ||\nCH3-C-CH2-CH3\n\nSo when this reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

The nitrile group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and a methyl group. The parent chain would be butane, with the nitrile (suffix -nitrile) on carbon 2, along with hydroxyl and methyl groups. So the structure is: \n\nOn carbon 2: -C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-, with the rest being CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the nitrile on carbon 2, hydroxyl and methyl also on carbon 2, and the chain extending to carbon 3 and 4. But butane only has four carbons. So if the nitrile is on carbon 2, then the structure would be:\n\nCH2-C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-CH2-CH3? But that\'s five carbons. Wait, maybe I\'m making a mistake here. Let me write the product again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is part of the substituent. So the longest chain would have the nitrile as the main functional group. Wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group has priority over hydroxyl in determining the suffix. So the parent chain is the longest chain that includes the nitrile group. So the nitrile is at the end of the chain. Wait, but in the product name, it\'s butanenitrile, so the nitrile is on the last carbon. Wait, but the hydroxy and methyl are on carbon 2. Wait, maybe the structure is:\n\nCH(CH2CN)(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.\n\nButan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and a reagent, it forms a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for cyanohydrin formation is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. However, HCN is a weak acid, so sometimes a catalyst like a base or acid is used. Alternatively, using NaCN (a salt of HCN) with an acid would generate HCN in situ. \n\nBut in the case of the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the reaction is the addition of HCN to the carbonyl group, resulting in the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which then picks up a proton to form the hydroxyl group. \n\nSo the reagent A in this case would be an acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Alternatively, since NaCN is used, which is a salt of a weak acid (HCN), adding a strong acid would generate HCN. But maybe in this case, the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Wait, but cyanohydrin formation is typically done under basic conditions? Or maybe with a catalyst. Let me check.\n\nActually, cyanohydrin formation can be done by adding HCN to the ketone in the presence of a base, but HCN is a weak acid, so using NaCN (which is the sodium salt) and then adding a weak acid might be the way. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and an acid. So in this case, reagent A is likely HCl or another acid to protonate the intermediate. \n\nSo the first reaction would be butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and HCl (as acid) to form the cyanohydrin. Alternatively, maybe H2SO4? But I think HCl is more common for generating HCN from NaCN. Wait, but adding HCl to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, in a controlled reaction, perhaps it\'s done under such conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. But since the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A, then reagent A is probably an acid like HCl. \n\nSo for the first reaction, reagent A is HCl. \n\nNow, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. \n\nSo the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. The typical pathways are:\n\n1. Acidic hydrolysis: Nitrile + H2O with strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4) and heat → carboxylic acid.\n\n2. Basic hydrolysis: Nitrile + NaOH (aqueous) with heat → carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to get the carboxylic acid.\n\nHowever, in this case, the reagent B is H2O, so maybe it\'s a specific condition. Wait, but H2O alone isn\'t enough. Maybe B is H2O with an acid or base catalyst. But the problem states that B is H2O. Wait, the reaction is written as:\n\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n\nSo B is H2O, but perhaps under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, but the way it\'s written, B is just H2O, but maybe in reality, it\'s aqueous acid or base. \n\nBut the product is a carboxylic acid, so likely acidic conditions. Alternatively, the nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done using H2O with a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup. \n\nBut the problem specifies that B is H2O, but maybe in the presence of an acid. However, the question is to select the suitable reagents. Since the second reagent is listed as B (H2O), but perhaps B is more than just water. Wait, maybe the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions. Let me think.\n\nTypically, converting nitriles to carboxylic acids requires either:\n\n- Strong acid (like HCl or H2SO4) with water and heat.\n\n- Or, using a base like NaOH with water and heat, then acidifying.\n\nBut since the product is the acid, not the carboxylate, maybe it\'s done under acidic conditions. So B would be aqueous acid, such as H2SO4, HCl, with heat. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting B to be H3O+ (acidic conditions), but written as H2O with acid. But since the question lists B as (H2O), maybe it\'s a typo and they just mean aqueous acid. However, the standard way to write this reagent is H3O+ or H2O/H+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s a two-step process where B is H2O with an enzyme catalyst, but that\'s unlikely. \n\nWait, another possibility: the nitrile group adjacent to a hydroxyl group might undergo hydrolysis under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base, the hydroxyl could deprotonate and assist in the hydrolysis. However, I\'m not sure.\n\nBut considering that the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative, and converting to the carboxylic acid, the most straightforward way is acidic hydrolysis. So reagent B would be H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and heat. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is done in basic conditions, then the product would be the carboxylate salt, which would then need to be acidified. But since the product is the acid, maybe the reagent B is aqueous acid. \n\nSo putting this together:\n\nFirst reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl (or another acid) → cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n\nSecond reaction: nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions (H2O, H2SO4, heat) → carboxylic acid.\n\nBut the question specifies that reagent B is H2O. Maybe it\'s a case where the hydrolysis is done with water and an acid catalyst, so B is H2O and H+ (like dilute H2SO4). However, if the options are to choose from common reagents, then for the first reaction, the acid (like HCl) is reagent A, and for the second reaction, H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat is reagent B. \n\nBut the problem states "B (H2O)" which might imply that B is aqueous acid. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a enzymatic hydrolysis, but that\'s less likely. \n\nAlternatively, for the second reaction, maybe it\'s a Ritter reaction, but no, that\'s for forming amides. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis under basic conditions to form the acid. But usually, basic hydrolysis gives the carboxylate. \n\nWait, another thought: the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile might facilitate hydrolysis. For example, in the case of cyanohydrins, hydrolysis of the nitrile group can lead to formation of α-hydroxy acids. The hydrolysis of cyanohydrins to α-hydroxy acids typically requires acidic conditions. For example, using concentrated HCl or H2SO4 with heating. \n\nSo for the second reaction, the reagent B would be aqueous HCl (concentrated) with heat. So in the reaction, B is H2O (as the solvent) with HCl as the acid. \n\nBut the problem mentions "B (H2O)", which might mean that the reagent is water, but in reality, it\'s an acidic aqueous solution. However, since the user wrote B as (H2O), maybe they are indicating that the reagent is water, but in the context of acid. But the way the question is phrased, the user might be expecting the answer to be H+/H2O (acid) for B. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nReaction 1: The reagent A is HCl (or another acid like H2SO4) to protonate the intermediate in the cyanohydrin formation.\n\nReaction 2: Reagent B is H2O with an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or HCl, under heat. \n\nBut since the problem lists B as (H2O), perhaps the answer is simply H2O with acid, but written as H3O+ or aqueous HCl. However, the user might expect the answer to be more specific. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for the first reaction, the reagent A is HCN, but since NaCN is provided, then A is H+ (acid). \n\nWait, in the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and A. So NaCN is the source of CN-, and A is the acid (like HCl) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. So the overall reaction is the formation of the cyanohydrin via the addition of HCN (generated in situ from NaCN and HCl) to the ketone. \n\nTherefore, reagent A is HCl. \n\nFor the second reaction, hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions. So reagent B is H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. But since the problem says B is (H2O), maybe they want the answer to be H3O+ or dilute H2SO4. Alternatively, the answer might be aqueous HCl. \n\nBut in many textbooks, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done with H2O and H2SO4 under reflux. So reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, heat. But since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps the answer is H2O and H2SO4. But maybe the answer is just H2O with acid, so B is aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4). \n\nAlternatively, since the reaction is written with B as (H2O), maybe the answer is simply H2O, but that can\'t be right because nitriles don\'t hydrolyze in water alone. So it must be H2O with acid or base. \n\nGiven that, the most likely answers are:\n\nA: HCl (or another acid)\n\nB: H2O (with H2SO4 or HCl, heat)\n\nBut the problem might expect the specific acid. For example, in the first reaction, H+ (from HCl) is needed, so reagent A is HCl. For the second reaction, since it\'s hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, H2O and H2SO4 (with heat) would be reagent B. \n\nAlternatively, the second reaction\'s reagent B is aqueous HCl. \n\nBut given the way the question is structured, I think:\n\nReaction 1: A is HCl (providing H+)\n\nReaction 2: B is H2O (with H2SO4, heat), but since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe the answer is H2O/H+ or just H3O+.\n\nBut since the user is asking for reagents, maybe for the first reaction, the answer is HCN, but since NaCN is already given, the acid is needed. So A is HCl. \n\nFor the second reaction, the reagent B is aqueous H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. But since the problem specifies B is H2O, perhaps the answer is simply H2O under acidic conditions. However, since the options are to write the reagents, maybe the answer for B is H3O+ (which is H2O with acid). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second reaction uses a different reagent. Wait, another possibility: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can also be achieved using a strong base like NaOH, followed by acidification, but in that case, B would be NaOH, then H+. But the problem states B is H2O. \n\nAlternatively, if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes acidic hydrolysis more readily. So B is aqueous HCl with heat. \n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nReaction 1: A is HCl (acid)\n\nReaction 2: B is HCl (aq), H2O, heat\n\nBut the problem says B is H2O, so maybe the answer is H2O and H+ (like dilute H2SO4).\n\nBut I need to check. Let me verify the hydrolysis of nitriles.\n\nNitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires either:\n\n1. Acidic conditions: H2O, H2SO4 (or HCl), heat. The mechanism involves protonation of the nitrile, addition of water, tautomerization, and further hydrolysis to the acid.\n\n2. Basic conditions: NaOH, H2O, heat, followed by acid workup. \n\nSince the product is the acid, and the reagent B is listed as H2O, I think the correct reagent B is aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat. So the answer for B is H3O+ (which is H+ and H2O). \n\nBut since the user might expect specific reagents, perhaps for B, it\'s H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl) under heat. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the second reaction is written as reagent B (H2O). So maybe they are indicating that B is H2O along with an acid. But since the question is to "select the suitable reagents", and in the first case, the reagents are NaCN and A (which is the acid), then for the second reaction, B is H2O with acid. \n\nTherefore, the answers would be:\n\nA: HCl (or H2SO4)\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, heat (or HCl, H2O, heat)\n\nBut since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe it\'s just H2O with acid, so reagent B is aqueous H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hydrolysis is enzymatic, but that\'s unlikely. \n\nGiven the information, I think the answers are:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, and heat\n\nBut the problem might want the acid to be specified as part of B. However, since the reaction is written as B (H2O), maybe B is H2O with H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, the standard way to write this reagent for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is H3O+ (which is H2O and H+). \n\nSo, final answers:\n\nReaction 1: A is HCl\n\nReaction 2: B is H3O+ (or H2O/H+)\n\nBut since the user wrote B (H2O), maybe the answer is H2O with acid, so B is dilute H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, if the question expects specific reagent names, then:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl), heat\n\nBut to present the answers in boxed format as reagents, perhaps:\n\nFirst reaction: A is HCl\n\nSecond reaction: B is H2SO4, H2O, Δ\n\nBut the problem mentions B is (H2O), so maybe it\'s just H2O with acid. However, I need to check standard reagents.\n\nIn many textbooks, the formation of cyanohydrin uses NaCN and H2SO4. Wait, for example, in the synthesis of cyanohydrins, HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. So maybe reagent A is H2SO4. \n\nWait, but NaCN is a salt of HCN. Adding H2SO4 (a strong acid) to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, in some procedures, it\'s done carefully. So perhaps A is H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is done under buffered conditions. But I\'m not sure. \n\nFor the first reaction, the standard method to form a cyanohydrin is to use HCN with a catalytic amount of base. But since the reagents given are NaCN and A, then A is likely an acid to protonate the cyanide. \n\nBut NaCN is already providing CN-; adding acid would protonate it to HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and would be in equilibrium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. So adding NaCN and H+ (from HCl) generates HCN in situ. \n\nSo perhaps reagent A is HCl. \n\nIn that case, the answers would be:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, heat\n\nBut in the problem statement, B is listed as (H2O). So maybe B is aqueous acid. \n\nGiven all that, I think the correct answers are:\n\nFor the first reaction, reagent A is HCl (or H2SO4) to provide acidic conditions for the cyanohydrin formation.\n\nFor the second reaction, reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with water and heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, writing the answers:\n\nReaction 1: A = HCl\n\nReaction 2: B = H2SO4, H2O, heat\n\nBut the problem might expect the answers in a specific format. Since the first reaction\'s reagents are NaCN and A, and the second is B (H2O), maybe the answers are:\n\nA: HCl (or H+)\n\nB: H3O+ (or H2O/H+)\n\nBut since the user might expect specific reagent names, I\'ll go with:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, and heat\n\nBut the problem might accept B as dilute H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, since nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can also be done using aqueous NaOH followed by acid, but the product here is the acid, so maybe B is aqueous HCl. \n\nBut I think the most accurate answers are:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4 (aq), heat\n\nBut to fit the format, since the user wrote B (H2O), maybe B is aqueous H2SO4. \n\nSo final answers in boxes:\n\nA: \\boxed{HCl}\n\nB: \\boxed{H_2SO_4, H_2O, \\Delta}\n\nOr if they want just the main reagent with H2O as specified, maybe B is \\boxed{H_2O/H^+}\n\nBut I think providing H2SO4 and heat is more precise.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745388369, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5537, prompt_tokens=953, total_tokens=6490, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions:

**Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. The intermediate alkoxide is then protonated to form the hydroxyl group. An acid is required to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. 

**Reagent A**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is used to provide the necessary protons (H⁺) for the reaction.

**Reaction 2: 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile facilitates the hydrolysis.

**Reagent B**: Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in water with heat is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Final Answers:
- **Reagent A**: \boxed{HCl}
- **Reagent B**: \boxed{H_2SO_4, H_2O, \Delta}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

hem the carbonyl is at position 2. Adding cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon (C2), and then protonation would occur. But then, the product would have the hydroxyl on C2 and the nitrile also on C2. Wait, but how does that happen? Because in a typical cyanohydrin, the nitrile is on the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me recall.

In the formation of a cyanohydrin, the mechanism is nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which then picks up a proton. So the product would have the hydroxyl group and the nitrile group on the same carbon. Wait, no. Wait, acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with HCN gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is acetone cyanohydrin. So in that case, the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon. So that's correct. So for butan-2-one, adding cyanide would lead to the same type of product: (CH3)COCH2CH3 becomes (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's count the carbons.

Butan-2-one is four carbons: CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Adding CN- would give CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So the nitrile and hydroxyl are on C2. The substituents on C2 are two methyl groups (from the original ketone's C2, which was (CH3)COCH2CH3), but wait, no. Wait, the original structure is:

Butan-2-one: the carbonyl is at C2. So the structure is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is methylacetone, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, but butan-2-one would actually be:

Butan-2-one structure: CH2CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait. Let me get the correct structure. Butan-2-one is (3-oxobutane), so the carbonyl is on C2. So the structure is CH2CH(O)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. Butan-2-one would be CH2=C(O)-CH2CH3? No. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Let's check.

Butan-2-one: the carbonyl group is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. But that would be pentan-2-one if the chain is longer. Wait, no. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butan-2-one is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again. The IUPAC name for butan-2-one is actually incorrect. Because butan-2-one would have a four-carbon chain with the ketone group on C2. But the correct name for (CH3)2CO is propan-2-one (acetone). So butan-2-one would be pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Butanone can be either butan-2-one or butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is not possible because the carbonyl can't be on the first carbon of a ketone (since ketones require two alkyl groups). So the correct structure for butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, no. Let's count. Butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. Butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. So that's correct. So the structure is:

       O
       ||
CH3-C-CH2-CH3

So when this reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The product structure would be:

       CN
       |
CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CH3

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the IUPAC name. The nitrile group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and a methyl group. The parent chain would be butane, with the nitrile (suffix -nitrile) on carbon 2, along with hydroxyl and methyl groups. So the structure is: 

On carbon 2: -C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-, with the rest being CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the nitrile on carbon 2, hydroxyl and methyl also on carbon 2, and the chain extending to carbon 3 and 4. But butane only has four carbons. So if the nitrile is on carbon 2, then the structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-CH2-CH3? But that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me write the product again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is part of the substituent. So the longest chain would have the nitrile as the main functional group. Wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group has priority over hydroxyl in determining the suffix. So the parent chain is the longest chain that includes the nitrile group. So the nitrile is at the end of the chain. Wait, but in the product name, it's butanenitrile, so the nitrile is on the last carbon. Wait, but the hydroxy and methyl are on carbon 2. Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH(CH2CN)(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and a reagent, it forms a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for cyanohydrin formation is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. However, HCN is a weak acid, so sometimes a catalyst like a base or acid is used. Alternatively, using NaCN (a salt of HCN) with an acid would generate HCN in situ. 

But in the case of the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the reaction is the addition of HCN to the carbonyl group, resulting in the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which then picks up a proton to form the hydroxyl group. 

So the reagent A in this case would be an acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Alternatively, since NaCN is used, which is a salt of a weak acid (HCN), adding a strong acid would generate HCN. But maybe in this case, the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Wait, but cyanohydrin formation is typically done under basic conditions? Or maybe with a catalyst. Let me check.

Actually, cyanohydrin formation can be done by adding HCN to the ketone in the presence of a base, but HCN is a weak acid, so using NaCN (which is the sodium salt) and then adding a weak acid might be the way. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and an acid. So in this case, reagent A is likely HCl or another acid to protonate the intermediate. 

So the first reaction would be butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and HCl (as acid) to form the cyanohydrin. Alternatively, maybe H2SO4? But I think HCl is more common for generating HCN from NaCN. Wait, but adding HCl to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, in a controlled reaction, perhaps it's done under such conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. But since the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A, then reagent A is probably an acid like HCl. 

So for the first reaction, reagent A is HCl. 

Now, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. The typical pathways are:

1. Acidic hydrolysis: Nitrile + H2O with strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4) and heat → carboxylic acid.

2. Basic hydrolysis: Nitrile + NaOH (aqueous) with heat → carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

However, in this case, the reagent B is H2O, so maybe it's a specific condition. Wait, but H2O alone isn't enough. Maybe B is H2O with an acid or base catalyst. But the problem states that B is H2O. Wait, the reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So B is H2O, but perhaps under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, but the way it's written, B is just H2O, but maybe in reality, it's aqueous acid or base. 

But the product is a carboxylic acid, so likely acidic conditions. Alternatively, the nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done using H2O with a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup. 

But the problem specifies that B is H2O, but maybe in the presence of an acid. However, the question is to select the suitable reagents. Since the second reagent is listed as B (H2O), but perhaps B is more than just water. Wait, maybe the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions. Let me think.

Typically, converting nitriles to carboxylic acids requires either:

- Strong acid (like HCl or H2SO4) with water and heat.

- Or, using a base like NaOH with water and heat, then acidifying.

But since the product is the acid, not the carboxylate, maybe it's done under acidic conditions. So B would be aqueous acid, such as H2SO4, HCl, with heat. 

Alternatively, the problem might be expecting B to be H3O+ (acidic conditions), but written as H2O with acid. But since the question lists B as (H2O), maybe it's a typo and they just mean aqueous acid. However, the standard way to write this reagent is H3O+ or H2O/H+.

Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process where B is H2O with an enzyme catalyst, but that's unlikely. 

Wait, another possibility: the nitrile group adjacent to a hydroxyl group might undergo hydrolysis under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base, the hydroxyl could deprotonate and assist in the hydrolysis. However, I'm not sure.

But considering that the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative, and converting to the carboxylic acid, the most straightforward way is acidic hydrolysis. So reagent B would be H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and heat. 

Alternatively, if the reaction is done in basic conditions, then the product would be the carboxylate salt, which would then need to be acidified. But since the product is the acid, maybe the reagent B is aqueous acid. 

So putting this together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl (or another acid) → cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).

Second reaction: nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions (H2O, H2SO4, heat) → carboxylic acid.

But the question specifies that reagent B is H2O. Maybe it's a case where the hydrolysis is done with water and an acid catalyst, so B is H2O and H+ (like dilute H2SO4). However, if the options are to choose from common reagents, then for the first reaction, the acid (like HCl) is reagent A, and for the second reaction, H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat is reagent B. 

But the problem states "B (H2O)" which might imply that B is aqueous acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a enzymatic hydrolysis, but that's less likely. 

Alternatively, for the second reaction, maybe it's a Ritter reaction, but no, that's for forming amides. 

Alternatively, considering that the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis under basic conditions to form the acid. But usually, basic hydrolysis gives the carboxylate. 

Wait, another thought: the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile might facilitate hydrolysis. For example, in the case of cyanohydrins, hydrolysis of the nitrile group can lead to formation of α-hydroxy acids. The hydrolysis of cyanohydrins to α-hydroxy acids typically requires acidic conditions. For example, using concentrated HCl or H2SO4 with heating. 

So for the second reaction, the reagent B would be aqueous HCl (concentrated) with heat. So in the reaction, B is H2O (as the solvent) with HCl as the acid. 

But the problem mentions "B (H2O)", which might mean that the reagent is water, but in reality, it's an acidic aqueous solution. However, since the user wrote B as (H2O), maybe they are indicating that the reagent is water, but in the context of acid. But the way the question is phrased, the user might be expecting the answer to be H+/H2O (acid) for B. 

So, summarizing:

Reaction 1: The reagent A is HCl (or another acid like H2SO4) to protonate the intermediate in the cyanohydrin formation.

Reaction 2: Reagent B is H2O with an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or HCl, under heat. 

But since the problem lists B as (H2O), perhaps the answer is simply H2O with acid, but written as H3O+ or aqueous HCl. However, the user might expect the answer to be more specific. 

Alternatively, maybe for the first reaction, the reagent A is HCN, but since NaCN is provided, then A is H+ (acid). 

Wait, in the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and A. So NaCN is the source of CN-, and A is the acid (like HCl) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. So the overall reaction is the formation of the cyanohydrin via the addition of HCN (generated in situ from NaCN and HCl) to the ketone. 

Therefore, reagent A is HCl. 

For the second reaction, hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions. So reagent B is H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. But since the problem says B is (H2O), maybe they want the answer to be H3O+ or dilute H2SO4. Alternatively, the answer might be aqueous HCl. 

But in many textbooks, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done with H2O and H2SO4 under reflux. So reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, heat. But since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps the answer is H2O and H2SO4. But maybe the answer is just H2O with acid, so B is aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4). 

Alternatively, since the reaction is written with B as (H2O), maybe the answer is simply H2O, but that can't be right because nitriles don't hydrolyze in water alone. So it must be H2O with acid or base. 

Given that, the most likely answers are:

A: HCl (or another acid)

B: H2O (with H2SO4 or HCl, heat)

But the problem might expect the specific acid. For example, in the first reaction, H+ (from HCl) is needed, so reagent A is HCl. For the second reaction, since it's hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, H2O and H2SO4 (with heat) would be reagent B. 

Alternatively, the second reaction's reagent B is aqueous HCl. 

But given the way the question is structured, I think:

Reaction 1: A is HCl (providing H+)

Reaction 2: B is H2O (with H2SO4, heat), but since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe the answer is H2O/H+ or just H3O+.

But since the user is asking for reagents, maybe for the first reaction, the answer is HCN, but since NaCN is already given, the acid is needed. So A is HCl. 

For the second reaction, the reagent B is aqueous H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat. But since the problem specifies B is H2O, perhaps the answer is simply H2O under acidic conditions. However, since the options are to write the reagents, maybe the answer for B is H3O+ (which is H2O with acid). 

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction uses a different reagent. Wait, another possibility: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can also be achieved using a strong base like NaOH, followed by acidification, but in that case, B would be NaOH, then H+. But the problem states B is H2O. 

Alternatively, if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes acidic hydrolysis more readily. So B is aqueous HCl with heat. 

So, to sum up:

Reaction 1: A is HCl (acid)

Reaction 2: B is HCl (aq), H2O, heat

But the problem says B is H2O, so maybe the answer is H2O and H+ (like dilute H2SO4).

But I need to check. Let me verify the hydrolysis of nitriles.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires either:

1. Acidic conditions: H2O, H2SO4 (or HCl), heat. The mechanism involves protonation of the nitrile, addition of water, tautomerization, and further hydrolysis to the acid.

2. Basic conditions: NaOH, H2O, heat, followed by acid workup. 

Since the product is the acid, and the reagent B is listed as H2O, I think the correct reagent B is aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat. So the answer for B is H3O+ (which is H+ and H2O). 

But since the user might expect specific reagents, perhaps for B, it's H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl) under heat. 

But in the problem statement, the second reaction is written as reagent B (H2O). So maybe they are indicating that B is H2O along with an acid. But since the question is to "select the suitable reagents", and in the first case, the reagents are NaCN and A (which is the acid), then for the second reaction, B is H2O with acid. 

Therefore, the answers would be:

A: HCl (or H2SO4)

B: H2SO4, H2O, heat (or HCl, H2O, heat)

But since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe it's just H2O with acid, so reagent B is aqueous H2SO4. 

Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis is enzymatic, but that's unlikely. 

Given the information, I think the answers are:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4, H2O, and heat

But the problem might want the acid to be specified as part of B. However, since the reaction is written as B (H2O), maybe B is H2O with H2SO4. 

Alternatively, the standard way to write this reagent for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is H3O+ (which is H2O and H+). 

So, final answers:

Reaction 1: A is HCl

Reaction 2: B is H3O+ (or H2O/H+)

But since the user wrote B (H2O), maybe the answer is H2O with acid, so B is dilute H2SO4. 

Alternatively, if the question expects specific reagent names, then:

A: HCl

B: H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl), heat

But to present the answers in boxed format as reagents, perhaps:

First reaction: A is HCl

Second reaction: B is H2SO4, H2O, Δ

But the problem mentions B is (H2O), so maybe it's just H2O with acid. However, I need to check standard reagents.

In many textbooks, the formation of cyanohydrin uses NaCN and H2SO4. Wait, for example, in the synthesis of cyanohydrins, HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. So maybe reagent A is H2SO4. 

Wait, but NaCN is a salt of HCN. Adding H2SO4 (a strong acid) to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, in some procedures, it's done carefully. So perhaps A is H2SO4. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under buffered conditions. But I'm not sure. 

For the first reaction, the standard method to form a cyanohydrin is to use HCN with a catalytic amount of base. But since the reagents given are NaCN and A, then A is likely an acid to protonate the cyanide. 

But NaCN is already providing CN-; adding acid would protonate it to HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and would be in equilibrium. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. So adding NaCN and H+ (from HCl) generates HCN in situ. 

So perhaps reagent A is HCl. 

In that case, the answers would be:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4, H2O, heat

But in the problem statement, B is listed as (H2O). So maybe B is aqueous acid. 

Given all that, I think the correct answers are:

For the first reaction, reagent A is HCl (or H2SO4) to provide acidic conditions for the cyanohydrin formation.

For the second reaction, reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with water and heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

So, writing the answers:

Reaction 1: A = HCl

Reaction 2: B = H2SO4, H2O, heat

But the problem might expect the answers in a specific format. Since the first reaction's reagents are NaCN and A, and the second is B (H2O), maybe the answers are:

A: HCl (or H+)

B: H3O+ (or H2O/H+)

But since the user might expect specific reagent names, I'll go with:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4, H2O, and heat

But the problem might accept B as dilute H2SO4. 

Alternatively, since nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can also be done using aqueous NaOH followed by acid, but the product here is the acid, so maybe B is aqueous HCl. 

But I think the most accurate answers are:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4 (aq), heat

But to fit the format, since the user wrote B (H2O), maybe B is aqueous H2SO4. 

So final answers in boxes:

A: \boxed{HCl}

B: \boxed{H_2SO_4, H_2O, \Delta}

Or if they want just the main reagent with H2O as specified, maybe B is \boxed{H_2O/H^+}

But I think providing H2SO4 and heat is more precise.

However, in the problem, NaCN is used. So reagent A must be an acid. Because NaCN is a salt, and in the presence of an acid (like HCl), it can generate HCN in situ. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a different method. Wait, but sometimes cyanohydrin reactions can be done under specific conditions. Let me recall: the typical conditions for cyanohydrin are either using HCN with a catalyst, or using NaCN with a weak acid. Maybe in aqueous solution? Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done in a two-phase system with a buffer. But since the problem states reagent A is needed along with NaCN, perhaps A is an acid like HCl. Wait, but adding HCl to NaCN would generate HCN. Alternatively, maybe a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a different acid. Wait, but in some cases, the reaction is done under basic conditions? Wait, no. Cyanide is a good nucleophile. So the ketone would react with CN- as a nucleophile. But for the addition to the carbonyl, the carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group only if protonated. So maybe an acid is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. But in the presence of CN-, which is a strong base. Hmm, but if you have NaCN (a salt of a weak acid, HCN), then maybe the solution is slightly basic. Wait, maybe I\'m getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe general reaction for cyanohydrin formation is the addition of HCN to a ketone or aldehyde. However, HCN is a weak acid and the reaction can be catalyzed by a base. Alternatively, using NaCN (which provides CN- ions) and then adding a proton source. Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a solution of NaCN with another acid. Wait, but adding H+ to CN- would generate HCN, which is a weak acid. But in practice, cyanohydrin formation can be done by using NaCN along with a weak acid like ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which provides a slightly acidic environment without completely protonating all the CN- ions. Alternatively, maybe in aqueous solution with some H+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl oxygen would then pick up a proton from the solvent or another acid to form the hydroxyl group. So, in this case, maybe the reagent A is simply a proton source, such as H2O or HCl. However, NaCN is already in the presence of some acid. Wait, but NaCN is a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (HCN). So in aqueous solution, NaCN would hydrolyze to form CN- and Na+ ions, but the solution would be basic. If the solution is basic, the carbonyl oxygen might not be protonated, making the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. Hmm. So maybe the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Therefore, reagent A could be HCl, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack. Then, after the attack, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton from the solution to form the hydroxyl group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is conducted under acidic conditions with NaCN. So reagent A is HCl. Therefore, the first reaction would be butan-2-one treated with NaCN and HCl, leading to the cyanohydrin. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction uses HCN directly, but here NaCN is given, so reagent A is probably an acid like HCl. Let me check the mechanism again.\n\nIn the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone:\n\n1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen by an acid (H+ from HCl) to make the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n2. Attack by the cyanide ion (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate.\n3. Deprotonation of the oxygen (maybe by a base, but since it\'s acidic conditions, perhaps the proton is lost to the solution) to form the hydroxyl group.\n\nSo, the reagents would be HCN (or NaCN + HCl). So in this case, since NaCN is provided, reagent A is likely HCl. Therefore, the first answer would be HCl.\n\nNow, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n\nThe starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid. The transformation is from a nitrile (R-CN) to a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). This is typically achieved via hydrolysis of the nitrile group.\n\nNitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions (with H2O and H2SO4, heat), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, it would form a carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to get the carboxylic acid.\n\nIn this case, reagent B is H2O. But H2O alone is not sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis. It usually requires a strong acid or base catalyst and heat. However, the problem states that reagent B is H2O, but maybe that\'s part of the reaction conditions. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", so perhaps B is H2O along with another reagent. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "2-hydroxy...nitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...acid". So B is the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O with another component. Let me check the possible reagents for nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nCommon methods for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids:\n\n1. Acidic hydrolysis: using H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. The nitrile is heated with aqueous acid to form the carboxylic acid. The reaction proceeds through an intermediate amide and then to the carboxylic acid.\n\n2. Basic hydrolysis: using aqueous NaOH (or another strong base) with heat, followed by acidification. The nitrile is first converted to the carboxylate salt, which is then treated with H+ to form the carboxylic acid.\n\nBut in the problem, the reagent B is added along with H2O. If B is H2O, that doesn\'t make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is indicating that H2O is part of the reaction conditions, and B is the actual reagent. Alternatively, maybe B is H3O+ (acid). But the problem states "B (H2O)", which might mean that B is aqueous solution of something. Alternatively, maybe B is H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) and heat. Alternatively, maybe B is HCl and heat. Let me think about the possible reagents.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile might influence the reaction. Sometimes, in the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to a nitrile, under acidic conditions, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis more readily. For example, the hydroxyl group could participate in the hydrolysis mechanism, such as forming an intermediate iminium ion or something similar. However, typically, nitrile hydrolysis requires strong conditions.\n\nIn the case of converting a cyanohydrin (which has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile) to the corresponding acid, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. For example, heating with aqueous HCl would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst.\n\nSo, reagent B is likely a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, with water and heat. However, the problem states that B is in H2O. So if B is H2O with H2SO4, then B could be H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe the reagent B is aqueous HCl. Let me confirm.\n\nThe standard hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids using HCl (aq) and heat. For example, the nitrile is heated with 6M HCl under reflux to produce the carboxylic acid. Therefore, reagent B could be HCl (aqueous) with heat. However, the problem mentions that B is added to H2O. Alternatively, maybe B is H2SO4. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction uses a catalyst. Another method for nitrile hydrolysis is using a mercury(II) catalyst in acidic conditions, but that\'s less common. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup. But since the product is the acid directly, maybe it\'s done under acidic conditions.\n\nSo, considering all this, reagent B is likely aqueous HCl with heat, or H2SO4 with heat. Since the problem states that B is in H2O, perhaps B is H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid), which is commonly used as a catalyst in such hydrolysis reactions. Alternatively, the answer could be HCl (aqueous). The exact reagent might depend on standard conditions.\n\nIn many textbooks, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done by heating with aqueous HCl or H2SO4. Therefore, the reagent B would be H2SO4 (dilute or concentrated) under reflux. Alternatively, HCl (aq) and heat. However, since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is simply H3O+ (acid), but that\'s not a specific reagent. Alternatively, the answer is H+ (acid), but more likely a specific acid like HCl or H2SO4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group allows for a different pathway. For example, under basic conditions, but that would require a base. However, the product is an acid, so if using a base, you would need to acidify afterward. But the problem states reagent B is H2O. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", which might mean that B is the reagent and H2O is the solvent. So B is the catalyst or other reagent added to water. For example, H2SO4 in H2O. So reagent B is H2SO4. Alternatively, B is HCl. So the answer would be either HCl or H2SO4, aqueous, with heat.\n\nLooking up, nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis is typically done in acidic conditions (HCl or H2SO4, H2O, heat). So reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl), under reflux. Given that, the answer is likely H2SO4 or HCl. However, which one is more common? Let me check common reactions.\n\nIn the formation of carboxylic acids from nitriles, the usual method is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. For example, using dilute H2SO4 as the catalyst and heating under reflux. Alternatively, concentrated HCl can also be used. However, the problem states that reagent B is added with H2O, so maybe B is H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl. But since the question is looking for the reagent, and the solvent is H2O, reagent B is likely H2SO4 (aq) or HCl (aq).\n\nAnother possibility is that since the starting material is a cyanohydrin (with a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile), the hydrolysis might proceed under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base. Wait, but that would form the carboxylate. Alternatively, perhaps using an enzyme. But that\'s less likely here.\n\nWait, but if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it can undergo a hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form the acid. For example, in the presence of H2SO4 and water. So reagent B would be H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl. Let me check a specific example.\n\nFor example, the hydrolysis of mandelonitrile (a cyanohydrin derived from benzaldehyde) to mandelic acid uses HCl and water. So in that case, reagent B would be HCl. Therefore, in this problem, since the starting material is a similar structure (a cyanohydrin), the reagent B would be HCl (aq) with heat. Therefore, the answer for B is HCl.\n\nAlternatively, H2SO4. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is simply hydrolysis under acidic conditions, so B is H+ (from HCl or H2SO4). Therefore, the reagent B would be HCl (dilute) with heating.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote "B (H2O)", which might suggest that B is H2O. But H2O alone isn\'t sufficient. Therefore, the reagent B must be an acid (like HCl) in aqueous solution. Therefore, the answer is HCl (aq) under heat. So B is HCl.\n\nBut to be precise, the standard way to write this reagent is typically HCl (aq), H2O, heat. Alternatively, H2SO4, H2O, heat. Since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is the acid, so HCl or H2SO4. But the answer would likely be H3O+ (acid), but since that\'s not a reagent, the specific acid would be HCl or H2SO4.\n\nIn conclusion, for the first reaction, reagent A is HCl (to protonate the carbonyl, allowing CN- attack), and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (aq) with heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to carboxylic acid.\n\nWait, but another thought: in the first reaction, sometimes the cyanohydrin formation uses NaCN and then H+ is added. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a buffered solution where the acid is generated in situ. Alternatively, maybe reagent A is H2SO4. But I think the key is that NaCN provides CN- and the acid (A) protonates the carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, HCl is likely.\n\nFor the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, so B is H2SO4 or HCl with water and heat. Since the question lists B as being added with H2O, the reagent B is probably H2SO4 or HCl. Depending on common practice, HCl is often used for such hydrolysis. However, in many cases, both acids can be used. But perhaps the answer is H2SO4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, the hydrolysis may proceed via a different mechanism. For example, under basic conditions, but then you would need to acidify afterward to get the carboxylic acid. However, the problem states that the reagent B is H2O, so perhaps the reaction is in aqueous base. Wait, but aqueous base would give the carboxylate, which would require acidification. But the product is the acid, not the salt, so maybe the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 or HCl.\n\nI think the safest answers are:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4 (or HCl) under aqueous conditions with heat.\n\nBut I need to check standard reagents.\n\nFor cyanohydrin formation, NaCN and H2SO4 are sometimes used. Wait, for example, in the formation of acetone cyanohydrin, HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. So reagent A would be H2SO4. Let me confirm:\n\nIf you have NaCN and H2SO4, they react to produce HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and can add to the ketone. Alternatively, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic for CN- attack. So perhaps reagent A is H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl.\n\nWait, but adding H2SO4 to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, maybe in a controlled way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where the acid is present to protonate the carbonyl. So perhaps A is H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a buffer solution. But I\'m not sure. Let me check a reference.\n\nUpon checking, the typical procedure for cyanohydrin formation uses a solution of sodium cyanide and a weak acid like acetic acid, or sometimes sulfuric acid. For example, the reaction of ketones with NaCN and H2SO4. So reagent A could be H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl.\n\nBut since the problem mentions that reagent A is needed along with NaCN, and the product is the cyanohydrin, the correct reagent A is likely H2SO4. However, in some references, acetone cyanohydrin is formed using HCN gas, which is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. Therefore, reagent A would be H2SO4.\n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is done under conditions where HCN is generated, then H2SO4 is the acid. Therefore, reagent A is H2SO4.\n\nFor the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, reagent B is H2SO4 (concentrated) with water and heat.\n\nTherefore, the answers would be:\n\nA: H2SO4\n\nB: H2SO4 or HCl (but more likely H2SO4)\n\nBut I need to confirm if that\'s the case.\n\nAlternatively, in the first reaction, reagent A could be an acid like HCl, leading to the formation of HCN in situ. However, HCN is a gas and may not be safe. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where the acid is present. But the problem states the reagents are butan-2-one + NaCN + A. So A is the acid. So if A is HCl, then the reaction would proceed as NaCN + HCl → HCN + NaCl. Then HCN adds to the ketone. But this would require handling HCN, which is dangerous. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done with NaCN and a buffer to maintain a slightly acidic pH so that some HCN is present. However, I\'m not entirely sure. Another approach is to remember that the cyanohydrin formation can also be performed using acetone cyanohydrin conditions, which use NaCN and H2SO4. Therefore, reagent A is H2SO4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction uses an acid like HCl. However, the exact answer might depend on textbook examples. Let me think of another way. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. The standard reagent for forming a cyanohydrin is HCN. However, since the problem uses NaCN, which is a safer alternative, reagent A must be an acid that provides H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, reagent A is HCl.\n\nBut in practice, when using NaCN, you might add an acid to generate HCN in situ. However, the addition of HCN to ketones is the standard method. If the problem provides NaCN, then reagent A is HCl (or another acid) to generate HCN. Therefore, reagent A is HCl. Then, the reaction proceeds via HCN adding to the ketone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition without generating HCN. In that case, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon directly. But for that to happen, the carbonyl must be activated. In basic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is not protonated, making the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. Therefore, maybe the reaction requires a different approach. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like CN-, which is a good nucleophile, maybe the attack can occur without protonation. Wait, but ketones are less reactive than aldehydes. So perhaps in the case of a ketone, the reaction is slower, and an acid catalyst is needed. Therefore, reagent A is an acid like HCl to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the CN- attack.\n\nTherefore, the first reaction\'s reagent A is HCl.\n\nThe second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The standard reagents are H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 or HCl. But since the question mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is H2SO4. Alternatively, the answer is HCl. However, in many cases, H2SO4 is used as the catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. Let me confirm with an example. For example, the hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzoic acid uses H2SO4 and heat. So reagent B would be H2SO4. Therefore, the answers are:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4\n\nBut I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, some sources indicate that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using aqueous HCl under reflux. For example, the Stephen reduction involves converting nitriles to imines and then to aldehydes, but that\'s different. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids using HCl:\n\nRCN + 2 H2O + HCl → RCOOH + NH4Cl\n\nBut this requires heating. Therefore, reagent B could be HCl (aq) with heat. Therefore, B is HCl.\n\nHowever, other sources mention using H2SO4. For example, concentrated H2SO4 can hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example:\n\nRCN + H2O (with H2SO4, heat) → RCOOH\n\nTherefore, reagent B is H2SO4.\n\nBut now I\'m confused. Which one is more appropriate? Let me check a textbook.\n\nAccording to Organic Chemistry by Clayden, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions (e.g., H2O, H2SO4, heat), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Under basic conditions, it forms the carboxylate salt, which is then acidified. Therefore, in this problem, since the product is the carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 (aq) with heat. So the answer is H2SO4.\n\nAlternatively, HCl is also used. For example, in the hydrolysis of nitriles, HCl and water can be used with heat.

**Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-Hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
**Reagent A: HCl**  
The reaction involves cyanohydrin formation. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen of butan-2-one, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the oxygen to form the hydroxyl group, yielding the cyanohydrin product.

**Reaction 2: 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
**Reagent B: HCl (with heat)**  
The nitrile group undergoes acidic hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in aqueous conditions with heat facilitates the conversion of the nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid.

That matches the product structure.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of HCN (hydrogen cyanide) to a ketone or aldehyde. However, in the problem, NaCN is used. So reagent A must be an acid. Because NaCN is a salt, and in the presence of an acid (like HCl), it can generate HCN in situ. Alternatively, maybe it's a different method. Wait, but sometimes cyanohydrin reactions can be done under specific conditions. Let me recall: the typical conditions for cyanohydrin are either using HCN with a catalyst, or using NaCN with a weak acid. Maybe in aqueous solution? Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done in a two-phase system with a buffer. But since the problem states reagent A is needed along with NaCN, perhaps A is an acid like HCl. Wait, but adding HCl to NaCN would generate HCN. Alternatively, maybe a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a different acid. Wait, but in some cases, the reaction is done under basic conditions? Wait, no. Cyanide is a good nucleophile. So the ketone would react with CN- as a nucleophile. But for the addition to the carbonyl, the carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group only if protonated. So maybe an acid is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. But in the presence of CN-, which is a strong base. Hmm, but if you have NaCN (a salt of a weak acid, HCN), then maybe the solution is slightly basic. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The general reaction for cyanohydrin formation is the addition of HCN to a ketone or aldehyde. However, HCN is a weak acid and the reaction can be catalyzed by a base. Alternatively, using NaCN (which provides CN- ions) and then adding a proton source. Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a solution of NaCN with another acid. Wait, but adding H+ to CN- would generate HCN, which is a weak acid. But in practice, cyanohydrin formation can be done by using NaCN along with a weak acid like ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which provides a slightly acidic environment without completely protonating all the CN- ions. Alternatively, maybe in aqueous solution with some H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl oxygen would then pick up a proton from the solvent or another acid to form the hydroxyl group. So, in this case, maybe the reagent A is simply a proton source, such as H2O or HCl. However, NaCN is already in the presence of some acid. Wait, but NaCN is a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (HCN). So in aqueous solution, NaCN would hydrolyze to form CN- and Na+ ions, but the solution would be basic. If the solution is basic, the carbonyl oxygen might not be protonated, making the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. Hmm. So maybe the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Therefore, reagent A could be HCl, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack. Then, after the attack, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton from the solution to form the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is conducted under acidic conditions with NaCN. So reagent A is HCl. Therefore, the first reaction would be butan-2-one treated with NaCN and HCl, leading to the cyanohydrin. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction uses HCN directly, but here NaCN is given, so reagent A is probably an acid like HCl. Let me check the mechanism again.

In the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone:

1. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen by an acid (H+ from HCl) to make the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.
2. Attack by the cyanide ion (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate.
3. Deprotonation of the oxygen (maybe by a base, but since it's acidic conditions, perhaps the proton is lost to the solution) to form the hydroxyl group.

So, the reagents would be HCN (or NaCN + HCl). So in this case, since NaCN is provided, reagent A is likely HCl. Therefore, the first answer would be HCl.

Now, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid. The transformation is from a nitrile (R-CN) to a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). This is typically achieved via hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions (with H2O and H2SO4, heat), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, it would form a carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

In this case, reagent B is H2O. But H2O alone is not sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis. It usually requires a strong acid or base catalyst and heat. However, the problem states that reagent B is H2O, but maybe that's part of the reaction conditions. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", so perhaps B is H2O along with another reagent. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "2-hydroxy...nitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...acid". So B is the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O with another component. Let me check the possible reagents for nitrile hydrolysis.

Common methods for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids:

1. Acidic hydrolysis: using H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. The nitrile is heated with aqueous acid to form the carboxylic acid. The reaction proceeds through an intermediate amide and then to the carboxylic acid.

2. Basic hydrolysis: using aqueous NaOH (or another strong base) with heat, followed by acidification. The nitrile is first converted to the carboxylate salt, which is then treated with H+ to form the carboxylic acid.

But in the problem, the reagent B is added along with H2O. If B is H2O, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is indicating that H2O is part of the reaction conditions, and B is the actual reagent. Alternatively, maybe B is H3O+ (acid). But the problem states "B (H2O)", which might mean that B is aqueous solution of something. Alternatively, maybe B is H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) and heat. Alternatively, maybe B is HCl and heat. Let me think about the possible reagents.

Alternatively, the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile might influence the reaction. Sometimes, in the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to a nitrile, under acidic conditions, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis more readily. For example, the hydroxyl group could participate in the hydrolysis mechanism, such as forming an intermediate iminium ion or something similar. However, typically, nitrile hydrolysis requires strong conditions.

In the case of converting a cyanohydrin (which has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile) to the corresponding acid, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. For example, heating with aqueous HCl would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst.

So, reagent B is likely a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, with water and heat. However, the problem states that B is in H2O. So if B is H2O with H2SO4, then B could be H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe the reagent B is aqueous HCl. Let me confirm.

The standard hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids using HCl (aq) and heat. For example, the nitrile is heated with 6M HCl under reflux to produce the carboxylic acid. Therefore, reagent B could be HCl (aqueous) with heat. However, the problem mentions that B is added to H2O. Alternatively, maybe B is H2SO4. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a catalyst. Another method for nitrile hydrolysis is using a mercury(II) catalyst in acidic conditions, but that's less common. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup. But since the product is the acid directly, maybe it's done under acidic conditions.

So, considering all this, reagent B is likely aqueous HCl with heat, or H2SO4 with heat. Since the problem states that B is in H2O, perhaps B is H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid), which is commonly used as a catalyst in such hydrolysis reactions. Alternatively, the answer could be HCl (aqueous). The exact reagent might depend on standard conditions.

In many textbooks, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done by heating with aqueous HCl or H2SO4. Therefore, the reagent B would be H2SO4 (dilute or concentrated) under reflux. Alternatively, HCl (aq) and heat. However, since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is simply H3O+ (acid), but that's not a specific reagent. Alternatively, the answer is H+ (acid), but more likely a specific acid like HCl or H2SO4.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group allows for a different pathway. For example, under basic conditions, but that would require a base. However, the product is an acid, so if using a base, you would need to acidify afterward. But the problem states reagent B is H2O. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", which might mean that B is the reagent and H2O is the solvent. So B is the catalyst or other reagent added to water. For example, H2SO4 in H2O. So reagent B is H2SO4. Alternatively, B is HCl. So the answer would be either HCl or H2SO4, aqueous, with heat.

Looking up, nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis is typically done in acidic conditions (HCl or H2SO4, H2O, heat). So reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl), under reflux. Given that, the answer is likely H2SO4 or HCl. However, which one is more common? Let me check common reactions.

In the formation of carboxylic acids from nitriles, the usual method is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. For example, using dilute H2SO4 as the catalyst and heating under reflux. Alternatively, concentrated HCl can also be used. However, the problem states that reagent B is added with H2O, so maybe B is H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl. But since the question is looking for the reagent, and the solvent is H2O, reagent B is likely H2SO4 (aq) or HCl (aq).

Another possibility is that since the starting material is a cyanohydrin (with a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile), the hydrolysis might proceed under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base. Wait, but that would form the carboxylate. Alternatively, perhaps using an enzyme. But that's less likely here.

Wait, but if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it can undergo a hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form the acid. For example, in the presence of H2SO4 and water. So reagent B would be H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl. Let me check a specific example.

For example, the hydrolysis of mandelonitrile (a cyanohydrin derived from benzaldehyde) to mandelic acid uses HCl and water. So in that case, reagent B would be HCl. Therefore, in this problem, since the starting material is a similar structure (a cyanohydrin), the reagent B would be HCl (aq) with heat. Therefore, the answer for B is HCl.

Alternatively, H2SO4. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is simply hydrolysis under acidic conditions, so B is H+ (from HCl or H2SO4). Therefore, the reagent B would be HCl (dilute) with heating.

But in the problem statement, the user wrote "B (H2O)", which might suggest that B is H2O. But H2O alone isn't sufficient. Therefore, the reagent B must be an acid (like HCl) in aqueous solution. Therefore, the answer is HCl (aq) under heat. So B is HCl.

But to be precise, the standard way to write this reagent is typically HCl (aq), H2O, heat. Alternatively, H2SO4, H2O, heat. Since the problem mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is the acid, so HCl or H2SO4. But the answer would likely be H3O+ (acid), but since that's not a reagent, the specific acid would be HCl or H2SO4.

In conclusion, for the first reaction, reagent A is HCl (to protonate the carbonyl, allowing CN- attack), and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (aq) with heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, sometimes the cyanohydrin formation uses NaCN and then H+ is added. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a buffered solution where the acid is generated in situ. Alternatively, maybe reagent A is H2SO4. But I think the key is that NaCN provides CN- and the acid (A) protonates the carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, HCl is likely.

For the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, so B is H2SO4 or HCl with water and heat. Since the question lists B as being added with H2O, the reagent B is probably H2SO4 or HCl. Depending on common practice, HCl is often used for such hydrolysis. However, in many cases, both acids can be used. But perhaps the answer is H2SO4.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, the hydrolysis may proceed via a different mechanism. For example, under basic conditions, but then you would need to acidify afterward to get the carboxylic acid. However, the problem states that the reagent B is H2O, so perhaps the reaction is in aqueous base. Wait, but aqueous base would give the carboxylate, which would require acidification. But the product is the acid, not the salt, so maybe the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 or HCl.

I think the safest answers are:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4 (or HCl) under aqueous conditions with heat.

But I need to check standard reagents.

For cyanohydrin formation, NaCN and H2SO4 are sometimes used. Wait, for example, in the formation of acetone cyanohydrin, HCN is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. So reagent A would be H2SO4. Let me confirm:

If you have NaCN and H2SO4, they react to produce HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and can add to the ketone. Alternatively, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic for CN- attack. So perhaps reagent A is H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl.

Wait, but adding H2SO4 to NaCN would produce HCN gas, which is dangerous. However, maybe in a controlled way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where the acid is present to protonate the carbonyl. So perhaps A is H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe it's a buffer solution. But I'm not sure. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, the typical procedure for cyanohydrin formation uses a solution of sodium cyanide and a weak acid like acetic acid, or sometimes sulfuric acid. For example, the reaction of ketones with NaCN and H2SO4. So reagent A could be H2SO4. Alternatively, HCl.

But since the problem mentions that reagent A is needed along with NaCN, and the product is the cyanohydrin, the correct reagent A is likely H2SO4. However, in some references, acetone cyanohydrin is formed using HCN gas, which is generated in situ by adding NaCN and H2SO4. Therefore, reagent A would be H2SO4.

Alternatively, if the reaction is done under conditions where HCN is generated, then H2SO4 is the acid. Therefore, reagent A is H2SO4.

For the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, reagent B is H2SO4 (concentrated) with water and heat.

Therefore, the answers would be:

A: H2SO4

B: H2SO4 or HCl (but more likely H2SO4)

But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Alternatively, in the first reaction, reagent A could be an acid like HCl, leading to the formation of HCN in situ. However, HCN is a gas and may not be safe. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where the acid is present. But the problem states the reagents are butan-2-one + NaCN + A. So A is the acid. So if A is HCl, then the reaction would proceed as NaCN + HCl → HCN + NaCl. Then HCN adds to the ketone. But this would require handling HCN, which is dangerous. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done with NaCN and a buffer to maintain a slightly acidic pH so that some HCN is present. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to remember that the cyanohydrin formation can also be performed using acetone cyanohydrin conditions, which use NaCN and H2SO4. Therefore, reagent A is H2SO4.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses an acid like HCl. However, the exact answer might depend on textbook examples. Let me think of another way. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. The standard reagent for forming a cyanohydrin is HCN. However, since the problem uses NaCN, which is a safer alternative, reagent A must be an acid that provides H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, reagent A is HCl.

But in practice, when using NaCN, you might add an acid to generate HCN in situ. However, the addition of HCN to ketones is the standard method. If the problem provides NaCN, then reagent A is HCl (or another acid) to generate HCN. Therefore, reagent A is HCl. Then, the reaction proceeds via HCN adding to the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition without generating HCN. In that case, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon directly. But for that to happen, the carbonyl must be activated. In basic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is not protonated, making the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. Therefore, maybe the reaction requires a different approach. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like CN-, which is a good nucleophile, maybe the attack can occur without protonation. Wait, but ketones are less reactive than aldehydes. So perhaps in the case of a ketone, the reaction is slower, and an acid catalyst is needed. Therefore, reagent A is an acid like HCl to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the CN- attack.

Therefore, the first reaction's reagent A is HCl.

The second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The standard reagents are H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 or HCl. But since the question mentions B (H2O), perhaps B is H2SO4. Alternatively, the answer is HCl. However, in many cases, H2SO4 is used as the catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. Let me confirm with an example. For example, the hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzoic acid uses H2SO4 and heat. So reagent B would be H2SO4. Therefore, the answers are:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4

But I need to verify.

Alternatively, some sources indicate that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using aqueous HCl under reflux. For example, the Stephen reduction involves converting nitriles to imines and then to aldehydes, but that's different. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids using HCl:

RCN + 2 H2O + HCl → RCOOH + NH4Cl

But this requires heating. Therefore, reagent B could be HCl (aq) with heat. Therefore, B is HCl.

However, other sources mention using H2SO4. For example, concentrated H2SO4 can hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example:

RCN + H2O (with H2SO4, heat) → RCOOH

Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4.

But now I'm confused. Which one is more appropriate? Let me check a textbook.

According to Organic Chemistry by Clayden, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions (e.g., H2O, H2SO4, heat), the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Under basic conditions, it forms the carboxylate salt, which is then acidified. Therefore, in this problem, since the product is the carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4 (aq) with heat. So the answer is H2SO4.

Alternatively, HCl is also used. For example, in the hydrolysis of nitriles, HCl and water can be used with heat. For example:

RCN + 2 H2O + HCl → RCOOH + NH4Cl

Therefore, reagent B could be HCl.

But the question states that B is added with H2O. So if B is H2SO4, then the reagent is concentrated sulfuric acid in water. Alternatively, if B is HCl, then it's aqueous HCl.

Given that both are possible, but in the context of an exam question, the most commonly expected reagents would be H2SO4 for acidic hydrolysis. Therefore, reagent B is H2SO4.

In summary:

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. A is HCl (to protonate the carbonyl).

Reaction 2: nitrile + B (H2O) → carboxylic acid. B is H2SO4 (acid catalyst for hydrolysis).

Alternatively, some sources use HCl for both steps. But considering that H2SO4 is a common catalyst for hydrolysis, I'll go with H2SO4 for B.

But I need to check if there's any specific condition for the second reaction considering the adjacent hydroxyl group. The presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile might facilitate hydrolysis under milder conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, the hydroxyl group could help stabilize intermediates. However, the reagent would still be H2SO4 or HCl.

Another angle: the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile. This structure is similar to a cyanohydrin. Hydrolysis of cyanohydrins typically uses acidic conditions to form α-hydroxy acids. For example, mandelonitrile (a cyanohydrin of benzaldehyde) hydrolyzes in HCl to form mandelic acid. Therefore, reagent B would be HCl (aq) with heat. Hence, B is HCl.

Given that example, perhaps B is HCl.

Therefore, final answers:

A: HCl

B: HCl

But this seems repetitive. Alternatively, if the first uses H2SO4 and the second uses HCl, but that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses HCN generated from NaCN and H2SO4, making A H2SO4, and the second uses HCl.

But considering the example of mandelonitrile hydrolysis to mandelic acid using HCl, then B would be HCl.

Therefore, the reagents are:

A: H2SO4 (to generate HCN in situ from NaCN)

B: HCl (for hydrolysis)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, both A and B could be H2SO4. However, given the prevalence of HCl in such reactions, and considering the example of mandelic acid, I think B is HCl.

Therefore, after thorough consideration, the answers are:

A: HCl

B: HCl

Wait, but HCl in the first reaction would generate HCN, which is dangerous. However, in an exam setting, they might expect the student to recognize that for cyanohydrin formation, the reagent is HCN, but since NaCN is given, the acid (HCl) is needed to generate HCN in situ. Therefore, A is HCl.

For the second reaction, hydrolysis under acidic conditions with HCl gives the carboxylic acid. Therefore, B is HCl.

Alternatively, if the hydrolysis uses H2SO4, then B is H2SO4.

But given that the problem specifies B is added with H2O, and HCl is a common reagent for such hydrolysis, I think the answer is HCl.

Final Answer:

A: HCl

B: HCl

But I'm not 100% confident. Let me check once more.

In the first reaction, the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone typically uses HCN. Since the question uses NaCN, the acid (HCl) is needed to generate HCN in situ. Therefore, A is HCl.

In the second reaction, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic aqueous conditions uses HCl, so B is HCl.

Hence, both reagents are HCl.

But sometimes, H2SO4 is used for hydrolysis. However, considering the example of mandelic acid from mandelonitrile using HCl, I'll stick with HCl for B.

Therefore, the reagents are HCl for both A and B.

Let me number the carbons:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: C=O\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nWait, that\'s not possible. Butan-2-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH3. So the structure is:\n\nO\n||\nC(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n\nWait, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I messed up the naming. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butan-2-one is methylacetone. So the structure is (CH3)COCH2. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nButan-2-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 2. So:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2-\n\nCarbon 2: C=O\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nWait, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I\'m confused. Alternatively, perhaps butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. But acetone is (propan-2-one), so butan-2-one would be (CH2CH2)COCH3? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, butan-2-one is (CH3)CH2CO. Wait, perhaps better to look up the structure. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone. The structure is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So, the carbonyl group is on carbon 2 of butane, making the structure:\n\nCH2CH2COCH3? Wait, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Butane is four carbons. So butan-2-one is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2-\n\nCarbon 2: C=O\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nBut that\'s five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, butane is four carbons. The numbering would be:\n\n1   2   3   4\nCH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3\n\nYes, so butan-2-one is methylacetone, with the structure (CH3)COCH2CH3. The carbonyl is at position 2, so the molecule is (CH3)COCH2CH3.\n\nNow, when we add NaCN and reagent A to butan-2-one, we get 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but the product name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let\'s parse that.\n\nButanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. The substituents are on carbon 2: hydroxyl and methyl. So, the structure is:\n\nCH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, that would be 3-cyano-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutane? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct structure for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is:\n\nThe nitrile group is on carbon 2, along with a hydroxyl and methyl group. So carbon 2 has three substituents: OH, CH3, and CN. The rest of the chain would be:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2-\n\nCarbon 2: C(OH)(CH3)(CN)\n\nCarbon 3: CH2-\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nWait, that\'s four carbons. Wait, but that would be:\n\nCH2-C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that\'s five carbons. Wait, perhaps I\'m getting confused again. Let\'s check the name again: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile on carbon 4? Wait, no. Wait, nitrile takes the lowest possible number, so the nitrile is on carbon 1. Wait, perhaps I\'m misnaming it. Let me check.\n\nWait, nitriles are named by replacing the -e in the alkane with -nitrile, and the numbering starts from the nitrile group. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but that\'s actually pentanenitrile. Wait, no. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, which is butyronitrile. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nButanenitrile: The nitrile group is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2CN. But that\'s three carbons plus the nitrile, making a total of four. Wait, no. Wait, the nitrile group is considered as a functional group, so the longest chain must include the nitrile. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, which is actually propanenitrile (since the nitrile is on the first carbon, making three carbons in total: CN-CH2CH2CH2-). Wait, that\'s confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct IUPAC name for CH3CH2CH2CN is butyronitrile (common name), which would be propanenitrile in IUPAC. Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let\'s break it down. The parent chain is butanenitrile, so four carbons with the nitrile group on the end. The substituents are hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2. So the structure would be:\n\nNitrile group on carbon 4 (if numbering from the nitrile end), but wait, in IUPAC, the nitrile group gets the lowest possible number. So maybe the nitrile is on carbon 1, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on carbon 2. So structure:\n\nNC-CH(CH3)(OH)-CH2-CH3\n\nBut that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but in this structure, the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has OH and CH3, and carbons 3 and 4 are CH2 and CH3. So the full structure is:\n\nNC-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nBut this would make the nitrile on carbon 1, with the hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2, and then two more carbons (CH2CH3). Wait, but that\'s five carbons. Wait, no. The nitrile is considered as part of the chain. So the parent chain is four carbons long, with the nitrile at the end. So:\n\nCarbon 1: CN\n\nCarbon 2: C(OH)(CH3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH2\n\nCarbon 4: CH3\n\nWait, but that would only be possible if the chain is arranged as:\n\nCH3-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CN\n\nBut that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanenitrile, which is not the desired product. Hmm. Maybe I\'m overcomplicating this. Let\'s try to approach it from the reaction perspective.\n\nButan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Adding NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The reaction likely involves the addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group. In a typical cyanohydrin formation, the carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) reacts with cyanide to form a cyanohydrin, which has adjacent hydroxyl and nitrile groups. However, in this case, the product seems to have the nitrile and hydroxyl on the same carbon. Wait, that\'s not typical for a cyanohydrin. Wait, maybe it\'s a different reaction.\n\nWait, if the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, then the nitrile and hydroxyl are on the same carbon. That suggests that the cyanide attacked the carbonyl carbon, and then perhaps there was some rearrangement or another step. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone, but under specific conditions. Wait, in the case of acetone cyanohydrin, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is acetone cyanohydrin. So in that case, the product has the hydroxyl and nitrile on adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon. Wait, that\'s correct. So in that case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. So for acetone, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. So perhaps similarly, butan-2-one would form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile via addition of cyanide.\n\nSo, the reaction would be the addition of cyanide to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The mechanism would involve the cyanide acting as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the oxygen. However, typically, cyanohydrin formation requires either acidic conditions (HCN with a catalyst) or a base. But here, sodium cyanide is used, which is a source of CN⁻. So perhaps reagent A is an acid, like HCl, to protonate the oxygen after the attack. But in some cases, especially with ketones, the reaction might proceed under basic conditions. Wait, but NaCN is already a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Wait, but the typical cyanohydrin formation uses HCN with a catalyst like KCN, which provides the cyanide ion and some acid. Wait, perhaps the reagent A is H2SO4 or another acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in aqueous solution with HCN generated in situ. But sodium cyanide is a salt, so maybe in the presence of a weak acid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where the ketone is activated by an acid. So, perhaps the reagent A is H2SO4, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. Then, the oxygen would be protonated, and upon workup, the product would have the hydroxyl group.\n\nWait, but in the case of acetone cyanohydrin, the reaction is typically done with HCN and a base like NaOH. Alternatively, using KCN and a weak acid. So perhaps in this case, reagent A is H+ (like HCl) to protonate the oxygen after the attack. But since the problem states the reagents are NaCN and A, perhaps A is an acid like HCl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s a Strecker synthesis, but that\'s for amino acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone under basic conditions. Wait, but in that case, the oxygen would become an alkoxide, which would then need to be protonated. So maybe reagent A is H2O or another proton source. However, NaCN in aqueous solution would provide some HCN, but perhaps the reaction requires an acid workup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction uses a solvent like ethanol and HCN. But the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A. So A is probably an acid, like HCl, to protonate the intermediate. So combining NaCN (which provides CN⁻) and HCl (which provides H+), but that might generate HCN, which is dangerous. Alternatively, the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Hmm.\n\nWait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which suggests that the cyanide has added to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen is protonated to form the hydroxyl group. So the mechanism is nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the oxygen. Therefore, the reaction conditions would involve a proton source. Since NaCN is a strong base, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. So maybe reagent A is HCN. But that\'s already provided by NaCN if acid is added. Alternatively, the reaction is in aqueous solution, so NaCN and H2O. But maybe the presence of an acid is needed. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a acid-catalyzed addition. The ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then, CN⁻ attacks, forming the alkoxide, which then picks up a proton to form the hydroxyl. So reagent A could be a dilute acid like HCl. Therefore, the reagents would be NaCN and HCl (or H2SO4), providing the necessary conditions for the addition.\n\nSo for the first reaction, A is probably HCl (or another acid), allowing the formation of the cyanohydrin via acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n\nNow, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. \n\nThe starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. The reaction here is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Common methods include using H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and heat, or using a base (like NaOH) with heat. However, in this case, the reagent B is H2O, but that\'s probably in the presence of an acid or base as a catalyst. Since the problem mentions B is H2O, but maybe it\'s aqueous acid or base. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", which might imply that B is aqueous conditions with another reagent. But the way the question is phrased is "B (H2O)", so B is water. But that can\'t be right, because nitriles don\'t hydrolyze to carboxylic acids in pure water. They require either acidic or basic conditions. So perhaps B is aqueous acid (like HCl, H2SO4) or aqueous base (like NaOH). \n\nIn the case of converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would be heated with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and water. The reaction typically proceeds through the formation of an intermediate amide, then hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, the nitrile is heated with NaOH, then acidified to get the carboxylic acid. \n\nBut the product here is the carboxylic acid, so if B is H2O, but with an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe B is aqueous HCl with heat. However, the problem states that B is H2O, but perhaps in the context of the question, B is the aqueous acidic or basic conditions. Since the reaction is written as + B (H2O), maybe B is aqueous H2SO4 and heat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrolyzed under specific enzymatic conditions, but that\'s probably not the case here. Let\'s think: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid would require strong acidic or basic conditions. Given that the product is a carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid. So perhaps B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) and heat. Alternatively, using H2SO4 and water with heat. \n\nAnother possibility is that the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, which might make the hydrolysis easier. The presence of the hydroxyl group in the alpha position (adjacent to the nitrile) could facilitate hydrolysis. In such cases, even milder conditions might work, but I\'m not sure. However, the standard method for nitrile to carboxylic acid is still acidic or basic hydrolysis. \n\nSo, considering the options, the reagent B is likely aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heat. Alternatively, it could be aqueous NaOH followed by acid work-up, but since the product is the acid, maybe B is acidic conditions. Therefore, B would be H3O+ (acid) and heat. \n\nBut the problem states that B is H2O. So maybe in this case, the hydrolysis is done under acidic aqueous conditions, so B is H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl), but the problem specifies B as H2O. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it\'s using a catalyst like a mercury(II) sulfate in aqueous solution (a method for nitrile hydrolysis), but that\'s more specialized. \n\nWait, another method for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids is using a strong acid like concentrated HCl with water and heat. The reaction is typically done under reflux. So perhaps B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) and heat. But the problem says B is H2O. Maybe the question assumes that H2O is the reagent, but in reality, you need acid. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a typo and B is aqueous acid. But given the problem\'s phrasing, I need to answer based on standard reagents. \n\nAlternatively, since the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile, maybe the hydrolysis occurs under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base, the hydroxyl group could deprotonate, making the nitrile more susceptible to hydrolysis. But I\'m not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction uses H2O as the reagent along with an enzyme or catalyst, but that\'s probably beyond the scope here. \n\nIn summary, the first reaction\'s reagent A is likely HCl (acid) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, allowing NaCN to add as a nucleophile, forming the cyanohydrin. The second reaction\'s reagent B is aqueous acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) under heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, perhaps the answer is H+ (as in acidic conditions), but the standard way to write that would be with H3O+ or specific acid. Alternatively, maybe the answer for B is H2O and H2SO4 (or another acid), but the problem specifies B as H2O, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the problem lists B as (H2O), but maybe this is indicating that water is the solvent, and the actual reagent is an acid or base. But the question says "select the suitable reagents", so for the second reaction, the reagents would be aqueous acid (like H2SO4, HCl) and heat. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, maybe the intended answer is simply H2O under acidic conditions, but reagents are typically specified with the acid. \n\nAlternatively, considering the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, perhaps the hydrolysis can occur under basic conditions, converting the nitrile to the carboxylate, which is then acidified to the carboxylic acid. So reagent B could be aqueous NaOH followed by H3O+, but since the product is the acid, maybe the question assumes that B includes both steps. However, the problem states that B is H2O. This is a bit unclear. \n\nBut given the standard hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical reagents are concentrated HCl or H2SO4 with water and heat. So perhaps for the second reaction, reagent B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) with heat. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, maybe the answer is H3O+ (dilute H2SO4) and heat. But I think the most straightforward answer is that reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O, heat). \n\nBut the problem states "+ B (H2O)", so perhaps B is aqueous H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe it\'s simply H2O under acidic conditions. Given that the first reaction\'s reagent A is likely an acid, perhaps the second reaction\'s B is H3O+ (acidic water). So, the answers would be:\n\nA: HCl (or H2SO4)\n\nB: H3O+ (or H2SO4, H2O, heat)\n\nBut I need to confirm the standard reagents. For cyanohydrin formation, the typical reagents are HCN (or NaCN with H2SO4), so maybe reagent A is H2SO4. For the hydrolysis, H2O with H2SO4 or HCl. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN and the second uses H3O+.\n\nWait, but the first reaction specifies NaCN and A. So NaCN is the source of CN⁻, and A is the acid. So A could be H2SO4. Then, the second reaction\'s B is H2SO4, H2O, heat. \n\nSo, to wrap up:\n\nFirst reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H2SO4 → cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n\nSecond reaction: hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid using H2SO4, H2O, and heat. \n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n\nA: H2SO4 (or HCl)\n\nB: H2SO4 (or HCl), H2O, heat. But since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe B is aqueous acid. So the answer for B is H3O+ (dilute H2SO4) with heat.\n\nBut to be precise, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. So the reagents are:\n\nA: H2SO4 (or HCl)\n\nB: H2O, H2SO4, heat\n\nBut the problem might expect for A: H+ (like HCl) and for B: H3O+ (acidic water). Alternatively, since the first step uses NaCN, maybe A is H+ (like HCl) to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic for the CN⁻ attack. Then, B is H3O+ (acid) with heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.\n\nYes, this makes sense. So:\n\nReaction 1: Reagent A is HCl (providing H+ to protonate carbonyl, allowing CN⁻ attack).\n\nReaction 2: Reagent B is H2O with H+ (acid) and heat, i.e., aqueous HCl or H2SO4 under reflux.\n\nBut since the problem specifies B as (H2O), maybe it\'s just H2O with acid implied. However, the standard way to write this would be with H2SO4, H2O, heat. But perhaps for the answer, they expect for B something like H3O+ or dilute H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply H2O and acid.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis under milder conditions. For example, in acidic or basic conditions, but I think the standard answer would be using H2SO or HCl with water and heat.\n\nTherefore, consolidating:\n\nA is HCl (or H2SO4) for the first reaction.\n\nB is H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat for the second reaction.\n\nBut the problem says B is H2O. So maybe the answer for B is simply H2O with acid, written as H3O+.\n\nBut since the user wrote "B (H2O)", perhaps the answer expects B to be aqueous acid. However, the most precise reagents would be:\n\nFirst reaction: NaCN and H2SO4 (or HCl).\n\nSecond reaction: H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl) with heat.\n\nBut to match the problem\'s format, where A and B are reagents added along with the mentioned substances (NaCN and H2O, respectively), the answers are:\n\nA: H2SO4 (or HCl)\n\nB: H2SO4 (or HCl)\n\nBut since H2O is already mentioned for B, maybe B is H+ (acid) along with H2O. So, for the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and H2SO4 (A), and for the second reaction, B is H2SO4 (aq) with H2O.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is under basic conditions, so B is NaOH, H2O, then acidified. But the product is the acid, so maybe that\'s the case. However, if only B is to be written, and the problem says B is H2O, perhaps the answer is H3O+.\n\nBut I think the safest answers based on standard reactions are:\n\nA: H2SO4 or HCl (acid)\n\nB: H2SO4 or HCl (aqueous acid) with heat\n\nBut given the problem\'s phrasing, the answer for A is likely HCl (since NaCN and HCl would generate HCN in situ, but actually, HCN is used for cyanohydrin). Wait, but NaCN is a salt. If you add HCl to NaCN, you get HCN and NaCl. However, HCN is a weak acid, and the reaction for cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN. So perhaps the reagent A is HCN. But the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A. So mixing NaCN and HCl would generate HCN. So reagent A is HCl. Therefore, the reagents are NaCN and HCl for the first reaction. Then, the second reaction\'s B is HCl (aq) and heat. \n\nBut the problem says B is H2O. So maybe B is aqueous HCl. Therefore, the answers are:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: HCl, H2O, heat\n\nBut the problem lists B as (H2O), so maybe B is aqueous HCl. However, the standard way to denote this is as HCl (aq). Therefore, the answers would be:\n\nReaction 1: A is HCl\n\nReaction 2: B is HCl (aq), heat\n\nBut the problem might expect:\n\nReaction 1: A is HCN, but since NaCN is provided, maybe A is H2SO4 to protonate the ketone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaCN and H2O as the acid. Wait, no. \n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Let me check standard cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrins are typically formed by adding HCN to a ketone or aldehyde in the presence of a base. Wait, but HCN is a weak acid. Alternatively, sodium cyanide and a weak acid. So, for example, using NaCN and H2SO4 to generate HCN in situ. Therefore, reagent A would be H2SO4. \n\nThen, the first reaction\'s reagents are NaCN and H2SO4. \n\nThe second reaction\'s hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions, so B would be H2SO4 (aq) and heat. \n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nA: H2SO4\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, heat\n\nBut since in the problem, B is listed as (H2O), maybe just H2O with acid, so B is dilute H2SO4. \n\nAlternatively, the hydrolysis can also be done with a base. For example, using NaOH, then acidifying. But the product is the acid, so maybe B is NaOH followed by H3O+, but the problem specifies B is H2O. \n\nAlternatively, the answer for B is simply H2O with an acid catalyst. \n\nIn summary, the most probable answers are:\n\nFor reaction 1: A is H2SO4 (or HCl) to acidify the solution, allowing NaCN to react with the ketone to form the cyanohydrin.\n\nFor reaction 2: B is H2SO4 (or HCl) in aqueous solution under heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.\n\nBut since the problem mentions B is H2O, perhaps the answer is that B is aqueous acid (H3O+), so the reagents are H3O+ (which could be represented as H2SO4 or HCl in water). \n\nGiven all that, I\'ll settle on:\n\nA: H2SO4 or HCl (acid)\n\nB: H2SO4 or HCl (aqueous acid) with heat\n\nBut to match common reagents:\n\nCyanohydrin formation: NaCN and H2SO4.\n\nNitrile hydrolysis: H2SO4, H2O, heat.\n\nSo the answers are:\n\nA: H2SO4\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, heat\n\nBut since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe B is H2O and H2SO4. But the way the question is structured, A and B are the reagents added along with the mentioned substances. So for the first reaction, reagents are NaCN and H2SO4. For the second, reagents are H2O and H2SO4. But the problem says B is H2O. So maybe B is H2O with H2SO4, but the answer would just be H2SO4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis uses H2O as the reagent with an acid catalyst, so B is dilute H2SO4. Therefore, the answers are:\n\nA: H2SO4\n\nB: H2SO4 (aq)\n\nBut I\'m not 100% sure.

**Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
**Reagent A**: **H₂SO₄ (or HCl)**  
This reaction involves cyanohydrin formation. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile. The acid (H₂SO₄ or HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen of butan-2-one, enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the intermediate alkoxide to form the hydroxyl group, yielding 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  

**Reaction 2: 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
**Reagent B**: **H₂SO₄ (or HCl), H₂O, heat**  
The nitrile group undergoes acidic hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. The reaction requires aqueous acid (H₂SO₄ or HCl) and heat. The acid catalyzes the addition of water to the nitrile, forming an intermediate imidic acid, which tautomerizes to an amide and is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group at the α-position may facilitate the reaction.  

**Final Answer:**  
- **A**: **H₂SO₄**  
- **B**: **H₂SO₄ (aq), heat**  

(Note: HCl can substitute H₂SO₄ in both reactions, but H₂SO₄ is more commonly used for nitrile hydrolysis.)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

when NaCN adds to the carbonyl, the product would be (CH3)C(OH)CN-CH2CH3? Wait, that might not fit. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one structure: 

CH2(CH3)-CO-CH3

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Wait, butane is four carbons. So butan-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's correct. So the carbonyl is at position 2: CH2CH2COCH3? No. Let me get the structure right.

Butan-2-one: the carbonyl group is on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butane is four carbons. So, 2-ketobutane would be:

CH2CH2COCH3? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, that's not possible. Butan-2-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH3. So the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)(CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I messed up the naming. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butan-2-one is methylacetone. So the structure is (CH3)COCH2. Wait, no. Let me check:

Butan-2-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 2. So:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. But acetone is (propan-2-one), so butan-2-one would be (CH2CH2)COCH3? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Alternatively, butan-2-one is (CH3)CH2CO. Wait, perhaps better to look up the structure. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone. The structure is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So, the carbonyl group is on carbon 2 of butane, making the structure:

CH2CH2COCH3? Wait, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Butane is four carbons. So butan-2-one is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

But that's five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, butane is four carbons. The numbering would be:

1   2   3   4
CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3

Yes, so butan-2-one is methylacetone, with the structure (CH3)COCH2CH3. The carbonyl is at position 2, so the molecule is (CH3)COCH2CH3.

Now, when we add NaCN and reagent A to butan-2-one, we get 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but the product name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's parse that.

Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. The substituents are on carbon 2: hydroxyl and methyl. So, the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, that would be 3-cyano-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutane? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The correct structure for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is:

The nitrile group is on carbon 2, along with a hydroxyl and methyl group. So carbon 2 has three substituents: OH, CH3, and CN. The rest of the chain would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CH3)(CN)

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, that's four carbons. Wait, but that would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let's check the name again: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile on carbon 4? Wait, no. Wait, nitrile takes the lowest possible number, so the nitrile is on carbon 1. Wait, perhaps I'm misnaming it. Let me check.

Wait, nitriles are named by replacing the -e in the alkane with -nitrile, and the numbering starts from the nitrile group. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's actually pentanenitrile. Wait, no. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, which is butyronitrile. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Butanenitrile: The nitrile group is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2CN. But that's three carbons plus the nitrile, making a total of four. Wait, no. Wait, the nitrile group is considered as a functional group, so the longest chain must include the nitrile. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, which is actually propanenitrile (since the nitrile is on the first carbon, making three carbons in total: CN-CH2CH2CH2-). Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct IUPAC name for CH3CH2CH2CN is butyronitrile (common name), which would be propanenitrile in IUPAC. Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's break it down. The parent chain is butanenitrile, so four carbons with the nitrile group on the end. The substituents are hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2. So the structure would be:

Nitrile group on carbon 4 (if numbering from the nitrile end), but wait, in IUPAC, the nitrile group gets the lowest possible number. So maybe the nitrile is on carbon 1, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on carbon 2. So structure:

NC-CH(CH3)(OH)-CH2-CH3

But that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but in this structure, the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has OH and CH3, and carbons 3 and 4 are CH2 and CH3. So the full structure is:

NC-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3

But this would make the nitrile on carbon 1, with the hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2, and then two more carbons (CH2CH3). Wait, but that's five carbons. Wait, no. The nitrile is considered as part of the chain. So the parent chain is four carbons long, with the nitrile at the end. So:

Carbon 1: CN

Carbon 2: C(OH)(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: CH3

Wait, but that would only be possible if the chain is arranged as:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CN

But that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanenitrile, which is not the desired product. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it from the reaction perspective.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Adding NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The reaction likely involves the addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group. In a typical cyanohydrin formation, the carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) reacts with cyanide to form a cyanohydrin, which has adjacent hydroxyl and nitrile groups. However, in this case, the product seems to have the nitrile and hydroxyl on the same carbon. Wait, that's not typical for a cyanohydrin. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, if the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, then the nitrile and hydroxyl are on the same carbon. That suggests that the cyanide attacked the carbonyl carbon, and then perhaps there was some rearrangement or another step. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone, but under specific conditions. Wait, in the case of acetone cyanohydrin, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is acetone cyanohydrin. So in that case, the product has the hydroxyl and nitrile on adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon. Wait, that's correct. So in that case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. So for acetone, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. So perhaps similarly, butan-2-one would form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile via addition of cyanide.

So, the reaction would be the addition of cyanide to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The mechanism would involve the cyanide acting as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the oxygen. However, typically, cyanohydrin formation requires either acidic conditions (HCN with a catalyst) or a base. But here, sodium cyanide is used, which is a source of CN⁻. So perhaps reagent A is an acid, like HCl, to protonate the oxygen after the attack. But in some cases, especially with ketones, the reaction might proceed under basic conditions. Wait, but NaCN is already a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Wait, but the typical cyanohydrin formation uses HCN with a catalyst like KCN, which provides the cyanide ion and some acid. Wait, perhaps the reagent A is H2SO4 or another acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in aqueous solution with HCN generated in situ. But sodium cyanide is a salt, so maybe in the presence of a weak acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where the ketone is activated by an acid. So, perhaps the reagent A is H2SO4, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN⁻ to attack. Then, the oxygen would be protonated, and upon workup, the product would have the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but in the case of acetone cyanohydrin, the reaction is typically done with HCN and a base like NaOH. Alternatively, using KCN and a weak acid. So perhaps in this case, reagent A is H+ (like HCl) to protonate the oxygen after the attack. But since the problem states the reagents are NaCN and A, perhaps A is an acid like HCl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Strecker synthesis, but that's for amino acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone under basic conditions. Wait, but in that case, the oxygen would become an alkoxide, which would then need to be protonated. So maybe reagent A is H2O or another proton source. However, NaCN in aqueous solution would provide some HCN, but perhaps the reaction requires an acid workup.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a solvent like ethanol and HCN. But the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A. So A is probably an acid, like HCl, to protonate the intermediate. So combining NaCN (which provides CN⁻) and HCl (which provides H+), but that might generate HCN, which is dangerous. Alternatively, the reaction is done in a buffered solution. Hmm.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which suggests that the cyanide has added to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen is protonated to form the hydroxyl group. So the mechanism is nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the oxygen. Therefore, the reaction conditions would involve a proton source. Since NaCN is a strong base, maybe the reaction is done in a solution where HCN is present. So maybe reagent A is HCN. But that's already provided by NaCN if acid is added. Alternatively, the reaction is in aqueous solution, so NaCN and H2O. But maybe the presence of an acid is needed. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a acid-catalyzed addition. The ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then, CN⁻ attacks, forming the alkoxide, which then picks up a proton to form the hydroxyl. So reagent A could be a dilute acid like HCl. Therefore, the reagents would be NaCN and HCl (or H2SO4), providing the necessary conditions for the addition.

So for the first reaction, A is probably HCl (or another acid), allowing the formation of the cyanohydrin via acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Now, moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

The starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. The reaction here is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Common methods include using H2O with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and heat, or using a base (like NaOH) with heat. However, in this case, the reagent B is H2O, but that's probably in the presence of an acid or base as a catalyst. Since the problem mentions B is H2O, but maybe it's aqueous acid or base. Wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", which might imply that B is aqueous conditions with another reagent. But the way the question is phrased is "B (H2O)", so B is water. But that can't be right, because nitriles don't hydrolyze to carboxylic acids in pure water. They require either acidic or basic conditions. So perhaps B is aqueous acid (like HCl, H2SO4) or aqueous base (like NaOH). 

In the case of converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would be heated with a strong acid (like H2SO4) and water. The reaction typically proceeds through the formation of an intermediate amide, then hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, the nitrile is heated with NaOH, then acidified to get the carboxylic acid. 

But the product here is the carboxylic acid, so if B is H2O, but with an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe B is aqueous HCl with heat. However, the problem states that B is H2O, but perhaps in the context of the question, B is the aqueous acidic or basic conditions. Since the reaction is written as + B (H2O), maybe B is aqueous H2SO4 and heat. 

Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrolyzed under specific enzymatic conditions, but that's probably not the case here. Let's think: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid would require strong acidic or basic conditions. Given that the product is a carboxylic acid, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid. So perhaps B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) and heat. Alternatively, using H2SO4 and water with heat. 

Another possibility is that the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, which might make the hydrolysis easier. The presence of the hydroxyl group in the alpha position (adjacent to the nitrile) could facilitate hydrolysis. In such cases, even milder conditions might work, but I'm not sure. However, the standard method for nitrile to carboxylic acid is still acidic or basic hydrolysis. 

So, considering the options, the reagent B is likely aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heat. Alternatively, it could be aqueous NaOH followed by acid work-up, but since the product is the acid, maybe B is acidic conditions. Therefore, B would be H3O+ (acid) and heat. 

But the problem states that B is H2O. So maybe in this case, the hydrolysis is done under acidic aqueous conditions, so B is H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl), but the problem specifies B as H2O. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's using a catalyst like a mercury(II) sulfate in aqueous solution (a method for nitrile hydrolysis), but that's more specialized. 

Wait, another method for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids is using a strong acid like concentrated HCl with water and heat. The reaction is typically done under reflux. So perhaps B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) and heat. But the problem says B is H2O. Maybe the question assumes that H2O is the reagent, but in reality, you need acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and B is aqueous acid. But given the problem's phrasing, I need to answer based on standard reagents. 

Alternatively, since the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile, maybe the hydrolysis occurs under milder conditions. For example, in the presence of a base, the hydroxyl group could deprotonate, making the nitrile more susceptible to hydrolysis. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses H2O as the reagent along with an enzyme or catalyst, but that's probably beyond the scope here. 

In summary, the first reaction's reagent A is likely HCl (acid) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, allowing NaCN to add as a nucleophile, forming the cyanohydrin. The second reaction's reagent B is aqueous acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) under heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, perhaps the answer is H+ (as in acidic conditions), but the standard way to write that would be with H3O+ or specific acid. Alternatively, maybe the answer for B is H2O and H2SO4 (or another acid), but the problem specifies B as H2O, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the problem lists B as (H2O), but maybe this is indicating that water is the solvent, and the actual reagent is an acid or base. But the question says "select the suitable reagents", so for the second reaction, the reagents would be aqueous acid (like H2SO4, HCl) and heat. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, maybe the intended answer is simply H2O under acidic conditions, but reagents are typically specified with the acid. 

Alternatively, considering the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, perhaps the hydrolysis can occur under basic conditions, converting the nitrile to the carboxylate, which is then acidified to the carboxylic acid. So reagent B could be aqueous NaOH followed by H3O+, but since the product is the acid, maybe the question assumes that B includes both steps. However, the problem states that B is H2O. This is a bit unclear. 

But given the standard hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical reagents are concentrated HCl or H2SO4 with water and heat. So perhaps for the second reaction, reagent B is aqueous HCl (concentrated) with heat. However, since the problem mentions B is H2O, maybe the answer is H3O+ (dilute H2SO4) and heat. But I think the most straightforward answer is that reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O, heat). 

But the problem states "+ B (H2O)", so perhaps B is aqueous H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe it's simply H2O under acidic conditions. Given that the first reaction's reagent A is likely an acid, perhaps the second reaction's B is H3O+ (acidic water). So, the answers would be:

A: HCl (or H2SO4)

B: H3O+ (or H2SO4, H2O, heat)

But I need to confirm the standard reagents. For cyanohydrin formation, the typical reagents are HCN (or NaCN with H2SO4), so maybe reagent A is H2SO4. For the hydrolysis, H2O with H2SO4 or HCl. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN and the second uses H3O+.

Wait, but the first reaction specifies NaCN and A. So NaCN is the source of CN⁻, and A is the acid. So A could be H2SO4. Then, the second reaction's B is H2SO4, H2O, heat. 

So, to wrap up:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H2SO4 → cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).

Second reaction: hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid using H2SO4, H2O, and heat. 

Therefore, the reagents are:

A: H2SO4 (or HCl)

B: H2SO4 (or HCl), H2O, heat. But since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe B is aqueous acid. So the answer for B is H3O+ (dilute H2SO4) with heat.

But to be precise, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. So the reagents are:

A: H2SO4 (or HCl)

B: H2O, H2SO4, heat

But the problem might expect for A: H+ (like HCl) and for B: H3O+ (acidic water). Alternatively, since the first step uses NaCN, maybe A is H+ (like HCl) to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic for the CN⁻ attack. Then, B is H3O+ (acid) with heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Yes, this makes sense. So:

Reaction 1: Reagent A is HCl (providing H+ to protonate carbonyl, allowing CN⁻ attack).

Reaction 2: Reagent B is H2O with H+ (acid) and heat, i.e., aqueous HCl or H2SO4 under reflux.

But since the problem specifies B as (H2O), maybe it's just H2O with acid implied. However, the standard way to write this would be with H2SO4, H2O, heat. But perhaps for the answer, they expect for B something like H3O+ or dilute H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply H2O and acid.

Alternatively, considering that the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis under milder conditions. For example, in acidic or basic conditions, but I think the standard answer would be using H2SO or HCl with water and heat.

Therefore, consolidating:

A is HCl (or H2SO4) for the first reaction.

B is H2O with H2SO4 (or HCl) and heat for the second reaction.

But the problem says B is H2O. So maybe the answer for B is simply H2O with acid, written as H3O+.

But since the user wrote "B (H2O)", perhaps the answer expects B to be aqueous acid. However, the most precise reagents would be:

First reaction: NaCN and H2SO4 (or HCl).

Second reaction: H2O and H2SO4 (or HCl) with heat.

But to match the problem's format, where A and B are reagents added along with the mentioned substances (NaCN and H2O, respectively), the answers are:

A: H2SO4 (or HCl)

B: H2SO4 (or HCl)

But since H2O is already mentioned for B, maybe B is H+ (acid) along with H2O. So, for the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and H2SO4 (A), and for the second reaction, B is H2SO4 (aq) with H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is under basic conditions, so B is NaOH, H2O, then acidified. But the product is the acid, so maybe that's the case. However, if only B is to be written, and the problem says B is H2O, perhaps the answer is H3O+.

But I think the safest answers based on standard reactions are:

A: H2SO4 or HCl (acid)

B: H2SO4 or HCl (aqueous acid) with heat

But given the problem's phrasing, the answer for A is likely HCl (since NaCN and HCl would generate HCN in situ, but actually, HCN is used for cyanohydrin). Wait, but NaCN is a salt. If you add HCl to NaCN, you get HCN and NaCl. However, HCN is a weak acid, and the reaction for cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN. So perhaps the reagent A is HCN. But the problem states that the reagents are NaCN and A. So mixing NaCN and HCl would generate HCN. So reagent A is HCl. Therefore, the reagents are NaCN and HCl for the first reaction. Then, the second reaction's B is HCl (aq) and heat. 

But the problem says B is H2O. So maybe B is aqueous HCl. Therefore, the answers are:

A: HCl

B: HCl, H2O, heat

But the problem lists B as (H2O), so maybe B is aqueous HCl. However, the standard way to denote this is as HCl (aq). Therefore, the answers would be:

Reaction 1: A is HCl

Reaction 2: B is HCl (aq), heat

But the problem might expect:

Reaction 1: A is HCN, but since NaCN is provided, maybe A is H2SO4 to protonate the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaCN and H2O as the acid. Wait, no. 

This is getting a bit too convoluted. Let me check standard cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrins are typically formed by adding HCN to a ketone or aldehyde in the presence of a base. Wait, but HCN is a weak acid. Alternatively, sodium cyanide and a weak acid. So, for example, using NaCN and H2SO4 to generate HCN in situ. Therefore, reagent A would be H2SO4. 

Then, the first reaction's reagents are NaCN and H2SO4. 

The second reaction's hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions, so B would be H2SO4 (aq) and heat. 

Therefore, the answers are:

A: H2SO4

B: H2SO4, H2O, heat

But since in the problem, B is listed as (H2O), maybe just H2O with acid, so B is dilute H2SO4. 

Alternatively, the hydrolysis can also be done with a base. For example, using NaOH, then acidifying. But the product is the acid, so maybe B is NaOH followed by H3O+, but the problem specifies B is H2O. 

Alternatively, the answer for B is simply H2O with an acid catalyst. 

In summary, the most probable answers are:

For reaction 1: A is H2SO4 (or HCl) to acidify the solution, allowing NaCN to react with the ketone to form the cyanohydrin.

For reaction 2: B is H2SO4 (or HCl) in aqueous solution under heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

But since the problem mentions B is H2O, perhaps the answer is that B is aqueous acid (H3O+), so the reagents are H3O+ (which could be represented as H2SO4 or HCl in water). 

Given all that, I'll settle on:

A: H2SO4 or HCl (acid)

B: H2SO4 or HCl (aqueous acid) with heat

But to match common reagents:

Cyanohydrin formation: NaCN and H2SO4.

Nitrile hydrolysis: H2SO4, H2O, heat.

So the answers are:

A: H2SO4

B: H2SO4, H2O, heat

But since the problem lists B as (H2O), maybe B is H2O and H2SO4. But the way the question is structured, A and B are the reagents added along with the mentioned substances. So for the first reaction, reagents are NaCN and H2SO4. For the second, reagents are H2O and H2SO4. But the problem says B is H2O. So maybe B is H2O with H2SO4, but the answer would just be H2SO4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis uses H2O as the reagent with an acid catalyst, so B is dilute H2SO4. Therefore, the answers are:

A: H2SO4

B: H2SO4 (aq)

But I'm not 100% sure. However, given the information, I'll go with these.
