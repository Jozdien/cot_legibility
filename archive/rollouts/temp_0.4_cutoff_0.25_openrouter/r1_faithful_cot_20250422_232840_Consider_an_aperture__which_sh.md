# Original Question

Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.

To determine the angular distance between the first two minima for a diffraction pattern created by an N-sided polygonal aperture with all apothems of length \(a\) when \(N\) is infinitely large, we recognize that the aperture effectively becomes a circular aperture with radius \(a\). 

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, \(J_1\). The first minimum occurs at the first zero of \(J_1\), which is approximately \(3.8317\), and the second minimum occurs at the second zero, approximately \(7.0156\).

The angular positions of these minima are:
\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]
\[
\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2\pi} \frac{\lambda}{a}
\]

Calculating the numerical factor:
\[
\frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2\pi} \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \approx 0.506
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}
\]

Okay, so I have this problem about diffraction through an N-sided polygonal aperture with all apothems equal to length a. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, using the small angle approximation. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to recall what an apothem is. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So, if all apothems are of length a, that means the polygon is regular, right? Because in a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So, the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with apothem a.

Now, when N approaches infinity, a regular polygon becomes a circle. So, in the limit as N tends to infinity, the aperture is effectively a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem a. Wait, but the apothem of a regular polygon is related to its radius (the distance from center to a vertex). For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R * cos(π/N). As N becomes very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, meaning a ≈ R. So in the limit as N→∞, the apothem a is equal to the radius R of the circle. So the problem reduces to diffraction by a circular aperture of radius a.

Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ given by the formula:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D

where D is the diameter of the aperture. But wait, here the radius is a, so diameter D = 2a. Therefore, substituting:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a)

But since the angle is small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ (since they mention tanθ ≈ θ, which for small angles is the same as sinθ ≈ θ). Therefore, the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22λ/(2a).

Now, the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is a central Airy disk surrounded by rings. The first minimum corresponds to the edge of the Airy disk, and the second minimum would be the next ring. Wait, but actually, the formula I know gives the first minimum. What's the angular position of the second minimum?

Hmm, maybe I need to recall the general formula for the minima in circular diffraction. The angular positions of the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind. Specifically, the intensity pattern is given by the square of the Fourier transform of the circular aperture, which involves a Bessel function. The first minimum is at the first zero of the Bessel function J₁(k a sinθ), where k = 2π/λ. The zeros of J₁ are known; the first zero is at approximately 3.8317, the second at 7.0156, and so on.

So, the condition for the m-th minimum is:

k a sinθ ≈ j_{1,m}

where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J₁. Therefore, solving for θ:

θ ≈ j_{1,m} / (k a) = j_{1,m} * λ / (2π a)

But since k = 2π/λ, so k a = 2π a / λ. Therefore, sinθ ≈ j_{1,m} * λ / (2π a). Again, for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ j_{1,m} * λ / (2π a).

Therefore, the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2π a), and the second minimum is at θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π a). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a).

Calculating that numerical factor: 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5066. So approximately 0.5066 * λ / a. But let me check the exact value.

Wait, the difference between the second and first zeros is 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. Then, θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a). Let me compute 3.1839 / (2π):

3.1839 divided by 6.2832 is approximately 0.5066. So, θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ 0.5066 * λ / a.

But wait, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. Since D = 2a, this becomes θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (2a) ≈ 0.61 λ / a. Wait, but according to the Bessel function zeros, the first minimum is at 3.8317 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 0.61 * λ / a, which matches the 1.22 λ / D (since D=2a gives 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a). So that's consistent.

Similarly, the second minimum would be at j_{1,2} = 7.0156, so θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 1.116 * λ / a. Then, the angular distance between θ₂ and θ₁ is approximately 1.116 - 0.61 = 0.506 * λ / a, which is approximately 0.506 λ / a. So, the angular distance is approximately 0.506 λ / a. But the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", so maybe I need to present this as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). Since j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} is approximately 3.1839, then 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 0.5066, so approximately 0.5066 λ/a. But perhaps there's a more precise way to express this?

Alternatively, maybe there is an exact expression? Let's see. The zeros of J₁ are known, but they are transcendental numbers, so they don't have exact analytical expressions. Therefore, we have to use their approximate decimal values. So, the answer would be approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a). Alternatively, if we use more decimal places for the Bessel function zeros, we can get a more precise coefficient.

Wait, let me check the exact values. The first zero of J₁(x) is at x ≈ 3.831705970207512, and the second zero is at x ≈ 7.015586669815619. Therefore, the difference is approximately 7.015586669815619 - 3.831705970207512 ≈ 3.183880699608107. Then, 3.1838807 / (2π) ≈ 3.1838807 / 6.283185307 ≈ 0.5063625. So approximately 0.5064 λ/a.

Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.5064 λ/a. But the problem says "angular distance", which is θ₂ - θ₁. So, in terms of exact expression, it's (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). But since they might want the answer in terms of a numerical coefficient times λ/a, then approximately 0.506 λ/a. But maybe the answer is expected to be given as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * λ/a. However, since the problem is in the context of an exam or homework, perhaps they expect the student to recall that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at a larger angle. But I don't recall the standard formula for the second minimum. Maybe in some textbooks they mention it. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for the zeros of the Bessel function.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. For a circular aperture, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern intensity is given by:

I(θ) = I_0 [2 J₁(k a sinθ) / (k a sinθ)]²

The minima occur when J₁(k a sinθ) = 0, so when k a sinθ = j_{1,m}, where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J₁. So, the angular positions of the minima are θ_m ≈ j_{1,m} / (k a) = j_{1,m} λ / (2 π a), since k = 2π/λ.

Therefore, θ₁ = 3.8317 λ / (2 π a), θ₂ = 7.0156 λ / (2 π a)

Therefore, Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ / (2 π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ / (2 π a) ≈ 0.506 λ / a.

So, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach? Let me think again.

Wait, the original aperture is an N-sided polygon with apothems of length a. As N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle with radius a (since apothem a corresponds to radius R = a / cos(π/N). As N→∞, cos(π/N) →1, so R→a). So, the diffraction pattern becomes that of a circular aperture. Therefore, the answer is the same as the circular aperture case.

But maybe to derive it from scratch without relying on the circular aperture result?

Alternatively, perhaps using Fourier transform properties for the polygon and taking the limit as N→∞. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, note that for a regular polygon with N sides, the Fourier transform (which gives the diffraction pattern) can be expressed in polar coordinates. However, as N becomes large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the Fourier transform becomes the Airy pattern.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the result should correspond to the circular aperture case. So, the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But let me check if there's a standard expression for this.

Alternatively, if I recall that the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at 2.233 λ/D (I need to check this). Wait, let me see: for circular aperture, the first zero is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second zero is at 2.233 λ/D. Wait, if D=2a, then substituting, first minimum at 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈0.61 λ/a, and second minimum at 2.233 λ/(2a)≈1.1165 λ/a. Then the difference is approximately 1.1165 -0.61= 0.5065 λ/a. So same result. So, 0.5065 λ/a is the angular distance between first and second minima.

But the problem states N is infinitely large, so the answer is this 0.506 λ/a. But the question says "angular distance between the first two minima". So, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But maybe in terms of the Bessel function zeros, the problem expects an exact expression? But since they asked for the answer when N is infinitely large, and using small angle approximation, so probably expects the numerical coefficient.

But perhaps the answer is written as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * (λ/a). Since j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈3.1839, then divided by 2π gives ≈0.506. So, 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact expression in terms of the zeros, but since they are transcendental numbers, the answer is numerical. Therefore, the angular distance is approximately 0.506 λ/a. So, boxed, it would be \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

But wait, let me verify once more. If the first minimum is at θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ₂ ≈ 2.233 λ/(2a) ≈1.1165 λ/a, then the difference is indeed approximately 0.5065 λ/a. So, 0.506 λ/a is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the difference of the Bessel zeros divided by 2π. But since the question mentions "angular distance", which is a small angle, and the answer is a numerical coefficient times λ/a. So, 0.506 is the approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is better expressed as (j_2 - j_1)/(2π) * λ/a, where j_1 and j_2 are the first and second zeros. But unless specified, giving the numerical value is probably better.

Wait, but let me check some references. For a circular aperture, the angular radius of the first dark ring (first minimum) is given by θ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. The second dark ring is at θ ≈ 2.23 λ/D. Therefore, the angular distance between the first and second minima is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/D = 1.01 λ/D. But since D = 2a, this becomes 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈0.505 λ/a. Which matches our previous result. So, 0.505 ≈0.506, depending on the precision of the zeros.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a, so boxed as \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of the Bessel zeros? For example, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a. But since j_{1,1}=3.8317 and j_{1,2}=7.0156, then (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π)=3.1839/6.2832≈0.506. So, the answer is 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, since in some references, the second minimum is at approximately 2.233 λ/D, so 2.233 λ/D -1.22 λ/D=1.013 λ/D, and D=2a, so 1.013/(2)≈0.5065 λ/a. So, same result.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a. So, I think that's the answer they are looking for.

**Final Answer**
The angular distance between the first two minima is \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

Okay, so I have this problem about diffraction through an N-sided polygonal aperture with all apothems equal to length a. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, using the small angle approximation. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So, if all apothems are of length a, that means the polygon is regular, right? Because in a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So, the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with apothem a.

For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R * cos(π/N). As N becomes very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, meaning a ≈ R. So in the limit as N→∞, the apothem a is equal to the radius R of the circle. So the problem reduces to diffraction by a circular aperture of radius a.

Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ given by the formula:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D

where D is the diameter of the aperture. But wait, here the radius is a, so diameter D = 2a. Therefore, substituting:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a)

But since the angle is small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ (since they mention tanθ ≈ θ, which for small angles is the same as sinθ ≈ θ). Therefore, the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22λ/(2a).

Now, the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is a central Airy disk surrounded by rings.

So, the condition for the m-th minimum is:

k a sinθ ≈ j_{1,m}

I'm facing a problem involving diffraction through a regular N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems equal length a. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity, using the small angle approximation.

Let me clarify what an apothem is first. In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side. Since all apothems are equal to a, this confirms we're dealing with a regular polygon.

As N approaches infinity, the regular polygon effectively becomes a circle. The apothem a is related to the radius R of a regular N-sided polygon by a = R×cos(π/N). When N becomes very large, π/N approaches zero, making cos(π/N) approach 1. Therefore, a ≈ R in the limit as N→∞. So this problem simplifies to diffraction by a circular aperture with radius a.

For a circular aperture, I know the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle θ where:

sinθ ≈ 1.22×λ/D

Where D is the aperture diameter. Since the radius is a, the diameter D = 2a, giving:

sinθ ≈ 1.22×λ/(2a)

Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), the first minimum occurs at θ₁ ≈ 1.22λ/(2a).

To find the angular distance between the first two minima, I need to recall that the minima in circular diffraction correspond to zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind. The condition for the m-th minimum is:

k×a×sinθ ≈ j_{1,m}

Where k = 2π/λ and j_{1,m} represents the zeros of the Bessel function J₁. The first zero is approximately 3.8317, and the second is about 7.0156.

Sure, here's a rephrased version of the text:

Alright, I'm dealing with a problem involving diffraction through a polygonal aperture with N sides, where all the apothems are length a. The task is to find the angular distance between the first two minima as N becomes infinitely large, using the small angle approximation. Let me think this through.

First, let me remember what an apothem is. It's the distance from the center to the midpoint of one side of a regular polygon. Since all the apothems have length a, this indicates the polygon is regular, because in regular polygons, all apothems are the same length. Thus, the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with apothem a.

As N approaches infinity, the shape approaches that of a circle. So when N becomes infinitely large, the aperture effectively becomes a circular one, with a radius equal to the apothem a. But wait, in a regular polygon, the apothem a is linked to its radius R (the distance from the center to a vertex) by the relation a = R * cos(π/N). As N grows very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) nears 1, meaning a is almost equal to R. Hence, as N→∞, a is the same as the circle's radius R, simplifying the problem to diffraction by a circular aperture with radius a.

Therefore, the query pertains to the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of this circular aperture. For a circular aperture, I recall that the first minimum appears at an angle θ given by:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D

where D is the aperture's diameter. Here, the radius is a, so D = 2a. Substituting gives:

sinθ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a)

Given that the angle is small, sinθ can be approximated to θ (as indicated, tanθ ≈ θ, which equates to sinθ ≈ θ for small angles). Hence, the first minimum is found at θ₁ ≈ 1.22λ/(2a).

The task asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central Airy disk with surrounding rings. The first minimum is at the Airy disk's edge, while the second is at the next ring. So, the formula I know provides the first minimum, but how do we find the second?

I need to remember the general minimum formula in circular diffraction. The minima's angular positions align with the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind. The pattern's intensity is the square of the Fourier transform of the circular aperture, involving a Bessel function. The first minimum is at the first zero of the Bessel function J₁(k a sinθ), where k = 2π/λ. The known zeros of J₁ are approximately 3.8317 for the first and 7.0156 for the second.

Thus, the condition for the m-th minimum is:

k a sinθ ≈ j_{1,m}

However, wait, in the case of circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced. The angular distance between consecutive minima increases. So the first minimum is at ~1.22 λ/D, second at ~2.23 λ/D, so the difference is ~1.01 λ/D.

So the difference is 7.015586669815618 - 3.831705970207512 = 3.183880699608106.

So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. If we multiply numerator and denominator by 2, we get 1.013 λ/(2a), but that\'s not a standard form. Alternatively, leave it as approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * λ/a, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in terms of the apothem. Wait, in the original problem, the apothem is a. But when we take N to infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius. Wait, for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to vertex) by a = R cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, π/N approaches 0, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. Therefore, in the limit, the radius R is equal to a. So the circular aperture has radius a, so diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/D = 1.22 λ/(2a). Similarly, the second minimum would be at θ = 2.23 λ/(2a). Therefore, the difference is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a, which matches the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance is approximately 1.01 λ/(2a) or 0.505 λ/a. Depending on how precise the answer needs to be, perhaps we can write it as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a. But since the problem states to assume small angles where tanθ ≈ theta, so we can write the answer as approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately 1.013 λ/(2a). But perhaps the answer is expected to be in terms of the Bessel function zeros? But maybe not. Alternatively, since the problem mentions N is infinitely large, so the aperture becomes circular, and the angular distance is the difference between the first two minima of the Airy pattern. The standard result is that the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second at 2.23 λ/D, so the difference is approximately 1.01 λ/D. Since D = 2a, then the difference is 1.01 λ/(2a). So 1.01 is approximately 1.013, so 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Either form is acceptable, but since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", and in the circular aperture case, the minima are not equally spaced, but the first two are separated by approximately 1.22 λ/D and 2.23 λ/D. So the difference is approximately 1.01 λ/D. Since D = 2a, substitute and get 1.01 λ/(2a). But since 1.01 is roughly 1.013, which is (7.0156 - 3.8317)/ (2π) * (λ/a). Wait, 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839, then 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 0.506, so 0.506 λ/a. So maybe the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a.\n\nBut let me check another source or formula. Wait, in the Airy disk, the angular radius of the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is θ = 2.233 λ/D, so the difference is 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, the difference is 1.013 λ/(2a) = 0.5065 λ/a. So approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a, or 1.013 λ/(2a). Depending on how precise we need to be, but since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large", and given that the answer is probably expected in terms of a numerical coefficient times λ/a, then 0.506 is approximately half of lambda over a. But maybe the exact coefficient is (j_2 - j_1)/(2π), where j_1 and j_2 are the first and second zeros of J_1. Since j_1 = 3.8317, j_2 = 7.0156, so the difference is 3.1839, divided by 2π gives approximately 0.506. So 0.506 λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1.22 λ/(2a) is the first minimum, and 2.23 λ/(2a) is the second, so the difference is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a. Either way, it\'s approximately half of lambda over a.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation:\n\nFirst minimum: θ₁ = j1 / (k a) where j1 = 3.8317, k = 2π / λ.

If we want to write it as a multiple of λ/a, then 0.506 is approximately 0.51, but maybe we can write it as (j2 - j1)/(2π) * λ/a, but unless they expect the exact value, which is 3.1839/(2π) ≈ 0.506. So, 0.506 λ/a is the answer.\n\nTherefore, boxed, it would be \\boxed{0.506 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}}.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", so maybe it\'s better to check once again.\n\nAlternatively, is there another approach?

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the angular distance between the first two minima for an N-sided polygonal aperture with apothems of length \(a\) when \(N\) is infinitely large, we recognize that the aperture becomes a circular aperture with radius \(a\). 

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, \(J_1\). The first minimum occurs at the first zero of \(J_1\), which is approximately \(3.8317\), and the second minimum occurs at the second zero, approximately \(7.0156\).

The angular positions of these minima are calculated using the formula:
\[
\theta_m = \frac{j_{1,m} \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]
where \(j_{1,m}\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\).

For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):
\[
\theta_1 = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):
\[
\theta_2 = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2\pi} \frac{\lambda}{a}
\]

Calculating the numerical value:
\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J₁. Therefore, for the first minimum (m=1):

(2π/λ) a θ ≈ 3.8317

Therefore, θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a ≈ 1.22 * λ/(2a)

Which matches the previous formula since 3.8317 / π ≈ 1.22. So, that's the first minimum.

Similarly, the second minimum occurs at j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156:

θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156 / 2π) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 * λ/a ≈ 2.23 * λ/(2a)

Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π) * λ/a ≈ (3.1839)/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.506 * λ/a ≈ 1.013 * λ/(2a)

Wait, let me compute that again. Let's do exact calculation:

θ₁ = 3.8317 / (2π) * λ/a ≈ 3.8317 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a

θ₂ = 7.0156 / (2π) * λ/a ≈ 7.0156 / 6.2832 ≈ 1.116 * λ/a

Therefore, the difference is θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.116 - 0.6098) * λ/a ≈ 0.5062 * λ/a

But since in the problem statement, they mention the angular distance between the first two minima. However, wait, in the case of circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced. The angular distance between consecutive minima increases. So the first minimum is at ~1.22 λ/D, second at ~2.23 λ/D, so the difference is ~1.01 λ/D. But since D = 2a, substituting:

θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 * λ/a

Alternatively, using the approximate coefficients:

First minimum: 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a

Second minimum: 2.23 λ/(2a) = 1.115 λ/a

Difference: 1.115 - 0.61 = 0.505 λ/a

So approximately 0.506 λ/a. But the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, which we've reduced to the circular aperture case. Therefore, the answer should be approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a, which is approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317)/6.2832 * λ/a ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 * λ/a ≈ 0.506 * λ/a. So approximately 0.506 λ/a. But maybe they want an exact coefficient?

Wait, let me check the exact zeros. The first zero of J₁(x) is at x = 3.831705970207512, and the second at x = 7.015586669815618. So the difference is 7.015586669815618 - 3.831705970207512 = 3.183880699608106. Then, divide by 2π to get the angular difference in terms of θ:

Δθ = 3.183880699608106 / (2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 3.183880699608106 / 6.283185307179586 ≈ 0.506 λ/a

So approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. If we multiply numerator and denominator by 2, we get 1.013 λ/(2a), but that's not a standard form. Alternatively, leave it as approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * λ/a, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe in terms of the apothem. Wait, in the original problem, the apothem is a. But when we take N to infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius. Wait, for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to vertex) by a = R cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, π/N approaches 0, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. Therefore, in the limit, the radius R is equal to a. So the circular aperture has radius a, so diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/D = 1.22 λ/(2a). Similarly, the second minimum would be at θ = 2.23 λ/(2a). Therefore, the difference is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a, which matches the previous calculation.

Therefore, the angular distance is approximately 1.01 λ/(2a) or 0.505 λ/a. Depending on how precise the answer needs to be, perhaps we can write it as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a. But since the problem states to assume small angles where tanθ ≈ theta, so we can write the answer as approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately 1.013 λ/(2a). But perhaps the answer is expected to be in terms of the Bessel function zeros? But maybe not. Alternatively, since the problem mentions N is infinitely large, so the aperture becomes circular, and the angular distance is the difference between the first two minima of the Airy pattern. The standard result is that the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second at 2.23 λ/D, so the difference is approximately 1.01 λ/D. Since D = 2a, then the difference is 1.01 λ/(2a). So 1.01 is approximately 1.013, so 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Either form is acceptable, but since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", and in the circular aperture case, the minima are not equally spaced, but the first two are separated by approximately 1.22 λ/D and 2.23 λ/D. So the difference is approximately 1.01 λ/D. Since D = 2a, substitute and get 1.01 λ/(2a). But since 1.01 is roughly 1.013, which is (7.0156 - 3.8317)/ (2π) * (λ/a). Wait, 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839, then 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 0.506, so 0.506 λ/a. So maybe the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

But let me check another source or formula. Wait, in the Airy disk, the angular radius of the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is θ = 2.233 λ/D, so the difference is 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, the difference is 1.013 λ/(2a) = 0.5065 λ/a. So approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a, or 1.013 λ/(2a). Depending on how precise we need to be, but since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large", and given that the answer is probably expected in terms of a numerical coefficient times λ/a, then 0.506 is approximately half of lambda over a. But maybe the exact coefficient is (j_2 - j_1)/(2π), where j_1 and j_2 are the first and second zeros of J_1. Since j_1 = 3.8317, j_2 = 7.0156, so the difference is 3.1839, divided by 2π gives approximately 0.506. So 0.506 λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe 1.22 λ/(2a) is the first minimum, and 2.23 λ/(2a) is the second, so the difference is (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a. Either way, it's approximately half of lambda over a.

But let me check the exact calculation:

First minimum: θ₁ = j1 / (k a) where j1 = 3.8317, k = 2π / λ. Therefore,

θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π a)

Similarly, θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π a)

Difference Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π a) = 3.1839 * λ / (6.2832 a) ≈ 0.506 * λ / a

Therefore, the angular distance is approximately 0.506 λ/a. If we want to write it as a multiple of λ/a, then 0.506 is approximately 0.51, but maybe we can write it as (j2 - j1)/(2π) * λ/a, but unless they expect the exact value, which is 3.1839/(2π) ≈ 0.506. So, 0.506 λ/a is the answer.

Therefore, boxed, it would be \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

But wait, the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", so maybe it's better to check once again.

Alternatively, is there another approach? The original aperture is an N-sided polygon with apothems of length a. As N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle with radius a. The question then reduces to the circular aperture diffraction problem, where the first minima are separated by the angles calculated above.

Alternatively, if we didn't take the limit, but considered a polygon with N sides, the diffraction pattern would have N-fold symmetry. But as N approaches infinity, the symmetry becomes continuous, i.e., circular. Therefore, the diffraction pattern becomes the Airy pattern, confirming our previous approach.

Therefore, the answer is the angular separation between first two minima of the Airy disk, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a. So, yes, the answer should be approximately 0.506 λ/a. Since the problem allows the small angle approximation, and the angles are small, we can safely use the approximation.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

**Final Answer**
The angular distance between the first two minima is \boxed{0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}}.

Wait, but in the standard formula, the first minimum is given by 1.22λ/D. Let me check where that comes from.\n\nYes, the first zero of J₁(x) is at x ≈ 3.8317. The formula θ ≈ 1.22λ/D comes from rearranging this. Let\'s confirm:\n\nThe condition is k a sinθ = j_{1,1}\n\nk = 2π/λ, so (2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317\n\nSolving for sinθ: sinθ = 3.8317 λ / (2π a)\n\nBut 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6098 ≈ 0.61, so sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ / a. However, since D = 2a, then sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ / D. So that matches the standard formula. So the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ / D = 1.22 λ / (2a).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at θ₁ = j_{1,1} λ/(2π a), and the second minimum would be at θ₂ = j_{1,2} λ/(2π a). The angular distance would be θ₂ - θ₁ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a).\n\nLet me check the values of j_{1,1} and j_{1,2}:\n\n- First zero of J₁(x): j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317\n- Second zero of J₁(x): j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156\n\nSo the difference is approximately 7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. Then the angular separation would be Δθ ≈ 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.\n\nBut wait, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a). Let\'s check whether this aligns with the Bessel approach. Let\'s compute 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6096, so θ₁ = 0.6096 λ/a. But 1.22 λ/(2a) is 0.61 λ/a, which matches. So that\'s consistent.\n\nSo θ₂ would be j_{1,2} λ/(2π a) ≈ 7.0156/(2π) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a. Then the angular distance between θ₂ and θ₁ is approximately 1.116 λ/a - 0.6096 λ/a ≈ 0.5064 λ/a. So approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps there is a more precise coefficient here. Let me compute the exact difference.\n\nj_{1,2} - j_{1,1} = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. Then dividing by 2π gives 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067. So Δθ ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. However, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the standard 1.22 factor. Wait, but the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima" for a circular aperture. Wait, but in circular diffraction, the pattern is a central Airy disk, and then rings. The first minimum is the edge of the Airy disk, the second minimum is the next dark ring. However, perhaps the problem is referring to the first two minima in the same direction, but since the problem is circularly symmetric, the minima are rings, so the angular separation would be the difference in their radii.\n\nBut since the question states "angular distance between the first two minima," this would correspond to the angle from the center to the first minimum (θ₁) and then to the second minimum (θ₂), but in circular diffraction, each minimum is a ring, so the angular distance between consecutive minima would be θ₂ - θ₁. So in that case, the answer would be approximately 0.506 λ/a. But maybe I should check standard references.\n\nWait, the standard Airy disk formula gives the first minimum at θ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. For the second minimum, let\'s check its position. The second zero of J₁ is at j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156. So using the same formula, the angle for the second minimum would be θ₂ = (7.0156 / π) * λ/(2a) ≈ (7.0156 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 2.233 * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a. Then the angular separation between first and second minima is θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ 1.1165 λ/a - 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact values:\n\nFirst minimum angle: θ₁ = (j_{1,1}/π) * λ/(2a) = (3.8317 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.2197 * λ/(2a) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a.\n\nSecond minimum angle: θ₂ = (7.0156 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 2.233 * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a.\n\nDifference: 1.1165 λ/a - 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. So approximately 0.507 λ/a.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the standard 1.22 factor. Wait, but the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, which is 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. The second minimum, if we use the second zero, would be at 2.233 λ/(2a) = 1.1165 λ/a. Then the difference is 0.5065 λ/a. So about 0.51 λ/a. If we need to express this in terms of the first minimum\'s coefficient, maybe there\'s another approach. But perhaps the answer is simply (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 3.1839/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. So approximately 0.51 λ/a. But maybe the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a). But since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima," and the answer is expected to be in a box, perhaps expressed as a numerical coefficient times λ/a. Let me check standard references for the positions of the minima in circular diffraction.\n\nUpon checking, the first minimum is indeed at θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.23 λ/D. Then, since D = 2a, substituting gives θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) and θ₂ ≈ 2.23 λ/(2a). The difference would be (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) ≈ 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a. So approximately 0.505 λ/a. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Since the problem states to use the small angle approximation, and the answer is likely a numerical factor times λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a, which rounds to approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, maybe there\'s a more precise coefficient. Let me compute the exact value.\n\nGiven j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317059702075123156,\n\nj_{1,2} ≈ 7.0155866698156187535.\n\nDifference: 7.0155866698156187535 - 3.8317059702075123156 ≈ 3.1838806996081064379.\n\nDivide by 2π: 3.1838806996081064379 / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1838807 / 6.2831853 ≈ 0.5067.\n\nSo 0.5067 λ/a. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a, but maybe the problem expects it in terms of a fraction. Let\'s see: 3.18388 / (2π) ≈ 0.5066. So 0.5066 is approximately 0.51, but perhaps as a fraction, maybe 3.18388 is approximately (3.18388) ≈ (10/π) because 10/π ≈ 3.1831, which is very close. So 10/π divided by 2π would be 10/(2π²) ≈ 10/(19.7392) ≈ 0.5066. Therefore, 10/(2π²) ≈ 0.5066. Therefore, the angular separation is 10/(2π²) * (λ/a) = (5/π²) * (λ/a). Since 5/π² ≈ 5/9.8696 ≈ 0.5067. So this gives a precise expression: Δθ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a = (5/π²) * λ/a. Wait, but 10/(2π²) is 5/π². But 10/(2π²) is indeed 5/π². But where does 10 come from? Wait, j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388, which is approximately 10/π, as 10/π ≈ 3.1830988618. So, j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 10/π. Then, (10/π)/(2π) = 10/(2π²) = 5/π². Therefore, Δθ ≈ 5/(π²) * λ/a. Calculating 5/(π²) gives approximately 0.5066. So, as an exact expression, it\'s (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a, but perhaps the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a more straightforward approach when N approaches infinity, considering the aperture becomes a circle.\n\nBut let\'s verify if this approach is correct. The original problem is a polygon with N sides, apothems equal to a. When N tends to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a, since apothem a = R cos(π/N) → R as N → ∞. Therefore, the problem reduces to circular aperture diffraction. Hence, the angular distance between first two minima is indeed as computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Fourier transform for a circular aperture. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture involves the Bessel function, leading to the Airy pattern. The minima occur where J₁(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J₁ are at k a sinθ = j_{1,m}, so sinθ = j_{1,m}/(k a) = j_{1,m} λ/(2π a). For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ j_{1,m} λ/(2π a). Therefore, the angular separation between the first two minima is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * (λ/a). If we use more precise values for the zeros of J₁:\n\nj_{1,1} = 3.8317059702075123156,\n\nj_{1,2} = 7.0155866698156187535,\n\nDifference: 7.0155866698156187535 - 3.8317059702075123156 = 3.1838806996081064379.\n\nDivide by 2π: 3.1838806996081064379 / (2 * 3.14159265358979323846) ≈ 3.1838806996081064379 / 6.28318530717958647693 ≈ 0.50663274577934086794.\n\nSo, approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Depending on the required precision, this could be approximated as 0.51 λ/a. However, since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large," and given that the answer should use small angle approximation, the exact coefficient would be (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π), which is approximately 0.5066. But perhaps the answer is better left in terms of Bessel function zeros. However, given the problem\'s context, it\'s more likely expecting the numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s an alternative approach using the polygon\'s properties before taking the limit. Let\'s consider that approach.\n\nFor a regular N-sided polygon with apothem a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, given by a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to vertex). As N approaches infinity, R approaches a, since cos(π/N) approaches 1.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, the electric field is the Fourier transform of the aperture function. For a regular polygon, the aperture function is more complex, but as N becomes large, it approximates a circle, so the diffraction pattern should approach that of a circular aperture.\n\nBut perhaps for a polygon with N sides, even large N, the diffraction pattern would have N-fold symmetry, but as N→∞, the symmetry becomes continuous, resulting in circular symmetry. Therefore, the first minima would approach those of a circular aperture. Hence, the answer should be the same as for the circular aperture, which we calculated as approximately 0.5066 λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the formula for a polygon and then taking N→∞. Let\'s consider that.\n\nLet me think: For a polygonal aperture, the Fourier transform (diffraction pattern) can be calculated, but it\'s more complicated. The aperture can be considered as the intersection of N half-planes. However, for large N, this becomes a circle. The diffraction pattern would then be the same as for a circular aperture. Therefore, the result would match the circular aperture case.\n\nTherefore, the angular separation between the first two minima when N is infinitely large is approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Rounding to two decimal places, 0.51 λ/a. However, since exact expressions are preferred in physics, perhaps expressing it as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a, but since the problem asks for the answer in a box and likely expects a numerical coefficient, 0.51 λ/a might be acceptable, but maybe more precise as 0.5066 λ/a. However, in standard references, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at 2.23 λ/D. Let\'s check using D=2a:\n\nFirst minimum: θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a\n\nSecond minimum: θ₂ = 2.23 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.115 λ/a\n\nDifference: 1.115 - 0.61 = 0.505 λ/a.\n\nTherefore, 0.505 λ/a. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a, but with the exact value being approximately 0.506 λ/a. However, given that the problem states to use the small angle approximation and that the answer is to be boxed, I think the answer is best expressed as approximately (0.506)λ/a. But maybe there is a more exact expression.\n\nWait, 3.1838807 divided by 2π is exactly 3.1838807/(2π) ≈ 0.506632745. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a.\n\nBut I should check if there\'s any standard formula for the separation between the first two minima for a circular aperture. Upon checking, most references mention the first minimum (Airy disk) but not the second minimum\'s position as commonly. However, according to some sources, the second minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle θ ≈ 2.23 λ/D, which for D=2a, would be θ ≈ 2.23 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.115 λ/a. So the difference between first and second minima is 1.115 - 0.61 ≈ 0.505 λ/a. Therefore, the angular separation is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Thus, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, since the exact calculation gives 0.5066, perhaps the problem expects this more precise value. But in exams or standard problems, sometimes approximate coefficients are used. However, given that the problem mentions "angular distance between the first two minima," and given the calculated value is approximately 0.507 λ/a, perhaps the answer is \\boxed{0.51 \\lambda/a}. Alternatively, if expressed as a fraction involving π, but since 0.5066 is approximately 5/(π²), which is about 0.5066, perhaps that\'s another way. 5/π² is exactly 5/(3.1416)^2 ≈ 5/9.8696 ≈ 0.5067. Therefore, another way to write it is \\boxed{\\frac{5\\lambda}{\\pi^2 a}}.\n\nBut let me check if 5/π² is indeed equal to (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π). Given that j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388, and 3.18388/(2π) ≈ 0.5066. But 5/π² ≈ 0.5066 as well. Therefore, 5/π² is exactly equal to (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) only if 3.18388 = 5/π. Let\'s check: 5/π ≈ 1.5915, but 3.18388 is roughly twice that. Wait, 3.18388 ≈ 2*(5/π) ≈ 3.1831. Indeed, 5/π ≈ 1.5915, so 2*(5/π) ≈ 3.1830, which is very close to j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388. Therefore, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) ≈ 2*(5/π). Therefore, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) ≈ (2*(5/π))/(2π) = 5/π². Therefore, Δθ = 5/(π²) * λ/a. Hence, the exact expression is 5λ/(π²a), which is approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Therefore, the answer can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{5 \\lambda}{\\pi^2 a}} or approximately 0.51 \\lambda/a.\n\nBut since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large," and given that the transition from polygon to circle leads to the standard circular aperture result, the answer should be expressed as 5λ/(π²a). However, I need to verify if this is indeed accurate. Let me confirm:\n\nGiven that j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317 and j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156, then:\n\nθ₁ = j_{1,1}/(k a) = j_{1,1} * λ/(2π a)\n\nθ₂ = j_{1,2} * λ/(2π a)\n\nΔθ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.\n\nBut 3.1839 is approximately 10/π (since 10/π ≈ 3.1831), so:\n\nΔθ ≈ (10/π) * λ/(2π a) = 10/(2π²) * λ/a = 5/(π²) * λ/a.\n\nHence, Δθ = 5λ/(π²a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.\n\nTherefore, the exact expression is 5λ/(π²a), and the approximate decimal value is ~0.5067λ/a.\n\nSince the problem allows for small angle approximation and doesn\'t specify the form of the answer, but given that they mentioned using tanθ ≈ θ, which is a small angle approximation, and considering that 5/π² is an exact coefficient, I think the answer should be presented as \\boxed{\\dfrac{5 \\lambda}{\\pi^2 a}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a numerical coefficient, they might prefer 0.51λ/a, but given the exact expression in terms of π is more precise and likely preferred in a physics context, especially since the zeros of Bessel functions are known constants.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

When considering a regular N-sided polygonal aperture with apothems of length \(a\), as \(N\) approaches infinity, the polygon effectively becomes a circle with radius \(a\). The problem then reduces to diffraction by a circular aperture of radius \(a\).

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, \(J_1\). The first minimum occurs at the first zero of \(J_1\), \(j_{1,1} \approx 3.8317\), and the second minimum occurs at the second zero, \(j_{1,2} \approx 7.0156\).

The angular position of the \(m\)-th minimum is given by:
\[
\theta_m = \frac{j_{1,m} \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]
where \(j_{1,m}\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\).

The angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

Substituting the values of the zeros:
\[
j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} \approx 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839
\]

Thus, the angular distance is:
\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx \frac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}
\]

Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima when \(N\) is infinitely large is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}}
\]

Wait, but for circular apertures, the first minimum is at j_{1,1} = 3.8317. Wait, but in the standard formula, the first minimum is given by 1.22λ/D. Let me check where that comes from.

Yes, the first zero of J₁(x) is at x ≈ 3.8317. The formula θ ≈ 1.22λ/D comes from rearranging this. Let's confirm:

The condition is k a sinθ = j_{1,1}

k = 2π/λ, so (2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317

Solving for sinθ: sinθ = 3.8317 λ / (2π a)

But 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6098 ≈ 0.61, so sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ / a. However, since D = 2a, then sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ / D. So that matches the standard formula. So the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ / D = 1.22 λ / (2a).

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at θ₁ = j_{1,1} λ/(2π a), and the second minimum would be at θ₂ = j_{1,2} λ/(2π a). The angular distance would be θ₂ - θ₁ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a).

Let me check the values of j_{1,1} and j_{1,2}:

- First zero of J₁(x): j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317
- Second zero of J₁(x): j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156

So the difference is approximately 7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. Then the angular separation would be Δθ ≈ 3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

But wait, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a). Let's check whether this aligns with the Bessel approach. Let's compute 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.6096, so θ₁ = 0.6096 λ/a. But 1.22 λ/(2a) is 0.61 λ/a, which matches. So that's consistent.

So θ₂ would be j_{1,2} λ/(2π a) ≈ 7.0156/(2π) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a. Then the angular distance between θ₂ and θ₁ is approximately 1.116 λ/a - 0.6096 λ/a ≈ 0.5064 λ/a. So approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps there is a more precise coefficient here. Let me compute the exact difference.

j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. Then dividing by 2π gives 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067. So Δθ ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. However, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the standard 1.22 factor. Wait, but the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima" for a circular aperture. Wait, but in circular diffraction, the pattern is a central Airy disk, and then rings. The first minimum is the edge of the Airy disk, the second minimum is the next dark ring. However, perhaps the problem is referring to the first two minima in the same direction, but since the problem is circularly symmetric, the minima are rings, so the angular separation would be the difference in their radii.

But since the question states "angular distance between the first two minima," this would correspond to the angle from the center to the first minimum (θ₁) and then to the second minimum (θ₂), but in circular diffraction, each minimum is a ring, so the angular distance between consecutive minima would be θ₂ - θ₁. So in that case, the answer would be approximately 0.506 λ/a. But maybe I should check standard references.

Wait, the standard Airy disk formula gives the first minimum at θ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. For the second minimum, let's check its position. The second zero of J₁ is at j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156. So using the same formula, the angle for the second minimum would be θ₂ = (7.0156 / π) * λ/(2a) ≈ (7.0156 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 2.233 * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a. Then the angular separation between first and second minima is θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ 1.1165 λ/a - 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.

Alternatively, if I use the exact values:

First minimum angle: θ₁ = (j_{1,1}/π) * λ/(2a) = (3.8317 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.2197 * λ/(2a) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a.

Second minimum angle: θ₂ = (7.0156 / 3.1416) * λ/(2a) ≈ 2.233 * λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a.

Difference: 1.1165 λ/a - 0.6098 λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. So approximately 0.507 λ/a.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the standard 1.22 factor. Wait, but the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, which is 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. The second minimum, if we use the second zero, would be at 2.233 λ/(2a) = 1.1165 λ/a. Then the difference is 0.5065 λ/a. So about 0.51 λ/a. If we need to express this in terms of the first minimum's coefficient, maybe there's another approach. But perhaps the answer is simply (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 3.1839/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. So approximately 0.51 λ/a. But maybe the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a). But since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima," and the answer is expected to be in a box, perhaps expressed as a numerical coefficient times λ/a. Let me check standard references for the positions of the minima in circular diffraction.

Upon checking, the first minimum is indeed at θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.23 λ/D. Then, since D = 2a, substituting gives θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) and θ₂ ≈ 2.23 λ/(2a). The difference would be (2.23 - 1.22) λ/(2a) ≈ 1.01 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.505 λ/a. So approximately 0.505 λ/a. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Since the problem states to use the small angle approximation, and the answer is likely a numerical factor times λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a, which rounds to approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, maybe there's a more precise coefficient. Let me compute the exact value.

Given j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317059702075123156,

j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0155866698156187535.

Difference: 7.0155866698156187535 - 3.8317059702075123156 ≈ 3.1838806996081064379.

Divide by 2π: 3.1838806996081064379 / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1838807 / 6.2831853 ≈ 0.5067.

So 0.5067 λ/a. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a, but maybe the problem expects it in terms of a fraction. Let's see: 3.18388 / (2π) ≈ 0.5066. So 0.5066 is approximately 0.51, but perhaps as a fraction, maybe 3.18388 is approximately (3.18388) ≈ (10/π) because 10/π ≈ 3.1831, which is very close. So 10/π divided by 2π would be 10/(2π²) ≈ 10/(19.7392) ≈ 0.5066. Therefore, 10/(2π²) ≈ 0.5066. Therefore, the angular separation is 10/(2π²) * (λ/a) = (5/π²) * (λ/a). Since 5/π² ≈ 5/9.8696 ≈ 0.5067. So this gives a precise expression: Δθ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a = (5/π²) * λ/a. Wait, but 10/(2π²) is 5/π². But 10/(2π²) is indeed 5/π². But where does 10 come from? Wait, j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388, which is approximately 10/π, as 10/π ≈ 3.1830988618. So, j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 10/π. Then, (10/π)/(2π) = 10/(2π²) = 5/π². Therefore, Δθ ≈ 5/(π²) * λ/a. Calculating 5/(π²) gives approximately 0.5066. So, as an exact expression, it's (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a, but perhaps the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward approach when N approaches infinity, considering the aperture becomes a circle.

But let's verify if this approach is correct. The original problem is a polygon with N sides, apothems equal to a. When N tends to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a, since apothem a = R cos(π/N) → R as N → ∞. Therefore, the problem reduces to circular aperture diffraction. Hence, the angular distance between first two minima is indeed as computed.

Alternatively, maybe using Fourier transform for a circular aperture. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture involves the Bessel function, leading to the Airy pattern. The minima occur where J₁(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J₁ are at k a sinθ = j_{1,m}, so sinθ = j_{1,m}/(k a) = j_{1,m} λ/(2π a). For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ j_{1,m} λ/(2π a). Therefore, the angular separation between the first two minima is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * (λ/a). If we use more precise values for the zeros of J₁:

j_{1,1} = 3.8317059702075123156,

j_{1,2} = 7.0155866698156187535,

Difference: 7.0155866698156187535 - 3.8317059702075123156 = 3.1838806996081064379.

Divide by 2π: 3.1838806996081064379 / (2 * 3.14159265358979323846) ≈ 3.1838806996081064379 / 6.28318530717958647693 ≈ 0.50663274577934086794.

So, approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Depending on the required precision, this could be approximated as 0.51 λ/a. However, since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large," and given that the answer should use small angle approximation, the exact coefficient would be (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π), which is approximately 0.5066. But perhaps the answer is better left in terms of Bessel function zeros. However, given the problem's context, it's more likely expecting the numerical value.

Alternatively, maybe there's an alternative approach using the polygon's properties before taking the limit. Let's consider that approach.

For a regular N-sided polygon with apothem a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, given by a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to vertex). As N approaches infinity, R approaches a, since cos(π/N) approaches 1.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, the electric field is the Fourier transform of the aperture function. For a regular polygon, the aperture function is more complex, but as N becomes large, it approximates a circle, so the diffraction pattern should approach that of a circular aperture.

But perhaps for a polygon with N sides, even large N, the diffraction pattern would have N-fold symmetry, but as N→∞, the symmetry becomes continuous, resulting in circular symmetry. Therefore, the first minima would approach those of a circular aperture. Hence, the answer should be the same as for the circular aperture, which we calculated as approximately 0.5066 λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the formula for a polygon and then taking N→∞. Let's consider that.

Let me think: For a polygonal aperture, the Fourier transform (diffraction pattern) can be calculated, but it's more complicated. The aperture can be considered as the intersection of N half-planes. However, for large N, this becomes a circle. The diffraction pattern would then be the same as for a circular aperture. Therefore, the result would match the circular aperture case.

Therefore, the angular separation between the first two minima when N is infinitely large is approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Rounding to two decimal places, 0.51 λ/a. However, since exact expressions are preferred in physics, perhaps expressing it as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a, but since the problem asks for the answer in a box and likely expects a numerical coefficient, 0.51 λ/a might be acceptable, but maybe more precise as 0.5066 λ/a. However, in standard references, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at 2.23 λ/D. Let's check using D=2a:

First minimum: θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a

Second minimum: θ₂ = 2.23 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.115 λ/a

Difference: 1.115 - 0.61 = 0.505 λ/a.

Therefore, 0.505 λ/a. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a, but with the exact value being approximately 0.506 λ/a. However, given that the problem states to use the small angle approximation and that the answer is to be boxed, I think the answer is best expressed as approximately (0.506)λ/a. But maybe there is a more exact expression.

Wait, 3.1838807 divided by 2π is exactly 3.1838807/(2π) ≈ 0.506632745. So perhaps the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a.

But I should check if there's any standard formula for the separation between the first two minima for a circular aperture. Upon checking, most references mention the first minimum (Airy disk) but not the second minimum's position as commonly. However, according to some sources, the second minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle θ ≈ 2.23 λ/D, which for D=2a, would be θ ≈ 2.23 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.115 λ/a. So the difference between first and second minima is 1.115 - 0.61 ≈ 0.505 λ/a. Therefore, the angular separation is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Thus, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, since the exact calculation gives 0.5066, perhaps the problem expects this more precise value. But in exams or standard problems, sometimes approximate coefficients are used. However, given that the problem mentions "angular distance between the first two minima," and given the calculated value is approximately 0.507 λ/a, perhaps the answer is \boxed{0.51 \lambda/a}. Alternatively, if expressed as a fraction involving π, but since 0.5066 is approximately 5/(π²), which is about 0.5066, perhaps that's another way. 5/π² is exactly 5/(3.1416)^2 ≈ 5/9.8696 ≈ 0.5067. Therefore, another way to write it is \boxed{\frac{5\lambda}{\pi^2 a}}.

But let me check if 5/π² is indeed equal to (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π). Given that j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388, and 3.18388/(2π) ≈ 0.5066. But 5/π² ≈ 0.5066 as well. Therefore, 5/π² is exactly equal to (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) only if 3.18388 = 5/π. Let's check: 5/π ≈ 1.5915, but 3.18388 is roughly twice that. Wait, 3.18388 ≈ 2*(5/π) ≈ 3.1831. Indeed, 5/π ≈ 1.5915, so 2*(5/π) ≈ 3.1830, which is very close to j_{1,2} - j_{1,1} ≈ 3.18388. Therefore, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) ≈ 2*(5/π). Therefore, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) ≈ (2*(5/π))/(2π) = 5/π². Therefore, Δθ = 5/(π²) * λ/a. Hence, the exact expression is 5λ/(π²a), which is approximately 0.5066 λ/a. Therefore, the answer can be written as \boxed{\dfrac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}} or approximately 0.51 \lambda/a.

But since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large," and given that the transition from polygon to circle leads to the standard circular aperture result, the answer should be expressed as 5λ/(π²a). However, I need to verify if this is indeed accurate. Let me confirm:

Given that j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317 and j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156, then:

θ₁ = j_{1,1}/(k a) = j_{1,1} * λ/(2π a)

θ₂ = j_{1,2} * λ/(2π a)

Δθ = (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.

But 3.1839 is approximately 10/π (since 10/π ≈ 3.1831), so:

Δθ ≈ (10/π) * λ/(2π a) = 10/(2π²) * λ/a = 5/(π²) * λ/a.

Hence, Δθ = 5λ/(π²a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a.

Therefore, the exact expression is 5λ/(π²a), and the approximate decimal value is ~0.5067λ/a.

Since the problem allows for small angle approximation and doesn't specify the form of the answer, but given that they mentioned using tanθ ≈ θ, which is a small angle approximation, and considering that 5/π² is an exact coefficient, I think the answer should be presented as \boxed{\dfrac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}}.

Alternatively, if the problem expects a numerical coefficient, they might prefer 0.51λ/a, but given the exact expression in terms of π is more precise and likely preferred in a physics context, especially since the zeros of Bessel functions are known constants. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}}.

**Final Answer**
The angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large is \boxed{\dfrac{5 \lambda}{\pi^2 a}}.

Let me check if these align. Since D = 2a, substituting gives θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (2a) ≈ 0.61 λ / a. Comparing with the Bessel zero approach:\n\nj_{1,1} = 3.8317, so θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.61 * λ/a. That matches the standard formula, so that\'s correct.\n\nSimilarly, θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 * λ/a\n\nSo the difference is 1.116 - 0.61 ≈ 0.506 * λ/a, which is consistent.\n\nHence, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But let me check if the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima". Wait, in the case of circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second minimum would be the next dark ring. But in some contexts, people might refer to the first minimum as the first dark ring (m=1), and the next as m=2. So yes, that\'s correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should verify if there\'s a formula for the angular separation between the first and second minima. Alternatively, perhaps another way of looking at it is through the approximation for the Airy disk. But in any case, using the zeros of the Bessel function gives the precise values.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall, the angular separation between consecutive minima in a circular aperture\'s diffraction pattern isn\'t a constant, but increases with each subsequent minimum. However, given that the problem specifies small angles, the linear approximation holds, and so the difference between θ₂ and θ₁ is approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). Which is exactly what I calculated above.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 * λ/a. But let me verify the exact value of the numerical coefficient.\n\nCalculating 3.1839 divided by 2π:\n\n3.1839 / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.283185307 ≈ 0.5067. So approximately 0.5067 λ/a. To three decimal places, that\'s 0.507, but perhaps the problem expects an exact expression in terms of the difference of the Bessel zeros over 2π, or a simplified fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). But the problem states to express the answer in terms of given variables, so maybe just the numerical coefficient times λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the approximation for large N, but since we are taking N to infinity, the circular aperture result is exactly applicable. Hence, the answer is the angular separation between the first two minima of a circular aperture, which is approximately 0.507 λ/a.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a standard expression for this. Wait, in the circular aperture case, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/D, as mentioned. Then, the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D (since 7.0156 / (2π) ≈ 1.116, and 1.116 * λ/a = 1.116 * λ/(D/2) = 2.233 λ/D). But since D = 2a, θ₂ ≈ 2.233 λ/(2a) = 1.116 λ/a, so the difference is 1.116 - 0.61 ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Yes, that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * (λ/a). Let\'s compute that:\n\n(j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) = 7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈ 3.1839\n\nSo 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 0.506, so 0.506 λ/a.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an exact answer. However, the Bessel zeros are transcendental numbers, so unless there\'s a specific coefficient expected, the approximate numerical value should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach when considering the polygon with infinitely many sides. Let me think. If we model the polygon as a circle in the limit as N→∞, then the diffraction pattern would be the same as for a circular aperture. Therefore, the first two minima would indeed be given by the zeros of the Bessel function as calculated. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the apothem a. Since for a circle, the apothem and radius become the same as N→∞, so the radius R = a. Therefore, the standard formula for the circular aperture applies here.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn\'t take the circular aperture approach, perhaps I could derive it for the polygon. But given that N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, so the result must be the same. So I think the answer is indeed Δθ ≈ (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.\n\nBut let me check some references. For a circular aperture, the angular radius of the first dark ring (first minimum) is θ ≈ 1.22 λ/D. The second dark ring is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D. Therefore, the separation is 2.233 - 1.22 = 1.013 λ/D. But since D = 2a, substituting gives 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So that\'s the same as before. Hence, the answer is approximately 0.5065 λ/a. Rounding to three significant figures, that\'s 0.507 λ/a, but perhaps the question expects an exact fraction or multiple of π. Wait, but the zeros of the Bessel functions are known constants. Let me check their exact values.\n\nFrom tables, the first zero of J₁(x) is approximately 3.831705970207512, and the second is approximately 7.015586669815619. Therefore, the difference is 7.015586669815619 - 3.831705970207512 ≈ 3.183880699608107. Then, 3.1838807 / (2π) ≈ 3.1838807 / 6.283185307 ≈ 0.5067.\n\nSo, the exact coefficient would be (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) ≈ 0.5067. Therefore, the angular separation is approximately 0.5067 λ/a. So, depending on the required precision, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, if the problem expects a symbolic answer in terms of the Bessel zeros, but since it\'s a numerical answer, the approximate value is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps when N is very large but finite, the polygon\'s diffraction pattern approaches that of a circle, but maybe there\'s a different consideration. However, the problem states N is infinitely large, so it\'s precisely a circle. Therefore, the answer for a circular aperture applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for a polygon and take the limit as N→∞. Let\'s explore that.\n\nFor a regular N-sided polygon, the aperture can be considered as a function that is 1 inside the polygon and 0 outside. The Fourier transform of this aperture (Fraunhofer diffraction) would give the diffraction pattern. In the limit as N→∞, this becomes the Fourier transform of a circle, which is the Airy pattern.\n\nBut maybe for a polygon, the diffraction pattern can be calculated by considering the Fourier transform. For a regular polygon, the far-field diffraction pattern can be found by integrating over the polygonal aperture. However, this integral might be complicated, but perhaps in the limit as N→∞, it simplifies to the circular case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using polar coordinates, the polygon with N sides can be approximated as a circle with perturbations, but as N→∞, the perturbations vanish, leading to the circular aperture result. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima would approach that of the circular aperture.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed the same as for a circular aperture, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a, or more precisely, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. Since the problem allows the use of small angle approximation, and asks for the angular distance, this should be the answer.\n\nBut just to confirm, let me check another source. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D. The angular separation is therefore approximately 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, this becomes 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a, which is the same as before. So, 0.5065 λ/a.\n\nTherefore, rounding to three significant figures, 0.507 λ/a. However, the problem might want the answer expressed as a multiple of λ/a with the exact coefficient from the Bessel zeros. If we compute (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π):\n\n(7.015586669815619 - 3.831705970207512) / (2 * π) ≈ 3.183880699608107 / 6.283185307179586 ≈ 0.5067.\n\nSo, 0.5067 λ/a. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of these Bessel zeros. However, since they are transcendental numbers, we can\'t express them as fractions. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the first zero, but I think the key is that when N approaches infinity, the problem reduces to the circular aperture case, and the angular separation between first two minima is approximately 0.507 λ/a.\n\nTherefore, after all that, the answer should be approximately 0.51 times λ/a. However, since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", and given that in the circular case, the minima are separated by approximately 0.5067 λ/a, which is approximately half the wavelength over the apothem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a factor of 2 missing. Let me check again. The first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. D = 2a, so θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ₂ ≈ 2.233 λ/D ≈ 2.233 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a. The difference is 1.1165 - 0.61 ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So yes, that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of radius R = a (since for N→∞, R = a), the formula for the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/(2R), and the second is θ = 2.233 λ/(2R). The difference is (2.233 - 1.22) λ/(2R) = 1.013 λ/(2R) = 0.5065 λ/R. Since R = a, it\'s 0.5065 λ/a. Therefore, the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. But given the problem states "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large", and given the process, the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. Depending on the required precision, but likely 0.51 λ/a is acceptable, or writing it as (approximately) 0.507 λ/a. However, perhaps the problem expects an exact expression in terms of the Bessel zeros. But since the problem mentions to use the small angle approximation and gives that tanθ ≈ θ, which we\'ve used, and since the zeros of the Bessel function are known, maybe the answer is expected to be written in terms of those zeros divided by 2π.\n\nBut since it\'s a numerical answer, I think the expected answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, in many textbooks, the first minimum for a circular aperture is given as 1.22 λ/D, so the separation between first and second minima would be the next zero, which is at approximately 2.233 λ/D, so the difference is 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, this becomes 0.5065 λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Hence, the box answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{1.22 \\lambda}{2a}} but wait, that\'s the first minimum. Wait, no. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nBut according to the standard formula, θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) and θ₂ = 2.233 λ/(2a). Therefore, the difference is (2.233 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So, the answer is approximately 0.5065 λ/a. But 0.5065 is approximately 0.51 when rounded to two decimal places. However, in terms of exact constants, (j₂ - j₁)/(2π) where j₁ and j₂ are the first and second zeros of J₁. So, perhaps the problem expects the answer expressed as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) \\lambda / (2\\pi a). But since they are constants, we can write the numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of the zeros, but I think given the context, a numerical coefficient is acceptable. Hence, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a, so boxed as \\boxed{0.51 \\dfrac{\\lambda}{a}}.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The exact difference between the second and first zeros of J₁ is approximately 3.1839. Dividing by 2π gives approximately 0.5067. So, 0.5067 λ/a. To two decimal places, that\'s 0.51 λ/a. However, if the problem expects three significant figures, it would be 0.507 λ/a. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, maybe they want an exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1.22 λ/(2a) for the first minimum, but the difference would need to be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach. For example, when considering a polygon with N sides and apothems a, as N approaches infinity, the perimeter approaches 2πa (since the apothem a relates to the circumference). However, maybe the diffraction calculation would involve integrating over the polygon\'s area. But in the limit of N→∞, the polygon becomes a circle, so the Fourier transform (diffraction pattern) becomes that of a circular aperture. Therefore, the first minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function as calculated.\n\nTherefore, after thorough consideration, the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large is approximately 0.51 times λ/a. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{0.51 \\dfrac{\\lambda}{a}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is \\boxed{0.51 \\dfrac{\\lambda}{a}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390283, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4147, prompt_tokens=741, total_tokens=4888, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the angular distance between the first two minima for a polygonal aperture with N sides (where N approaches infinity) and apothem \(a\), we consider the aperture as a circular aperture with radius \(a\) (since the apothem of a regular polygon approaches the radius as N becomes large).

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind \(J_1\). The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are approximately \(3.8317\) and \(7.0156\). The angular positions of the minima are:

\[
\theta_m \approx \frac{j_{1,m} \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

where \(j_{1,m}\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):

\[
\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\]

Calculating the numerical factor:

\[
\frac{3.1839}{2\pi} \approx 0.5067
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx 0.5067 \frac{\lambda}{a}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

\[
\boxed{0.51 \dfrac{\lambda}{a}}
\]

where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J₁. For the first minimum (m=1), j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317, and for the second (m=2), j_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156.

Expressed in terms of θ:

sinθ ≈ j_{1,m} * λ / (2π a)

Again, for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ_m ≈ j_{1,m} * λ / (2π a)

Therefore, the angular positions are:

θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2π a)

θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π a)

The angular distance between the first two minima is θ₂ - θ₁:

Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a)

Calculating the numerical factor: 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839

Then, 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.506 ≈ 0.506

Thus, Δθ ≈ 0.506 * λ / a

But wait, the standard formula for the first minimum is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. Let me check if these align. Since D = 2a, substituting gives θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (2a) ≈ 0.61 λ / a. Comparing with the Bessel zero approach:

j_{1,1} = 3.8317, so θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.61 * λ/a. That matches the standard formula, so that's correct.

Similarly, θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 * λ/a

So the difference is 1.116 - 0.61 ≈ 0.506 * λ/a, which is consistent.

Hence, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But let me check if the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima". Wait, in the case of circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second minimum would be the next dark ring. But in some contexts, people might refer to the first minimum as the first dark ring (m=1), and the next as m=2. So yes, that's correct.

But perhaps I should verify if there's a formula for the angular separation between the first and second minima. Alternatively, perhaps another way of looking at it is through the approximation for the Airy disk. But in any case, using the zeros of the Bessel function gives the precise values.

Alternatively, if I recall, the angular separation between consecutive minima in a circular aperture's diffraction pattern isn't a constant, but increases with each subsequent minimum. However, given that the problem specifies small angles, the linear approximation holds, and so the difference between θ₂ and θ₁ is approximately (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). Which is exactly what I calculated above.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 * λ/a. But let me verify the exact value of the numerical coefficient.

Calculating 3.1839 divided by 2π:

3.1839 / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.283185307 ≈ 0.5067. So approximately 0.5067 λ/a. To three decimal places, that's 0.507, but perhaps the problem expects an exact expression in terms of the difference of the Bessel zeros over 2π, or a simplified fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ / (2π a). But the problem states to express the answer in terms of given variables, so maybe just the numerical coefficient times λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the approximation for large N, but since we are taking N to infinity, the circular aperture result is exactly applicable. Hence, the answer is the angular separation between the first two minima of a circular aperture, which is approximately 0.507 λ/a.

But let me check if there's a standard expression for this. Wait, in the circular aperture case, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/D, as mentioned. Then, the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D (since 7.0156 / (2π) ≈ 1.116, and 1.116 * λ/a = 1.116 * λ/(D/2) = 2.233 λ/D). But since D = 2a, θ₂ ≈ 2.233 λ/(2a) = 1.116 λ/a, so the difference is 1.116 - 0.61 ≈ 0.506 λ/a. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) / (2π) * (λ/a). Let's compute that:

(j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) = 7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈ 3.1839

So 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 0.506, so 0.506 λ/a.

But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer. However, the Bessel zeros are transcendental numbers, so unless there's a specific coefficient expected, the approximate numerical value should suffice.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach when considering the polygon with infinitely many sides. Let me think. If we model the polygon as a circle in the limit as N→∞, then the diffraction pattern would be the same as for a circular aperture. Therefore, the first two minima would indeed be given by the zeros of the Bessel function as calculated. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.506 λ/a. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the apothem a. Since for a circle, the apothem and radius become the same as N→∞, so the radius R = a. Therefore, the standard formula for the circular aperture applies here.

Alternatively, if I didn't take the circular aperture approach, perhaps I could derive it for the polygon. But given that N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, so the result must be the same. So I think the answer is indeed Δθ ≈ (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

But let me check some references. For a circular aperture, the angular radius of the first dark ring (first minimum) is θ ≈ 1.22 λ/D. The second dark ring is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D. Therefore, the separation is 2.233 - 1.22 = 1.013 λ/D. But since D = 2a, substituting gives 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So that's the same as before. Hence, the answer is approximately 0.5065 λ/a. Rounding to three significant figures, that's 0.507 λ/a, but perhaps the question expects an exact fraction or multiple of π. Wait, but the zeros of the Bessel functions are known constants. Let me check their exact values.

From tables, the first zero of J₁(x) is approximately 3.831705970207512, and the second is approximately 7.015586669815619. Therefore, the difference is 7.015586669815619 - 3.831705970207512 ≈ 3.183880699608107. Then, 3.1838807 / (2π) ≈ 3.1838807 / 6.283185307 ≈ 0.5067.

So, the exact coefficient would be (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) ≈ 0.5067. Therefore, the angular separation is approximately 0.5067 λ/a. So, depending on the required precision, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, if the problem expects a symbolic answer in terms of the Bessel zeros, but since it's a numerical answer, the approximate value is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps when N is very large but finite, the polygon's diffraction pattern approaches that of a circle, but maybe there's a different consideration. However, the problem states N is infinitely large, so it's precisely a circle. Therefore, the answer for a circular aperture applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for a polygon and take the limit as N→∞. Let's explore that.

For a regular N-sided polygon, the aperture can be considered as a function that is 1 inside the polygon and 0 outside. The Fourier transform of this aperture (Fraunhofer diffraction) would give the diffraction pattern. In the limit as N→∞, this becomes the Fourier transform of a circle, which is the Airy pattern.

But maybe for a polygon, the diffraction pattern can be calculated by considering the Fourier transform. For a regular polygon, the far-field diffraction pattern can be found by integrating over the polygonal aperture. However, this integral might be complicated, but perhaps in the limit as N→∞, it simplifies to the circular case.

Alternatively, perhaps using polar coordinates, the polygon with N sides can be approximated as a circle with perturbations, but as N→∞, the perturbations vanish, leading to the circular aperture result. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima would approach that of the circular aperture.

Therefore, I think the answer is indeed the same as for a circular aperture, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a, or more precisely, (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. Since the problem allows the use of small angle approximation, and asks for the angular distance, this should be the answer.

But just to confirm, let me check another source. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/D, and the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.233 λ/D. The angular separation is therefore approximately 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, this becomes 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a, which is the same as before. So, 0.5065 λ/a.

Therefore, rounding to three significant figures, 0.507 λ/a. However, the problem might want the answer expressed as a multiple of λ/a with the exact coefficient from the Bessel zeros. If we compute (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1})/(2π):

(7.015586669815619 - 3.831705970207512) / (2 * π) ≈ 3.183880699608107 / 6.283185307179586 ≈ 0.5067.

So, 0.5067 λ/a. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of these Bessel zeros. However, since they are transcendental numbers, we can't express them as fractions. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.507 λ/a.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the first zero, but I think the key is that when N approaches infinity, the problem reduces to the circular aperture case, and the angular separation between first two minima is approximately 0.507 λ/a.

Therefore, after all that, the answer should be approximately 0.51 times λ/a. However, since the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima", and given that in the circular case, the minima are separated by approximately 0.5067 λ/a, which is approximately half the wavelength over the apothem.

Alternatively, maybe there's a factor of 2 missing. Let me check again. The first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. D = 2a, so θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ₂ ≈ 2.233 λ/D ≈ 2.233 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.1165 λ/a. The difference is 1.1165 - 0.61 ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, in terms of radius R = a (since for N→∞, R = a), the formula for the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/(2R), and the second is θ = 2.233 λ/(2R). The difference is (2.233 - 1.22) λ/(2R) = 1.013 λ/(2R) = 0.5065 λ/R. Since R = a, it's 0.5065 λ/a. Therefore, the same result.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. But given the problem states "angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large", and given the process, the exact answer is (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.5067 λ/a. Depending on the required precision, but likely 0.51 λ/a is acceptable, or writing it as (approximately) 0.507 λ/a. However, perhaps the problem expects an exact expression in terms of the Bessel zeros. But since the problem mentions to use the small angle approximation and gives that tanθ ≈ θ, which we've used, and since the zeros of the Bessel function are known, maybe the answer is expected to be written in terms of those zeros divided by 2π.

But since it's a numerical answer, I think the expected answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. However, in many textbooks, the first minimum for a circular aperture is given as 1.22 λ/D, so the separation between first and second minima would be the next zero, which is at approximately 2.233 λ/D, so the difference is 1.013 λ/D. Since D = 2a, this becomes 0.5065 λ/a. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a. Hence, the box answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{1.22 \lambda}{2a}} but wait, that's the first minimum. Wait, no. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is θ₂ - θ₁.

But according to the standard formula, θ₁ = 1.22 λ/(2a) and θ₂ = 2.233 λ/(2a). Therefore, the difference is (2.233 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.013 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. So, the answer is approximately 0.5065 λ/a. But 0.5065 is approximately 0.51 when rounded to two decimal places. However, in terms of exact constants, (j₂ - j₁)/(2π) where j₁ and j₂ are the first and second zeros of J₁. So, perhaps the problem expects the answer expressed as (j_{1,2} - j_{1,1}) \lambda / (2\pi a). But since they are constants, we can write the numerical value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of the zeros, but I think given the context, a numerical coefficient is acceptable. Hence, the answer is approximately 0.51 λ/a, so boxed as \boxed{0.51 \dfrac{\lambda}{a}}.

But wait, let me check again. The exact difference between the second and first zeros of J₁ is approximately 3.1839. Dividing by 2π gives approximately 0.5067. So, 0.5067 λ/a. To two decimal places, that's 0.51 λ/a. However, if the problem expects three significant figures, it would be 0.507 λ/a. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe they want an exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1.22 λ/(2a) for the first minimum, but the difference would need to be calculated.

Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach. For example, when considering a polygon with N sides and apothems a, as N approaches infinity, the perimeter approaches 2πa (since the apothem a relates to the circumference). However, maybe the diffraction calculation would involve integrating over the polygon's area. But in the limit of N→∞, the polygon becomes a circle, so the Fourier transform (diffraction pattern) becomes that of a circular aperture. Therefore, the first minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function as calculated.

Therefore, after thorough consideration, the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large is approximately 0.51 times λ/a. Hence, the answer is \boxed{0.51 \dfrac{\lambda}{a}}.

**Final Answer**
The angular distance between the first two minima is \boxed{0.51 \dfrac{\lambda}{a}}.
