The compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid** (p-chlorobenzoic acid). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mass Spectrum**:  
   - Molecular ion at m/z 156 (100%) and a peak at m/z 158 (32%) indicates the presence of one chlorine atom (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes in a ~3:1 ratio).  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂** (exact mass ≈ 156.45, consistent with m/z 156).

2. **IR Spectroscopy**:  
   - Broad peak (3500–2700 cm⁻¹): O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.  
   - Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹: C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.  

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), deshielded and as a singlet.  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets from aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents (Cl and COOH) split the aromatic protons into two pairs of equivalent protons, with coupling typical of a para-disposed aromatic system.

The para substitution of Cl and COOH groups explains the spectral data, including the molecular weight, chlorine isotope pattern, IR peaks, and NMR splitting.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out what this compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, and there's a peak at m/z 158 that's 32%. The molecular ion peak tells me the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. The peak at 158 is about a third the height of the 156 peak. Hmm, that ratio of 32% is roughly a third, which makes me think of chlorine because chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, in about a 3:1 ratio. So if there's one chlorine atom in the molecule, the molecular ion would have two peaks at 156 and 158 with a ratio of approximately 3:1, which matches the 100% and 32% here. So maybe the compound contains a chlorine atom.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. A broad peak in that region usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl group, C=O. Carboxylic acids have both the O-H stretch and the carbonyl, so that fits. Alternatively, maybe an ester or an acid chloride, but the O-H stretch is more likely a carboxylic acid. But wait, acid chlorides have a higher C=O stretch, around 1800 cm^-1. So 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester. But the broad O-H suggests carboxylic acid.

Now the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H). The 11.0 ppm peak is very deshielded, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. The singlet suggests no neighboring protons, which makes sense for the -COOH group. Then the two doublets around 7.7-8.0 ppm are likely aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe a para-substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets if they're adjacent to substituents. For example, in p-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets because of the substituents in the para position.

Putting this together: molecular weight 156. If it's p-chlorobenzoic acid, let's check the molecular weight. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Molecular weight is 122 (C=12*7=84, H=6, O=16*2=32; 84+6+32=122). If there's a chlorine substituting one hydrogen, the formula becomes C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight would be 122 -1 (for H) +35.5 (Cl) = 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm. Chlorine's atomic weight is approximately 35.5, so 122 -1 +35.5 = 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. That's very close, maybe due to rounding or the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe it's another substituent. Wait, maybe it's not chlorine? Wait, the mass spectrum showed peaks at 156 and 158 with a ratio of about 3:1, which is characteristic of a single chlorine atom. So the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. The exact molecular weight would be (12*7) + 5 + 35.45 + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.45 +32 = 156.45, which rounds to 156. So that fits.

So the structure would be p-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me confirm the NMR. The carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm as a singlet. The aromatic protons: in p-chlorobenzoic acid, the two protons ortho to the Cl and meta to the COOH would be equivalent, and the two protons meta to Cl and ortho to COOH would be equivalent. Wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The COOH is in the para position relative to Cl. So the ring has Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1 (assuming numbering such that they are para). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl and meta to COOH) would be equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH) would be equivalent. But wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the substituents can affect the chemical shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and COOH) would be more deshielded. Let me check typical NMR shifts for p-chlorobenzoic acid. From what I recall, the aromatic protons in p-chlorobenzoic acid are two doublets. The protons adjacent to the Cl and across from the COOH would be one set, and the others another. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the two sets. The doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. The downfield shift is due to the electron-withdrawing groups. The coupling constant between the two doublets would be around 8-9 Hz for para-substituted aromatic protons. So the two doublets each integrating to 2H would fit a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents (Cl and COOH), leading to two pairs of equivalent protons. That matches the NMR data.

So putting it all together: the molecular weight matches p-chlorobenzoic acid, the IR shows a carboxylic acid (broad O-H and C=O), and the NMR has the carboxylic proton and the aromatic protons in a para-substituted pattern. The chlorine is indicated by the mass spectrum's isotope pattern. Therefore, the compound is likely p-chlorobenzoic acid.

Alright, I need to determine the compound identity based on the provided spectral data, examining each piece of evidence carefully.

Starting with the mass spectrum, I observe the molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, accompanied by a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. The molecular ion peak indicates the compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The ratio between these peaks is approximately 3:1, which is characteristic of a chlorine-containing compound. Chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, that naturally occur in a roughly 3:1 ratio. This suggests the molecule likely contains one chlorine atom, explaining the observed isotopic pattern.

Moving to the IR spectrum, I notice a broad absorption band extending from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. This broad feature typically signifies an O-H stretching vibration, commonly found in carboxylic acids. There's also a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm^-1, which corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The combination of both the O-H stretch and carbonyl absorption strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group. While esters or acid chlorides could account for the carbonyl peak, the broad O-H stretch more strongly supports the carboxylic acid structure. However, I should note that acid chlorides also have...

Alright, I need to identify this compound using the spectral data provided. I'll analyze the information step by step.

Starting with the mass spectrum, the molecular ion peak appears at m/z 156 with an intensity of 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with an intensity of 32%. The molecular ion at 156 indicates the compound's molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak being about a third of the 156 peak's height suggests a 32% ratio, reminiscent of chlorine due to its isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37, which occur in a 3:1 ratio. If the molecule contains one chlorine atom, the molecular ion peaks would appear at 156 and 158 in approximately a 3:1 ratio, corresponding well with the 100% and 32% observed. This points to the presence of a chlorine atom in the compound.

Next, let's consider the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak ranging from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1, usually signifying an O-H stretch, typical in carboxylic acids. Additionally, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids are characterized by both the O-H stretch and the carbonyl group, so this aligns well. While an ester or an acid chloride might be considered, the O-H stretch strongly suggests a carboxylic acid. However, acid chlorides...

The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H). The 11.0 ppm peak is really upfield for a proton. Wait, actually, 11 ppm is a very deshielded proton. Carboxylic acid protons usually appear around 10-12 ppm as a singlet because they're exchange broadened, but in the NMR data here, it's a singlet, 1H. So that's the -COOH proton. Then the two doublets at around 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. Those look like aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling between the two doublets suggests that they are adjacent on the ring, but if it's para-substituted, the protons would be two doublets each integrating to 2H. Wait, para-substituted benzene would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, then the two ortho protons would be equivalent and the two meta protons would be equivalent. But in the NMR, there are two doublets each with 2H. That suggests maybe a substituent that causes the ortho and meta protons to split into two doublets. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, if there are two different substituents, but in this case, maybe a single substituent. Wait, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene. Wait, if it's a mono-substituted benzene, like a para-substituted group, but that's not possible because para is relative. Wait, maybe it's a meta-substituted, but that would give more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzoic acid. Let me think. If the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, for example. The structure would be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be the two ortho to the COOH and the two meta to the COOH. Wait, but in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So if the ring has Cl and COOH in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be the two ortho to Cl and meta to COOH, and the two ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. But in that case, the coupling might lead to two doublets. Let me recall the NMR of para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives. For example, in 4-nitrobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons are two doublets. The protons adjacent to the nitro group (ortho) would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid (ortho to COOH) would also be deshielded. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are Cl and COOH. Let me check the chemical shifts. The protons ortho to electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and COOH would be deshielded. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring protons ortho to Cl and COOH would each be split into doublets. The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to each pair being a doublet. So the two protons adjacent to Cl (ortho) would couple with the two adjacent to COOH (ortho), but wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite, so each substituent is para to the other. Then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two ortho to Cl and meta to COOH, and the two ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Each of these sets would be equivalent. The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to each set being a doublet. Let me confirm: in para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, each substituent is para to the other, so the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The remaining protons would be two sets of two protons each. Each set is adjacent to one substituent and across from the other. The coupling between adjacent protons would result in each set appearing as a doublet. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons next to Cl (ortho) would be coupled with the protons next to COOH (ortho), but since they are across the ring, maybe the coupling is through four bonds (para coupling), which is usually small. Wait, actually, in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent. Let's imagine the Cl is at position 1, COOH at position 4. Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to Cl (position 1), and positions 3 and 5 are ortho to COOH (position 4). The protons at 2 and 6 would each be adjacent to Cl and next to positions 3 and 5. The protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COOH and next to positions 2 and 6. However, in such a case, each pair (2,6 and 3,5) would be equivalent. The coupling between adjacent protons (like 2 and 3) would lead to each pair being a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts would depend on the substituents. Chlorine is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to Cl would be deshielded (upfield or downfield? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups deshield the protons, causing downfield shifts). Similarly, the COOH group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it would also be deshielded and shifted downfield. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two protons ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be downfield, and the two protons ortho to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would also be downfield, but maybe at slightly different chemical shifts. However, in the given NMR data, there are two doublets: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). Let's compare with known values. For example, benzoic acid itself has protons around 8.0 ppm. If there's a chlorine substituent, which is more electron-withdrawing than a methyl group, the ortho protons would be more deshielded. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to Cl would be around 7.5-8.0 ppm, and those ortho to COOH might be similar. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that one set is more downfield than the other. Let me check some references. For example, in 4-nitrobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons are around 8.3 and 8.0 ppm as two doublets. Similarly, 4-chlorobenzoic acid might have protons around 8.0 and 7.7 ppm. That matches the given NMR data: 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. So that fits.\n\nPutting it all together: molecular weight is 156. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Chlorine has a mass of 35.5, so if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C7 is 7*12=84, H5 is 5*1=5, Cl is 35.5, O2 is 32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5, which is approximately 156. The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 would correspond to the molecular weight, considering that the exact mass might be 156.5, but in mass spec, the molecular ion is the nominal mass, so 156. The isotope peak at 158 is due to chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl in a 3:1 ratio), so the M and M+2 peaks would be approximately 3:1, which matches the 100% and 32% given.\n\nThe IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. The NMR has the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm as a singlet, and the aromatic protons as two doublets, which aligns with the para-substituted benzoic acid with chlorine.\n\nTherefore, the compound is most likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389496, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2222, prompt_tokens=451, total_tokens=2673, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

carbonyl stretches around 1800 cm^-1, so 1720 is more consistent with a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester. But the broad peak suggests a carboxylic acid because of the O-H. So maybe a benzoic acid derivative with chlorine?

Then the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H). The 11.0 ppm peak is really upfield for a proton.

The coupling between adjacent protons (like 2 and 3) would lead to each pair being a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts would depend on the substituents. Chlorine is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to Cl would be deshielded (upfield or downfield? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups deshield the protons, causing downfield shifts).

Putting it all together: molecular weight is 156. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Chlorine has a mass of 35.5, so if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C7 is 7*12=84, H5 is 5*1=5, Cl is 35.5, O2 is 32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5, which is approximately 156. The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 would correspond to the molecular weight, considering that the exact mass might be 156.5, but in mass spec, the molecular ion is the nominal mass, so 156. The isotope peak at 158 is due to chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl in a 3:1 ratio), so the M and M+2 peaks would be approximately 3:1, which matches the 100% and 32% given.

The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. The NMR has the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm as a singlet, and the aromatic protons as two doublets, which aligns with the para-substituted benzoic acid with chlorine.

Therefore, the compound is most likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substitution pattern where the protons on the aromatic ring are split into two doublets due to coupling with each other. The downfield shifts of these aromatic protons (around 7.7-8.0 ppm) suggest that they are deshielded, possibly due to electron-withdrawing groups attached to the ring.

Since the molecular weight is 156 and we have a carboxylic acid (which is -COOH, molecular weight 45), the benzene ring with substituents would account for 156 - 45 = 111 g/mol. Let's check: Benzene (C6H5-) is 77 g/mol. If we have a substituent of Cl (35.5), then 77 + 35.5 = 112.5, which is close but a bit over. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is another group.

The molecular ion is at m/z 156, which would be the exact mass if considering the most abundant isotopes (Cl-35). The presence of the Cl also explains the isotopic peaks at m/z 156 and 158 in a 3:1 ratio, as the Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%) isotopes contribute to the molecular ion. So, the structure would be 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-chlorobenzoic acid). Let's confirm the NMR signals.\n\nIn 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons are para to the chlorine and ortho to the carboxylic acid group. Wait, actually, the substituents on the benzene ring would be the carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the chlorine (Cl) in para positions. Wait, no. Wait, the benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. If there's a chlorine substituent para to the carboxylic acid, then the structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the COOH group. The aromatic protons would then be the two protons adjacent to the Cl and the two adjacent to the COOH group. Alternatively, if the substituent is only the COOH and a Cl, but in the para position. Let me draw this out mentally. The benzene ring has a COOH group and a Cl group in the para positions. The remaining positions are two sets of equivalent protons. The protons adjacent to the Cl (ortho to Cl) would be deshielded, and those adjacent to the COOH (ortho to COOH) would also be deshielded. However, in para-substituted benzoic acids, the protons adjacent to the COOH group (ortho to COOH) are typically downfield shifted. Similarly, the protons ortho to Cl are also deshielded. However, in para-substituted rings with two substituents (Cl and COOH), the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Let's check the NMR. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating for 2H. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the COOH (which would be at positions 2 and 6) and the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Wait, no: if the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4 (para), then the ring positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4 (Cl), 5, 6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl). Each pair would be equivalent. The coupling between protons at positions 2 and 3 would lead to a doublet. But I need to recall the typical NMR of para-substituted benzoic acids. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are only the COOH and another group. Wait, in benzoic acid (without substituents), the aromatic protons are a triplet and a doublet, but if there's a para substituent, then the ring becomes para-disubstituted, leading to two doublets. For example, in para-nitrobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons split into two doublets. Similarly, para-chlorobenzoic acid would have two doublets. The chemical shifts would depend on the substituents. Chlorine is electron-withdrawing via inductive effect, which deshields the adjacent protons, causing their signals to shift downfield. The COOH group is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons adjacent to it would also be deshielded. However, the exact shifts can vary. In the given NMR, the two doublets are at 8.02 and 7.72. Let me check if that matches with para-chlorobenzoic acid. Looking up NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the aromatic protons are typically around 7.5-8.0 ppm. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). So perhaps the higher shift (8.02 ppm) corresponds to the protons next to the COOH, and the lower (7.72 ppm) next to Cl. That would make sense. The coupling between these protons would lead to two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, which is usually a singlet because it's exchanging rapidly and/or not split by neighboring protons. However, sometimes in solution, the carboxylic proton can be broad due to hydrogen bonding, but here it's a singlet. Wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is consistent with the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, which is usually broad due to hydrogen bonding. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. All of this aligns with 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me confirm the molecular weight. The molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Calculating the molecular weight: 7*12 (C) = 84, 5*1 (H) =5, Cl=35.5, 2*16 (O)=32. Total = 84+5+35.5+32=156.5, which rounds to 156, matching the molecular ion at m/z 156. The isotopic peaks at 156 and 158 (3:1 ratio) are due to the chlorine atom. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Alternatively, it could be 2-chlorobenzoic acid, but the NMR would differ. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho substitution), the aromatic protons would have different splitting patterns. For para substitution, the two sets of protons would each be equivalent and give two doublets. In ortho substitution, the protons adjacent to Cl and COOH would not be equivalent, leading to more complex splitting. The given NMR data with two doublets suggests para substitution.

wait, acid chlorides typically show higher carbonyl absorption frequencies (around 1800 cm^-1), so 1720 cm^-1 is more in line with a carboxylic acid or perhaps an ester. But the broad O-H stretch is key here for a carboxylic acid. Maybe the O-H is part of the carboxylic acid group.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons are para to the chlorine and ortho to the carboxylic acid group. Wait, actually, the substituents on the benzene ring would be the carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the chlorine (Cl) in para positions. Wait, no. Wait, the benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group.

So carboxylic acid is more likely here.\n\nNow, the 1H NMR data: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is very deshielded, which is typical for the carboxylic acid proton. The other signals are two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). These are likely aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shifts of the aromatic protons indicate electron-withdrawing groups, such as a substituent that depletes electron density from the ring. Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (from IR and NMR), the substituent could be a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring. However, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which would occur if there are two equivalent protons adjacent to the substituent and two more equivalent protons across the ring. Wait, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be equivalent, and the ones across (para) would be another equivalent set, but if the substituent is in the para position relative to another group, maybe?\n\nWait, let's think. If the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group like -COOH, the ortho protons (adjacent to the COOH) would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the meta protons (next to ortho) would also be deshielded but perhaps less so. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, if there's a substituent that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons, maybe a disubstituted benzene. But in the NMR, there are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if there are two substituents para to each other, each substituent would have ortho protons. Wait, but that might not split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe one substituent in the para position, such as a nitro group or a carboxylic acid group. Wait, let's take an example: benzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The aromatic protons in benzoic acid are typically split into a triplet and a doublet, but maybe under certain conditions or with substituents, they could split into two doublets. Wait, perhaps if there's another substituent. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Wait, let's check the molecular weight.\n\nThe molecular weight of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is 122 g/mol. If we add a chlorine atom (35.5), the molecular weight would be 122 + 35.5 = 157.5, which is approximately 158. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm. Wait, that's close but not exact. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me calculate the exact molecular weight. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2: 7*12 + 6*1 + 16*2 = 84 + 6 + 32 = 122. Adding a Cl (35.45) gives 122 + 35.45 = 157.45, which would have a molecular ion at m/z 157.45. But the observed molecular ion is at 156. That's a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't chlorinated. Wait, but the mass spectrum shows peaks at 156 and 158 with a 3:1 ratio, which suggests a Cl. So maybe there's another element involved. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a Br instead. Bromine has two isotopes, Br-79 and Br-81, in roughly 1:1 ratio. But in the mass spectrum, the ratio here is 100% (156) and 32% (158). If the molecular ion is 156 and the next peak is 158 (difference of 2), that's more consistent with a Cl (since Cl-35 and Cl-37 differ by 2). For Br, the isotopes would be 2 amu apart as well, but the natural abundance is about 50% each. But here, the 158 peak is about a third of 156. So that's more Cl. So maybe the compound has a Cl. But if the molecular weight is 156, and we have a Cl (35.45), then the remaining part would be 156 - 35.45 = 120.55. Let's see: 120.55 would correspond to C6H5O2 (benzoic acid without the Cl). Wait, C6H5O2 would be 6*12 +5*1 +16*2 =72 +5 +32=109. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's check: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.45, O2=32. Total: 84+5+35.45+32=156.45, which would round to 156. That fits. So the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. So that would be chlorobenzoic acid. Now, the substituents on the benzene ring would be Cl and COOH. Let's consider the positions. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are para to each other. In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The COOH group is at the para position relative to Cl. Let me visualize the structure: Cl attached to carbon 1, COOH at carbon 4 (para). The remaining aromatic protons would be at carbons 2,3,5,6. But in this case, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH) would be another equivalent set. But wait, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. However, depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts would differ. The Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6), and the COOH group is also electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5). Therefore, in the NMR, we might see two doublets: one for the protons ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and another for the protons ortho to COOH (positions 3 and 5). The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to doublets. Let's check the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to Cl in chlorobenzene typically resonate around 7.0-7.5 ppm. However, when there's another electron-withdrawing group, like COOH, the shifts could be more downfield. Similarly, protons ortho to a COOH group (as in benzoic acid) are around 8.0 ppm. In the given NMR data, the two doublets are at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H). The higher shift (8.02) would correspond to the protons ortho to the COOH group, which are more deshielded, and the lower shift (7.72) to those ortho to Cl. Alternatively, the other way around. But in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are around 8.0-8.2 ppm. So if the COOH is at the para position relative to Cl, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would be at higher ppm. Thus, the 8.02 ppm doublet (2H) would be those, and the 7.72 ppm (2H) would be ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6). The coupling between the protons would result in each pair being a doublet because each proton is adjacent to one proton from the other set. For example, each proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 3, which is part of the other doublet. So the coupling constant would lead to a doublet for each set. The integration of each doublet as 2H matches the two equivalent protons in each set. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, which is typically a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, carboxylic acid protons in NMR are usually broad due to hydrogen bonding and exchange, but sometimes they can appear as sharp singlets if the sample is very dry or if deuterated solvent isn't perfectly excluding protons. Alternatively, maybe the sample is not a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl. So that's consistent. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Carboxylic acid protons can sometimes appear as singlets if there's no splitting, which they usually don't because of exchange broadening. But in some cases, they might appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the proton is in a different environment, but given the data, this seems acceptable. So putting it all together, the structure would be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me verify the molecular weight again. C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.45, O2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.45=124.45, +32=156.45. Rounded to 156, which matches the molecular ion at m/z 156.

The compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mass Spectrum**:  
   - Molecular ion at **m/z = 156** (C₇H₅ClO₂, exact mass ≈ 156.45).  
   - The **M+2 peak at m/z = 158** (32% intensity) arises from the natural isotopic abundance of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in a ~3:1 ratio), confirming one Cl atom.

2. **IR Spectrum**:  
   - **Broad peak (3500–2700 cm⁻¹)**: O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.  
   - **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid group.

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Carboxylic acid proton (deshielded, exchange-broadened but appears as a singlet here).  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets arise from coupling between protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing groups (–Cl and –COOH).  
     - The downfield shift of 8.02 ppm corresponds to protons *ortho* to the –COOH group.  
     - The 7.72 ppm signal corresponds to protons *ortho* to the –Cl group.

**Structure**:  
![4-Chlorobenzoic Acid](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=8439&t=l)  
The para-substitution of –Cl and –COOH on the benzene ring explains the spectral data.

wait, acid chlorides have a carbonyl stretch but not the O-H. So carboxylic acid is more likely here.

Now, the 1H NMR data: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is very deshielded, which is typical for the carboxylic acid proton. The other signals are two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). These are likely aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shifts of the aromatic protons indicate electron-withdrawing groups, such as a substituent that depletes electron density from the ring. Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (from IR and NMR), the substituent could be a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring. However, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which would occur if there are two equivalent protons adjacent to the substituent and two more equivalent protons across the ring. Wait, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be equivalent, and the ones across (para) would be another equivalent set, but if the substituent is in the para position relative to another group, maybe?

Wait, let's think. If the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group like -COOH, the ortho protons (adjacent to the COOH) would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the meta protons (next to ortho) would also be deshielded but perhaps less so. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, if there's a substituent that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons, maybe a disubstituted benzene. But in the NMR, there are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if there are two substituents para to each other, each substituent would have ortho protons. Wait, but that might not split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe one substituent in the para position, such as a nitro group or a carboxylic acid group. Wait, let's take an example: benzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The aromatic protons in benzoic acid are typically split into a triplet and a doublet, but maybe under certain conditions or with substituents, they could split into two doublets. Wait, perhaps if there's another substituent. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Wait, let's check the molecular weight.

The molecular weight of benzoic acid (C7H6O2) is 122 g/mol. If we add a chlorine atom (35.5), the molecular weight would be 122 + 35.5 = 157.5, which is approximately 158. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm. Wait, that's close but not exact. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me calculate the exact molecular weight. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2: 7*12 + 6*1 + 16*2 = 84 + 6 + 32 = 122. Adding a Cl (35.45) gives 122 + 35.45 = 157.45, which would have a molecular ion at m/z 157.45. But the observed molecular ion is at 156. That's a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't chlorinated. Wait, but the mass spectrum shows peaks at 156 and 158 with a 3:1 ratio, which suggests a Cl. So maybe there's another element involved. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a Br instead. Bromine has two isotopes, Br-79 and Br-81, in roughly 1:1 ratio. But in the mass spectrum, the ratio here is 100% (156) and 32% (158). If the molecular ion is 156 and the next peak is 158 (difference of 2), that's more consistent with a Cl (since Cl-35 and Cl-37 differ by 2). For Br, the isotopes would be 2 amu apart as well, but the natural abundance is about 50% each. But here, the 158 peak is about a third of 156. So that's more Cl. So maybe the compound has a Cl. But if the molecular weight is 156, and we have a Cl (35.45), then the remaining part would be 156 - 35.45 = 120.55. Let's see: 120.55 would correspond to C6H5O2 (benzoic acid without the Cl). Wait, C6H5O2 would be 6*12 +5*1 +16*2 =72 +5 +32=109. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's check: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.45, O2=32. Total: 84+5+35.45+32=156.45, which would round to 156. That fits. So the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. So that would be chlorobenzoic acid. Now, the substituents on the benzene ring would be Cl and COOH. Let's consider the positions. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are para to each other. In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The COOH group is at the para position relative to Cl. Let me visualize the structure: Cl attached to carbon 1, COOH at carbon 4 (para). The remaining aromatic protons would be at carbons 2,3,5,6. But in this case, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH) would be another equivalent set. But wait, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. However, depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts would differ. The Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6), and the COOH group is also electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5). Therefore, in the NMR, we might see two doublets: one for the protons ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and another for the protons ortho to COOH (positions 3 and 5). The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to doublets. Let's check the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to Cl in chlorobenzene typically resonate around 7.0-7.5 ppm. However, when there's another electron-withdrawing group, like COOH, the shifts could be more downfield. Similarly, protons ortho to a COOH group (as in benzoic acid) are around 8.0 ppm. In the given NMR data, the two doublets are at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H). The higher shift (8.02) would correspond to the protons ortho to the COOH group, which are more deshielded, and the lower shift (7.72) to those ortho to Cl. Alternatively, the other way around. But in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are around 8.0-8.2 ppm. So if the COOH is at the para position relative to Cl, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would be at higher ppm. Thus, the 8.02 ppm doublet (2H) would be those, and the 7.72 ppm (2H) would be ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6). The coupling between the protons would result in each pair being a doublet because each proton is adjacent to one proton from the other set. For example, each proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 3, which is part of the other doublet. So the coupling constant would lead to a doublet for each set. The integration of each doublet as 2H matches the two equivalent protons in each set. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, which is typically a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, carboxylic acid protons in NMR are usually broad due to hydrogen bonding and exchange, but sometimes they can appear as sharp singlets if the sample is very dry or if deuterated solvent isn't perfectly excluding protons. Alternatively, maybe the sample is not a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl. So that's consistent. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Carboxylic acid protons can sometimes appear as singlets if there's no splitting, which they usually don't because of exchange broadening. But in some cases, they might appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the proton is in a different environment, but given the data, this seems acceptable. So putting it all together, the structure would be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me verify the molecular weight again. C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.45, O2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.45=124.45, +32=156.45. Rounded to 156, which matches the molecular ion at m/z 156. The chlorine isotope pattern also fits, with M and M+2 peaks in a 3:1 ratio. The IR matches a carboxylic acid, and the NMR shows the aromatic protons split into two doublets and a carboxylic acid proton. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
