To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

The potential in polar coordinates is given by:
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \]

Using \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \) and \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), we rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates:
\[ V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \]

This potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. The energy levels for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energies from each direction:
\[ E = E_x + E_y \]

For the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \). For the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \).

The energy levels for each direction are:
\[ E_x = \hbar \omega_x \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) \]
\[ E_y = \hbar \omega_y \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) \]

Combining these, the total energy is:
\[ E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) \]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \):
\[ E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left( 2 \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) \right) \]
\[ E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right) \]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[ \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{2m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \dfrac{3}{2}\right)} \]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Okay, so I have this problem here where a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). The task is to find the energy spectrum. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates (r, θ), it's often useful to use separation of variables. The potential here seems to have a radial part and an angular part. The first term, (1/2)kr², looks like a simple harmonic oscillator potential in the radial direction. The second term, (3/2)kr² cos²(θ), complicates things because it introduces an angular dependence. So the potential isn't just radial; it also depends on the angle θ. That probably means that the angular part of the Schrödinger equation will be more complicated than the usual case with central potentials.

Let me write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + V(r, θ)

Plugging in the given potential:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

Hmm, so the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me simplify that expression. Combine the terms:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)kr² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Let me recall: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ

So V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

Wait, is that right? Let me check again:

Original expression: 1 + 3 cos²θ

Replace cos²θ with (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr²*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

So the potential can be written as V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. That separates into a radial part and an angular part. Wait, but the radial part is multiplied by cos2θ. Hmm, so it's not a central potential; the angular dependence is still there. So maybe we can separate variables by assuming a solution of the form ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Let's try that.

The Schrödinger equation is:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)Φ + (1/r²)(d²Φ/dθ²)R ] + [ (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ ] RΦ = E RΦ

Divide both sides by RΦ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] + (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

[ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Let me rearrange terms:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

This seems complicated because the potential term has both r² and r² cos2θ, which mixes r and θ. So maybe we can try to separate the variables by moving terms around. Let's see:

Bring the angular term to the other side:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Hmm, the term with cos2θ is problematic because it has both r² and cos2θ. So unless we can factor that term in a way that separates r and θ, we can't proceed with separation of variables. Let me see.

Wait, the term is - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ). If we can write this as a product of a function of r and a function of θ, then maybe we can separate variables. Similarly, the other terms.

Let me write all terms:

Left-hand side (LHS):

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²)

Right-hand side (RHS):

- (2m/ħ²) E

So grouping terms:

[ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) ] + [ (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) ] = - (2m/ħ²) E

Hmm, this still mixes r and θ in the second bracket. Wait, the second bracket has (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ). If we can factor out 1/r² from the first term and kr² from the second term, perhaps we can write this as:

(1/r²)[ (1/Φ)(d²Φ/dθ²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) ]

But that introduces r^4, which complicates things further. Alternatively, maybe we need to consider a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be separated by using a substitution or recognizing a form of the equation. Let me think. The term with cos2θ suggests that the angular part might be related to Mathieu equations or something similar, which are equations with periodic potentials. However, maybe there's a way to relate this to spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials, but since this is in two dimensions, perhaps we can use polar coordinates with angular momentum.

Wait, in two dimensions, the angular part is usually e^{ilθ}, where l is an integer. But here, the potential has a cos2θ term, which might couple different angular momentum states. Alternatively, maybe we can use a substitution to make the angular equation into a form that can be solved with some special functions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make a coordinate transformation. Let me think: the potential V(r, θ) is given in polar coordinates, but maybe if we switch to Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes separable. Let's try that.

In Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Therefore, the potential is:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x²

But r² = x² + y², so substituting:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + 3/2 k x² = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

Oh! Wait, that simplifies the potential to V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So in Cartesian coordinates, it's just a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, with different spring constants in the x and y directions. That makes things much easier! Why didn't I think of that earlier?

So, if the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², then the problem reduces to a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are simply the sum of the energies from each direction. That is, E = E_x + E_y, where E_x is the energy from the x-component oscillator and E_y from the y-component.

For a harmonic oscillator in one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = ħω(n + 1/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) and ω is the angular frequency, given by ω = sqrt(k/m). However, in this case, the spring constants are different in the x and y directions.

Let's compute the frequencies for each direction. For the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², so the spring constant is 2k. Therefore, the angular frequency ω_x is sqrt(2k/m). For the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so the spring constant is (1/2)k, and the angular frequency ω_y is sqrt( (1/2)k / m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).

Therefore, the energy levels for the x-direction are E_{n_x} = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2), and for the y-direction, E_{n_y} = ħω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2).

Therefore, the total energy is E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2).

But let's simplify these expressions. Let's factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). Therefore:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Wait, let me compute that again:

sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2), right? So sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2). Therefore:

sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) = (2/sqrt(2))(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) = (1/sqrt(2))[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

Yes. Then:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Alternatively, we can write this as:

E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Wait, because sqrt(k/m) * 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(k/(2m)). So:

E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)

But let me check the algebra again step by step.

Original frequencies:

ω_x = sqrt(2k/m)

ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)

So, E_x = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2)

E_y = ħ (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Therefore, E = E_x + E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Factor out sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Which is:

E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, we can write it as:

E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But wait, the constants here: sqrt(k/(2m)) is the same as sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2). So this is a valid expression.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it in terms of the usual harmonic oscillator quanta. Let me see. Let's define ω = sqrt(k/m). Then, we can write:

ω_x = sqrt(2) ω

ω_y = ω / sqrt(2)

Therefore, E = ħ sqrt(2) ω (n_x + 1/2) + ħ (ω / sqrt(2)) (n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ ω:

E = ħ ω [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Again, factor out 1/sqrt(2):

E = ħ ω (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Which gives:

E = (ħ ω / sqrt(2)) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

But ω = sqrt(k/m), so:

E = (ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2)) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Which is the same as before. So the energy levels are quantized in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, if we prefer to write it in terms of the original variables without substituting into Cartesian coordinates, we might need to check if there's any constraint on the quantum numbers. But since the problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates, and the energy is simply the sum of the two 1D oscillators, the energy levels are indeed given by the sum above.

Wait, but let me verify if this makes sense. For example, if n_x = n_y = 0, then the ground state energy would be E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (0 + 0 + 3/2 ) = (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m)). That seems reasonable for a 2D anisotropic oscillator.

Alternatively, if we think of the original potential in polar coordinates, but after transforming to Cartesian, we found it's separable. So this seems like a valid approach.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers. Alternatively, this can be written as:

E = ħ sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)

But maybe we can write this in terms of a single quantum number if there's a relation between n_x and n_y, but I don't think so. Since the oscillator is anisotropic, the quantum numbers n_x and n_y are independent. Therefore, the energy levels depend on both n_x and n_y.

Alternatively, sometimes in anisotropic oscillators, especially with commensurate frequencies, you can have energy levels that coincide for different combinations of n_x and n_y. But in this case, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(2) ω and ω_y = ω / sqrt(2), which are incommensurate unless sqrt(2) is a rational number, which it's not. Therefore, the energy levels are non-degenerate except for possible accidental degeneracies. However, the problem just asks for the energy spectrum, which is given in terms of n_x and n_y.

Therefore, the answer should be:

E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)

where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

But let me check once again if the transformation to Cartesian coordinates is correct.

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Expressed in Cartesian coordinates:

cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r².

Therefore:

V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2k + 3/2k)x² + (1/2k)y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the potential is indeed V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², confirming that it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in x and y directions.

Therefore, the energy levels are as I derived. So I think this is the correct approach.

Another way to think about it is that the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x is the Hamiltonian for the x-component oscillator with spring constant 2k, and H_y is the Hamiltonian for the y-component oscillator with spring constant (1/2)k. Since these Hamiltonians commute, the eigenstates are products of the eigenstates of H_x and H_y, and the energies are sums of the individual energies.

Therefore, the energy levels are:

E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + 1/2) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + 1/2)

With ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m)).

Substituting these:

E = \hbar sqrt(2k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + \hbar sqrt(k/(2m))(n_y + 1/2)

Factor out \hbar sqrt(k/m):

E = \hbar sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Which simplifies to:

E = \hbar sqrt(k/(2m)) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

= \hbar sqrt(k/(2m)) [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]

= \hbar sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)

Yes, that's the same result as before. So this confirms the energy spectrum.

Therefore, the energy levels are determined by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, each non-negative integer, and the energy is a linear combination of these. Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:

E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)

I think that's the answer. Let me just check if there's another way this could be expressed, perhaps in terms of a single quantum number, but given the anisotropy, I don't think so. The energy depends on both n_x and n_y independently. So unless there's a hidden symmetry or another way to combine the quantum numbers, this should be the correct expression.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is as derived above.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{2m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \dfrac{3}{2}\right)} where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Okay, so I have this problem here where a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). The task is to find the energy spectrum. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates (r, θ), it's often useful to use separation of variables. The potential here seems to have a radial part and an angular part. The first term, (1/2)kr², looks like a simple harmonic oscillator potential in the radial direction. The second term, (3/2)kr² cos²(θ), complicates things because it introduces an angular dependence. So the potential isn't just radial; it also depends on the angle θ. That probably means that the angular part of the Schrödinger equation will be more complicated than the usual case with central potentials.

Let me write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + V(r, θ)

Plugging in the given potential:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

Hmm, so the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me simplify that expression. Combine the terms:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)kr² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Let me recall: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ

So V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

Wait, is that right? Let me check again:

Original expression: 1 + 3 cos²θ

Replace cos²θ with (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr²*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

So the potential can be written as V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. That separates into a radial part and an angular part. Wait, but the radial part is multiplied by cos2θ. Hmm, so it's not a central potential; the angular dependence is still there. So maybe we can separate variables by assuming a solution of the form ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Let's try that.

The Schrödinger equation is:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)Φ + (1/r²)(d²Φ/dθ²)R ] + [ (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ ] RΦ = E RΦ

Divide both sides by RΦ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] + (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

[ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Let me rearrange terms:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

This seems complicated because the potential term has both r² and r² cos2θ, which mixes r and θ. So maybe we can try to separate the variables by moving terms around. Let's see:

Bring the angular term to the other side:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Hmm, the term with cos2θ is problematic because it has both r² and cos2θ. So unless we can factor that term in a way that separates r and θ, we can't proceed with separation of variables. Let me see.

Wait, the term is - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ). If we can write this as a product of a function of r and a function of θ, then maybe we can separat

# Anthropic completion

I'm dealing with a problem concerning a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) expressed as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). I need to determine the energy spectrum for this system.

For quantum mechanics problems in polar coordinates, separation of variables is typically a useful approach. The potential here has both radial and angular components. The first term (1/2)kr² resembles a harmonic oscillator potential radially, while the second term (3/2)kr² cos²(θ) adds angular dependence, making this more complex than standard central potentials.

I'll start by writing the time-independent Schrödinger equation with this Hamiltonian in polar coordinates:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + V(r, θ)

Substituting the given potential:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

I'll simplify the potential expression by combining terms:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)kr² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Using the trigonometric identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, I can rewrite this as:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ

So the potential becomes:
V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

Let me verify this calculation:
Original: 1 + 3 cos²θ
Substituting cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:
1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ
This confirms V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

To solve this problem, I'll try separation of variables with ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). The Schrödinger equation becomes:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)Φ + (1/r²)(d²Φ/dθ²)R ] + [ (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ ] RΦ = E RΦ

Dividing by RΦ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] + (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ = E

Multiplying by -2m/ħ² for simplification:

[ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Rearranging:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

The challenge here is the term with cos2θ, which contains both r² and cos2θ. This mixing of r and θ complicates the separation of variables unless we can factor it appropriately.

Alright, I've come across a situation involving a particle with mass m moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) defined by the expression (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). The objective is to determine the energy spectrum. Let's see how to tackle this.

I recall that in quantum mechanics, when handling potentials in polar coordinates (r, θ), employing separation of variables is often beneficial. The potential here seems to have distinct radial and angular components. The initial term, (1/2)kr², appears akin to a simple harmonic oscillator potential along the radial direction. However, the inclusion of the angular term (3/2)kr² cos²(θ) introduces an angular dependence, suggesting the potential isn't solely radial. This probable complexity implies that the angular section of the Schrödinger equation may be more intricate than usual for central potentials.

First, I'll jot down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is expressed as:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + V(r, θ)

Substituting the potential given:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

Now, let's simplify this potential. We can rewrite it as follows:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)kr² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Utilizing the trigonometric identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, we get:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ

Thus, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ

Alright, so V(r, θ) can be represented as (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. This indicates both a radial and an angular component, although the radial part is multiplied by cos2θ, so the angular dependence remains. Therefore, we might attempt separation of variables by assuming a solution of the form ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Let's proceed with that.

The Schrödinger equation now reads:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)Φ + (1/r²)(d²Φ/dθ²)R ] + [ (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ ] RΦ = E RΦ

Dividing each side by RΦ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] + (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ = E

Multiplying through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

[ (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Reorganizing terms:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

The complexity arises due to the potential involving both r² and r² cos2θ, interlinking r and θ. We may need to further separate variables by rearranging terms. For instance:

Move the angular term to the opposite side:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) = - (2m/ħ²) E

The challenge lies with the term - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ), as it involves both r² and cos2θ. To separate variables effectively, expressing it as a product of an r-dependent function and a θ-dependent function would be ideal. We need to explore possibilities for achieving this separation further.

Let's see:\n\n- (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k) r² cos2θ = [ - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r² ] * cos2θ\n\nSo yes, that's a product of a function of r (proportional to r²) and a function of θ (cos2θ). Therefore, perhaps we can write the equation as:\n\n(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r² cos2θ = - (2m/ħ²) E\n\nBut this still has terms with r and θ mixed. To separate variables, all terms should be either functions of r or functions of θ. Let's try multiplying through by r² to eliminate denominators:\n\nr (d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) r² + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r^4 cos2θ = - (2m/ħ²) E r²\n\nThis seems even worse because now we have terms with r^4 and r². Hmm, maybe separation of variables isn't straightforward here. Perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can make a substitution for the angular part. Let me think about the angular dependence. The potential has a term proportional to cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part might be related to the Mathieu equation or something similar. Alternatively, since cos2θ can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials, but since we're in two dimensions, maybe it's related to the angular momentum eigenfunctions.\n\nWait, in two dimensions, the angular part is usually e^{ilθ} where l is an integer. But with a potential that has a cos2θ term, the angular equation might not be as simple. Let me recall that for central potentials, the angular part is e^{ilθ} and the radial equation depends on l. But here, the potential is not central; it has an angular dependence. Therefore, the angular momentum is not conserved, and l might not be a good quantum number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can treat the angular part as a perturbation. But the potential term (3/4)kr² cos2θ is not necessarily small, so perturbation theory might not be applicable. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe we can rewrite the potential in a way that allows separation. Let me think again. The potential is V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Let me factor out (5/4)kr²:\n\nV(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² [1 + (3/5) cos2θ]\n\nBut I don't know if that helps. Maybe instead, consider that this potential resembles an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. For instance, in two dimensions, if the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)k_x x² + (1/2)k_y y², then the energy levels are quantized in each direction. But here, the potential is given in polar coordinates with a cos²θ term. Maybe converting to Cartesian coordinates could help?\n\nLet's try that. Let me recall that in Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. So cos²θ = x²/r², sin²θ = y²/r².\n\nSo the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + (1/2)k x² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + 2k x²\n\nSo V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! That's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. Specifically, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y², where ω_x and ω_y are the frequencies in the x and y directions.\n\nWait, but in this case, the potential is written as 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let me check: original V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Then, substituting r² = x² + y² and cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²):\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²\n\nYes, that's correct. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is just a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with potential V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different stiffnesses in the x and y directions.\n\nThat's a significant simplification! So maybe I should switch to Cartesian coordinates where the problem is separable into x and y components, each being a simple harmonic oscillator. Then the total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.\n\nIn that case, the energy levels would be E = E_x + E_y, where E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), with n_x and n_y non-negative integers.\n\nSo first, let's find the frequencies ω_x and ω_y. For a harmonic oscillator in the x-direction with potential V(x) = (1/2)m ω_x² x², comparing with our potential term 2k x², we have:\n\n(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x² = (4k)/m => ω_x = 2√(k/m)\n\nSimilarly, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so:\n\n(1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = √(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies are ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m)\n\nThen the energy levels would be:\n\nE = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ [2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nFactor out √(k/m):\n\nE = ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying:\n\nE = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nBut let me check the arithmetic again:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nE = ħ * 2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nFactor out ħ √(k/m):\n\nE = ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nCalculate inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2\n\nYes, that's correct. So the energy levels are:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, since the frequencies are ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m), we can write:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2)\n\nBut substituting ω_x and ω_y:\n\n= ħ * 2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\n= ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\n= ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]\n\n= ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nYes, same result. So the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nAlternatively, we can write this in terms of the quantum numbers. Let me check if this makes sense. For an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are indeed the sum of the energies from each direction. Since the frequencies in x and y are different, the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as an isotropic oscillator. Each pair (n_x, n_y) gives a distinct energy level unless the ratio of frequencies is rational, which in this case, ω_x / ω_y = 2, which is rational, so there might be some degeneracy. But regardless, the energy spectrum is as given.\n\nBut let me confirm that this approach is valid. The key step was realizing that the potential in Cartesian coordinates separates into x and y components, each being a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, the solution is separable into x and y parts, each being the usual harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. Therefore, the total energy is the sum, and the eigenfunctions are products of Hermite polynomials in x and y. Therefore, the energy levels should indeed be E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2).\n\nTherefore, the answer is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) for n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in terms of a single quantum number if we can find a relation, but since the frequencies are in a 2:1 ratio, perhaps there's a way to express it with a different set of quantum numbers. However, the problem just asks for the energy spectrum, so expressing it in terms of n_x and n_y is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the original problem was in polar coordinates. However, since we transformed to Cartesian coordinates and found that the potential is separable, leading to the energy levels above, is there a way to express this in terms of the original polar coordinates? For example, in polar coordinates, the usual approach would involve angular momentum quantum numbers, but here, due to the anisotropy, the angular momentum is not conserved, so those quantum numbers don't apply. Therefore, expressing the energy in terms of n_x and n_y is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate n_x and n_y to some other quantum numbers, but I don't think that's necessary here. The problem just asks for the energy spectrum, so stating it in terms of the two quantum numbers n_x and n_y is sufficient.\n\nBut let me check again for possible mistakes. For example, when converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates, was that correct?\n\nOriginal potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ\n\nConvert to Cartesian:\n\n(1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, indeed, the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Then, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(2k / (m/2))? Wait, hold on. Wait, the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)m ω² x². In the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². Therefore:\n\n(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x² = 4k/m => ω_x = 2√(k/m). Yes, correct. Similarly, in y-direction:\n\n(1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = √(k/m). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels are as previously calculated. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut let me check the constants. The standard harmonic oscillator energy is (n + 1/2)ħω. So in x-direction, we have (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x, and similarly for y. Then, substituting ω_x and ω_y:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * √(k/m)\n\nFactor out ħ√(k/m):\n\nE = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by this expression. So the final answer is that the energy levels are E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = √(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, since ω = √(k/m), we can write E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). So that's the energy spectrum.\n\nBut just to confirm once more, let's consider the case when n_x = n_y = 0. Then the ground state energy would be (3/2)ħ√(k/m). Then, for n_x =1, n_y=0, it would be (2 + 0 + 3/2)ħ√(k/m) = (7/2)ħ√(k/m). For n_x=0, n_y=1, it would be (0 +1 +3/2)= (5/2)ħ√(k/m). So the energy levels are spaced by 2ħ√(k/m) in the x-direction and by ħ√(k/m) in the y-direction. That makes sense given the frequencies ω_x and ω_y.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the correct energy spectrum.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is given by \\boxed{E = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} where \\(n_x\\) and \\(n_y\\) are non-negative integers.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385651, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4062, prompt_tokens=1388, total_tokens=5450, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

Rewriting the potential in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]
This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. 

The frequencies of the harmonic oscillators in each direction are determined by comparing with the standard harmonic oscillator potential \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2 \):
- For the \( x \)-direction: \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2 = 2k \) gives \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)
- For the \( y \)-direction: \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \) gives \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)

The energy levels of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energies from each direction:
\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[
E = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \right]
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the brackets:
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[
\boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

variables. Let's see:

- (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k) r² cos2θ = [ - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r² ] * cos2θ

So yes, that's a product of a function of r (proportional to r²) and a function of θ (cos2θ). Therefore, perhaps we can write the equation as:

(1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r² cos2θ = - (2m/ħ²) E

But this still has terms with r and θ mixed. To separate variables, all terms should be either functions of r or functions of θ. Let's try multiplying through by r² to eliminate denominators:

r (d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) r² + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (3 m k)/(2 ħ²) r^4 cos2θ = - (2m/ħ²) E r²

This seems even worse because now we have terms with r^4 and r². Hmm, maybe separation of variables isn't straightforward here. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can make a substitution for the angular part. Let me think about the angular dependence. The potential has a term proportional to cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part might be related to the Mathieu equation or something similar. Alternatively, since cos2θ can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials, but since we're in two dimensions, maybe it's related to the angular momentum eigenfunctions.

Wait, in two dimensions, the angular part is usually e^{ilθ} where l is an integer. But with a potential that has a cos2θ term, the angular equation might not be as simple. Let me recall that for central potentials, the angular part is e^{ilθ} and the radial equation depends on l. But here, the potential is not central; it has an angular dependence. Therefore, the angular momentum is not conserved, and l might not be a good quantum number.

Alternatively, maybe we can treat the angular part as a perturbation. But the potential term (3/4)kr² cos2θ is not necessarily small, so perturbation theory might not be applicable. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe we can rewrite the potential in a way that allows separation. Let me think again. The potential is V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Let me factor out (5/4)kr²:

V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² [1 + (3/5) cos2θ]

But I don't know if that helps. Maybe instead, consider that this potential resembles an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. For instance, in two dimensions, if the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)k_x x² + (1/2)k_y y², then the energy levels are quantized in each direction. But here, the potential is given in polar coordinates with a cos²θ term. Maybe converting to Cartesian coordinates could help?

Let's try that. Let me recall that in Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. So cos²θ = x²/r², sin²θ = y²/r².

So the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + (1/2)k x² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + 2k x²

So V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! That's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. Specifically, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y², where ω_x and ω_y are the frequencies in the x and y directions.

Wait, but in this case, the potential is written as 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let me check: original V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Then, substituting r² = x² + y² and cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²):

V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

Yes, that's correct. So in Cartesian coordinates, this is just a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with potential V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different stiffnesses in the x and y directions.

That's a significant simplification! So maybe I should switch to Cartesian coordinates where the problem is separable into x and y components, each being a simple harmonic oscillator. Then the total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.

In that case, the energy levels would be E = E_x + E_y, where E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), with n_x and n_y non-negative integers.

So first, let's find the frequencies ω_x and ω_y. For a harmonic oscillator in the x-direction with potential V(x) = (1/2)m ω_x² x², comparing with our potential term 2k x², we have:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x² = (4k)/m => ω_x = 2√(k/m)

Similarly, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so:

(1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = √(k/m)

Therefore, the frequencies are ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m)

Then the energy levels would be:

E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ [2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) ]

Factor out √(k/m):

E = ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, simplifying:

E = ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

But let me check the arithmetic again:

Original expression:

E = ħ * 2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ √(k/m):

E = ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Calculate inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

Yes, that's correct. So the energy levels are:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, since the frequencies are ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m), we can write:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2)

But substituting ω_x and ω_y:

= ħ * 2√(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * √(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

= ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

= ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= ħ √(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Yes, same result. So the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, we can write this in terms of the quantum numbers. Let me check if this makes sense. For an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are indeed the sum of the energies from each direction. Since the frequencies in x and y are different, the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as an isotropic oscillator. Each pair (n_x, n_y) gives a distinct energy level unless the ratio of frequencies is rational, which in this case, ω_x / ω_y = 2, which is rational, so there might be some degeneracy. But regardless, the energy spectrum is as given.

But let me confirm that this approach is valid. The key step was realizing that the potential in Cartesian coordinates separates into x and y components, each being a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, the solution is separable into x and y parts, each being the usual harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. Therefore, the total energy is the sum, and the eigenfunctions are products of Hermite polynomials in x and y. Therefore, the energy levels should indeed be E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2).

Therefore, the answer is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) for n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of a single quantum number if we can find a relation, but since the frequencies are in a 2:1 ratio, perhaps there's a way to express it with a different set of quantum numbers. However, the problem just asks for the energy spectrum, so expressing it in terms of n_x and n_y is acceptable.

Wait, but the original problem was in polar coordinates. However, since we transformed to Cartesian coordinates and found that the potential is separable, leading to the energy levels above, is there a way to express this in terms of the original polar coordinates? For example, in polar coordinates, the usual approach would involve angular momentum quantum numbers, but here, due to the anisotropy, the angular momentum is not conserved, so those quantum numbers don't apply. Therefore, expressing the energy in terms of n_x and n_y is appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate n_x and n_y to some other quantum numbers, but I don't think that's necessary here. The problem just asks for the energy spectrum, so stating it in terms of the two quantum numbers n_x and n_y is sufficient.

But let me check again for possible mistakes. For example, when converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates, was that correct?

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

Convert to Cartesian:

(1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, correct.

Therefore, indeed, the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Then, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(2k / (m/2))? Wait, hold on. Wait, the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)m ω² x². In the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². Therefore:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x² = 4k/m => ω_x = 2√(k/m). Yes, correct. Similarly, in y-direction:

(1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = √(k/m). Correct.

Therefore, the energy levels are as previously calculated. Therefore, the answer is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But let me check the constants. The standard harmonic oscillator energy is (n + 1/2)ħω. So in x-direction, we have (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x, and similarly for y. Then, substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * √(k/m)

Factor out ħ√(k/m):

E = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by this expression. So the final answer is that the energy levels are E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = √(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, since ω = √(k/m), we can write E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). So that's the energy spectrum.

But just to confirm once more, let's consider the case when n_x = n_y = 0. Then the ground state energy would be (3/2)ħ√(k/m). Then, for n_x =1, n_y=0, it would be (2 + 0 + 3/2)ħ√(k/m) = (7/2)ħ√(k/m). For n_x=0, n_y=1, it would be (0 +1 +3/2)= (5/2)ħ√(k/m). So the energy levels are spaced by 2ħ√(k/m) in the x-direction and by ħ√(k/m) in the y-direction. That makes sense given the frequencies ω_x and ω_y.

Therefore, I think this is the correct energy spectrum.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

However, the term involving cos2θ still has r², which complicates things. Let's see:\n\nMultiply through by r² to eliminate denominators:\n\nr( d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4) + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E r²\n\nThis still mixes r and θ in the third and fourth terms. The presence of r^4 cos2θ makes separation difficult. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe using a coordinate system where the potential separates. Since the potential has a cos2θ term, maybe this suggests some sort of angular momentum coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a perturbation. But given that the problem is to find the exact energy spectrum, not a perturbative approach, we need an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angular part can be transformed into a Mathieu equation, which deals with equations like Φ'' + [a - 2q cos2θ]Φ = 0. Let's check.\n\nLooking back at the angular part of the equation. Let me isolate the angular terms. Let's start from the original Schrödinger equation and try to separate variables.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ] + V(r,θ)ψ = Eψ\n\nExpressed as:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ] - (ħ²/(2m))(1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) + [ (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ ]ψ = Eψ\n\nAssume ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ).

Let's try to collect terms in r and θ. Let's multiply through by r²:\n\nr( d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 k r^4) + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(3/2 k r^4 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E r²\n\nThis is problematic because the term with cos²θ still has r^4. Therefore, unless the angular part can be expressed in terms of r, which complicates separation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or coordinate transformation that can make this separable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let's recall that in Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/r². Then, the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (x²/r²) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x²\n\nBut x² + y² = r², so substituting:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nOriginal potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ\n\nExpressed in Cartesian coordinates:\n\ncosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Then,\n\nV(r,θ) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + 3/2 k x² = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²\n\nSo the potential is actually V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². This is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. That's a significant simplification!\n\nSo instead of working in polar coordinates, perhaps Cartesian coordinates are more straightforward here. The problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates because the potential is a sum of terms depending on x and y separately. Therefore, the energy levels can be found as the sum of the energies of two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian is:\n\nH = H_x + H_y\n\nwhere H_x = (p_x²)/(2m) + 2k x²\n\nand H_y = (p_y²)/(2m) + (1/2)k y²\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential (1/2) m ω² x² are E_n = ħω(n + 1/2). Let's recall that ω = sqrt(k/m). However, here we have different spring constants for x and y directions.\n\nFor H_x: the potential is 2k x², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nSimilarly, for H_y: the potential is (1/2)k y², which is (1/2) m ω_y² y², so (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the frequencies for the x and y oscillators are ω_x = 2 ω and ω_y = ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThus, the energy levels for each direction are:\n\nE_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2)\n\nE_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nTherefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying:\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut we can also write this in terms of the standard harmonic oscillator energy levels. Let me check the expressions again.\n\nWait, let's recall the standard formula: For a 1D harmonic oscillator with angular frequency ω, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħ ω.\n\nFor the x-direction, the angular frequency ω_x is sqrt( (2k)/m * 2 ), but wait, actually, for H_x, the potential is 2k x². The standard form is (1/2) m ω² x², so equate:\n\n2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² => ω_x² = 4k/m => ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nSimilarly, for H_y: (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the energy levels are:\n\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)\n\nThus, total energy E = E_x + E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2\n\nSo, E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, since sqrt(k/m) is the base frequency ω_0 = sqrt(k/m), we can write:\n\nE = ħ ω_0 (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut in terms of the original problem, the mass is m and the potential is given in terms of k. So this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the energy in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y. However, there might be a different way to index the energy levels. For example, sometimes in 2D harmonic oscillators, people use the total number of quanta, but here the frequencies are different in x and y directions, so the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as isotropic oscillators.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nwhere n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it in terms of the original parameters without introducing ω_0, then:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, we can factor out the 1/2:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y ) + (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )\n\nBut I think the first form is clearer.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem was originally presented in polar coordinates, perhaps the solution expects an answer in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers. However, since we transformed to Cartesian coordinates and found it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, perhaps the answer is indeed in terms of n_x and n_y.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way. Suppose we had proceeded in polar coordinates. The potential V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. If we tried to separate variables, we might have an equation where the angular part has a term proportional to cos2θ. The angular equation would then look like:\n\nd²Φ/dθ² + [ A - B cos2θ ] Φ = 0\n\nwhere A and B are constants. This is the Mathieu equation. However, solving the Mathieu equation typically doesn't result in a simple energy spectrum with integer quantum numbers, unless certain conditions are met. However, in this case, transforming to Cartesian coordinates simplified the problem, so perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nGiven that the potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are straightforward. Thus, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy expressed in terms of the usual (n + m + 1) type terms, but with different coefficients. Let me check the constants again.\n\nWait, in the x-direction, the frequency is ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), so the energy contribution is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m )\n\nSimilarly, in the y-direction, ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )\n\nThus, total energy:\n\nE = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, expressing sqrt(k/m) as ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), the energy is E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut without introducing ω, the answer is as above.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. For example, if n_x = n_y = 0, the ground state energy would be (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). Then, increasing n_x by 1 adds 2 ħ sqrt(k/m), and increasing n_y by 1 adds ħ sqrt(k/m). This seems reasonable for an anisotropic oscillator with different stiffness in x and y directions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the energy levels in terms of polar coordinates quantum numbers, but given that the potential separates in Cartesian coordinates, the answer is more naturally expressed in terms of n_x and n_y. Therefore, the energy spectrum is as above.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a substitution of variables that allows the expression in terms of a single quantum number? For example, if we let N = 2n_x + n_y, then the energy would be E_N = ħ sqrt(k/m) (N + 3/2 ). However, N can take values 0, 1, 2, ..., but each N corresponds to multiple (n_x, n_y) pairs. For example, N=0: n_x=0, n_y=0; N=1: n_x=0, n_y=1 or n_x=1, n_y=-1 (but n_y can't be negative). So actually, N=1 would be n_x=0, n_y=1. Then N=2: n_x=1, n_y=0 or n_x=0, n_y=2.

To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \), the potential can be rewritten as:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 \left(1 + 3\cos^2(\theta)\right) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta)
\]

However, converting to Cartesian coordinates \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \), the potential simplifies to:
\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]

This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. The Hamiltonian separates into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:
\[
H_x = \frac{p_x^2}{2m} + 2kx^2 \quad \text{and} \quad H_y = \frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]

The angular frequencies for these oscillators are:
\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by \( E_n = \hbar\omega(n + \frac{1}{2}) \). Applying this to each direction:
\[
E_x = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
\[
E_y = \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Summing these contributions gives the total energy:
\[
E = E_x + E_y = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is:
\[
\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Let me check if the angular part can be separated by moving terms around.

Let me write the equation as:

(1/rR)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²) + (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

If I can arrange this so that terms depending on θ are on one side and terms depending on r on the other, then we can set each side equal to a separation constant. However, the term involving cos2θ still has r², which complicates things. Let's see:

Multiply through by r² to eliminate denominators:

r( d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4) + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E r²

This still mixes r and θ in the third and fourth terms. The presence of r^4 cos2θ makes separation difficult. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe using a coordinate system where the potential separates. Since the potential has a cos2θ term, maybe this suggests some sort of angular momentum coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be treated as a perturbation. But given that the problem is to find the exact energy spectrum, not a perturbative approach, we need an exact solution.

Alternatively, maybe the angular part can be transformed into a Mathieu equation, which deals with equations like Φ'' + [a - 2q cos2θ]Φ = 0. Let's check.

Looking back at the angular part of the equation. Let me isolate the angular terms. Let's start from the original Schrödinger equation and try to separate variables.

Original equation:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ] + V(r,θ)ψ = Eψ

Expressed as:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ] - (ħ²/(2m))(1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) + [ (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ ]ψ = Eψ

Assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Then, substitute:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ ] - (ħ²/(2m))(1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² + [ (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ ] RΦ = E RΦ

Divide both sides by RΦ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] - (ħ²/(2m))(1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

(1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Rearranged:

(1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/2 kr² cos²θ) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² = - (2m/ħ²) E

Bring the angular term to the left and the rest to the right:

(1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(3/2 kr² cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

But this still mixes variables. Let's try to collect terms in r and θ. Let's multiply through by r²:

r( d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 k r^4) + (d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(3/2 k r^4 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E r²

This is problematic because the term with cos²θ still has r^4. Therefore, unless the angular part can be expressed in terms of r, which complicates separation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or coordinate transformation that can make this separable.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let's recall that in Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/r². Then, the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (x²/r²) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x²

But x² + y² = r², so substituting:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:

Original potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ

Expressed in Cartesian coordinates:

cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Then,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + 3/2 k x² = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

So the potential is actually V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². This is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. That's a significant simplification!

So instead of working in polar coordinates, perhaps Cartesian coordinates are more straightforward here. The problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates because the potential is a sum of terms depending on x and y separately. Therefore, the energy levels can be found as the sum of the energies of two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.

In Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian is:

H = H_x + H_y

where H_x = (p_x²)/(2m) + 2k x²

and H_y = (p_y²)/(2m) + (1/2)k y²

The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential (1/2) m ω² x² are E_n = ħω(n + 1/2). Let's recall that ω = sqrt(k/m). However, here we have different spring constants for x and y directions.

For H_x: the potential is 2k x², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, for H_y: the potential is (1/2)k y², which is (1/2) m ω_y² y², so (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Therefore, the frequencies for the x and y oscillators are ω_x = 2 ω and ω_y = ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m)

Thus, the energy levels for each direction are:

E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2)

E_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Therefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, simplifying:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But we can also write this in terms of the standard harmonic oscillator energy levels. Let me check the expressions again.

Wait, let's recall the standard formula: For a 1D harmonic oscillator with angular frequency ω, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħ ω.

For the x-direction, the angular frequency ω_x is sqrt( (2k)/m * 2 ), but wait, actually, for H_x, the potential is 2k x². The standard form is (1/2) m ω² x², so equate:

2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² => ω_x² = 4k/m => ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, for H_y: (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Therefore, the energy levels are:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m)

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Thus, total energy E = E_x + E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

So, E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, since sqrt(k/m) is the base frequency ω_0 = sqrt(k/m), we can write:

E = ħ ω_0 (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But in terms of the original problem, the mass is m and the potential is given in terms of k. So this seems correct.

Alternatively, we can express the energy in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y. However, there might be a different way to index the energy levels. For example, sometimes in 2D harmonic oscillators, people use the total number of quanta, but here the frequencies are different in x and y directions, so the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as isotropic oscillators.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, if we want to write it in terms of the original parameters without introducing ω_0, then:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, we can factor out the 1/2:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y ) + (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )

But I think the first form is clearer.

Alternatively, since the problem was originally presented in polar coordinates, perhaps the solution expects an answer in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers. However, since we transformed to Cartesian coordinates and found it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, perhaps the answer is indeed in terms of n_x and n_y.

But let's check if there's another way. Suppose we had proceeded in polar coordinates. The potential V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. If we tried to separate variables, we might have an equation where the angular part has a term proportional to cos2θ. The angular equation would then look like:

d²Φ/dθ² + [ A - B cos2θ ] Φ = 0

where A and B are constants. This is the Mathieu equation. However, solving the Mathieu equation typically doesn't result in a simple energy spectrum with integer quantum numbers, unless certain conditions are met. However, in this case, transforming to Cartesian coordinates simplified the problem, so perhaps that's the intended approach.

Given that the potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are straightforward. Thus, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy expressed in terms of the usual (n + m + 1) type terms, but with different coefficients. Let me check the constants again.

Wait, in the x-direction, the frequency is ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), so the energy contribution is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m )

Similarly, in the y-direction, ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )

Thus, total energy:

E = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Which simplifies to:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, expressing sqrt(k/m) as ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), the energy is E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But without introducing ω, the answer is as above.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.

But let me check if this makes sense. For example, if n_x = n_y = 0, the ground state energy would be (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). Then, increasing n_x by 1 adds 2 ħ sqrt(k/m), and increasing n_y by 1 adds ħ sqrt(k/m). This seems reasonable for an anisotropic oscillator with different stiffness in x and y directions.

Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the energy levels in terms of polar coordinates quantum numbers, but given that the potential separates in Cartesian coordinates, the answer is more naturally expressed in terms of n_x and n_y. Therefore, the energy spectrum is as above.

Alternatively, could there be a substitution of variables that allows the expression in terms of a single quantum number? For example, if we let N = 2n_x + n_y, then the energy would be E_N = ħ sqrt(k/m) (N + 3/2 ). However, N can take values 0, 1, 2, ..., but each N corresponds to multiple (n_x, n_y) pairs. For example, N=0: n_x=0, n_y=0; N=1: n_x=0, n_y=1 or n_x=1, n_y=-1 (but n_y can't be negative). So actually, N=1 would be n_x=0, n_y=1. Then N=2: n_x=1, n_y=0 or n_x=0, n_y=2. So the energy levels are degenerate for certain combinations. However, since the problem asks for the energy spectrum, not the degeneracy, the expression in terms of n_x and n_y is sufficient.

But perhaps the answer is more appropriately written as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m). Since in harmonic oscillator problems, expressing energy in terms of ω is standard.

To confirm, let's check dimensional analysis. The term inside the parenthesis is dimensionless (quantum numbers plus 3/2). ħω has dimensions of energy, since ω is in radians per second, and ħ has dimensions of energy times time. So sqrt(k/m) has dimensions of 1/time, since k has dimensions [mass]/[time]^2 (as F = -kx implies k has [force]/[length] = [mass][time]^{-2}), so sqrt(k/m) is [1/time], so ħ * sqrt(k/m) has dimensions of energy. Correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, using ω = sqrt(k/m), then E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Either form is acceptable, but since the problem gives V in terms of k, perhaps keeping sqrt(k/m) is better.

Wait, but in harmonic oscillators, the standard form is (1/2)k x², which leads to ω = sqrt(k/m). However, in our case, the potential in x is 2k x², so we had to adjust ω_x accordingly. This was correctly accounted for by setting ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy expression is accurate.

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by the sum of the energies of two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions with frequencies ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m), leading to the energy levels as above.

Therefore, the answer should be:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of the original variables without separating into n_x and n_y, but given that the potential separates in Cartesian coordinates, expressing the energy in terms of n_x and n_y is the natural approach. Thus, the energy spectrum is as stated.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Therefore, the frequencies would be ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels for each direction are:\n\nE_x = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ*2*sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2)\n\nE_y = ħω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ*sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nTherefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nBut let me check again. The potential in x is 2k x², which is equivalent to (1/2)(4k)x², so the angular frequency for x is sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m). Similarly, the potential in y is (1/2)k y², so the angular frequency is sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energies are:\n\nE_x = (1/2)ħω_x (2n_x + 1) = (1/2)ħ*2*sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1) = ħ*sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1)\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, harmonic oscillator energy levels are E_n = ħω(n + 1/2). So, for the x-direction, ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m), so E_x = ħ*2*sqrt(k/m)*(n_x + 1/2). Similarly, for the y-direction, E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(n_y + 1/2). Therefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplifying further. Let me compute the constants. Let\'s denote ω_0 = sqrt(k/m). Then ω_x = 2ω_0 and ω_y = ω_0. Therefore, E_x = ħ*2ω_0(n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħ*ω_0(n_y + 1/2). Therefore, total energy E = 2ħω_0(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_0(n_y + 1/2) = ħω_0[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħω_0[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω_0[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nBut let me verify once again if this is accurate. Let\'s step back. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x², and H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y².\n\nEach of these is a harmonic oscillator. For H_x, the potential is (1/2)(4k)x², so the frequency is ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). For H_y, the potential is (1/2)k y², so ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy levels are E_x = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħω_y(n_y + 1/2). Thus, E_total = E_x + E_y = ħ(2 sqrt(k/m))(n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m)(n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Therefore, the energy levels are indeed quantized as E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers. Hence, the energy spectrum is determined.\n\nAlternatively, to express this in terms of the quantum numbers, perhaps we can introduce a different set of quantum numbers. For instance, if we let N = 2n_x + n_y, then E_N = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2). However, since 2n_x + n_y can take various values depending on n_x and n_y, the spectrum might exhibit degeneracies. For example, for a given N, possible combinations of n_x and n_y such that 2n_x + n_y = N. For each N, n_x can range from 0 to floor(N/2), and n_y = N - 2n_x. Therefore, the degeneracy for each energy level E_N would be floor(N/2) + 1. However, the problem only asks for the energy spectrum, so perhaps expressing it in terms of n_x and n_y is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, one might express the energy as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m). This seems appropriate.\n\nBut wait, let me check the constants once again. The original potential had V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When converted to Cartesian coordinates, that became 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which is correct. Then, the x-component has a spring constant of 4k (since V(x) = 2k x² = (1/2)(4k)x²). Therefore, ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, the y-component has a spring constant of k (since V(y) = (1/2)k y²), so ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy expressions are correct.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels are indeed E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]. Alternatively, factoring out sqrt(k/m), which is ω, the basic frequency, we can write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m).\n\nAlternatively, using the standard harmonic oscillator energy levels, which are E = (n + 1/2)ħω, here we have two different frequencies, so the total energy is the sum of the two individual energies. Therefore, E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y. Substituting ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), gives E = (n_x + 1/2)2ħω + (n_y + 1/2)ħω = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]ħω = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]ħω = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]ħω. So, that\'s consistent.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Therefore, the possible energy levels are quantized in terms of these two quantum numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if we prefer to express the energy in terms of a single quantum number, we can note that each energy level corresponds to a specific combination of n_x and n_y. However, due to the anisotropy (different frequencies in x and y), the degeneracy of each energy level might be different from the isotropic case.\n\nFor example, the ground state (n_x = 0, n_y = 0) has energy E = (0 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited states would be when either n_x or n_y increments by 1. If n_x increases by 1, E becomes (2*1 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. If n_y increases by 1, E becomes (2*0 + 1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω as well. Wait, so both (n_x=1, n_y=0) and (n_x=0, n_y=1) give the same energy of 5/2 ħω. Therefore, the first excited state is doubly degenerate. Similarly, higher energy levels may have higher degeneracies depending on the combinations of n_x and n_y. However, the problem doesn\'t require the degeneracy, just the energy spectrum. So, the energy levels can be written as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nBut maybe there\'s a different way to parametrize it. Let\'s consider defining a quantum number related to the sum 2n_x + n_y. Let N = 2n_x + n_y. Then, for each integer N ≥ 0, there are multiple (n_x, n_y) pairs that satisfy 2n_x + n_y = N. For example:\n\n- N = 0: n_x = 0, n_y = 0\n- N = 1: n_x = 0, n_y = 1\n- N = 2: n_x = 1, n_y = 0 or n_x = 0, n_y = 2\n- N = 3: n_x = 1, n_y = 1 or n_x = 0, n_y = 3\n- Etc.\n\nTherefore, each N corresponds to a certain number of states, but the energy for each N is E = ħω(N + 3/2). However, this is only true if all combinations (n_x, n_y) with 2n_x + n_y = N have the same energy. However, in reality, the energy is E = ħω(N + 3/2) where N = 2n_x + n_y, so each N corresponds to a specific energy. Therefore, the energy levels are E_N = ħω(N + 3/2), where N is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), and the degeneracy of each level E_N is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions (n_x, n_y) such that 2n_x + n_y = N. However, the problem doesn’t require the degeneracy, so the energy spectrum can be presented as E_N = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2) with N = 0, 1, 2, ... Alternatively, keeping the original quantum numbers, E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. For instance, when N = 0, E = ħω(0 + 3/2) = (3/2)ħω. For N = 1, E = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. For N = 2, E = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω, and so on. Each N corresponds to an energy level with increasing energy by ħω each time N increases by 1. However, the spacing between energy levels is ħω, but because N increases by 1 each time, but the actual steps in energy when changing n_x and n_y can be different. However, since N = 2n_x + n_y, increasing n_x by 1 increases N by 2, while increasing n_y by 1 increases N by 1. Therefore, the energy levels would have a structure where some levels are spaced by ħω and others by 2ħω. Wait, perhaps that complicates things.\n\nWait, no. If we write E_N = ħω(N + 3/2), then each N is an integer, so the energy levels are spaced by ħω. However, the actual possible transitions depend on how N can change. But since the problem only asks for the energy spectrum, not the transitions, perhaps expressing it in terms of N is acceptable. However, in reality, the energy levels can be written as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), which is equivalent to E = ħω( (2n_x) + n_y + 3/2 ). Here, 2n_x and n_y are integers, so 2n_x + n_y can take all non-negative integer values. For example:\n\n- If n_x = 0, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 0,1,2,...\n- If n_x = 1, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 2,3,4,...\n- If n_x = 2, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 4,5,6,...\n\nTherefore, N can take all non-negative integers, but some values of N can be achieved in multiple ways (as seen earlier). Therefore, the energy levels are E = ħω(N + 3/2) where N is 0,1,2,..., and each E_N has a certain degeneracy. However, the problem doesn\'t specify to express the energy in terms of N, so perhaps it\'s clearer to leave it in terms of n_x and n_y. Either way, both forms are correct, but the second one (in terms of N) might be more concise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy levels in terms of the standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. But in standard 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = ħω(n_x + n_y + 1), which is different from this case due to the anisotropy.\n\nIn our case, since the frequencies in x and y are different (ω_x = 2ω, ω_y = ω), the energy is E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) = ħ(2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2))ω = ħ(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ω. So, this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nHence, this is the solution. To recap, the key insight was recognizing that converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates reveals separability into x and y components with different spring constants, leading to an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are then simply the sum of the energies from each independent oscillator. This approach circumvents the complexity of dealing with the angular component in polar coordinates, which initially seemed challenging.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the energy spectrum is E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers. Alternatively, expressing ω explicitly, E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where ω = sqrt(k/m).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is given by \\boxed{E = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} where \\(n_x\\) and \\(n_y\\) are non-negative integers.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386088, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5035, prompt_tokens=1130, total_tokens=6165, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

The potential in polar coordinates is given by:
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \), we rewrite the potential as:
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 \left(1 + 3 \cos^2(\theta)\right) \]

Converting to Cartesian coordinates where \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \), we get:
\[ V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 \]
\[ V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \]

This potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. The Hamiltonian is separable into \( x \) and \( y \) components:
\[ H = \frac{p_x^2}{2m} + 2kx^2 + \frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \]

The angular frequencies for the harmonic oscillators in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions are:
\[ \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]
\[ \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]

The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator in each direction are given by:
\[ E_x = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]
\[ E_y = \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[ E_x = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]
\[ E_y = \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

The total energy is the sum of the energies from each direction:
\[ E = E_x + E_y = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \right] \]
\[ E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right) \]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[ \boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} \]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Let's see:

Let me denote:

Term1: (1/(rR))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr²)
Term2: (1/(r²Φ))(d²Φ/dθ²) - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 kr² cos2θ)

So, Term1 + Term2 = - (2m/ħ²) E

But Term1 is r-dependent (except for the angular term in Term2 that still has r² cos2θ). Therefore, this seems non-separable unless we can manipulate the terms to isolate r and θ dependencies. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or coordinate transformation that can make this separable. For instance, if the angular part can be expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of some operator, similar to the standard central potential case where angular momentum eigenfunctions are used.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the potential in a different coordinate system. The presence of cos²θ suggests that maybe using Cartesian coordinates could be helpful? Let's check.

Expressing the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ, so cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/r². Hence, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²*(x²/r²) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

But kr²/2 + 3k x²/2 can be rewritten as (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² (since r² = x² + y²). Combining terms:

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So, in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². That's interesting! So, the potential is actually separable into x and y components, each with their own spring constants. Therefore, the problem reduces to a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different frequencies along the x and y axes.

Wait a minute, that's a significant simplification. Instead of dealing with polar coordinates and struggling with angular dependencies, converting to Cartesian coordinates reveals the potential is separable into x and y directions. Therefore, the energy spectrum can be determined by considering the sum of the energies of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in x and y directions with different frequencies.

Let me verify this. Starting from the original potential in Cartesian coordinates:

V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Therefore, the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = (p_x²)/(2m) + (p_y²)/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

This is indeed separable into x and y components. The x-component has a "spring constant" of 4k (since the potential is (1/2)(4k)x²) and the y-component has a "spring constant" of k (since the potential is (1/2)(k)y²). Therefore, the frequencies would be ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Therefore, the energy levels for each direction are:

E_x = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ*2*sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2)

E_y = ħω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ*sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Therefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

But let me check again. The potential in x is 2k x², which is equivalent to (1/2)(4k)x², so the angular frequency for x is sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m). Similarly, the potential in y is (1/2)k y², so the angular frequency is sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energies are:

E_x = (1/2)ħω_x (2n_x + 1) = (1/2)ħ*2*sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1) = ħ*sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1)

Wait, hold on. Wait, harmonic oscillator energy levels are E_n = ħω(n + 1/2). So, for the x-direction, ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m), so E_x = ħ*2*sqrt(k/m)*(n_x + 1/2). Similarly, for the y-direction, E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(n_y + 1/2). Therefore, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ*sqrt(k/m)[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Alternatively, perhaps simplifying further. Let me compute the constants. Let's denote ω_0 = sqrt(k/m). Then ω_x = 2ω_0 and ω_y = ω_0. Therefore, E_x = ħ*2ω_0(n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħ*ω_0(n_y + 1/2). Therefore, total energy E = 2ħω_0(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_0(n_y + 1/2) = ħω_0[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħω_0[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω_0[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

But let me verify once again if this is accurate. Let's step back. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x², and H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y².

Each of these is a harmonic oscillator. For H_x, the potential is (1/2)(4k)x², so the frequency is ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). For H_y, the potential is (1/2)k y², so ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy levels are E_x = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) and E_y = ħω_y(n_y + 1/2). Thus, E_total = E_x + E_y = ħ(2 sqrt(k/m))(n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m)(n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the energy levels are indeed quantized as E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers. Hence, the energy spectrum is determined.

Alternatively, to express this in terms of the quantum numbers, perhaps we can introduce a different set of quantum numbers. For instance, if we let N = 2n_x + n_y, then E_N = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2). However, since 2n_x + n_y can take various values depending on n_x and n_y, the spectrum might exhibit degeneracies. For example, for a given N, possible combinations of n_x and n_y such that 2n_x + n_y = N. For each N, n_x can range from 0 to floor(N/2), and n_y = N - 2n_x. Therefore, the degeneracy for each energy level E_N would be floor(N/2) + 1. However, the problem only asks for the energy spectrum, so perhaps expressing it in terms of n_x and n_y is sufficient.

Alternatively, one might express the energy as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m). This seems appropriate.

But wait, let me check the constants once again. The original potential had V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When converted to Cartesian coordinates, that became 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which is correct. Then, the x-component has a spring constant of 4k (since V(x) = 2k x² = (1/2)(4k)x²). Therefore, ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, the y-component has a spring constant of k (since V(y) = (1/2)k y²), so ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy expressions are correct.

Therefore, the energy levels are indeed E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]. Alternatively, factoring out sqrt(k/m), which is ω, the basic frequency, we can write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m).

Alternatively, using the standard harmonic oscillator energy levels, which are E = (n + 1/2)ħω, here we have two different frequencies, so the total energy is the sum of the two individual energies. Therefore, E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y. Substituting ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), gives E = (n_x + 1/2)2ħω + (n_y + 1/2)ħω = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]ħω = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]ħω = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]ħω. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Therefore, the possible energy levels are quantized in terms of these two quantum numbers.

Alternatively, if we prefer to express the energy in terms of a single quantum number, we can note that each energy level corresponds to a specific combination of n_x and n_y. However, due to the anisotropy (different frequencies in x and y), the degeneracy of each energy level might be different from the isotropic case.

For example, the ground state (n_x = 0, n_y = 0) has energy E = (0 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited states would be when either n_x or n_y increments by 1. If n_x increases by 1, E becomes (2*1 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. If n_y increases by 1, E becomes (2*0 + 1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω as well. Wait, so both (n_x=1, n_y=0) and (n_x=0, n_y=1) give the same energy of 5/2 ħω. Therefore, the first excited state is doubly degenerate. Similarly, higher energy levels may have higher degeneracies depending on the combinations of n_x and n_y. However, the problem doesn't require the degeneracy, just the energy spectrum. So, the energy levels can be written as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

But maybe there's a different way to parametrize it. Let's consider defining a quantum number related to the sum 2n_x + n_y. Let N = 2n_x + n_y. Then, for each integer N ≥ 0, there are multiple (n_x, n_y) pairs that satisfy 2n_x + n_y = N. For example:

- N = 0: n_x = 0, n_y = 0
- N = 1: n_x = 0, n_y = 1
- N = 2: n_x = 1, n_y = 0 or n_x = 0, n_y = 2
- N = 3: n_x = 1, n_y = 1 or n_x = 0, n_y = 3
- Etc.

Therefore, each N corresponds to a certain number of states, but the energy for each N is E = ħω(N + 3/2). However, this is only true if all combinations (n_x, n_y) with 2n_x + n_y = N have the same energy. However, in reality, the energy is E = ħω(N + 3/2) where N = 2n_x + n_y, so each N corresponds to a specific energy. Therefore, the energy levels are E_N = ħω(N + 3/2), where N is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), and the degeneracy of each level E_N is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions (n_x, n_y) such that 2n_x + n_y = N. However, the problem doesn’t require the degeneracy, so the energy spectrum can be presented as E_N = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2) with N = 0, 1, 2, ... Alternatively, keeping the original quantum numbers, E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

But let me check if this is correct. For instance, when N = 0, E = ħω(0 + 3/2) = (3/2)ħω. For N = 1, E = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. For N = 2, E = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω, and so on. Each N corresponds to an energy level with increasing energy by ħω each time N increases by 1. However, the spacing between energy levels is ħω, but because N increases by 1 each time, but the actual steps in energy when changing n_x and n_y can be different. However, since N = 2n_x + n_y, increasing n_x by 1 increases N by 2, while increasing n_y by 1 increases N by 1. Therefore, the energy levels would have a structure where some levels are spaced by ħω and others by 2ħω. Wait, perhaps that complicates things.

Wait, no. If we write E_N = ħω(N + 3/2), then each N is an integer, so the energy levels are spaced by ħω. However, the actual possible transitions depend on how N can change. But since the problem only asks for the energy spectrum, not the transitions, perhaps expressing it in terms of N is acceptable. However, in reality, the energy levels can be written as E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), which is equivalent to E = ħω( (2n_x) + n_y + 3/2 ). Here, 2n_x and n_y are integers, so 2n_x + n_y can take all non-negative integer values. For example:

- If n_x = 0, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 0,1,2,...
- If n_x = 1, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 2,3,4,...
- If n_x = 2, n_y can be 0,1,2,... so N = 4,5,6,...

Therefore, N can take all non-negative integers, but some values of N can be achieved in multiple ways (as seen earlier). Therefore, the energy levels are E = ħω(N + 3/2) where N is 0,1,2,..., and each E_N has a certain degeneracy. However, the problem doesn't specify to express the energy in terms of N, so perhaps it's clearer to leave it in terms of n_x and n_y. Either way, both forms are correct, but the second one (in terms of N) might be more concise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy levels in terms of the standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. But in standard 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = ħω(n_x + n_y + 1), which is different from this case due to the anisotropy.

In our case, since the frequencies in x and y are different (ω_x = 2ω, ω_y = ω), the energy is E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) = ħ(2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2))ω = ħ(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ω. So, this is correct.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

Hence, this is the solution. To recap, the key insight was recognizing that converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates reveals separability into x and y components with different spring constants, leading to an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are then simply the sum of the energies from each independent oscillator. This approach circumvents the complexity of dealing with the angular component in polar coordinates, which initially seemed challenging.

Therefore, the final answer for the energy spectrum is E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers. Alternatively, expressing ω explicitly, E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where ω = sqrt(k/m).

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.
