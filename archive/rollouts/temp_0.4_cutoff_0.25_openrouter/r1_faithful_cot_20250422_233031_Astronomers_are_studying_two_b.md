# Original Question

Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and the total mass of the binary star systems. The total mass of a binary system can be calculated using the formula:

\[
M = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2\pi G}
\]

where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since we are comparing the masses of the two systems, the constants cancel out, and the ratio of the masses is given by:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(K_{1_1} + K_{2_1})^3 \cdot P_1}{(K_{1_2} + K_{2_2})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

For system_1:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_{1_1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_{2_1} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_{1_1} + K_{2_1} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)

For system_2:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_{1_2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_{2_2} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_{1_2} + K_{2_2} = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)

Substituting these values into the ratio formula:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = \frac{54}{125}
\]

Thus, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \(\boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both are binary star systems, and we have some data on their eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Let me recall what I know about binary stars and how these parameters relate to their masses.

First, the period of the eclipses should correspond to the orbital period of the stars around each other. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, and for system_2 it's 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes tell us how fast each star is moving in its orbit. For each system, there are two stars with different RV amplitudes. I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star moves more slowly, so the ratio of their velocities is inverse to the ratio of their masses. So if one star has a velocity amplitude of 10 km/s and the other 5 km/s in system_1, then the mass ratio is 5:10, which simplifies to 1:2. Wait, no, actually, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then mass_A / mass_B = v_B / v_A. So for system_1, mass_1/mass_2 = 5/10 = 1/2, so mass_1 is half the mass of mass_2. But actually, since they are orbiting each other, the total mass would be mass_1 + mass_2. Similarly for system_2.

But how do we connect the velocities, period, and the masses? I think Kepler's third law is involved here. The formula for binary stars is (mass_1 + mass_2) * P^2 / (4π²) = (a_1 + a_2)^3 / G, where P is the period, and a_1 and a_2 are the semi-major axes of the orbits. Alternatively, since the stars are orbiting the center of mass, their velocities are related to their distances from the center of mass. So the velocity ratio is inverse to the mass ratio. So if v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars, then m1/m2 = v2/v1. That seems right.

Also, the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass is proportional to their velocity multiplied by the period. Because the distance is velocity times time, but since it's an orbit, maybe a = v * P / (2π). Wait, the circumference of the orbit is 2πa, and the velocity is 2πa / P, so a = v * P / (2π). So the semi-major axis for each star is a1 = v1 * P / (2π) and a2 = v2 * P / (2π). Then the total separation between the two stars is a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π).

But Kepler's third law in terms of total mass is (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * (a)^3 / P². Substituting a from above:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [(v1 + v2) * P / (2π)]^3 / P²

Simplifying that:

= (4π² / G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P^3 / (8π³) ) / P²

= (4π² / G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (8π³ )

= (4 / (8π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

But I might have messed up the constants. Let me check the exact formula.

Alternatively, using the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. For a binary system, the radial velocity K (semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (m + M)^(2/3) )

Wait, but that might be for exoplanets where one mass is much smaller. For a binary star system with two masses m1 and m2, the radial velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2, which are related to their velocities around the center of mass. The ratio K1/K2 = m2/m1. So m1/m2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. So m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 1/2. Therefore, m2 = 2 m1. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = 3 m1. Similarly, for system_2, K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. Therefore, m1 = (2/3) m2, so total mass is m1 + m2 = (5/3) m2.

But how do we get the actual masses? Because we need to relate the velocities, period, and the total mass. Let's recall that in a binary system, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the orbital speeds of the two stars. The orbital period P is the same for both stars. The separation between the stars is a = a1 + a2, where a1 = K1 * P / (2π) and a2 = K2 * P / (2π). Therefore, a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π).

Now, using Kepler's third law: (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * a³ / P².

Substituting a:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]³ / P²

Simplifying:

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

= (4 / (8 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

But the problem is that we don't know the value of G in the right units. Wait, but since we are comparing the two systems, maybe the constants will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses.

Let me denote M1 as the total mass of system_1 and M2 as the total mass of system_2. Then:

M1 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1

M2 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2

Therefore, the ratio M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Since all the constants (2 π G) cancel out.

So plugging in the numbers:

For system_1: K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, P1 = 2 years

For system_2: K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s, P2 = 1 year

Therefore,

M1/M2 = [ (10 + 5)^3 * 2 ] / [ (15 + 10)^3 * 1 ]

Compute the numerator: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

Denominator: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625

So M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625 = Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 / 25 = 270, 15625 /25 = 625

So 270 / 625. Hmm, 270 divided by 625. Let's compute:

625 × 0.4 = 250, 625 × 0.432 = 270? Let's check:

625 × 0.432 = 625 × 0.4 + 625 × 0.032 = 250 + 20 = 270. Yes. So 270/625 = 0.432.

But maybe simplify the fraction. Let's see if 270 and 625 have a common factor. 270 is 2×3³×5, 625 is 5⁴. So common factor is 5. So 270 ÷5=54, 625 ÷5=125. So 54/125. Which is 0.432. So M1/M2 = 54/125 ≈0.432. Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But 0.432 is less than 1, which would mean system_1 is less massive. But the problem says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the ratio again. M1 is the mass of system_1, M2 is the mass of system_2. If M1/M2 = 54/125 ≈0.432, then system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. But the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Hmm. That suggests that maybe I inverted the ratio. Let me check.

Wait, the formula was M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Plugging in:

K1_1 + K2_1 = 10 +5=15, P1=2

K1_2 + K2_2=15+10=25, P2=1

So numerator: 15³ *2 = 3375*2=6750

Denominator:25³*1=15625*1=15625

So 6750/15625=54/125≈0.432. So M1/M2≈0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive by a factor of 1/0.432≈2.315. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But according to this, system_1 is less massive. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again. The formula for the total mass:

M1 + M2 = (4π²/G) * a³ / P²

But we expressed a in terms of (K1 + K2)*P/(2π). So substituting:

M1 + M2 = (4π²/G) * [ (K1 + K2)*P/(2π) ]³ / P²

= (4π²/G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

Simplify the constants:

4π² / 8 π³ = (4 /8) * (π² / π³) = 0.5 * (1/π) = 1/(2π)

So M1 + M2 = (1/(2π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. Therefore, the ratio of the masses is ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Which is exactly what I did before. So the ratio is 15^3 *2 /25^3 *1= 3375*2 /15625= 6750/15625≈0.432. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" There's a contradiction here. Either I did something wrong, or maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly. Wait, let me check the problem again.

The problem states: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

Hmm, according to my calculation, system_1 is less massive. But maybe I inverted the ratio. Wait, let's check the formula again. Wait, in the formula, the mass is proportional to (velocity sum)^3 * period. So for system_1, velocity sum is 15 km/s, period 2 years. For system_2, velocity sum 25 km/s, period 1 year. So plugging into the formula:

M1 ∝ 15³ *2

M2 ∝25³ *1

Therefore, M1/M2= (15³ *2)/(25³ *1)= (3375 *2)/15625= 6750/15625=54/125≈0.432. So M1=0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_2 is more massive. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive, but the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". This is confusing. Maybe there's an error in the problem statement? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, let's check the velocity amplitudes again. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So K1=10, K2=5. For system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So the velocity sums are 15 and 25. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the mass uses the individual velocities differently. Wait, another approach: since the mass ratio is m1/m2 = K2/K1, as the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses.

So for system_1:

m1/m2 = 5/10=0.5 → m2=2 m1. So total mass M1= m1 + m2=3 m1.

Similarly, for system_2:

m1/m2=10/15=2/3 → m1= (2/3) m2 → total mass M2= m1 + m2= (5/3) m2.

But how to relate this to the actual masses? We need to use Kepler's law. The formula involving the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The general formula for the total mass is:

M1 + M2 = (P / (2π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3

Wait, but units here might be tricky. Let's recall that Kepler's third law in astronomical units uses specific units, but since we are taking a ratio, maybe the units cancel.

But let's think in terms of Kepler's third law:

(M1 + M2) * P^2 = (a1 + a2)^3 / (G / (4π²))

But a1 = K1 * P / (2π), a2 = K2 * P / (2π). So a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π). Therefore:

(M1 + M2) * P^2 = [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]^3 / (G / (4π²))

Multiply both sides by G / (4π²):

(M1 + M2) * P^2 * G / (4π²) = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 π³) ]

Multiply both sides by 4π² / G:

(M1 + M2) * P^2 = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 π³) ] * 4π² / G

Simplify RHS:

= (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 * 4π² / (8 π³ G )

= (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (2 π G )

Therefore:

(M1 + M2) = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

Which is the same as before. So the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So the ratio is:

M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Which gives us 15^3 *2 /25^3 *1≈0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_2 is more massive by a factor of 1/0.432≈2.315. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Since 0.432 is less than 1, this would mean system_1 is less massive. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I confused the velocity amplitudes. Let me check another source. In a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the masses by the formula:

K1/K2 = m2/m1

So m1/m2 = K2/K1

Therefore, for system_1, m1/m2 =5/10=0.5, so m1=0.5 m2, total mass=1.5 m2

Wait, no, m1 + m2 = m2 + 0.5 m2=1.5 m2. Wait, but in this case, m2 is the mass of the second star. Wait, perhaps I need to express the total mass in terms of one of the velocities.

Alternatively, using the formula:

M1 + M2 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG)

But since we are taking the ratio, G cancels. So the ratio is:

M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

But according to this, it's (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)= (3375*2)/15625=6750/15625=54/125=0.432. So M1=0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I inverted system_1 and system_2.

Wait, checking the problem again:

"Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s."

So system_1 has period 2 years, RV 10 and 5. System_2 period 1 year, RV 15 and 10.

So my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, so system_2 is more massive. But the question asks the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the periods are mixed up. Wait, the problem says "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2". So system_1 has period 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. So my calculation is correct. So maybe the answer is that system_1 is less massive, but the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the mass function instead of the total mass. Wait, but the problem says to consider the mass of the system as the sum of the masses. So we can't use the mass function which depends on the inclination angle. However, in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1. But even then, the mass function is:

f(m) = (m2³ sin³ i)/( (m1 + m2)² )

But since we have both velocities, we can determine the mass ratio and hence the total mass. Wait, but if we have both velocities, then we can determine the mass ratio m1/m2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1:

m1/m2 =5/10=0.5, so m2=2 m1. Total mass M1=3 m1.

Similarly, for system_2:

m1/m2=10/15=2/3, so m2=1.5 m1. Total mass M2=2.5 m1.

But we need to find the actual masses. To do this, we use Kepler's third law.

The formula connecting the period, velocities, and total mass.

From Kepler's third law:

M1 + M2 = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But a1 = v1 * P / (2π), a2 = v2 * P / (2π). So a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π)

Therefore:

M1 + M2 = (4π²/G) * [ (v1 + v2) * P / (2π) ]³ / P²

= (4π²/G) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P³ / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

= ( (4π²) / (8 π³ G) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P. Since we are comparing two systems, the ratio of their masses is:

M1/M2 = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Plugging in the values:

For system_1: v1=10, v2=5, P=2

For system_2: v1=15, v2=10, P=1

So:

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/15625 = 6750/15625 = 54/125 ≈0.432

Therefore, M1 ≈0.432 M2, so system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~2.315. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is contradictory.

Is there a possibility that the problem uses the semi-amplitude of each star's velocity around the center of mass, and there's a different formula? Let me check another source.

Wait, according to the formula for the total mass of a binary system when you have both radial velocity amplitudes:

The total mass M = (P * (K1 + K2)^3 ) / (2πG sin³i )

But since the system is eclipsing, sin i ≈1, so we can ignore it. Therefore, the total mass is proportional to P*(K1 + K2)^3. Therefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)=54/125≈0.432.

So unless there's a miscalculation here, the conclusion is that system_1 is less massive. But the problem states the opposite. Maybe the problem intended to swap the velocities or the periods? Let me check again.

Problem states:

system_1: period 2 years, RV 10 and 5 km/s

system_2: period 1 year, RV 15 and 10 km/s

If we swap the periods:

M1/M2= (15^3 *1)/(25^3 *2)=3375/(15625*2)=3375/31250≈0.108. Still less than 1.

If we swap the RV amplitudes:

Suppose system_1 has RV 15 and 10, system_2 has RV10 and5.

Then:

M1/M2= (25^3 *2)/(15^3 *1)= (15625*2)/3375≈31250/3375≈9.259. So system_1 would be more massive by factor ~9.26.

But that's not what the problem says.

Alternatively, maybe the problem swapped the velocity amplitudes for the two systems. If system_1 had higher velocities, but according to the problem, system_2 has higher velocities (15 and10 vs 10 and5).

Alternatively, maybe the formula should be (K1 + K2)^3 / P², but no, the period is in the numerator. Wait, let's think about physical intuition. For a given separation, a shorter period implies higher velocity. But if the period is longer, the stars are farther apart, so velocities are lower. But in our case, system_1 has a longer period (2 years) and lower velocity amplitudes (10 and5) compared to system_2 which has a shorter period (1 year) and higher velocities (15 and10). So the velocities and periods are inversely related, which makes sense. Because if you have a shorter period, the stars are closer, so they move faster. So system_2 has higher velocities and shorter period, which makes sense.

But according to the formula, the mass is proportional to (velocity sum)^3 * period. So even though system_2 has a shorter period, its velocity sum is higher. So the cube of the velocity sum might dominate. Let's compute the velocity sums:

system_1:15, system_2:25. 25^3=15625 vs 15^3=3375. So even though system_2 has a shorter period (1 vs 2), the velocity sum cubed is much larger. So 25^3 is about 4.6 times larger than 15^3 (since 25/15≈1.666, 1.666³≈4.629). Then multiplied by period ratio (1 vs 2), so 4.629*(1/2)=2.314. So system_2's mass is larger by factor ~2.314. Therefore, system_1 is 1/2.314≈0.432 times as massive as system_2.

Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, so system_2 is more massive. But the question asks the opposite. Is there a possibility that the problem intended to ask the reverse? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio direction.

Wait, the question says: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the calculation, the answer is that system_1 is not more massive; it's less massive. But since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, the answer would be 54/125, which is approximately 0.432. Even though it's less than 1, this is the factor. So perhaps the answer is 54/125 or 0.432, and the phrasing is correct if we interpret "more massive" as "times as massive", regardless of the factor being less than 1. So even though system_1 is less massive, the factor is 0.432.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the reciprocal, assuming that the larger velocities and shorter period imply higher mass. But in reality, higher velocities can imply higher mass if the period is the same, but here the periods are different.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think differently. If we use the mass ratio m1/m2=K2/K1, then for system_1:

m1/m2=5/10=0.5, so total mass M1= m1 + m2=0.5 m2 + m2=1.5 m2=3 m1

For system_2:

m1/m2=10/15=2/3, so total mass M2= m1 + m2=2/3 m2 + m2=5/3 m2=2.5 m1 (if m1=2/3 m2)

But without knowing the actual values of m1 or m2, we can't compare M1 and M2. So we need to relate them via Kepler's law.

Alternatively, using the formula:

For each system, the total mass M= (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG)

But since G is constant, the ratio is as before.

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of 54/125, which is approximately 0.432. But the question says "more massive". So unless there's a mistake, the answer is 54/125, but phrased as "more massive", which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of the mass ratio of the systems, and the reciprocal.

But according to the strict calculation, the answer is 54/125. Therefore, the factor is 54/125, and since it's less than 1, system_1 is less massive. However, the problem asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", which is technically incorrect. But maybe I should provide the calculated factor, even if it's less than 1.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as the reciprocal because of a different approach. Let me check with another method.

Alternative method: The mass of the system can be found using the formula for each star's mass.

For star 1 in system_1:

m1 = (K2 * (K1 + K2)^2 * P) / (2πG)

Similarly, star 2:

m2 = (K1 * (K1 + K2)^2 * P) / (2πG)

Therefore, total mass M1= m1 + m2= (K2 + K1) * (K1 + K2)^2 * P / (2πG )= (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG )

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the ratio is still (15³*2)/(25³*1)=54/125≈0.432.

Therefore, I think the answer is 54/125, or simplifying, 54/125 cannot be simplified further. So the factor is 54/125, which is 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So the answer is 54/125.

But the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". If we strictly answer the question, even though system_1 is less massive, the factor is 54/125. But maybe the problem expects the absolute value or the reciprocal. However, since the user instruction says to provide the factor, and the calculation leads to 54/125, I think that's the answer, even if it's counterintuitive.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is M= (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG). So the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So for system_1:15^3 *2, system_2:25^3 *1. So ratio is (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)= (3375*2)/15625=6750/15625=54/125. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 54/125. So boxed, it would be \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both are binary star systems, and we have some data on their eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Let me recall what I know about binary stars and how these parameters relate to their masses.

First, the period of the eclipses should correspond to the orbital period of the stars around each other. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, and for system_2 it's 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes tell us how fast each star is moving in its orbit. For each system, there are two stars with different RV amplitudes. I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star moves more slowly, so the ratio of their velocities is inverse to the ratio of their masses. So if one star has a velocity amplitude of 10 km/s and the other 5 km/s in system_1, then the mass ratio is 5:10, which simplifies to 1:2. Wait, no, actually, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then mass_A / mass_B = v_B / v_A. So for system_1, mass_1/mass_2 = 5/10 = 1/2, so mass_1 is half the mass of mass_2. But actually, since they are orbiting each other, the total mass would be mass_1 + mass_2. Similarly for system_2.

But how do we connect the velocities, period, and the masses? I think Kepler's third law is involved here. The formula for binary stars is (mass_1 + mass_2) * P^2 / (4π²) = (a_1 + a_2)^3 / G, where P is the period, and a_1 and a_2 are the semi-major axes of the orbits. Alternatively, since the stars are orbiting the center of mass, their velocities are related to their distances from the center of mass. So the velocity ratio is inverse to the mass ratio. So if v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars, then m1/m2 = v2/v1. That seems right.

Also, the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass is proportional to their velocity multiplied by the period. Because the distance is velocity times time, but since it's an orbit, maybe a = v * P / (2π). Wait, the circumference of the orbit is 2πa, and the velocity is 2πa / P, so a = v * P / (2π). So the semi-major axis for each star is a1 = v1 * P / (2π) and a2 = v2 * P / (2π). Then the total separation between the two stars is a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π).

But Kepler's third law in terms of total mass is (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * (a)^3 / P². Substituting a from above:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [(v1 + v2) * P / (2π)]^3 / P²

Simplifying that:

= (4π² / G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P^3 / (8π³) ) / P²

= (4π² / G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (8π³ )

= (4 / (8π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

But I might have messed up the constants. Let me check the exact formula.

Alternatively, using the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. For a binary system, the radial velocity K (semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (m + M)^(2/3) )

Wait, but that might be for exoplanets where one mass is much smaller. For a binary star system with two masses m1 and m2, the radial velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2, which are related to their velocities around the center of mass. The ratio K1/K2 = m2/m1. So m1/m2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. So m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 1/2. Therefore, m2 = 2 m1. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = 3 m1. Similarly, for system_2, K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. Therefore, m1 = (2/3) m2, so total mass is m1 + m2 = (5/3) m2.

But how do we get the actual masses? Because we need to relate the velocities, period, and the total mass. Let's recall that in a binary system, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the orbital speeds of the two stars. The orbital period P is the same for both stars. The separation between the stars is a = a1 + a2, where a1 = K1 * P / (2π) and a2 = K2 * P / (2π). Therefore, a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π).

Now, using Kepler's third law: (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * a³ / P².

Substituting a:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]³ / P²

Simplifying:

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

= (4 / (8 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

But the problem is that we don't know the value of G in the right units. Wait, but since we are comparing the two systems, maybe the constants will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses.

Let me denote M1 as the total mass of system_1 and M2 as the total mass of system_2. Then:

M1 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1

M2 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2

Therefore, the ratio M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Since all the constants (2 π G) cancel out.

So plugging in the numbers:

For system_1: K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, P1 = 2 years

For system_2: K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s, P2 = 1 year

Therefore,

M1/M2 = [ (10 + 5)^3 * 2 ] / [ (15 + 10)^3 * 1 ]

Compute the numerator: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

Denominator: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625

So M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625 = Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 / 25 = 270, 15625 /25 = 625

So 270 / 625. Hmm, 270 divided by 625. Let's compute:

625 × 0.4 = 250, 625 × 0.432 = 270? Let's check:

625 × 0.432 = 625 × 0.4 + 625 × 0.032 = 250 + 20 = 270. Yes. So 270/625 = 0.432.

But maybe simplify the fraction. Let's see if 270 and 625

I need to determine the mass ratio between two binary star systems by analyzing their eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Let me work through this methodically.

For binary star systems, I know that orbital periods correspond to eclipse periods, with system_1 having a 2-year period and system_2 having a 1-year period. The radial velocity amplitudes indicate how fast each star moves in its orbit, with the more massive star moving more slowly. The velocity ratio is inversely proportional to the mass ratio, so if stars have velocities v_A and v_B, then mass_A/mass_B = v_B/v_A.

For system_1, with velocities of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, the mass ratio is 5/10 = 1/2, meaning one star is half the mass of the other. The total system mass is the sum of both stars.

Kepler's third law helps connect velocity, period, and mass in binary systems. The semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass can be calculated as a = v × P/(2π), where v is velocity and P is period. The total separation between stars is a = a₁ + a₂ = (v₁ + v₂) × P/(2π).

Using Kepler's law in terms of total mass: (m₁ + m₂) = (4π²/G) × a³/P². Substituting and simplifying, we get:
(m₁ + m₂) = (1/(2πG)) × (v₁ + v₂)³ × P

For binary stars, the radial velocity amplitudes K₁ and K₂ give us the mass ratio: m₁/m₂ = K₂/K₁.

For system_1: K₁ = 10 km/s, K₂ = 5 km/s, so m₁/m₂ = 5/10 = 1/2, meaning m₂ = 2m₁, and total mass is 3m₁.
For system_2: K₁ = 15 km/s, K₂ = 10 km/s, so m₁/m₂ = 10/15 = 2/3, meaning m₁ = (2/3)m₂, and total mass is (5/3)m₂.

To compare the systems directly, I'll calculate the ratio of their total masses:
M₁/M₂ = [(K₁₁ + K₂₁)³ × P₁]/[(K₁₂ + K₂₂)³ × P₂]

Substituting the values:
M₁/M₂ = [(10 + 5)³ × 2]/[(15 + 10)³ × 1] = [15³ × 2]/[25³ × 1] = 6750/15625 = 270/625 = 0.432

Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2.

Alright, I need to determine by what factor system_1 is more massive compared to system_2. Both are binary star systems, and I have data on their eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Let's review the fundamental concepts of binary stars and how these parameters relate to their masses.

Firstly, the eclipse period should match the orbital period of the stars. The orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, while for system_2 it's 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes indicate star movement speeds in their orbits. In each system, the two stars have different RV amplitudes. In a binary system, the more massive star moves slower, so the velocity ratio is inverse to the mass ratio. Thus, if one star has a velocity amplitude of 10 km/s and the other 5 km/s in system_1, the mass ratio is 5:10, simplifying to 1:2. However, the mass ratio is actually inversely proportional to the velocity ratio. Therefore, if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then mass_A / mass_B = v_B / v_A. For system_1, mass_1/mass_2 = 5/10 = 1/2, indicating mass_1 is half of mass_2. Since they orbit each other, the total mass equals mass_1 + mass_2. The same applies to system_2.

To connect velocities, period, and masses, Kepler's third law is relevant. The formula for binary stars is (mass_1 + mass_2) * P^2 / (4π²) = (a_1 + a_2)^3 / G, where P is the period and a_1 and a_2 are the semi-major axes. Alternatively, since stars orbit the center of mass, their velocities relate to their distances from it. Therefore, the velocity ratio is inverse to the mass ratio. If v1 and v2 are velocities of the two stars, then m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Also, the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass is proportional to their velocity and period. Since distance equals velocity times time, but it's an orbit, perhaps a = v * P / (2π). The orbit circumference is 2πa, and velocity is 2πa / P, so a = v * P / (2π). Therefore, a1 = v1 * P / (2π) and a2 = v2 * P / (2π). Consequently, the total separation a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π).

Kepler's third law regarding total mass becomes (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * a³ / P². Substituting for a:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [(v1 + v2) * P / (2π)]³ / P²

Simplifying gives:

= (4π² / G) * ((v1 + v2)^3 * P^3 / 8π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * ((v1 + v2)^3 * P) / (8π³)

= (4 / (8π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P

But there might be a mistake with the constants. I should verify the formula.

Alternatively, considering the radial velocity semi-amplitude K, for a binary system, K = (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (m + M)^(2/3) ). However, that might apply to exoplanets with one much smaller mass. For binary stars with masses m1 and m2, radial velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2, related to their speeds around the center of mass. Thus K1/K2 = m2/m1, so m1/m2 = K2/K1.

For system_1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s, yielding m1/m2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 1/2. Hence, m2 = 2 * m1, making the total mass m1 + m2 = 3 * m1. Similarly, for system_2, K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s, leading to m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. Therefore, m1 = (2/3) * m2, resulting in a total mass of m1 + m2 = (5/3) * m2.

To find actual masses, relate velocities, period, and total mass. In a binary system, velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 correlate with the orbital speeds. Both stars share the orbital period P, and star separation is a = a1 + a2, where a1 = K1 * P / (2π) and a2 = K2 * P / (2π), hence a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π).

Applying Kepler's third law: (m1 + m2) = (4π² / G) * a³ / P². With a:

m1 + m2 = (4π² / G) * [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]³ / P²

Simplifying further:

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P³ / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

= (4 / (8 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

The challenge is we lack the precise G value in suitable units. However, since we're comparing these systems, constants might cancel in the mass ratio.

Let M1 denote system_1's total mass and M2 system_2's total mass:

M1 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1

M2 = (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2

Thus, M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ], canceling constants (2 π G).

Inputting specifics:

For system_1: K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, P1 = 2 years

For system_2: K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s, P2 = 1 year

So,

M1/M2 = [ (10 + 5)^3 * 2 ] / [ (15 + 10)^3 * 1 ]

Numerator: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

Denominator: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625

Therefore, M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625. Let's determine:

Reduce numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 / 25 = 270, 15625 / 25 = 625

Hence, 270 / 625. Calculating 270 divided by 625 gives approximately 0.432.

Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But 0.432 is less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive. But that contradicts the initial thought? Wait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, system_1 has a longer period (2 years) compared to system_2 (1 year). Also, the velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 and 5, so sum 15, while system_2 has 15 and 10, sum 25. So (15)^3 * 2 vs (25)^3 *1. Hmm, 15^3 is 3375 *2=6750, 25^3=15625. So 6750/15625=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" But according to this, it\'s less massive. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the ratio. The question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the ratio M1/M2 = 0.432, then system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning it\'s less massive. But maybe the problem is expecting the reciprocal? Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, the formula: M1/M2 = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P ]_1 / [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P ]_2\n\nPlugging in:\n\nSystem_1: (10 +5)^3 *2 = 15^3 *2 = 3375*2=6750\n\nSystem_2: (15 +10)^3 *1 =25^3 *1=15625\n\nSo 6750/15625=0.432. So M1=0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2, so system_2 is more massive. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So either the answer is 0.432, meaning it\'s actually less massive, or I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let\'s rederive it.\n\nStarting from Kepler\'s third law: (m1 + m2) = (4π²/G) * (a)^3 / P²\n\nBut a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, which is a = a1 + a2. Each a1 and a2 can be expressed as (K1 * P)/(2π) and (K2 * P)/(2π) respectively. So a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π)\n\nTherefore, substituting into Kepler\'s law:\n\nm1 + m2 = (4π²/G) * [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]^3 / P²\n\n= (4π²/G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 π³) / P²\n\n= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)\n\n= (4 / (8 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P\n\n= (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P\n\nTherefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So when comparing two systems, the ratio is [(K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1] / [(K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2]\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, unless there\'s a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1/M2=0.432, then the answer would be 0.432. But that would mean system_1 is less massive. Alternatively, maybe the question is inverting the ratio? Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, sum 15, period 2. System_2 has velocities 15 and 10, sum 25, period 1. So (15)^3 *2 vs (25)^3 *1. So 3375*2=6750 vs 15625*1=15625. 6750/15625=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, if the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive, but according to this, it\'s less massive. So maybe the problem is misstated? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.\n\nWait, the problem says "sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s" for system_1. So each star has those amplitudes. So the semi-amplitudes K1 and K2. Then in the formula, we use K1 + K2. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the velocities are not the actual orbital velocities, but something else. Wait, radial velocity semi-amplitude is the velocity of the star towards or away from us, so it\'s related to the orbital speed. If the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), then the radial velocity amplitude is equal to the orbital speed. If it\'s inclined, then it\'s K = v sin i. However, the problem doesn\'t mention inclination. But since they are eclipsing systems, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes are approximately equal to the actual orbital velocities. So that\'s probably accounted for.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. But the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is supposed to be a factor greater than 1, then perhaps there\'s a mistake in the problem or in my calculation. Alternatively, maybe the period is not the orbital period but something else. Wait, the problem says "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses" which should be the orbital period. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the mass function. Wait, the mass function is used when you don\'t know the inclination, but since it\'s an eclipsing binary, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Then the mass function gives the actual mass. Let me recall the mass function formula:\n\nf(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i)/( (m1 + m2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G)\n\nBut since sin i =1, then:\n\nm2^3 / (m1 + m2)^2 = (K1^3 P )/(2π G)\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Wait, but if we have both K1 and K2, then we can get the mass ratio, and then compute the total mass.\n\nAlternatively, since we have K1 and K2, the mass ratio q = m1/m2 = K2/K1.\n\nSo for system_1:\n\nq1 = m1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Then total mass M1= m1 + m2=1.5 m2.\n\nBut we need to find M1 in terms of observable quantities. Wait, using Kepler\'s third law:\n\nM1 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2π G)\n\nBut again, unless we can relate the two systems by the same G, which cancels in the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the total mass:\n\nM = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2943.3)\n\nWhere M is in solar masses, K1 and K2 in km/s, P in years. Let me check this formula.\n\nYes, there\'s a version of Kepler\'s third law for binaries where:\n\nM1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2943.3)\n\nWith M in solar masses, K in km/s, P in years.\n\nIf that\'s the case, then the ratio would be:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]\n\nWhich is exactly the same as before. So 6750 / 15625 = 0.432. Therefore, the same result.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. That\'s contradictory. Therefore, either the answer is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.3148, meaning system_2 is more massive by that factor, but the question is phrased the other way. Wait, maybe the problem statement mixed up the systems? Let me check again.\n\nWait, system_1: period 2 years, velocities 10 and 5. System_2: period 1 year, velocities 15 and 10. So according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. But the problem says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So either the answer is the reciprocal, or there\'s a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let\'s think in terms of units. If you have higher velocities, that suggests that the stars are moving faster, which could mean they are closer together or more massive. Since the period is shorter for system_2, which also affects the mass. The formula combines both the velocities and the period. So even though system_2 has a shorter period, which would imply closer orbit and possibly lower mass, but it has higher velocities, which could imply higher mass. So the combination might still result in system_2 being more massive.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s take a simple example. Suppose two systems with same velocities but different periods. The one with longer period would have larger orbit, hence more massive. Similarly, if two systems have same period, the one with higher velocities would be more massive. In our case, system_2 has higher velocities (sum 25 vs 15) but shorter period (1 vs 2). The question is which effect dominates. The formula (K1 + K2)^3 * P, so 15^3 *2 vs 25^3 *1. 15^3 is 3375, times 2 is 6750. 25^3 is 15625. So 6750 vs 15625. So the higher velocities cubed times the shorter period (but only 1 vs 2) leads to system_2 being more massive.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. But the question is asking the opposite. Hmm. Unless the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps I misread the question.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\n"Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s.

Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."\n\nSo the periods are 2 years for system_1, 1 year for system_2. RV amplitudes 10 and 5 for system_1, 15 and 10 for system_2. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. So either the answer is 0.432, which is less than 1, implying system_1 is less massive, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the formula is supposed to be (K1 + K2)^3 / P^2, but no, Kepler\'s law is (a^3)/(P^2) ~ M. And a is proportional to (K1 + K2)*P. So substituting a gives M ~ (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula M1/M2 = ( (K1_sys1 + K2_sys1) / (K1_sys2 + K2_sys2) )^3 * (P_sys1 / P_sys2). But that\'s exactly what we did. So (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = (0.6)^3 *2 = 0.216 *2=0.432. So same result.\n\nTherefore, unless there\'s a different interpretation of the RV amplitudes. Wait, maybe the problem is giving the semi-amplitudes of each star\'s velocity, so for system_1, the two stars have K1=10 and K2=5. Then the mass ratio q = m1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Therefore, total mass M1= m1 + m2=1.5 m2. Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10. Mass ratio q=10/15=2/3. So m1= (2/3) m2. So total mass M2= m1 +m2= (5/3)m2.\n\nBut how do we relate M1 and M2? We need another equation. Using Kepler\'s law. For system_1:\n\nM1 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2943.3) )\n\nBut in solar masses. But since we are taking the ratio, the constant cancels. So:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15)^3 *2 ] / [ (25)^3 *1 ] = 3375*2 / 15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432.\n\nSame result. So the answer is 0.432. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. So unless the answer is presented as 1/0.432 ≈2.315, but that would be the factor by which system_2 is more massive than system_1.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, swapping system_1 and system_2.

Therefore, unless there\'s a different approach, the answer is 0.432. But the question says "more massive", so maybe the answer is supposed to be the reciprocal. But strictly speaking, the calculation shows M1/M2=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the answer should be 0.432. However, since the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", which is not the case here. It\'s actually less massive. Therefore, possibly a trick question? Or maybe I missed a step.\n\nWait, another thought: when they say "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses" is the period. For eclipsing binaries, the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period. So that\'s correct. So the period used is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the RV amplitudes are not K1 and K2, but something else. Wait, radial velocity amplitude is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve. So for each star, you get a sine wave with semi-amplitude K1 and K2. Then, the ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of the velocities. So m1/m2 = K2/K1. Then, the total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + (K1/K2) m1 = m1 (1 + K1/K2 ). But how does this relate to the period?\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n(m1 + m2) sin³ i = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2π G)\n\nBut since it\'s eclipsing, i ≈90°, so sin i ≈1. Therefore:\n\nm1 + m2 = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2π G)\n\nAgain, same as before. So the ratio is (15³ *2)/(25³ *1)=0.432.\n\nTherefore, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.432. But the question is phrased as "more massive", which is confusing. Unless there\'s a misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is in the original parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the periods given are not the orbital periods but the eclipse periods, which could be different? But no, in an eclipsing binary, the time between primary eclipses is the orbital period. Unless the orbit is eccentric and there\'s apsidal motion, but that\'s advanced and not mentioned here. So we can assume the period is the orbital period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the individual masses. For system_1:\n\nm1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1=1.5 m2.\n\nFor system_2:\n\nm1/m2=10/15=2/3. So m1= (2/3)m2. Total mass M2= (5/3)m2.\n\nBut without knowing the actual values of m2 for each system, we can\'t compare M1 and M2. However, using Kepler\'s law, which relates the total mass to the period and velocities. So the previous approach is necessary.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 0.432, even though the wording is confusing. Perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, but based on the given parameters, system_1 is less massive by that factor. However, since the problem explicitly asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", and according to the calculation it\'s 0.432, which is less than 1, we have to state that factor. Maybe in the answer, they expect the reciprocal because of a different formula, but according to standard Keplerian equations, it\'s 0.432.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the cube. Let me recompute the ratio:\n\nNumerator: (10 +5)^3 *2 =15³ *2=3375*2=6750\n\nDenominator: (15 +10)^3 *1=25³=15625\n\n6750 divided by 15625.

So yes, same result.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{54}{125}} or 0.432. But the question says "more massive", which contradicts the result. Unless there\'s a miscalculation. But I think the calculation is correct. Maybe the answer is 54/125, and it\'s acceptable even though it\'s less than 1.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods of the binary star systems. 

For a binary star system, the total mass can be calculated using the formula derived from Kepler's third law:
\[
M = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2\pi G}
\]
where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since we are comparing the two systems, the constants cancel out, and we only need the ratio of the masses.

For system_1:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)

For system_2:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)

The ratio of the total masses of the systems is given by:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)_1^3 \cdot P_1}{(K_1 + K_2)_2^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = \frac{54}{125}
\]

Thus, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

have a common factor. 270 is 2×3^3×5, 625 is 5^4. So the common factor is 5. Therefore, 270/625 = 54/125. But 54 and 125 have no common factors. So 54/125 is 0.432. So the ratio is 0.432, which is 54/125. So M1/M2 = 54/125 ≈ 0.432. Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But 0.432 is less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive. But that contradicts the initial thought? Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, system_1 has a longer period (2 years) compared to system_2 (1 year). Also, the velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 and 5, so sum 15, while system_2 has 15 and 10, sum 25. So (15)^3 * 2 vs (25)^3 *1. Hmm, 15^3 is 3375 *2=6750, 25^3=15625. So 6750/15625=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" But according to this, it's less massive. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the ratio. The question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the ratio M1/M2 = 0.432, then system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning it's less massive. But maybe the problem is expecting the reciprocal? Let me check my steps again.

First, the formula: M1/M2 = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P ]_1 / [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P ]_2

Plugging in:

System_1: (10 +5)^3 *2 = 15^3 *2 = 3375*2=6750

System_2: (15 +10)^3 *1 =25^3 *1=15625

So 6750/15625=0.432. So M1=0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2, so system_2 is more massive. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So either the answer is 0.432, meaning it's actually less massive, or I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let's rederive it.

Starting from Kepler's third law: (m1 + m2) = (4π²/G) * (a)^3 / P²

But a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, which is a = a1 + a2. Each a1 and a2 can be expressed as (K1 * P)/(2π) and (K2 * P)/(2π) respectively. So a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π)

Therefore, substituting into Kepler's law:

m1 + m2 = (4π²/G) * [ (K1 + K2) * P / (2π) ]^3 / P²

= (4π²/G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 π³) / P²

= (4π² / G) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (8 π³)

= (4 / (8 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So when comparing two systems, the ratio is [(K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1] / [(K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2]

Which is exactly what I did before. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if M1/M2=0.432, then the answer would be 0.432. But that would mean system_1 is less massive. Alternatively, maybe the question is inverting the ratio? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, sum 15, period 2. System_2 has velocities 15 and 10, sum 25, period 1. So (15)^3 *2 vs (25)^3 *1. So 3375*2=6750 vs 15625*1=15625. 6750/15625=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, if the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive, but according to this, it's less massive. So maybe the problem is misstated? Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, the problem says "sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s" for system_1. So each star has those amplitudes. So the semi-amplitudes K1 and K2. Then in the formula, we use K1 + K2. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the velocities are not the actual orbital velocities, but something else. Wait, radial velocity semi-amplitude is the velocity of the star towards or away from us, so it's related to the orbital speed. If the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), then the radial velocity amplitude is equal to the orbital speed. If it's inclined, then it's K = v sin i. However, the problem doesn't mention inclination. But since they are eclipsing systems, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes are approximately equal to the actual orbital velocities. So that's probably accounted for.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. But the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is supposed to be a factor greater than 1, then perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my calculation. Alternatively, maybe the period is not the orbital period but something else. Wait, the problem says "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses" which should be the orbital period. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the mass function. Wait, the mass function is used when you don't know the inclination, but since it's an eclipsing binary, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Then the mass function gives the actual mass. Let me recall the mass function formula:

f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i)/( (m1 + m2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G)

But since sin i =1, then:

m2^3 / (m1 + m2)^2 = (K1^3 P )/(2π G)

But this seems more complicated. Wait, but if we have both K1 and K2, then we can get the mass ratio, and then compute the total mass.

Alternatively, since we have K1 and K2, the mass ratio q = m1/m2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1:

q1 = m1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Then total mass M1= m1 + m2=1.5 m2.

But we need to find M1 in terms of observable quantities. Wait, using Kepler's third law:

M1 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2π G)

But again, unless we can relate the two systems by the same G, which cancels in the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the total mass:

M = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2943.3)

Where M is in solar masses, K1 and K2 in km/s, P in years. Let me check this formula.

Yes, there's a version of Kepler's third law for binaries where:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2943.3)

With M in solar masses, K in km/s, P in years.

If that's the case, then the ratio would be:

M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Which is exactly the same as before. So 6750 / 15625 = 0.432. Therefore, the same result.

Therefore, the conclusion is that system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. That's contradictory. Therefore, either the answer is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.3148, meaning system_2 is more massive by that factor, but the question is phrased the other way. Wait, maybe the problem statement mixed up the systems? Let me check again.

Wait, system_1: period 2 years, velocities 10 and 5. System_2: period 1 year, velocities 15 and 10. So according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. But the problem says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So either the answer is the reciprocal, or there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, let's think in terms of units. If you have higher velocities, that suggests that the stars are moving faster, which could mean they are closer together or more massive. Since the period is shorter for system_2, which also affects the mass. The formula combines both the velocities and the period. So even though system_2 has a shorter period, which would imply closer orbit and possibly lower mass, but it has higher velocities, which could imply higher mass. So the combination might still result in system_2 being more massive.

Alternatively, let's take a simple example. Suppose two systems with same velocities but different periods. The one with longer period would have larger orbit, hence more massive. Similarly, if two systems have same period, the one with higher velocities would be more massive. In our case, system_2 has higher velocities (sum 25 vs 15) but shorter period (1 vs 2). The question is which effect dominates. The formula (K1 + K2)^3 * P, so 15^3 *2 vs 25^3 *1. 15^3 is 3375, times 2 is 6750. 25^3 is 15625. So 6750 vs 15625. So the higher velocities cubed times the shorter period (but only 1 vs 2) leads to system_2 being more massive.

Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. But the question is asking the opposite. Hmm. Unless the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, let me check the original problem again:

"Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

So the periods are 2 years for system_1, 1 year for system_2. RV amplitudes 10 and 5 for system_1, 15 and 10 for system_2. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. So either the answer is 0.432, which is less than 1, implying system_1 is less massive, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the formula is supposed to be (K1 + K2)^3 / P^2, but no, Kepler's law is (a^3)/(P^2) ~ M. And a is proportional to (K1 + K2)*P. So substituting a gives M ~ (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula M1/M2 = ( (K1_sys1 + K2_sys1) / (K1_sys2 + K2_sys2) )^3 * (P_sys1 / P_sys2). But that's exactly what we did. So (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = (0.6)^3 *2 = 0.216 *2=0.432. So same result.

Therefore, unless there's a different interpretation of the RV amplitudes. Wait, maybe the problem is giving the semi-amplitudes of each star's velocity, so for system_1, the two stars have K1=10 and K2=5. Then the mass ratio q = m1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Therefore, total mass M1= m1 + m2=1.5 m2. Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10. Mass ratio q=10/15=2/3. So m1= (2/3) m2. So total mass M2= m1 +m2= (5/3)m2.

But how do we relate M1 and M2? We need another equation. Using Kepler's law. For system_1:

M1 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2943.3) )

But in solar masses. But since we are taking the ratio, the constant cancels. So:

M1/M2 = [ (15)^3 *2 ] / [ (25)^3 *1 ] = 3375*2 / 15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

Same result. So the answer is 0.432. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. So unless the answer is presented as 1/0.432 ≈2.315, but that would be the factor by which system_2 is more massive than system_1.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, swapping system_1 and system_2. Or maybe I misread which system has which parameters. Let me check again:

system_1: period 2 years, RV amplitudes 10 and 5.

system_2: period 1 year, RV amplitudes 15 and 10.

Yes, as per the problem statement. Therefore, unless there's a different approach, the answer is 0.432. But the question says "more massive", so maybe the answer is supposed to be the reciprocal. But strictly speaking, the calculation shows M1/M2=0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the answer should be 0.432. However, since the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", which is not the case here. It's actually less massive. Therefore, possibly a trick question? Or maybe I missed a step.

Wait, another thought: when they say "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses" is the period. For eclipsing binaries, the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period. So that's correct. So the period used is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the RV amplitudes are not K1 and K2, but something else. Wait, radial velocity amplitude is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve. So for each star, you get a sine wave with semi-amplitude K1 and K2. Then, the ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of the velocities. So m1/m2 = K2/K1. Then, the total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + (K1/K2) m1 = m1 (1 + K1/K2 ). But how does this relate to the period?

Alternatively, using the formula:

(m1 + m2) sin³ i = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2π G)

But since it's eclipsing, i ≈90°, so sin i ≈1. Therefore:

m1 + m2 = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2π G)

Again, same as before. So the ratio is (15³ *2)/(25³ *1)=0.432.

Therefore, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.432. But the question is phrased as "more massive", which is confusing. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is in the original parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the periods given are not the orbital periods but the eclipse periods, which could be different? But no, in an eclipsing binary, the time between primary eclipses is the orbital period. Unless the orbit is eccentric and there's apsidal motion, but that's advanced and not mentioned here. So we can assume the period is the orbital period.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the individual masses. For system_1:

m1/m2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1=1.5 m2.

For system_2:

m1/m2=10/15=2/3. So m1= (2/3)m2. Total mass M2= (5/3)m2.

But without knowing the actual values of m2 for each system, we can't compare M1 and M2. However, using Kepler's law, which relates the total mass to the period and velocities. So the previous approach is necessary.

Therefore, I think the answer is 0.432, even though the wording is confusing. Perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, but based on the given parameters, system_1 is less massive by that factor. However, since the problem explicitly asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", and according to the calculation it's 0.432, which is less than 1, we have to state that factor. Maybe in the answer, they expect the reciprocal because of a different formula, but according to standard Keplerian equations, it's 0.432.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the cube. Let me recompute the ratio:

Numerator: (10 +5)^3 *2 =15³ *2=3375*2=6750

Denominator: (15 +10)^3 *1=25³=15625

6750 divided by 15625. Let's compute 6750/15625:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270/625

Divide by 5: 54/125

54 divided by 125=0.432. So yes, same result.

So the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}} or 0.432. But the question says "more massive", which contradicts the result. Unless there's a miscalculation. But I think the calculation is correct. Maybe the answer is 54/125, and it's acceptable even though it's less than 1. So the factor is 54/125.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}

The correct formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) in solar masses is given by (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(m1 + m2))/(4π²), but when using radial velocities, the formula is (m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = (P/(2πG)) * (v1 + v2)^3, where i is the inclination. If we assume edge-on orbits (i=90°), sin(i)=1, so total mass is (P/(2πG))*(v1 + v2)^3.

However, the question asks by what factor system_1 is MORE massive, which contradicts the result. This suggests a possible misunderstanding in the problem setup or miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the velocities. Let me check again. For system_1: velocities are 10 and 5, so sum is 15. System_2: velocities are 15 and 10, sum is 25. Periods are 2 and 1. The formula gives M proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P. So M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432. Therefore, M1 is 0.432 times M2, meaning system_1 is less massive. The question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I made an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the mass ratio of the two stars in each system can be found using the velocity ratio. For system_1, m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m2 = 2m1. Then m1 + m2 = 3m1. Similarly, for system_2, m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3, so m1 = (2/3)m2, total mass (5/3)m2.\n\nBut how to find the actual masses? Using Kepler\'s law. The formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) in terms of velocity amplitudes and period is:\n\nm1 + m2 = (P/ (2πG)) * (v1 + v2)^3\n\nBut since G and constants are the same when taking the ratio between the two systems, the ratio of the masses would be (P1 * (v1 + v2)^3) / (P2 * (v1\' + v2\')^3). Which is the same as before. So M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is less massive. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" This inconsistency implies either a mistake in calculation or a trick in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the periods given are the orbital periods, which in eclipsing binaries are the same as the orbital period. So both systems have their respective periods. Then the formula for the total mass is ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2πG), so when taking the ratio, the gravitational constant cancels. So the ratio is ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 ) = 3375*2 / 15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432. So system_1\'s total mass is 0.432 times that of system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This is confusing. Unless the problem intended to switch the systems, but as per the given data, system_1 has a longer period and lower velocity sum. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let\'s recall Kepler\'s third law in terms of the binary system. The formula is:\n\n(m1 + m2) = (4π²/G³) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²\n\nBut the velocities are related to the semi-major axes by v = 2πa/P. Therefore, a = vP/(2π). So a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2π). Substituting into Kepler\'s law:\n\nm1 + m2 = (4π²/G) * ( (v1 + v2) P/(2π) )³ / P² )\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= (4π²/G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³) ) / P² )\n\n= (4π² / G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π³ P² )\n\n= (4π² / G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P / (8 π³ )\n\n= (4 / (8 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P\n\n= (1 / (2 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P\n\nTherefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P. Therefore, when comparing two systems:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (v1 + v2)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1\' + v2\')^3 * P2 ]\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This suggests either a problem in the question or a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I confused the velocity amplitudes. Let me check again. The problem states:\n\nIn system_1: radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n\nIn system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n\nSo for system_1, velocities are 10 and 5, sum to 15.\n\nFor system_2, 15 and 10, sum to 25.\n\nP1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year.\n\nTherefore, M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432. So M1 = 0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the answer is 0.432, but the question says "more massive", maybe there\'s a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps I have an error in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the velocity amplitudes are not summed but used in another way. Let\'s think again: The velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the mass ratio. The ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of the velocities: m1/m2 = K2/K1.\n\nBut the total mass is m1 + m2. So, for system_1:\n\nm1/m2 = 5/10 = 1/2 => m2 = 2m1 => total mass = 3m1.\n\nSimilarly, system_2:\n\nm1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3 => m1 = (2/3)m2 => total mass = (5/3)m2.\n\nBut without knowing the actual values of m1 and m2, how can we compare the total masses? Unless we use Kepler\'s law. The total mass relates to the orbital period and the size of the orbit. But to find the absolute masses, we need the semi-major axis or the actual velocities combined with the period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the mass function. But since the inclination is not given, assuming edge-on orbits (sin i = 1). The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:\n\nf(m) = (m2³ sin³ i)/( (m1 + m2)² ) = (P/(2πG)) K1³ (1 - e²)^(3/2)\n\nAssuming circular orbits (e=0), so:\n\nf(m) = (P/(2πG)) K1³\n\nBut the mass function is not the total mass. However, if we have both K1 and K2, we can find the mass ratio and the total mass.\n\nAlternatively, combining K1 and K2. Since K1/K2 = m2/m1, so m1 = m2 * K2/K1.\n\nThen total mass M = m1 + m2 = m2 (1 + K2/K1) = m2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 )\n\nSimilarly, m2 = (M K1)/(K1 + K2 )\n\nFrom Kepler\'s third law:\n\nM = (4π² a³)/(G P²)\n\nBut the semi-major axis a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P)/(2π) + (K2 P)/(2π) = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)\n\nTherefore, a = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)\n\nPlugging into M:\n\nM = (4π² [ (K1 + K2) P/(2π) ]³ ) / (G P² )\n\n= (4π² (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³ G P² )\n\n= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P )/( 2 π G )\n\nThus, M is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 P. Therefore, the ratio M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 P2 ]\n\nWhich again gives the same result as before: (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive.\n\nBut the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" This suggests the answer should be greater than 1, but according to the calculation, it\'s less than 1. There\'s a contradiction here. Perhaps the original problem intended to state that the periods are the orbital periods, but the eclipse periods might be different? Wait, the problem says "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses." In an eclipsing binary, the time between primary eclipses is equal to the orbital period, assuming a circular orbit. So the periods given are indeed the orbital periods. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.\n\nGiven that, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, but the question asks how much more massive system_1 is. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes. Let me check again.\n\nWait, radial velocity amplitudes: in a binary system, each star\'s velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A has velocity 10 km/s and star B 5 km/s, then mass ratio m_A/m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_B = 2 m_A. Total mass is 3 m_A. Similarly, for system_2, velocities 15 and 10, so m_C/m_D = 10/15 = 2/3. So m_C = (2/3)m_D, total mass (5/3)m_D.\n\nBut to find the actual masses, we need to use Kepler\'s law. The total mass (M) relates to the period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler\'s third law: M = (4 π² a³)/(G P²). The semi-major axis a is the sum of the individual semi-major axes of the two stars\' orbits around the center of mass. Each star\'s semi-major axis is a_i = (v_i P)/(2 π). So a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).\n\nSubstituting into Kepler\'s law:\n\nM = (4 π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ]³ ) / (G P² )\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= (4 π² (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³ G P² )\n\n= ( (v1 + v2)^3 P )/( 2 π G )\n\nTherefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 P. Therefore, the ratio of the total masses:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 P2 ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFor system_1: v1 + v2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years.\n\nFor system_2: v1 + v2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, P2 = 1 year.\n\nSo M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive. The question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which implies the answer should be a factor greater than 1, but according to the calculation, it\'s less than 1. This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a misunderstanding in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. Let\'s consider the individual masses. For system_1, m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so m2 = 2 m1. Total mass M1 = 3 m1. For system_2, m3/m4 = 10/15 = 2/3, so m4 = 1.5 m3. Total mass M2 = 2.5 m3.\n\nTo relate m1 and m3, we need to use Kepler\'s law. For system_1, M1 = 3 m1 = (15^3 * 2)/(2 π G). For system_2, M2 = 2.5 m3 = (25^3 *1)/(2 π G). Taking the ratio:\n\nM1/M2 = (15³ * 2)/(25³ *1) = 0.432, same as before. So even when breaking down into individual masses, the ratio remains the same. Hence, system_1 is indeed less massive.\n\nGiven that, the answer contradicts the question\'s phrasing. However, since the calculation is consistent, perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, or there\'s a typo in the given velocity amplitudes or periods. But assuming the data is correct, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of approximately 0.432. But the problem states "more massive", so maybe the intended answer is the reciprocal, 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, but that would be incorrect based on the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass ratio instead of the total mass. Wait, the velocity amplitudes relate to the mass ratio, but the total mass requires the period and velocities. The calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning it\'s less massive. However, since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, there\'s a contradiction. Unless there\'s a different interpretation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the period is the orbital period, but in eclipsing binaries, the period between eclipses can sometimes be half the orbital period if the orbit is eccentric and eclipses happen twice per orbit. But the problem specifies "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses," which in a circular orbit is equal to the orbital period. If the orbit is eccentric, the period between primary eclipses can differ, but the problem doesn\'t mention eccentricity, so we assume circular orbits. Thus, the periods are the orbital periods.\n\nGiven all this, I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, but the question\'s wording is flawed. However, since the user might expect the answer as per the calculation, even if it contradicts the question\'s phrasing, I should present the correct factor, which is approximately 0.432, but since it\'s asking by what factor system_1 is more massive, which is impossible given the result, perhaps there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation once more:\n\n15^3 = 3375\n\n25^3 = 15625\n\n3375 * 2 = 6750\n\n6750 / 15625 = 6750 ÷ 15625\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625 = 54 / 125 = 0.432. Correct.\n\nYes, so the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the user insists on answering despite the contradiction, the answer is approximately 0.432, but it\'s essential to note that system_1 is actually less massive. However, since the problem might have intended different parameters, but given the data, this is the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the units. The formula M1/M2 = [(v1 + v2)^3 * P1] / [(v1\' + v2\')^3 * P2] is unitless if the velocities and periods are in consistent units, but since we are taking the ratio, the actual units cancel out. Therefore, the ratio is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the question\'s phrasing, the calculation shows system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432. But since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, which is impossible given the data, perhaps there\'s an error. However, strictly following the calculation, the answer is 0.432, but since it\'s less, the correct statement would be system_1 is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315 times less massive. But the question asks the opposite. This is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended to use the cube of the velocity amplitudes ratio times the period ratio, which would be ((10+5)/(15+10))^3 * (2/1) = (15/25)^3 *2 = (0.6)^3 *2 = 0.216 *2 = 0.432, same result. Therefore, the answer is 0.432, system_1 is less massive. Given that, perhaps the question has a mistake, but the answer should be 0.432, and the user might need to present it boxed.\n\nAlternatively, if the question indeed meant "less massive", the answer is \\boxed{0.43} or similar, but given the instructions, I have to provide the answer as per the calculation, noting the discrepancy.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390430, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4896, prompt_tokens=752, total_tokens=5648, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The total mass of a binary star system is proportional to \((v_1 + v_2)^3 \times P\), where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes and \(P\) is the orbital period.

For system_1:
- Velocities: 10 km/s and 5 km/s, sum = 15 km/s
- Period: 2 years

For system_2:
- Velocities: 15 km/s and 10 km/s, sum = 25 km/s
- Period: 1 year

The ratio of the total masses is calculated as:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \times 2}{(25)^3 \times 1} = \frac{3375 \times 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

This result indicates that system_1 is actually less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.432. However, the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. Given the calculation, there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement. The correct factor based on the calculation is:

\boxed{0.432}

Note: This factor shows that system_1 is less massive than system_2. If the question intended to ask the opposite, the reciprocal (approximately 2.315) would be the answer, but the calculation does not support that.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, so taking the reciprocal: 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315. Wait, but according to the calculation, M₁/M₂ is 0.432, so system_1 is less massive. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If M₁/M₂ is 0.432, then system_1 is actually less massive. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me check again. The mass of each system is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So M₁ = (10 + 5)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750. M₂ = (15 + 10)^3 * 1 = 15625. Then M₁/M₂ = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432. So system_1 is actually less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This suggests a possible error in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the formula should use the sum of masses in terms of Kepler's law. Let's re-examine Kepler's third law. The correct formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) in solar masses is given by (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(m1 + m2))/(4π²), but when using radial velocities, the formula is (m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = (P/(2πG)) * (v1 + v2)^3, where i is the inclination. If we assume edge-on orbits (i=90°), sin(i)=1, so total mass is (P/(2πG))*(v1 + v2)^3. Since the gravitational constant G and factors of 2π are the same for both systems, the ratio of total masses would be (P1*(v1 + v2)^3)/(P2*(v1' + v2')^3).

Substituting the values for system_1 (P=2 years, velocities 10 and 5) and system_2 (P=1 year, velocities 15 and 10):

M₁/M₂ = [2*(15)^3]/[1*(25)^3] = 2*(3375)/15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432. This confirms the earlier result. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. However, the question asks by what factor system_1 is MORE massive, which contradicts the result. This suggests a possible misunderstanding in the problem setup or miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the velocities. Let me check again. For system_1: velocities are 10 and 5, so sum is 15. System_2: velocities are 15 and 10, sum is 25. Periods are 2 and 1. The formula gives M proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P. So M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432. Therefore, M1 is 0.432 times M2, meaning system_1 is less massive. The question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I made an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the mass ratio of the two stars in each system can be found using the velocity ratio. For system_1, m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m2 = 2m1. Then m1 + m2 = 3m1. Similarly, for system_2, m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3, so m1 = (2/3)m2, total mass (5/3)m2.

But how to find the actual masses? Using Kepler's law. The formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) in terms of velocity amplitudes and period is:

m1 + m2 = (P/ (2πG)) * (v1 + v2)^3

But since G and constants are the same when taking the ratio between the two systems, the ratio of the masses would be (P1 * (v1 + v2)^3) / (P2 * (v1' + v2')^3). Which is the same as before. So M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is less massive. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" This inconsistency implies either a mistake in calculation or a trick in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the periods given are the orbital periods, which in eclipsing binaries are the same as the orbital period. So both systems have their respective periods. Then the formula for the total mass is ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2πG), so when taking the ratio, the gravitational constant cancels. So the ratio is ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 ) = 3375*2 / 15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432. So system_1's total mass is 0.432 times that of system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This is confusing. Unless the problem intended to switch the systems, but as per the given data, system_1 has a longer period and lower velocity sum. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let's recall Kepler's third law in terms of the binary system. The formula is:

(m1 + m2) = (4π²/G³) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But the velocities are related to the semi-major axes by v = 2πa/P. Therefore, a = vP/(2π). So a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2π). Substituting into Kepler's law:

m1 + m2 = (4π²/G) * ( (v1 + v2) P/(2π) )³ / P² )

Simplifying:

= (4π²/G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³) ) / P² )

= (4π² / G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π³ P² )

= (4π² / G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P / (8 π³ )

= (4 / (8 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P. Therefore, when comparing two systems:

M1/M2 = [ (v1 + v2)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1' + v2')^3 * P2 ]

Which is exactly what I did before. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This suggests either a problem in the question or a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the velocity amplitudes. Let me check again. The problem states:

In system_1: radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s.

In system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

So for system_1, velocities are 10 and 5, sum to 15.

For system_2, 15 and 10, sum to 25.

P1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year.

Therefore, M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/15625 = 6750/15625 = 0.432. So M1 = 0.432 M2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the answer is 0.432, but the question says "more massive", maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps I have an error in the derivation.

Alternatively, maybe the velocity amplitudes are not summed but used in another way. Let's think again: The velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the mass ratio. The ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of the velocities: m1/m2 = K2/K1.

But the total mass is m1 + m2. So, for system_1:

m1/m2 = 5/10 = 1/2 => m2 = 2m1 => total mass = 3m1.

Similarly, system_2:

m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3 => m1 = (2/3)m2 => total mass = (5/3)m2.

But without knowing the actual values of m1 and m2, how can we compare the total masses? Unless we use Kepler's law. The total mass relates to the orbital period and the size of the orbit. But to find the absolute masses, we need the semi-major axis or the actual velocities combined with the period.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the mass function. But since the inclination is not given, assuming edge-on orbits (sin i = 1). The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:

f(m) = (m2³ sin³ i)/( (m1 + m2)² ) = (P/(2πG)) K1³ (1 - e²)^(3/2)

Assuming circular orbits (e=0), so:

f(m) = (P/(2πG)) K1³

But the mass function is not the total mass. However, if we have both K1 and K2, we can find the mass ratio and the total mass.

Alternatively, combining K1 and K2. Since K1/K2 = m2/m1, so m1 = m2 * K2/K1.

Then total mass M = m1 + m2 = m2 (1 + K2/K1) = m2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 )

Similarly, m2 = (M K1)/(K1 + K2 )

From Kepler's third law:

M = (4π² a³)/(G P²)

But the semi-major axis a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P)/(2π) + (K2 P)/(2π) = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)

Therefore, a = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)

Plugging into M:

M = (4π² [ (K1 + K2) P/(2π) ]³ ) / (G P² )

= (4π² (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³ G P² )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P )/( 2 π G )

Thus, M is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 P. Therefore, the ratio M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Which again gives the same result as before: (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive.

But the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" This suggests the answer should be greater than 1, but according to the calculation, it's less than 1. There's a contradiction here. Perhaps the original problem intended to state that the periods are the orbital periods, but the eclipse periods might be different? Wait, the problem says "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses." In an eclipsing binary, the time between primary eclipses is equal to the orbital period, assuming a circular orbit. So the periods given are indeed the orbital periods. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.

Given that, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, but the question asks how much more massive system_1 is. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes. Let me check again.

Wait, radial velocity amplitudes: in a binary system, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A has velocity 10 km/s and star B 5 km/s, then mass ratio m_A/m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_B = 2 m_A. Total mass is 3 m_A. Similarly, for system_2, velocities 15 and 10, so m_C/m_D = 10/15 = 2/3. So m_C = (2/3)m_D, total mass (5/3)m_D.

But to find the actual masses, we need to use Kepler's law. The total mass (M) relates to the period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's third law: M = (4 π² a³)/(G P²). The semi-major axis a is the sum of the individual semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass. Each star's semi-major axis is a_i = (v_i P)/(2 π). So a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).

Substituting into Kepler's law:

M = (4 π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ]³ ) / (G P² )

Simplifying:

= (4 π² (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π³ G P² )

= ( (v1 + v2)^3 P )/( 2 π G )

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 P. Therefore, the ratio of the total masses:

M1/M2 = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 P2 ]

Plugging in the numbers:

For system_1: v1 + v2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years.

For system_2: v1 + v2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, P2 = 1 year.

So M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432.

Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive. The question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which implies the answer should be a factor greater than 1, but according to the calculation, it's less than 1. This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a misunderstanding in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the individual masses. For system_1, m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so m2 = 2 m1. Total mass M1 = 3 m1. For system_2, m3/m4 = 10/15 = 2/3, so m4 = 1.5 m3. Total mass M2 = 2.5 m3.

To relate m1 and m3, we need to use Kepler's law. For system_1, M1 = 3 m1 = (15^3 * 2)/(2 π G). For system_2, M2 = 2.5 m3 = (25^3 *1)/(2 π G). Taking the ratio:

M1/M2 = (15³ * 2)/(25³ *1) = 0.432, same as before. So even when breaking down into individual masses, the ratio remains the same. Hence, system_1 is indeed less massive.

Given that, the answer contradicts the question's phrasing. However, since the calculation is consistent, perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, or there's a typo in the given velocity amplitudes or periods. But assuming the data is correct, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of approximately 0.432. But the problem states "more massive", so maybe the intended answer is the reciprocal, 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, but that would be incorrect based on the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass ratio instead of the total mass. Wait, the velocity amplitudes relate to the mass ratio, but the total mass requires the period and velocities. The calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning it's less massive. However, since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, there's a contradiction. Unless there's a different interpretation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the period is the orbital period, but in eclipsing binaries, the period between eclipses can sometimes be half the orbital period if the orbit is eccentric and eclipses happen twice per orbit. But the problem specifies "the time between two consecutive primary eclipses," which in a circular orbit is equal to the orbital period. If the orbit is eccentric, the period between primary eclipses can differ, but the problem doesn't mention eccentricity, so we assume circular orbits. Thus, the periods are the orbital periods.

Given all this, I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432, but the question's wording is flawed. However, since the user might expect the answer as per the calculation, even if it contradicts the question's phrasing, I should present the correct factor, which is approximately 0.432, but since it's asking by what factor system_1 is more massive, which is impossible given the result, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me verify the calculation once more:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 = 15625

3375 * 2 = 6750

6750 / 15625 = 6750 ÷ 15625

Dividing numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625 = 54 / 125 = 0.432. Correct.

Yes, so the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the user insists on answering despite the contradiction, the answer is approximately 0.432, but it's essential to note that system_1 is actually less massive. However, since the problem might have intended different parameters, but given the data, this is the result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the units. The formula M1/M2 = [(v1 + v2)^3 * P1] / [(v1' + v2')^3 * P2] is unitless if the velocities and periods are in consistent units, but since we are taking the ratio, the actual units cancel out. Therefore, the ratio is correct.

In conclusion, despite the question's phrasing, the calculation shows system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.432. But since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, which is impossible given the data, perhaps there's an error. However, strictly following the calculation, the answer is 0.432, but since it's less, the correct statement would be system_1 is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315 times less massive. But the question asks the opposite. This is perplexing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to use the cube of the velocity amplitudes ratio times the period ratio, which would be ((10+5)/(15+10))^3 * (2/1) = (15/25)^3 *2 = (0.6)^3 *2 = 0.216 *2 = 0.432, same result. Therefore, the answer is 0.432, system_1 is less massive. Given that, perhaps the question has a mistake, but the answer should be 0.432, and the user might need to present it boxed.

Alternatively, if the question indeed meant "less massive", the answer is \boxed{0.43} or similar, but given the instructions, I have to provide the answer as per the calculation, noting the discrepancy.

So, common factor 5. 270/625 = 54/125 = 0.432. So M1 is 0.432 times M2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If M1/M2 = ~0.432, then system_1 is less massive. But that contradicts the initial thought. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, they are asking "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive.

Let\'s divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 /25=270, 15625 /25=625. So, 270/625= (270 ÷5)/(625 ÷5)=54/125=0.432. So M1 is 0.432 times M2, so system_1 is less massive. But the question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is less than 1, then the factor is 0.432, meaning system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_2 is more massive by a factor of 1/0.432 ≈2.315. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the result is 0.432, then the answer is 0.432, but that would mean system_1 is less massive. Did I miscalculate the formula?\n\nWait, the formula for total mass in terms of velocity amplitudes and period:\n\nM1 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G) but when taking the ratio, the constants cancel. So M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]\n\nWait, but Kepler\'s third law in this form might have different dependencies. Wait, let\'s recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function, but in a binary system, if we have both velocities, we can determine the mass ratio and the total mass.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) can be derived using the following approach.\n\nThe orbital speed of each star is v1 = (2π a1)/P and v2 = (2π a2)/P. The ratio of velocities is v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1, from the center of mass condition m1 a1 = m2 a2. Therefore, m1/m2 = a2/a1 = v2/v1.\n\nTherefore, m1 = (v2/v1) m2.\n\nTotal mass M = m1 + m2 = m2 (1 + v2/v1) = m2 (v1 + v2)/v1.\n\nBut also, from Kepler\'s third law: M = (4π² (a1 + a2)^3)/(G P²)\n\nBut a1 + a2 = a = (G M P²/(4π²))^(1/3)\n\nAlternatively, substituting a1 = v1 P/(2π) and a2 = v2 P/(2π), so a = (v1 + v2) P/(2π)\n\nThen, substituting into Kepler\'s third law:\n\nM = (4π² a³)/(G P²) = (4π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2π) ]³ ) / (G P² )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (4π² (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ G P² )\n\n= (4π² / 8 π³) * (v1 + v2)^3 P / G\n\n= (1 / (2 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P\n\nYes, that\'s the same as before. So M = (v1 + v2)^3 P / (2 π G)\n\nTherefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 multiplied by the period. So when we take the ratio of M1 to M2, it\'s [(v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1] / [(v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2]\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nFor system_1: (10 + 5)^3 * 2 = 15³ * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750\n\nFor system_2: (15 +10)^3 *1 =25³ *1= 15625\n\nSo ratio M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. But the problem asks "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which suggests the answer should be greater than 1. But according to this, it\'s less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive. Did I misinterpret the problem?\n\nWait, let\'s check the problem statement again:\n\n"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."\n\nSo if the ratio M1/M2 is 0.432, then system_1 is less massive. So the answer would be 0.432, but the question is phrased as "more massive". Maybe there\'s a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the RV amplitudes are given in different orders. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. If the primary star (more massive) has a smaller velocity, so if one star has 10 km/s and the other 5 km/s, then the mass ratio is 5/10=0.5, so the star with 10 km/s is half the mass of the other. Therefore, the total mass is m1 + m2, where m1 is 0.5 m2, so total mass is 1.5 m2. Alternatively, if the primary eclipse is caused by the hotter star being eclipsed, but perhaps masses are determined purely by velocities.\n\nBut regardless, the calculation of total mass as proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P should hold. So unless there\'s a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should use the sum of velocities, but in Kepler\'s law, total mass relates to the cube of the separation over the square of the period. The separation is a1 + a2, which is (v1 + v2) * P / (2π). So the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity amplitudes are only the semi-amplitudes, so the actual velocities are 2K? Wait, no, the radial velocity amplitude K is the semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity measured. So when we talk about v1 and v2, they are the actual velocities, so K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes, so the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the total mass is different. Let\'s check standard formulae.\n\nThe formula for the total mass of a binary system when you have the radial velocity amplitudes and the period is:\n\nM1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( (1 - e^2)^(3/2) * (sin i)^3 ) * (1 / (2 π G)) )\n\nBut since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination angle i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i = 1. If the orbits are circular (e=0), then the formula simplifies to M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )\n\nBut since we are taking the ratio between M1 and M2, the G and 2 π cancels, so the ratio is ((K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1) / ((K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, M1/M2 = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. However, the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which suggests either the answer is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, or perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement or my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the velocities. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\nIn system_1: RV amplitudes 10 and 5 km/s.\n\nIn system_2: RV amplitudes 15 and 10 km/s.\n\nSo, for system_1, the sum of velocities is 15 km/s, period 2 years.\n\nFor system_2, sum is 25 km/s, period 1 year.\n\nSo, total mass proportional to (sum velocities)^3 * period.\n\nSo system_1: 15^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750\n\nsystem_2: 25^3 *1 = 15625\n\nRatio 6750 /15625 = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times system_2. Hence, system_1 is less massive. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the answer is 0.432, then the question might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: the mass ratio between the two stars in each system can be found from the velocity amplitudes. For system_1: m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1 = m1 + m2 =1.5 m2. Similarly, for system_2: m3/m4 =10/15=2/3. So m3= (2/3)m4. Total mass M2 = m3 + m4 = (5/3)m4.\n\nBut to find the actual masses, we need to use Kepler\'s law. The total mass relates to the orbital period and the semi-major axis. But without knowing the actual separation, we use the velocities. The separation a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π). Then, Kepler\'s third law: M1 + M2 = (4π² a³)/(G P²). Substituting a gives M1 + M2 = (4π² [(v1 + v2) P / (2π)]³ )/(G P²) = (4π² (v1 + v2)^3 P³ )/(8 π³ G P² ) = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P )/(2 π G )\n\nTherefore, the total mass is (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 π G ). So the same as before. Hence, the ratio is correct. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which contradicts the result. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocities given are not the actual velocities but the semi-amplitudes. Wait, in spectroscopic binaries, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula for the mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G (1 - e^2)^(3/2)) ), but that\'s the mass function which depends on the inclination. However, since the system is eclipsing, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. The mass function is f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i)/( (m1 + m2)^2 ) = K1^3 P / (2 π G )\n\nBut if we have both K1 and K2, then we can get the mass ratio and hence the total mass.\n\nAlternatively, since we have both velocities, K1 and K2, we can find the mass ratio q = m2/m1 = K1/K2. Then, the total mass is (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G (1 + q)^3 )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine this.\n\nLet me recall that in a binary system:\n\nThe mass ratio q = m2/m1 = K1/K2.\n\nThe separation between the stars a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P / (2 π)) + (K2 P / (2 π)) = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π)\n\nFrom Kepler\'s third law:\n\n(m1 + m2) = (4 π² a^3) / (G P²) = (4 π² ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) )^3 ) / (G P² )\n\n= (4 π² ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) ) / (G P² )\n\n= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, total mass is indeed (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )\n\nBut since we are taking the ratio between two systems, the 2 π G cancels, so the ratio is:\n\nM1/M2 = ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )\n\nWhich is as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is 6750 /15625 = 0.432. So system_1 is less massive. Therefore, the answer is 0.432, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. So either the question is inverted, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity amplitudes were swapped.\n\nWait, in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5. If the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude, then the 5 km/s corresponds to the more massive star. Similarly, in system_2, the 10 km/s corresponds to the more massive star. But does that affect the total mass? Wait, regardless of individual masses, the total mass depends on the sum of velocities. Even if the individual masses are different, the sum of velocities is used in the formula. So even if one star is more massive, the sum (K1 + K2) is what\'s important. Therefore, the calculation remains as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in years versus some other unit. Wait, the period is in years, but Kepler\'s law uses the period in seconds. However, since we are taking the ratio, the units for period would cancel as long as both periods are in the same unit. Since both are given in years, it\'s fine. Let me check.\n\nIf P is in years, but Kepler\'s law requires it in seconds. However, when taking the ratio M1/M2, the conversion factor from years to seconds would cancel out. Let\'s verify:\n\nSuppose we convert P1 = 2 years and P2 =1 year to seconds. Then P1 = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds, P2 =1 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. So P1/P2 =2. Therefore, when calculating M1/M2, the ratio would still be ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ), since the conversion factor (365.25 *24*3600) would appear in both numerator and denominator and cancel. So the ratio remains 0.432. Hence, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that system_1 has approximately 43.2% the mass of system_2, so system_1 is less massive. However, the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. There\'s a contradiction here.\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n1. Mistake in the problem statement: perhaps it should be "less massive."\n\n2. Mistake in interpreting velocity amplitudes: maybe the velocity amplitudes given are for the same star in each system. For example, in system_1, the primary star has 10 km/s and secondary 5 km/s, and in system_2, primary 15 km/s and secondary 10 km/s. But regardless, the sum is what matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes to be multiplied by sin(i), but since both systems are eclipsing, sin(i)=1, so it cancels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the mass using the individual velocities and mass ratios.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor system_1:\n\nmass_1 = m1, mass_2 = m2.\n\nFrom RV amplitudes: m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10 =0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1 = m1 + m2= 1.5 m2.\n\nFrom Kepler\'s law: M1 = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )\n\nSo 1.5 m2 = (15^3 * 2 ) / (2 π G )\n\nSimilarly, for system_2:\n\nmass_3 = m3, mass_4 = m4.\n\nm3/m4 = v4/v3 =10/15=2/3. Thus, m3= (2/3)m4. Total mass M2= m3 + m4= (5/3)m4.\n\nFrom Kepler\'s law: M2= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, the ratio M1/M2= [1.5 m2 ] / [ (5/3) m4 ] = (9/10) (m2/m4 )\n\nBut we need to relate m2 and m4. From Kepler\'s equations:\n\nFor system_1:\n\n1.5 m2 = (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G )\n\nFor system_2:\n\n(5/3)m4 = (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, m2 = [ (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G ) ] /1.5 = (15^3 *2 ) / (3 π G )\n\nm4 = [ (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G ) ] / (5/3 ) = (25^3 *3 ) / (10 π G )\n\nTherefore, m2/m4= [ (15^3 *2 ) / (3 π G ) ] / [ (25^3 *3 ) / (10 π G ) ] = (15^3 *2 *10 ) / (3*25^3 *3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n15^3=3375, 25^3=15625\n\nSo= (3375 *2 *10 ) / (3 *15625 *3 )= (67500 ) / (140625 )= 0.48\n\nTherefore, M1/M2= (9/10)*0.48=0.432. Same result as before. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 0.432. Hence, system_1 is less massive. The problem\'s wording is likely incorrect, or there\'s a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the question might refer to the mass ratio of the primary stars, but the problem states "the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a miscalculation. Let\'s confirm:\n\n15^3=3375, 25^3=15625\n\n3375*2=6750\n\n15625*1=15625\n\n6750/15625=0.432\n\nYes. So unless there\'s a different interpretation, the answer is 0.432. But given the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, which contradicts the result. However, given the calculation, the answer is 0.432. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the reciprocal, 1/0.432≈2.315, but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the problem\'s velocity amplitudes or periods. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the mass ratio instead of the total mass.\n\nWait, let\'s compute the individual masses.\n\nFor system_1:\n\nm1/m2 =0.5, so m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1=1.5 m2.\n\nFrom Kepler\'s law:\n\nM1= ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )\n\nSo 1.5 m2= (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, m2= (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G *1.5 )= (15^3 *2 )/(3 π G )\n\nSimilarly, system_2:\n\nm3/m4=2/3, so m3=2/3 m4. Total mass M2=5/3 m4.\n\nFrom Kepler\'s law:\n\n5/3 m4= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )\n\nTherefore, m4= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G ) *3/5= (25^3 *3 )/(10 π G )\n\nNow, to compare M1 and M2:\n\nM1=1.5 m2=1.5*(15^3 *2 )/(3 π G )=1.5*(3375*2)/(3 π G )=1.5*6750/(3 π G )=3375/ π G\n\nM2=5/3 m4=5/3*(25^3 *3 )/(10 π G )=5/3*(15625*3 )/(10 π G )=5*15625/(10 π G )=78125/(10 π G )=7812.5/ π G\n\nTherefore, M1/M2=3375 /7812.5=0.432.\n\nSame result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so it\'s less massive. The question\'s phrasing is likely incorrect. But since the problem asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", and the answer is 0.432, I must conclude that either the answer is 0.432 (system_1 is less massive) or there\'s a mistake in the problem. However, given the data provided, the calculation leads to 0.432. Hence, I will present the answer as 27/64, which is 0.421875, close to 0.432. Wait, 6750/15625: let\'s divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270/625. Divide by 5:54/125. 54/125 is 0.432. So 54/125 is the exact fraction. Simplify: 54 and 125 have no common factors. So 54/125= (54 ÷ 2)/(125 ÷2)=27/62.5, but fractional denominators are not standard. So 54/125 is the simplified fraction.\n\nBut 54/125 cannot be simplified further. Therefore, the factor is 54/125, which is approximately 0.432. However, if expressed as a fraction, 54/125 reduces to 27/62.5, but since we can\'t have decimals in fractions, 54/125 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using the mass ratio from velocities and not the total mass via Kepler\'s law. For example, mass is inversely proportional to velocity, so for system_1, masses are in ratio 5:10=1:2, total mass 3 units. For system_2, ratio 10:15=2:3, total mass 5 units. Then, the total mass ratio is 3:5, so system_1 is 3/5=0.6 times system_2. But this approach ignores the period and Kepler\'s law. But that\'s incorrect because the actual total mass depends on the velocities and period. The previous calculation is the correct method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 54/125 or 0.432. However, since the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, and the answer is less than 1, there\'s inconsistency. Unless "factor" is allowed to be less than 1, indicating a fraction. So the answer is 54/125, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{54}{125}}.\n\nAlternatively, if expressed as a decimal factor, approximately 0.432, but since the question might expect a fraction, 54/125 simplifies to 27/62.5, but 62.5 is not an integer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expressed as a reduced fraction:\n\n54/125 = (2 × 27)/(5 × 25) = no, 27 and 25 are co-prime. So 54/125 is simplest.\n\nBut let me check 54 and 125:\n\n54 factors: 2 × 3³\n\n125 factors: 5³\n\nNo common factors. So yes, 54/125 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in interpreting velocity amplitudes as different parameters. For example, if the velocity amplitudes are not the actual velocities but something else. But in the context of the problem, they should be the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves, which are used in Kepler\'s law as done.\n\nHence, after thorough calculation and verification, the answer is 54/125. Thus, system_1 is 54/125 times as massive as system_2, which is approximately 0.432. Therefore, the factor is 54/125.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \\boxed{\\dfrac{54}{125}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390650, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6204, prompt_tokens=1784, total_tokens=7988, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the given periods and radial velocity amplitudes of both systems. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity Amplitudes and Mass Ratios**:
   - For system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. The mass ratio of the stars is inversely proportional to their velocity ratio, giving \( \frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the total mass of system_1 is \( m_1 + m_2 = 3m_1 \).
   - For system_2, the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The mass ratio is \( \frac{m_3}{m_4} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \). Thus, the total mass of system_2 is \( m_3 + m_4 = \frac{5}{3}m_4 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   - The total mass of a binary system is given by \( M = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 \cdot P}{2 \pi G} \), where \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes, \( P \) is the orbital period, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant. Since we are comparing the ratio of the masses, the constants cancel out.

3. **Calculating the Mass Ratio**:
   - For system_1: \( (v_1 + v_2) = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - For system_2: \( (v_1 + v_2) = 25 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P = 1 \, \text{year} \)
   - The ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = \frac{54}{125}
     \]

Thus, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

But let's check if they can be simplified further. 270 and 625: 270 is 2*3^3*5, 625 is 5^4. So, common factor 5. 270/625 = 54/125 = 0.432. So M1 is 0.432 times M2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If M1/M2 = ~0.432, then system_1 is less massive. But that contradicts the initial thought. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, they are asking "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Numerator: (10 + 5)^3 * 2 = 15^3 *2 = 3375 *2 = 6750

Denominator: (15 +10)^3 *1 =25^3 *1= 15625

So 6750 / 15625. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 /25=270, 15625 /25=625. So, 270/625= (270 ÷5)/(625 ÷5)=54/125=0.432. So M1 is 0.432 times M2, so system_1 is less massive. But the question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is less than 1, then the factor is 0.432, meaning system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_2 is more massive by a factor of 1/0.432 ≈2.315. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the result is 0.432, then the answer is 0.432, but that would mean system_1 is less massive. Did I miscalculate the formula?

Wait, the formula for total mass in terms of velocity amplitudes and period:

M1 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G) but when taking the ratio, the constants cancel. So M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Wait, but Kepler's third law in this form might have different dependencies. Wait, let's recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function, but in a binary system, if we have both velocities, we can determine the mass ratio and the total mass.

Alternatively, the formula for the total mass (m1 + m2) can be derived using the following approach.

The orbital speed of each star is v1 = (2π a1)/P and v2 = (2π a2)/P. The ratio of velocities is v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1, from the center of mass condition m1 a1 = m2 a2. Therefore, m1/m2 = a2/a1 = v2/v1.

Therefore, m1 = (v2/v1) m2.

Total mass M = m1 + m2 = m2 (1 + v2/v1) = m2 (v1 + v2)/v1.

But also, from Kepler's third law: M = (4π² (a1 + a2)^3)/(G P²)

But a1 + a2 = a = (G M P²/(4π²))^(1/3)

Alternatively, substituting a1 = v1 P/(2π) and a2 = v2 P/(2π), so a = (v1 + v2) P/(2π)

Then, substituting into Kepler's third law:

M = (4π² a³)/(G P²) = (4π² [ (v1 + v2) P/(2π) ]³ ) / (G P² )

Simplify:

= (4π² (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ G P² )

= (4π² / 8 π³) * (v1 + v2)^3 P / G

= (1 / (2 π G)) * (v1 + v2)^3 P

Yes, that's the same as before. So M = (v1 + v2)^3 P / (2 π G)

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 multiplied by the period. So when we take the ratio of M1 to M2, it's [(v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1] / [(v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2]

So plugging in the numbers:

For system_1: (10 + 5)^3 * 2 = 15³ * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

For system_2: (15 +10)^3 *1 =25³ *1= 15625

So ratio M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. But the problem asks "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which suggests the answer should be greater than 1. But according to this, it's less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive. Did I misinterpret the problem?

Wait, let's check the problem statement again:

"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

So if the ratio M1/M2 is 0.432, then system_1 is less massive. So the answer would be 0.432, but the question is phrased as "more massive". Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the RV amplitudes are given in different orders. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. If the primary star (more massive) has a smaller velocity, so if one star has 10 km/s and the other 5 km/s, then the mass ratio is 5/10=0.5, so the star with 10 km/s is half the mass of the other. Therefore, the total mass is m1 + m2, where m1 is 0.5 m2, so total mass is 1.5 m2. Alternatively, if the primary eclipse is caused by the hotter star being eclipsed, but perhaps masses are determined purely by velocities.

But regardless, the calculation of total mass as proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P should hold. So unless there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the sum of velocities, but in Kepler's law, total mass relates to the cube of the separation over the square of the period. The separation is a1 + a2, which is (v1 + v2) * P / (2π). So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity amplitudes are only the semi-amplitudes, so the actual velocities are 2K? Wait, no, the radial velocity amplitude K is the semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity measured. So when we talk about v1 and v2, they are the actual velocities, so K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes, so the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the total mass is different. Let's check standard formulae.

The formula for the total mass of a binary system when you have the radial velocity amplitudes and the period is:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( (1 - e^2)^(3/2) * (sin i)^3 ) * (1 / (2 π G)) )

But since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination angle i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i = 1. If the orbits are circular (e=0), then the formula simplifies to M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But since we are taking the ratio between M1 and M2, the G and 2 π cancels, so the ratio is ((K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1) / ((K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2)

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, M1/M2 = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. However, the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which suggests either the answer is 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, or perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement or my approach.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the velocities. Let me check the problem statement again:

In system_1: RV amplitudes 10 and 5 km/s.

In system_2: RV amplitudes 15 and 10 km/s.

So, for system_1, the sum of velocities is 15 km/s, period 2 years.

For system_2, sum is 25 km/s, period 1 year.

So, total mass proportional to (sum velocities)^3 * period.

So system_1: 15^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

system_2: 25^3 *1 = 15625

Ratio 6750 /15625 = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times system_2. Hence, system_1 is less massive. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If the answer is 0.432, then the question might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the mass ratio between the two stars in each system can be found from the velocity amplitudes. For system_1: m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1 = m1 + m2 =1.5 m2. Similarly, for system_2: m3/m4 =10/15=2/3. So m3= (2/3)m4. Total mass M2 = m3 + m4 = (5/3)m4.

But to find the actual masses, we need to use Kepler's law. The total mass relates to the orbital period and the semi-major axis. But without knowing the actual separation, we use the velocities. The separation a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2π). Then, Kepler's third law: M1 + M2 = (4π² a³)/(G P²). Substituting a gives M1 + M2 = (4π² [(v1 + v2) P / (2π)]³ )/(G P²) = (4π² (v1 + v2)^3 P³ )/(8 π³ G P² ) = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P )/(2 π G )

Therefore, the total mass is (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 π G ). So the same as before. Hence, the ratio is correct. Therefore, system_1 is less massive. But the problem states "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" which contradicts the result. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, perhaps the velocities given are not the actual velocities but the semi-amplitudes. Wait, in spectroscopic binaries, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula for the mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G (1 - e^2)^(3/2)) ), but that's the mass function which depends on the inclination. However, since the system is eclipsing, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. The mass function is f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i)/( (m1 + m2)^2 ) = K1^3 P / (2 π G )

But if we have both K1 and K2, then we can get the mass ratio and hence the total mass.

Alternatively, since we have both velocities, K1 and K2, we can find the mass ratio q = m2/m1 = K1/K2. Then, the total mass is (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G (1 + q)^3 )

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine this.

Let me recall that in a binary system:

The mass ratio q = m2/m1 = K1/K2.

The separation between the stars a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P / (2 π)) + (K2 P / (2 π)) = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π)

From Kepler's third law:

(m1 + m2) = (4 π² a^3) / (G P²) = (4 π² ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) )^3 ) / (G P² )

= (4 π² ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) ) / (G P² )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, total mass is indeed (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

But since we are taking the ratio between two systems, the 2 π G cancels, so the ratio is:

M1/M2 = ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Which is as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is 6750 /15625 = 0.432. So system_1 is less massive. Therefore, the answer is 0.432, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. So either the question is inverted, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity amplitudes were swapped.

Wait, in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5. If the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude, then the 5 km/s corresponds to the more massive star. Similarly, in system_2, the 10 km/s corresponds to the more massive star. But does that affect the total mass? Wait, regardless of individual masses, the total mass depends on the sum of velocities. Even if the individual masses are different, the sum of velocities is used in the formula. So even if one star is more massive, the sum (K1 + K2) is what's important. Therefore, the calculation remains as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in years versus some other unit. Wait, the period is in years, but Kepler's law uses the period in seconds. However, since we are taking the ratio, the units for period would cancel as long as both periods are in the same unit. Since both are given in years, it's fine. Let me check.

If P is in years, but Kepler's law requires it in seconds. However, when taking the ratio M1/M2, the conversion factor from years to seconds would cancel out. Let's verify:

Suppose we convert P1 = 2 years and P2 =1 year to seconds. Then P1 = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds, P2 =1 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. So P1/P2 =2. Therefore, when calculating M1/M2, the ratio would still be ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ), since the conversion factor (365.25 *24*3600) would appear in both numerator and denominator and cancel. So the ratio remains 0.432. Hence, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that system_1 has approximately 43.2% the mass of system_2, so system_1 is less massive. However, the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. There's a contradiction here.

Possible reasons:

1. Mistake in the problem statement: perhaps it should be "less massive."

2. Mistake in interpreting velocity amplitudes: maybe the velocity amplitudes given are for the same star in each system. For example, in system_1, the primary star has 10 km/s and secondary 5 km/s, and in system_2, primary 15 km/s and secondary 10 km/s. But regardless, the sum is what matters.

Alternatively, maybe the formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes to be multiplied by sin(i), but since both systems are eclipsing, sin(i)=1, so it cancels.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the mass using the individual velocities and mass ratios.

Let me try this approach.

For system_1:

mass_1 = m1, mass_2 = m2.

From RV amplitudes: m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10 =0.5. So m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1 = m1 + m2= 1.5 m2.

From Kepler's law: M1 = ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So 1.5 m2 = (15^3 * 2 ) / (2 π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

mass_3 = m3, mass_4 = m4.

m3/m4 = v4/v3 =10/15=2/3. Thus, m3= (2/3)m4. Total mass M2= m3 + m4= (5/3)m4.

From Kepler's law: M2= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, the ratio M1/M2= [1.5 m2 ] / [ (5/3) m4 ] = (9/10) (m2/m4 )

But we need to relate m2 and m4. From Kepler's equations:

For system_1:

1.5 m2 = (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G )

For system_2:

(5/3)m4 = (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, m2 = [ (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G ) ] /1.5 = (15^3 *2 ) / (3 π G )

m4 = [ (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G ) ] / (5/3 ) = (25^3 *3 ) / (10 π G )

Therefore, m2/m4= [ (15^3 *2 ) / (3 π G ) ] / [ (25^3 *3 ) / (10 π G ) ] = (15^3 *2 *10 ) / (3*25^3 *3 )

Simplify:

15^3=3375, 25^3=15625

So= (3375 *2 *10 ) / (3 *15625 *3 )= (67500 ) / (140625 )= 0.48

Therefore, M1/M2= (9/10)*0.48=0.432. Same result as before. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 0.432. Hence, system_1 is less massive. The problem's wording is likely incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the question might refer to the mass ratio of the primary stars, but the problem states "the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let's confirm:

15^3=3375, 25^3=15625

3375*2=6750

15625*1=15625

6750/15625=0.432

Yes. So unless there's a different interpretation, the answer is 0.432. But given the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, which contradicts the result. However, given the calculation, the answer is 0.432. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the reciprocal, 1/0.432≈2.315, but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's velocity amplitudes or periods. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the mass ratio instead of the total mass.

Wait, let's compute the individual masses.

For system_1:

m1/m2 =0.5, so m1=0.5 m2. Total mass M1=1.5 m2.

From Kepler's law:

M1= ( (v1 + v2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So 1.5 m2= (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, m2= (15^3 *2 ) / (2 π G *1.5 )= (15^3 *2 )/(3 π G )

Similarly, system_2:

m3/m4=2/3, so m3=2/3 m4. Total mass M2=5/3 m4.

From Kepler's law:

5/3 m4= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G )

Therefore, m4= (25^3 *1 ) / (2 π G ) *3/5= (25^3 *3 )/(10 π G )

Now, to compare M1 and M2:

M1=1.5 m2=1.5*(15^3 *2 )/(3 π G )=1.5*(3375*2)/(3 π G )=1.5*6750/(3 π G )=3375/ π G

M2=5/3 m4=5/3*(25^3 *3 )/(10 π G )=5/3*(15625*3 )/(10 π G )=5*15625/(10 π G )=78125/(10 π G )=7812.5/ π G

Therefore, M1/M2=3375 /7812.5=0.432.

Same result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so it's less massive. The question's phrasing is likely incorrect. But since the problem asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", and the answer is 0.432, I must conclude that either the answer is 0.432 (system_1 is less massive) or there's a mistake in the problem. However, given the data provided, the calculation leads to 0.432. Hence, I will present the answer as 27/64, which is 0.421875, close to 0.432. Wait, 6750/15625: let's divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270/625. Divide by 5:54/125. 54/125 is 0.432. So 54/125 is the exact fraction. Simplify: 54 and 125 have no common factors. So 54/125= (54 ÷ 2)/(125 ÷2)=27/62.5, but fractional denominators are not standard. So 54/125 is the simplified fraction.

But 54/125 cannot be simplified further. Therefore, the factor is 54/125, which is approximately 0.432. However, if expressed as a fraction, 54/125 reduces to 27/62.5, but since we can't have decimals in fractions, 54/125 is the simplest form.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects using the mass ratio from velocities and not the total mass via Kepler's law. For example, mass is inversely proportional to velocity, so for system_1, masses are in ratio 5:10=1:2, total mass 3 units. For system_2, ratio 10:15=2:3, total mass 5 units. Then, the total mass ratio is 3:5, so system_1 is 3/5=0.6 times system_2. But this approach ignores the period and Kepler's law. But that's incorrect because the actual total mass depends on the velocities and period. The previous calculation is the correct method.

Therefore, the answer is 54/125 or 0.432. However, since the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, and the answer is less than 1, there's inconsistency. Unless "factor" is allowed to be less than 1, indicating a fraction. So the answer is 54/125, which can be written as \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.

Alternatively, if expressed as a decimal factor, approximately 0.432, but since the question might expect a fraction, 54/125 simplifies to 27/62.5, but 62.5 is not an integer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expressed as a reduced fraction:

54/125 = (2 × 27)/(5 × 25) = no, 27 and 25 are co-prime. So 54/125 is simplest.

But let me check 54 and 125:

54 factors: 2 × 3³

125 factors: 5³

No common factors. So yes, 54/125 is simplest.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting velocity amplitudes as different parameters. For example, if the velocity amplitudes are not the actual velocities but something else. But in the context of the problem, they should be the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves, which are used in Kepler's law as done.

Hence, after thorough calculation and verification, the answer is 54/125. Thus, system_1 is 54/125 times as massive as system_2, which is approximately 0.432. Therefore, the factor is 54/125.

**Final Answer**
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.
