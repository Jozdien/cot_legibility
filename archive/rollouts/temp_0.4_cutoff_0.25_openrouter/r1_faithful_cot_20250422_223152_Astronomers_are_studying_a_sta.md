# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots (6000 K) compared to when it has spots (5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

The factor of change is the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at the two temperatures:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

**Key Steps:**
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Compute \(\Delta E / k\):**
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99,370 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Temperature Terms:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
   \]

4. **Exponent Calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 99,370 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.505
   \]

5. **Final Factor:**
   \[
   \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5
   \]

**Answer:** The ratio decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots. Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Let me start by recalling what I know about stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation, since the problem mentions Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

First, when the star has spots covering 40% of its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) drops from 6000K to 5500K. The transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in levels 2 and 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the respective levels,
- ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which corresponds to a lower temperature, I need to see how the ratio changes with temperature. The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on the inverse of temperature. So, as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Therefore, when the star is cooler (with spots), n2/n1 should be smaller, which matches the observation. 

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. That is, we need to compute the ratio of (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots. Let's denote T1 = 6000K (no spots) and T2 = 5500K (with spots). 

So the factor would be:

[(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)))] / [(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)))] = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Since the statistical weights g2 and g1 cancel out. 

Now, I need to compute ΔE. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = hc/λ. Let's compute that. 

But before plugging in numbers, let me make sure of the units. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s, and λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 m (since 1 Å = 10^-10 m). 

Calculating ΔE:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE/k would be:

ΔE/k ≈ (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.372 / 1.38 x 10^5 ≈ approximately 1.0 x 10^5 K. Wait, that gives ΔE/k ≈ 1.0e5 K. Let me check the calculation again:

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 1448e-10 m: 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J. Then divide by 1.38e-23 J/K: 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4 K. So ΔE/k ≈ 99,400 K. Let's call it approximately 1e5 K for simplicity, but maybe I should keep more precise numbers.

But let's compute it more accurately:

First, compute h*c:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299,792,458 m/s

So h*c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299,792,458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = hc/λ = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Then ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9937 * 1e5 ≈ 99,370 K

So approximately 99,370 K. Let's keep this as 99,370 for more precision.

Now, the exponent in the factor is ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1

So multiplying by ΔE/k ≈ 99,370 K:

99,370 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ Let's compute that:

First, 99,370 * 1.51515e-5 = 99,370 * 0.0000151515 ≈

Compute 99,370 * 0.00001 = 0.9937

Then 99,370 * 0.0000051515 ≈ 99,370 * 0.000005 = 0.49685, and 99,370 * 0.0000001515 ≈ ~0.01506

Adding up: 0.9937 + 0.49685 + 0.01506 ≈ 1.5056

So the exponent is approximately 1.5056

Therefore, the factor is exp(1.5056) ≈ Let's calculate e^1.5056.

We know e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 = 1.6487, so e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817. Then e^1.5056 is slightly more than that.

Compute 1.5056 - 1.5 = 0.0056. So e^0.0056 ≈ 1 + 0.0056 + (0.0056)^2/2 ≈ 1.0056 + 0.00001568 ≈ 1.00561568

Therefore, e^1.5056 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00561568 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.00561568 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0252 ≈ 4.5069

So approximately 4.51. Let me check with a calculator:

Alternatively, using more accurate computation:

1.5056

We can use the Taylor series expansion around 1.5:

But maybe better to use natural logarithm tables or remember that ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041. Wait, ln(4.5) is:

ln(4) = 1.3863, ln(4.5) = ln(4) + ln(1.125) ≈ 1.3863 + 0.1178 ≈ 1.5041. So ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041. But our exponent is 1.5056, which is 1.5041 + 0.0015. So e^1.5056 = e^{1.5041 + 0.0015} = e^{1.5041} * e^{0.0015} ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.0015) ≈ 4.5 * 1.0015 ≈ 4.50675. So approximately 4.5068. So about 4.51.

Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51. So the ratio when the star doesn't have spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. But wait, let me confirm:

Wait, the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)] ≈ exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.51. So the ratio decreases by a factor of 4.51 when the star has spots. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is 4.51. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor is (no spots)/(with spots) = 4.51. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5.

But let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation steps.

First, the energy difference calculation: yes, using hc/λ, converted to meters, correct.

ΔE/k: yes, computed correctly as approximately 99,370 K.

Then (1/T2 - 1/T1): yes, 1/5500 - 1/6000, which is (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1. Multiplying by ΔE/k gives 99,370 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99,370 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.505. So exponent is 1.505, e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. Correct.

Therefore, the factor is approximately e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. But let's see if the question wants an exact number or if there's a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me recompute ΔE with more precise numbers.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact, since it's defined)

c = 299,792,458 m/s (exact)

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299,792,458 = 1.98644586e-25 J·m

ΔE = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.98644586 / 1.448 * 1e-18 = approximately 1.372e-18 J

Then ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9937 * 1e5 = 99370 K

So, 99,370 K.

Then 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 0.0000151515 K^-1

Multiply by ΔE/k: 99,370 * 0.0000151515 ≈

Let's compute 99,370 * 0.0000151515:

First, 99,370 * 0.00001 = 0.9937

99,370 * 0.0000051515 = 99,370 * (0.000005 + 0.0000001515) = 99,370*0.000005 = 0.49685, and 99,370*0.0000001515 ≈ 0.01506

Total: 0.9937 + 0.49685 + 0.01506 ≈ 1.5056

So exponent is 1.5056, then e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51.

Alternatively, using calculator input:

1.5056

e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51. So yes, approximately 4.5. But let's check with a calculator for higher precision.

Using a calculator:

e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.

The question mentions that 40% of the surface is covered by spots. However, the effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots are present. But how does the presence of spots affect the observed effective temperature? Typically, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity decreases, and the effective temperature is an average. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps we can treat the star as having two regions: spotted regions with a lower temperature and unspotted regions with the original temperature. However, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the question is about the photospheric temperature affecting the Boltzmann ratio. Wait, but the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". Hmm. Effective temperature is a measure of the total energy output, so if parts of the photosphere are cooler, the average temperature would be lower. But the Boltzmann ratio depends on the local temperature in the photosphere. However, the problem states "the stellar photosphere is in LTE". So if 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler regions, then in those spotted regions, the local temperature is lower, and in the unspotted regions, the temperature remains at 6000 K. But when we observe the star, we get a combination of the spectra from both the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the problem states that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. This suggests that the observed ratio is an average over the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the problem says to assume LTE, which usually applies locally. So maybe each region (spots and non-spots) has its own LTE conditions, and the total ratio is a combination. But the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms... observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots". Wait, but if the spots are cooler, then in the spots, the ratio n2/n1 would be lower, and in the unspotted regions, it's higher. However, the observed ratio would be a combination of the two. But the problem states that the overall ratio decreases. That suggests that the cooler regions contribute more to the line formation or that the filling factor causes the average to be lower. However, the problem statement might be simplifying this by stating that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere decreases to 5500 K. Wait, but effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation, not necessarily the local temperature. However, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". Maybe in this context, they are considering the photosphere to have a uniform effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present, which might not be realistic, but perhaps it's a simplification for the problem. Alternatively, maybe the presence of spots causes the entire photosphere to cool, which is not how spots work, but perhaps the problem is assuming that. But given that the problem states "the stellar photosphere is in LTE", and asks for the ratio change, we can proceed under the assumption that the temperature of the photosphere (either as an average or as a uniform temperature) is 5500 K when spots are present. Therefore, the calculation we did earlier with T1=6000K and T2=5500K is valid, leading to a factor of approximately 4.5.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 4.5. However, let me check once more if there's a different approach.

Alternatively, if the star's surface is partially covered by spots with a different temperature, the effective temperature is determined by the area-weighted average of the flux from both regions. The flux is proportional to T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the total luminosity would be L = σ * (A1 * T1^4 + A2 * T2^4), where A1 is the area without spots, A2 is the area with spots. Then the effective temperature is given by L = σ * A_total * Teff^4. However, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. If we were to compute the temperature of the spots, we could set up the equation:

(0.6 * T1^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4) = Teff_new^4

Given Teff_new = 5500 K, T1 = 6000 K. Solving for T_spot:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 5500^4

But this would give us the temperature of the spots. However, the problem does not ask for the spot temperature but rather the ratio of the Boltzmann factors assuming the photosphere's Teff is 5500K. However, if the photosphere is a combination of two temperatures, the observed ratio n2/n1 would be a weighted average of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. If the ratio in the spots is lower and in the unspotted regions remains the same, the overall ratio would be a weighted average. However, the problem might be simplifying this by considering that the entire photosphere has a lower effective temperature of 5500K, hence using a single temperature for the Boltzmann equation. But this would not be accurate because starspots cause the star to have a non-uniform photosphere. However, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", which might imply that for the purpose of this problem, we can treat the entire photosphere as having a uniform temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. This is a simplification, but perhaps necessary for the problem. Given that, then our initial calculation holds. However, if instead, the ratio is a weighted average of two regions, we would need more information. Let me explore this possibility.

Suppose that 60% of the surface is at 6000K and 40% is at T_spot. Then the observed ratio n2/n1 would be:

(n2/n1)_obs = 0.6*(n2/n1)_6000K + 0.4*(n2/n1)_Tspot

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. If (n2/n1)_Tspot < (n2/n1)_6000K, then the observed ratio would be lower. However, the problem states that the effective temperature is 5500K. If we were to compute the effective temperature from the areas and temperatures, we can find T_spot, and then compute the ratio. But the problem does not provide T_spot, it provides the effective temperature. This suggests that the problem expects us to use the effective temperature as the temperature in the Boltzmann equation, even though in reality it's an average. Since the problem states "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", and "the stellar photosphere is in LTE", perhaps we are to assume that the entire photosphere is at 5500K when spots are present. This is a bit conflicting with how starspots work, but given the problem's phrasing, this might be the intended approach. Therefore, proceeding with T1=6000K and T2=5500K gives the factor as e^(ΔE/k*(1/T2 -1/T1)) ≈4.5.

Alternatively, if the problem expects considering that only part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, then the average ratio would be a weighted sum. Let's explore this:

Let’s denote f = 0.4 (fraction covered by spots), T_spot = ?

First, compute T_spot using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

The total flux is a weighted sum of the fluxes from the spotted and unspotted regions:

sigma * ( (1 - f) * T1^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) = sigma * Teff_new^4

Cancel sigma:

(1 - f)*T1^4 + f*T_spot^4 = Teff_new^4

We can solve for T_spot:

T_spot^4 = [ Teff_new^4 - (1 - f)*T1^4 ] / f

Plugging in the numbers:

Teff_new = 5500 K, T1 = 6000 K, f = 0.4

Compute Teff_new^4 = (5500)^4

Similarly, T1^4 = (6000)^4

Calculating:

First, compute (5500/1000)^4 = 5.5^4 = 5.5*5.5=30.25; 30.25*5.5=166.375; 166.375*5.5≈915.0625. So 5500^4 = 915.0625e12 K^4

Similarly, 6000^4 = 1296e12 K^4

So,

Teff_new^4 ≈ 915.0625e12

(1 - f)*T1^4 = 0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12

Thus,

T_spot^4 = (915.0625e12 - 777.6e12) / 0.4 = (137.4625e12) / 0.4 = 343.65625e12

Therefore,

T_spot = (343.65625e12)^(1/4)

First, compute (343.65625e12)^(1/4) = (343.65625)^(1/4) * (1e12)^(1/4) = (343.65625)^(1/4) * 1e3

Now, 343.65625 is approximately 7^3 = 343, so 343.65625^(1/4) ≈ cube root of 7^3^(1/4) = 7^(3/4) ≈ e^( (3/4)*ln7 ) ≈ e^( (3/4)*1.9459 ) ≈ e^(1.4594) ≈ 4.3

But let's compute more accurately:

343.65625 = 343 + 0.65625 = 7^3 + 0.65625

Let me compute the fourth root:

We can note that 4.3^4 = (4 + 0.3)^4 = 4^4 + 4*4^3*0.3 + 6*4^2*0.3^2 + 4*4*0.3^3 + 0.3^4

= 256 + 4*64*0.3 + 6*16*0.09 + 4*4*0.027 + 0.0081

= 256 + 76.8 + 8.64 + 0.432 + 0.0081 ≈ 256 + 76.8 = 332.8 +8.64=341.44 +0.432=341.872 +0.0081=341.8801

But we need 343.65625. So 4.3^4 ≈341.88, which is less than 343.656. Let's try 4.31:

4.31^4 = ?

First, compute 4.3^4 ≈341.88

Then, 4.31^4 ≈ (4.3 + 0.01)^4 ≈ 4.3^4 + 4*4.3^3*0.01 + 6*4.3^2*0.01^2 + ... ≈ approximate using binomial expansion:

≈341.88 + 4*(79.507)*0.01 + 6*(18.49)*0.0001

First, 4.3^3 = 4.3*4.3*4.3 = 18.49*4.3 ≈ 79.507

So second term: 4*79.507*0.01 ≈ 3.1803

Third term: 6*18.49*0.0001 ≈ 0.011094

So total ≈341.88 +3.1803 +0.011094 ≈345.0714

But we need 343.656, which is between 4.3^4 and 4.31^4. Let's find x such that x^4 =343.656

We have:

At x=4.3: 341.88

At x=4.305: Let's compute 4.305^4

First, 4.3^4=341.88

Now, 4.305 =4.3 +0.005

Using binomial approx:

Δx=0.005

x^4 ≈ (4.3)^4 + 4*(4.3)^3*Δx + 6*(4.3)^2*(Δx)^2 + 4*(4.3)*(Δx)^3 + (Δx)^4

=341.88 +4*(79.507)*0.005 +6*(18.49)*(0.005)^2 +4*(4.3)*(0.005)^3 + (0.005)^4

Calculate each term:

Second term:4*79.507*0.005≈1.59014

Third term:6*18.49*0.000025≈6*18.49*0.000025≈0.0027735

Fourth term:4*4.3*0.000000125≈0.00000215

Fifth term:0.000000000625

Total ≈341.88 +1.59014 +0.0027735 +0.00000215 ≈343.4729

Hmm, 4.305^4≈343.4729, which is still less than 343.656. The difference is 343.656 -343.4729≈0.1831.

The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3. At x=4.305, 4x^3≈4*(4.305)^3≈4*79.507 (from before, but x=4.305, so 4.305^3≈ (4.3)^3 +3*(4.3)^2*0.005 + ... ) But maybe approximate:

dx needed to get 0.1831 increase:

dx ≈0.1831 / (4*(4.305)^3) ≈0.1831 / (4*79.8)≈0.1831/319.2≈0.000574

So x≈4.305 +0.000574≈4.305574

Thus, x≈4.3056, so T_spot≈4305.6 K

Therefore, the spots have a temperature of approximately 4305 K.

Now, if we have 60% of the surface at 6000K and 40% at ~4305K, then the ratio n2/n1 observed would be a weighted average of the two regions. However, the problem states that "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms... decreases when the star has spots". If we compute the average ratio, it would be:

(n2/n1)_avg = 0.6*(n2/n1)_6000 + 0.4*(n2/n1)_4305

But each ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor:

(n2/n1)_T = (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(kT))

Assuming g2/g1 is the same for both regions (same element, same transition), the ratio becomes:

(n2/n1)_avg = (g2/g1) [0.6*exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) + 0.4*exp(-ΔE/(k*4305)) ]

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. Let's compare this to the no-spot case, which is (n2/n1)_no_spots = (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(k*6000))

So the factor by which the ratio changes is:

[(n2/n1)_no_spots] / [(n2/n1)_spots] = [exp(-ΔE/(k*6000))] / [0.6*exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) + 0.4*exp(-ΔE/(k*4305)) ]

= 1 / [0.6 + 0.4*exp( ΔE/(k*(1/4305 - 1/6000)) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) for T=4305:

ΔE/k ≈99,370 K, so:

ΔE/(k*4305) ≈99,370 /4305 ≈23.08

Similarly, ΔE/(k*6000)≈99,370 /6000≈16.56

So exp(-23.08) and exp(-16.56). These are very small numbers. Wait, but this can't be right. If ΔE corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet, then the energy difference ΔE is significant, leading to a low population in the upper level. Let's compute these exponentials:

First, compute ΔE/(k*T) for T=6000K:

As before, ΔE/k = ~99,370 K, so 99,370 /6000 ≈16.5617

Similarly, for T=4305K:

99,370 /4305 ≈23.08

Thus, exp(-16.5617) ≈ 6.3e-8

exp(-23.08) ≈ 1.03e-10

Therefore, the average ratio:

(n2/n1)_avg = (g2/g1)[0.6*6.3e-8 + 0.4*1.03e-10] ≈ (g2/g1)[3.78e-8 + 4.12e-11] ≈ (g2/g1)*3.78412e-8

The no-spot ratio is (g2/g1)*6.3e-8

Therefore, the factor is:

(6.3e-8) / (3.78412e-8) ≈1.664

So the ratio decreases by a factor of ~1.66 when spots are present. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is approximately 1.66, meaning the ratio is 1.66 times higher when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

But this contradicts our initial approach where we considered the entire photosphere at 5500K, giving a factor of ~4.5. So which is correct?

The problem states that the effective temperature decreases to 5500K when 40% is covered by spots. However, the Boltzmann ratio depends on the local temperature in the regions where the spectral lines are formed. If the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, and the rest is at 6000K, then the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions. However, the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, which involves T^4, but the Boltzmann factor depends exponentially on 1/T. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which usually applies locally. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the two different temperatures in the spotted and unspotted regions and compute the average ratio. However, the problem might be oversimplifying by stating that the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500K, implying that the entire photosphere is at that temperature. This is a common simplification in some problems, even though it's not physically accurate. The discrepancy arises because the effective temperature relates to the total flux (T^4), while the Boltzmann factor depends exponentially on 1/T. 

Given the problem's statement: "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", and "the stellar photosphere is in LTE", it's ambiguous whether the temperature refers to the local temperature or an average. However, since LTE applies locally, the spotted regions would have a lower temperature, and the unspotted regions remain at 6000K. Therefore, the ratio should be a weighted average. However, when we calculated this, the factor was only ~1.66, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which aligns with both approaches. However, the initial approach assuming a uniform 5500K gives a larger factor (~4.5), whereas the more realistic approach gives ~1.66.

But wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". The term "photospheric effective temperature" might be intended to mean that the entire photosphere is modeled as having a uniform temperature of 5500K when spots are present. In real stars, the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux and doesn't imply that the photosphere is isothermal. However, in the context of this problem, since it specifies LTE (which is a local condition), and asks for the ratio in the photosphere, it's possible that they expect using the effective temperature as the temperature in the Boltzmann equation. This is a simplified model, but it's possible. 

But given that when we consider the star having 40% spots at ~4305K and 60% at 6000K, the average ratio is lower than the no-spot case by a factor of ~1.66, whereas using a uniform 5500K gives a factor of ~4.5. The problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which is true in both cases, but the factor differs. 

However, the problem mentions "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels... observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots". If the spectral lines are formed in regions that are either spotted or unspotted, then the observed ratio would be a combination. However, the transition corresponding to 1448 Å is in the ultraviolet, which might be more affected by hotter regions. But without more information on the contribution functions or how the spots affect the line formation, it's hard to say. 

Given that the problem gives the effective temperature as 5500K when spots are present, and asks to assume LTE, it's possible that the intended solution is to use the effective temperature as the temperature in the Boltzmann equation, leading to the factor of ~4.5. However, the more accurate approach considering two temperatures gives a smaller factor. Given that in examination settings, sometimes simplifications are expected, and the problem provides the effective temperature with spots as 5500K, the answer expected is likely the one using T=5500K, leading to the factor of approximately e^(ΔE/k*(1/5500 -1/6000))≈4.5.

But let's check what the actual calculation gives. Earlier, with T_spot≈4305K, the factor was ~1.66, but maybe the problem expects us to use the given Teff=5500K as the temperature governing the Boltzmann ratio. 

Another angle: The effective temperature is related to the radiation field, but the Boltzmann equation depends on the local temperature where the line forms. If the line forms in regions that are at the effective temperature, then using Teff is correct. However, in reality, lines form in different layers, and spots complicate this. But given LTE and the problem's wording, using Teff=5500K for the spotted case might be the intended approach.

Given that, the factor is approximately e^(1.5056)=4.51. Rounding to two significant figures, 4.5. However, perhaps we should compute it more accurately.

Let me recompute the exponent with precise values:

ΔE/k =99370 K

1/T2 -1/T1 =1/5500 -1/6000= (6000-5500)/(5500*6000)=500/(33,000,000)=1/66,000=0.0000151515...

So ΔE/k*(1/T2 -1/T1)=99370*0.0000151515=1.5056

Then e^1.5056=4.506. So approximately 4.51.

But another way: using the actual value of ΔE/k* (1/T2 -1/T1)= (hc/(λk)) * (1/T2 -1/T1)

Let me compute this using all constants:

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s

c=299792458 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m

k=1.380649e-23 J/K

T1=6000 K

T2=5500 K

Compute exponent= (h c)/(λ k) * (1/T2 -1/T1)

Numerator: h c =6.62607015e-34 *299792458=1.98644586e-25 J·m

Divide by λk:1.98644586e-25 / (1448e-10 *1.380649e-23)=1.98644586e-25 / (2.000e-13)=1.98644586e-25 /2.000e-13=9.9322293e-13

Then multiply by (1/T2 -1/T1)=1/5500 -1/6000= (6000-5500)/(5500*6000)=500/(33,000,000)=1/66,000≈0.0000151515

So exponent=9.9322293e-13 *0.0000151515≈1.505e-17? Wait, no. Wait, the units:

Wait, (h c)/(λ k) has units of (J·m)/(m·J/K)= (J·m)/(J·m/K)* something? Wait, let's check units:

h c has units J·m

λk has units m·J/K (since k is J/K)

So (h c)/(λ k) has units (J·m)/(m·J/K)= K

Then multiply by (1/T2 -1/T1) which has units 1/K

So overall exponent is dimensionless, as needed.

So (h c)/(λ k)=1.98644586e-25 / (1448e-10 *1.380649e-23)=1.98644586e-25 / (1.448e-7 *1.380649e-23)=1.98644586e-25 / (2.000e-30)=9.932e5 K

Then multiply by (1/T2 -1/T1)=1/5500 -1/6000≈0.0000151515 K^-1

So exponent=9.932e5 *0.0000151515≈15.05

Wait, this can't be right. Wait, 9.932e5 K *0.0000151515 K^-1=9.932e5 *1.51515e-5=9.932*1.51515≈15.05

So exponent=15.05

Wait, but earlier we had exponent=1.5056. This is a discrepancy. Where is the mistake?

Ah, yes! Earlier, I incorrectly computed ΔE/k as 99,370 K, but when recalculating with exact constants, the exponent becomes 15.05. This is a critical error. Let me trace back.

Wait, the exponent is (h c)/(λ k) * (1/T2 -1/T1)

Let me compute this step by step:

First, compute (h c)/(λ k):

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s

c=299792458 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m=1.448e-7 m

k=1.380649e-23 J/K

So hc=6.62607015e-34 *299792458=1.98644586e-25 J·m

Divide by λ k=1.448e-7 m *1.380649e-23 J/K=1.448e-7*1.380649e-23=2.000e-30 J·m/K

Thus, (h c)/(λ k)=1.98644586e-25 /2.000e-30=993.22 K

Wait, 1.98644586e-25 /2.000e-30= (1.98644586 /2.000) *1e5=0.99322 *1e5=99322 K≈9.932e4 K=99,320 K. Which matches the earlier value of ΔE/k≈99,370 K (close enough, differences due to rounding).

Then, multiply by (1/T2 -1/T1)=1/5500 -1/6000≈0.0000151515 K^-1

So exponent=99322 K *0.0000151515 K^-1≈99322 *0.0000151515≈1.505

Ah, yes, so exponent≈1.505, hence e^1.505≈4.5. 

My mistake earlier was miscalculating the units when trying to recompute, but the correct exponent is indeed ~1.505, leading to e^1.505≈4.5. Therefore, the initial calculation was correct, and the factor is approximately 4.5.

The confusion with the alternative approach considering two temperatures giving a factor of ~1.66 arises from interpreting the problem differently. However, the problem explicitly states that the effective temperature decreases to 5500K when spots are present and assumes LTE. Given that LTE holds, and the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500K, it's implied that the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is 5500K. Therefore, the correct factor is e^1.505≈4.5.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5, and after checking all possible angles, this seems to be the intended solution.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Let me start by recalling what I know about stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation, since the problem mentions Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

First, when the star has spots covering 40% of its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) drops from 6000K to 5500K. The transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in levels 2 and 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the respective levels,
- ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which corresponds to a lower temperature, I need to see how the ratio changes with temperature. The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on the inverse of temperature. So, as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Therefore, when the star is cooler (with spots), n2/n1 should be smaller, which matches the observation. 

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. That is, we need to compute the ratio of (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots. Let's denote T1 = 6000K (no spots) and T2 = 5500K (with spots). 

So the factor would be:

[(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)))] / [(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)))] = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Since the statistical weights g2 and g1 cancel out. 

Now, I need to compute ΔE. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = hc/λ. Let's compute that. 

But before plugging in numbers, let me make sure of the units. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s, and λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 m (since 1 Å = 10^-10 m). 

Calculating ΔE:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE/k would be:

ΔE/k ≈ (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.372 / 1.38 x 10^5 ≈ approximately 1.0 x 10^5 K. Wait, that gives ΔE/k ≈ 1.0e5 K. Let me check the calculation again:

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 1448e-10 m: 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J. Then divide by 1.38e-23 J/K: 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4 K. So ΔE/k ≈ 99,400 K. Let's call it approximately 1e5 K for simplicity, but maybe I should keep more precise numbers.

But let's compute it more accurately:

First, compute h*c:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299,792,458 m/s

So h*c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299,792,458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = hc/λ = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Then ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9937 * 1e5 ≈ 99,370 K

So approximately 99,370 K. Let's keep this as 99,370 for more precision.

Now, the exponent in the factor is ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1

So multiplying by ΔE/k ≈ 99,370 K:

99,370 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ Let's compute that:

First, 99,370 * 1.51515e-5 = 99,370 * 0.0000151515 ≈

Compute 99,370 * 0.00001 = 0.9937

Then 99,370 * 0.0000051515 ≈ 99,370 * 0.000005 = 0.49685, and 99,370 * 0.0000001515 ≈ ~0.01506

Adding up: 0.9937 + 0.49685 + 0.01506 ≈ 1.5056

So the exponent is approximately 1.5056

Therefore, the factor is exp(1.5056) ≈ Let's calculate e^1.5056.

We know e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 = 1.6487, so e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817. Then e^1.5056 is slightly more than that.

Compute 1.5056 - 1.5 = 0.0056. So e^0.0056 ≈ 1 + 0.0056 + (0.0056)^2/2 ≈ 1.0056 + 0.00001568 ≈ 1.00561568

Therefore, e^1.5056 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00561568 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.00561568 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0252 ≈ 4.5069

So approximately 4.51. Let me check with a calculator:

Alternatively, using more accurate computation:

1.5056

We can use the Taylor series expansion around 1.5:

But maybe better to use natural logarithm tables or remember that ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041. Wait, ln(4.5) is:

ln(4) = 1.3863, ln(4.5) = ln(4) + ln(1.125) ≈ 1.3863 + 0.1178 ≈ 1.5041. So ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5041. But our exponent is 1.5056, which is 1.5041 + 0.0015. So e^1.5056 = e^{1.5041 + 0.0015} = e^{1.5041} * e^{0.0015} ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.0015) ≈ 4.5 * 1.0015 ≈ 4.50675. So approximately 4.5068. So about 4.51.

Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51. So the ratio when the star doesn't have spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. But wait, let me confirm:

Wait, the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)] ≈ exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.51. So the ratio decreases by a factor of 4.51 when the star has spots. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is 4.51. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor is (no spots)/(with spots) = 4.51. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5.

But let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation steps.

First, the energy difference calculation: yes, using hc/λ, converted to meters, correct.

ΔE/k: yes, computed correctly as approximately 99,370 K.

Then (1/T2 - 1/T1): yes, 1/5500 - 1/6000, which is (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1. Multiplying by ΔE/k gives 99,370 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99,370 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.505. So exponent is 1.505, e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. Correct.

Therefore, the factor is approximately e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. But let's see if the question wants an exact number or if there's a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me recompute ΔE with more precise numbers.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact, since it's defined)

c = 299,792,458 m/s (exact)

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299,792,458 = 1.98644586e-25 J·m

ΔE = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.98644586 / 1.448 * 1e-18 = approximately 1.372e-18 J

Then ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9937 * 1e5 = 99370 K

So, 99,370 K.

Then 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 0.0000151515 K^-1

Multiply by ΔE/k: 99,370 * 0.0000151515 ≈

Let's compute 99,370 * 0.0000151515:

First, 99,370 * 0.00001 = 0.9937

99,370 * 0.0000051515 = 99,370 * (0.000005 + 0.0000001515) = 99,370*0.000005 = 0.49685, and 99,370*0.0000001515 ≈ 0.01506

Total: 0.9937 + 0.49685 + 0.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms between two energy levels changes when comparing a star without spots to one with spots. I'll approach this using knowledge of stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation since we're dealing with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

For the spotless star, the effective temperature is 6000K, while with 40% spot coverage, it drops to 5500K. The transition between energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å in the ultraviolet range. According to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Where n2 and n1 are number densities in levels 2 and 1, g2 and g1 are statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Since the ratio decreases with spots (lower temperature), this makes sense as the ratio depends exponentially on the inverse temperature. As temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller.

To find the factor by which the ratio changes, I need to calculate:
(n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Where T1 = 6000K (no spots) and T2 = 5500K (with spots). The statistical weights cancel out.

First, I'll calculate ΔE using E = hc/λ:
h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299,792,458 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m

So: hc = 1.98644586e-25 J·m
And: ΔE = hc/λ = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Then: ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ 99,370 K

Now for (1/T2 - 1/T1):
1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1

Therefore: 99,370 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 1.5056

The factor is exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.51

This means the ratio when the star doesn't have spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. Since the problem states that the ratio decreases with spots, this calculation confirms that the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is approximately 4.5.

I need to determine how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has no spots versus when it does. First, with 40% spot coverage, the star's effective temperature decreases from 6000K to 5500K. The transition between these energy levels occurs at 1448 Å in the ultraviolet range. The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of atoms in the two levels:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities,
- g2 and g1 are statistical weights,
- ΔE is the energy difference,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is temperature.

The ratio decreases with spots due to the lower temperature, suggesting the exponent's negativity increases, reducing the ratio. We need the factor of change, calculated by:

[(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)))] / [(g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)))] = exp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Statistical weights cancel out.

Calculating ΔE using the relation E = hc/λ, with h as Planck's constant, c as light speed, and λ as the wavelength, we find:

ΔE = hc/λ, using:
- h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s,
- c = 3.00 x 10^8 m/s,
- λ = 1448 x 10^-10 m.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J

With k = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K, ΔE/k ≈ (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 99,370 K.

The exponent ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) with T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K becomes:
1/5500 - 1/6000 = 500/(5500*6000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1.

Multiplying by ΔE/k gives 99,370 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 1.5056.

Thus, the factor is exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.51, meaning the ratio is about 4.5 times higher without spots.

So yes, approximately 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nBut let me check once again the question: "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots (T=5500K), the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when there are no spots (T=6000K). Therefore, the ratio without spots is higher by a factor of e^(ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)) ≈ 4.5. So the answer is 4.5, approximately.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation. Let me check if I can get a more accurate value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a different approach. Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". However, when spots are present, the star\'s observed effective temperature is lower. But in reality, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. However, the problem states that 40% of the surface is covered by spots, and the effective temperature is 5500K. But the way the effective temperature is calculated is as a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. Wait, but the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". So maybe we are to assume that the entire photosphere is at 5500K when spots are present? Or is the effective temperature a combination of the cooler spots and the warmer photosphere?\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. The effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and radius: Teff = (L/(4πσR²))^(1/4). If 40% of the surface is covered by spots which are cooler, then the total luminosity would be the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. This might mean that the effective temperature, as observed, is 5500K, implying that the star\'s total emission is equivalent to a blackbody of 5500K. However, the actual photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions might still be 6000K, and the spots are cooler. But the question mentions "the stellar photosphere is in LTE", so perhaps we need to consider the temperature of the photosphere where the spectral lines are formed. \n\nWait, the problem states: "In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels...". So the ratio depends on the local temperature in the photosphere. If the photosphere has regions at different temperatures (spots and non-spots), then the observed ratio would be an average. However, the problem says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots". So maybe when spots are present, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, which affects the average. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500K. Wait, perhaps the entire photosphere is assumed to be at 5500K when spots are present? That would make the calculation straightforward, as we can just compute the ratio at 6000K and 5500K. However, in reality, starspots are cooler regions on the star\'s surface, and the effective temperature is a combination. But the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500K". Maybe in this problem, for simplicity, when spots cover 40% of the surface, the entire photosphere is modeled as having a uniform temperature of 5500K. Otherwise, the calculation would be more complex, involving a weighted average of two different temperatures (spots and non-spots regions). \n\nBut the problem says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE". If the photosphere has two different temperatures (some regions at 6000K and some lower), then LTE would apply separately in each region. However, the observed ratio would be a combination of the contributions from both regions. But the problem states that "the ratio decreases when the star has spots", which suggests that the presence of spots leads to a lower average ratio. \n\nBut if we are to take the problem at face value, it says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500K. So perhaps in this case, we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500K when spots are present, and 6000K when not. Then the ratio n2/n1 is simply given by the Boltzmann factor at each temperature. \n\nBut the problem might be more complex. Let me think again.\n\nIf 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, and 60% is at the original temperature of 6000K. Then the effective temperature is some average. But the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500K. However, the effective temperature is related to the total luminosity. The luminosity would be L = 0.6 * L1 + 0.4 * L2, where L1 is the luminosity from the unspotted region (Teff1=6000K) and L2 from the spotted region (Teff2=?).\n\nBut the problem gives the effective temperature when spots are present as 5500K. So using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when spots are present, the total luminosity would be L_spots = 4πR²σ(0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4), assuming that the spotted areas have temperature T2 and cover 40% of the surface. But the problem states that the effective temperature is 5500K, so:\n\n4πR²σ(0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4) = 4πR²σTeff^4\n\nCanceling terms:\n\n0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4 = Teff^4\n\nBut the problem states that Teff becomes 5500K when 40% is covered by spots. However, T1 here is the unspotted temperature, which is 6000K. So:\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T2^4 = (5500)^4\n\nWe can solve for T2, the temperature of the spots.\n\nBut this might be necessary if the problem expects us to consider that the spots have a different temperature, and the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions. However, the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere consists of two regions at different temperatures, then the total number ratio would be a weighted average of the two ratios (weighted by their respective areas). \n\nBut the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms... astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots". So the observed ratio is a combination of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. If the spotted regions are cooler, their n2/n1 ratio is lower, and the unspotted regions have a higher ratio. The combined ratio would be somewhere in between. However, the problem states that the overall ratio decreases, which makes sense if the cooler regions contribute a lower ratio, pulling the average down.\n\nBut this complicates the calculation because we need to find the average ratio over the two regions. However, the problem might be simplifying this by assuming that when the star has spots, the entire photosphere is at 5500K, hence the ratio is just the Boltzmann factor at 5500K. Similarly, when there are no spots, the ratio is at 6000K. Then the factor would be as calculated before, e^(ΔE/k (1/5500 - 1/6000)), but actually, wait:\n\nWait, the ratio when no spots is at 6000K, and with spots it\'s at 5500K. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K = exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. \n\nHowever, if instead, the ratio is a weighted average of the spotted and unspotted regions, then we need to compute:\n\n(n2/n1)_avg = [0.6*(n2/n1)_hot + 0.4*(n2/n1)_cool] / [0.6 + 0.4]\n\nBut since n2/n1 depends exponentially on temperature, and the cool spots have a much lower ratio, the average would be dominated more by the cooler spots if their emission is significantly different.\n\nBut the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. If the spots are part of the photosphere, then the Ti ionization/excitation would be according to their local temperatures. However, when we observe the star, the light we receive is a combination of the bright regions (6000K) and the dark spots (cooler, say T_spot). The equivalent width of the absorption lines would be affected by the varying temperatures. However, the ratio of populations in two energy levels would require knowing the contribution from each region. \n\nBut the problem mentions that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. If the spots are cooler, then in those regions, the ratio n2/n1 is lower. The unspotted regions still have the higher ratio. However, the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average. The flux from each region depends on their surface area and their specific intensity. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. The problem might be intending us to ignore the spatial variation and just consider the effective temperature change, assuming that the entire photosphere is at the lower temperature when spots are present. Otherwise, the problem would need to provide the temperature of the spots. But since it doesn\'t, and just says the effective temperature is 5500K when 40% is covered by spots, maybe we are to proceed with the initial approach where the entire photosphere is treated as 5500K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem accounts for the fact that the spots are at a different temperature, but since we don\'t know the spot temperature, we can\'t compute the exact factor, so we have to assume that the effective temperature represents the temperature relevant for the Boltzmann equation. However, in reality, the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, not the local temperature where the spectral lines form. \n\nGiven that the problem states the photosphere is in LTE, and when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500K, I think we are to assume that the Ti atoms are in a photosphere with T=5500K, hence the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor at 5500K, and similarly 6000K when no spots. Thus, the factor is e^(ΔE/k (1/5500 - 1/6000)) ≈ 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let me just check if the energy difference calculation was correct. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 144.8 nm. The energy of a photon with that wavelength is E=hc/λ. Let\'s compute it in eV for better understanding.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.986e-25 J·m / λ in m) / 1.602e-19 J/eV.\n\nSo E = (1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7) / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.372e-18) / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV. That seems quite large for atomic energy levels; typical electronic transitions are a few eV. For example, hydrogen Lyman alpha is about 10.2 eV, which is in the far UV. But 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the ultraviolet, so 8.57 eV is reasonable. \n\nBut let\'s check: 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.56 eV. Yes, that\'s correct. So the energy difference is about 8.56 eV. \n\nBut Boltzmann\'s constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,340 K, which matches our previous calculation. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, using k in eV/K:\n\nΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99,340 K.\n\nThen the exponent is ΔE/k*(1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99,340*(1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 99,340*(0.0001818 - 0.0001667) ≈ 99,340*0.00001515 ≈ 1.505, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the factor is e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. \n\nThus, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is 4.5. \n\nI think this is the correct answer. The key steps are recognizing the use of the Boltzmann factor, computing the energy difference from the wavelength, and applying the temperatures. The fact that the star\'s effective temperature changes due to spots might imply a more complex averaging, but given the problem\'s phrasing and the mention of LTE in the photosphere, treating the entire photosphere as having the effective temperature (5500K with spots, 6000K without) is reasonable.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386783, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3586, prompt_tokens=2954, total_tokens=6540, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 2 to level 1) is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio decreases when the star has spots because the effective temperature (Teff) drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The factor by which this ratio changes is determined by the exponential dependence on temperature in the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{no spots}}}{(n_2/n_1)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

**Key steps:**
1. **Energy Difference (ΔE):** Calculated from the transition wavelength (1448 Å) using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \):
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(or } 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J)}
   \]

2. **Temperature Terms:** 
   - \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1} \)

3. **Exponent Calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99,370 \, \text{K}, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 1.505
   \]

4. **Final Factor:**
   \[
   \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5
   \]

**Answer:** The ratio decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots. Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is:

\boxed{4.5}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

01506 ≈ 1.5056

So exponent is 1.5056, e^1.5056 ≈ 4.51.

Alternatively, using a calculator for e^1.5056:

We can compute 1.5056 * ln(10) ≈ 1.5056 * 2.302585 ≈ 3.466. So e^1.5056 ≈ e^{3.466/2.302585} ≈ 10^{1.5056 / 2.302585} ≈ 10^{0.654} ≈ 10^0.654 ≈ 4.51 (since 10^0.65 ≈ 4.466, 10^0.654 ≈ 4.5). So yes, approximately 4.5.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5.

But let me check once again the question: "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots (T=5500K), the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when there are no spots (T=6000K). Therefore, the ratio without spots is higher by a factor of e^(ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)) ≈ 4.5. So the answer is 4.5, approximately.

But the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation. Let me check if I can get a more accurate value.

But if we are to take the problem at face value, it says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500K. So perhaps in this case, we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500K when spots are present, and 6000K when not. Then the ratio n2/n1 is simply given by the Boltzmann factor at each temperature. 

But the problem might be more complex. Let me think again.

If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, and 60% is at the original temperature of 6000K. Then the effective temperature is some average. But the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500K. However, the effective temperature is related to the total luminosity. The luminosity would be L = 0.6 * L1 + 0.4 * L2, where L1 is the luminosity from the unspotted region (Teff1=6000K) and L2 from the spotted region (Teff2=?).

But the problem gives the effective temperature when spots are present as 5500K. So using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when spots are present, the total luminosity would be L_spots = 4πR²σ(0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4), assuming that the spotted areas have temperature T2 and cover 40% of the surface. But the problem states that the effective temperature is 5500K, so:

4πR²σ(0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4) = 4πR²σTeff^4

Canceling terms:

0.6*T1^4 + 0.4*T2^4 = Teff^4

But the problem states that Teff becomes 5500K when 40% is covered by spots. However, T1 here is the unspotted temperature, which is 6000K. So:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T2^4 = (5500)^4

We can solve for T2, the temperature of the spots.

But this might be necessary if the problem expects us to consider that the spots have a different temperature, and the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions. However, the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere consists of two regions at different temperatures, then the total number ratio would be a weighted average of the two ratios (weighted by their respective areas). 

But the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms... astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots". So the observed ratio is a combination of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. If the spotted regions are cooler, their n2/n1 ratio is lower, and the unspotted regions have a higher ratio. The combined ratio would be somewhere in between. However, the problem states that the overall ratio decreases, which makes sense if the cooler regions contribute a lower ratio, pulling the average down.

But this complicates the calculation because we need to find the average ratio over the two regions. However, the problem might be simplifying this by assuming that when the star has spots, the entire photosphere is at 5500K, hence the ratio is just the Boltzmann factor at 5500K. Similarly, when there are no spots, the ratio is at 6000K. Then the factor would be as calculated before, e^(ΔE/k (1/5500 - 1/6000)), but actually, wait:

Wait, the ratio when no spots is at 6000K, and with spots it's at 5500K. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K = exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. 

However, if instead, the ratio is a weighted average of the spotted and unspotted regions, then we need to compute:

(n2/n1)_avg = [0.6*(n2/n1)_hot + 0.4*(n2/n1)_cool] / [0.6 + 0.4]

But since n2/n1 depends exponentially on temperature, and the cool spots have a much lower ratio, the average would be dominated more by the cooler spots if their emission is significantly different.

But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. If the spots are part of the photosphere, then the Ti ionization/excitation would be according to their local temperatures. However, when we observe the star, the light we receive is a combination of the bright regions (6000K) and the dark spots (cooler, say T_spot). The equivalent width of the absorption lines would be affected by the varying temperatures. However, the ratio of populations in two energy levels would require knowing the contribution from each region. 

But the problem mentions that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. If the spots are cooler, then in those regions, the ratio n2/n1 is lower. The unspotted regions still have the higher ratio. However, the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average. The flux from each region depends on their surface area and their specific intensity. 

But this is getting complicated. The problem might be intending us to ignore the spatial variation and just consider the effective temperature change, assuming that the entire photosphere is at the lower temperature when spots are present. Otherwise, the problem would need to provide the temperature of the spots. But since it doesn't, and just says the effective temperature is 5500K when 40% is covered by spots, maybe we are to proceed with the initial approach where the entire photosphere is treated as 5500K.

Alternatively, maybe the problem accounts for the fact that the spots are at a different temperature, but since we don't know the spot temperature, we can't compute the exact factor, so we have to assume that the effective temperature represents the temperature relevant for the Boltzmann equation. However, in reality, the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, not the local temperature where the spectral lines form. 

Given that the problem states the photosphere is in LTE, and when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500K, I think we are to assume that the Ti atoms are in a photosphere with T=5500K, hence the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor at 5500K, and similarly 6000K when no spots. Thus, the factor is e^(ΔE/k (1/5500 - 1/6000)) ≈ 4.5.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let me just check if the energy difference calculation was correct. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 144.8 nm. The energy of a photon with that wavelength is E=hc/λ. Let's compute it in eV for better understanding.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.986e-25 J·m / λ in m) / 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So E = (1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7) / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.372e-18) / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV. That seems quite large for atomic energy levels; typical electronic transitions are a few eV. For example, hydrogen Lyman alpha is about 10.2 eV, which is in the far UV. But 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the ultraviolet, so 8.57 eV is reasonable. 

But let's check: 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.56 eV. Yes, that's correct. So the energy difference is about 8.56 eV. 

But Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,340 K, which matches our previous calculation. So that's correct.

Therefore, using k in eV/K:

ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99,340 K.

Then the exponent is ΔE/k*(1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99,340*(1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 99,340*(0.0001818 - 0.0001667) ≈ 99,340*0.00001515 ≈ 1.505, same as before.

Therefore, the factor is e^1.505 ≈ 4.5. 

Thus, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is 4.5. 

I think this is the correct answer. The key steps are recognizing the use of the Boltzmann factor, computing the energy difference from the wavelength, and applying the temperatures. The fact that the star's effective temperature changes due to spots might imply a more complex averaging, but given the problem's phrasing and the mention of LTE in the photosphere, treating the entire photosphere as having the effective temperature (5500K with spots, 6000K without) is reasonable.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Boltzmann Equation:**  
   The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\Delta E / kT}
   \]
   Since \(g_2/g_1\) cancels when taking the ratio of two scenarios, the factor depends on the exponential term.

2. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   Using the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Convert to thermal units:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,370 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Temperature Difference Factor:**  
   Compute \(1/T_{\text{spots}} - 1/T_{\text{no spots}}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
   \]

4. **Exponential Factor:**  
   Multiply by \(\Delta E/k\):
   \[
   99,370 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5056
   \]
   Exponentiate:
   \[
   e^{1.5056} \approx 4.51
   \]

**Conclusion:**  
The ratio of Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is **4.5 times higher** when the star has no spots compared to when 40% of its surface is covered by spots.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we use the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

**Step 1: Energy Difference Calculation**
The transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

**Step 2: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)**
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99,370 \, \text{K}
\]

**Step 3: Temperature Effect on Ratio**
The ratio change factor between temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left[\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) \right]
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,370 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) \approx \exp(1.5056) \approx 4.51
\]

**Conclusion**
The ratio of titanium atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]

---

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning
