To resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), their energy difference must exceed the sum of their natural linewidths. The linewidth \( \Gamma \) for each state is given by the energy-time uncertainty principle:  
\[
\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]
where \( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).  

**Calculations:**  
1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):  
\[
\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]  
2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):  
\[
\Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]  

**Total linewidth (sum):**  
\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]  

**Convert to electronvolts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):**  
\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]  

**Conclusion:**  
The energy difference must exceed \( \sim 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \) to resolve the states. A value **greater than this threshold** (e.g., \( 1 \, \mu\text{eV} \)) would suffice.  

**Answer:** \(\boxed{1 \, \mu\text{eV}}\)

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy difference between two quantum states that have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly resolve the two energy levels. Hmm, right. I remember that the lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty in its energy. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, maybe? Let me think. 

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is on the order of Planck's constant divided by 2π. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, actually, the exact relation is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. That makes sense because if a state exists for a shorter time (smaller Δt), its energy is less well-defined (larger ΔE), leading to a broader linewidth.

So each energy level isn't perfectly sharp; instead, they have a natural linewidth due to their finite lifetimes. To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, right? Otherwise, the two peaks would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

Let me write that down. The energy difference ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, which are ΔE1 and ΔE2. So:

ΔE_total > ΔE1 + ΔE2

But how do I calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2? Since ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime. Wait, actually, the uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So solving for ΔE gives ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). But I think in practice, the linewidth is often approximated as Γ = ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. Hmm, maybe different conventions here. Let me check.

In spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ, so Γ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Lorentzian profile. The relation between Γ and τ is Γ = ħ / τ. But wait, actually, Planck's constant h is 2πħ, so maybe Γ = (1/(2πτ)) * h? Wait, no. Let me recall.

The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. If the lifetime is τ, then Δt is approximately τ, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). But the natural linewidth Γ is actually 2ΔE, so Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Let me confirm this.

Yes, the natural linewidth Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Because the uncertainty in energy is Γ/2π? Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let's get precise.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time is:

ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2

But the lifetime τ is related to the decay rate Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, that's another relation. So Γ is the decay rate, which is the inverse of the lifetime multiplied by ħ. Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact definitions.

Alternatively, the natural linewidth Γ is given by the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ΔE. Then using the uncertainty principle, Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So if the lifetime is τ, then the energy uncertainty is Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, each energy level has an uncertainty of Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

Therefore, the total linewidth that we need to consider for distinguishing the two energy levels would be the sum of their individual linewidths. So the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than the sum of Γ1 and Γ2. So:

|E2 - E1| > Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)

But wait, is it the sum or the quadrature sum? Hmm, in uncertainty principles, sometimes you add uncertainties in quadrature, but in this case, since the linewidths are independent, I think they just add up. Because each energy level's uncertainty contributes to the width of the spectral line, and if the peaks are separated by more than the sum of their widths, then they can be resolved. So yes, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual linewidths.

So first, let's compute Γ1 and Γ2.

Given τ1 = 10^-9 s, τ2 = 10^-8 s.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1

Γ2 = ħ / τ2

Therefore, Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/10^-9 + 1/10^-8) = ħ (10^9 + 10^8) = ħ * 11 * 10^8 s^-1

But let's compute this value. First, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1e9 + 1e8) s^-1

= 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9

= 1.16e-25 J

But energy is often expressed in electronvolts (eV). Let me convert that.

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J

So Γ1 + Γ2 in eV is:

1.16e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV

So approximately 0.724 microelectronvolts (μeV)

Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be clearly resolved.

Now, let's look at the options provided. Wait, the problem didn't list the options, but the user is asking "which one of the following options could be their energy difference". But since the user hasn't provided the options, maybe I need to infer based on standard choices or perhaps the calculation.

But since the user is part of a system where the original question had options, but in the current prompt, they are not shown. Hmm. Wait, looking back at the original problem statement:

"Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

But the user hasn't provided the options here. Maybe in the original context, the options were present, but in the current prompt, they are missing. Since I don't have the options, I need to proceed with the calculation and suggest possible energy differences.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a formulaic answer. Let's see.

But given that the energy difference needs to be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV, so any energy difference larger than that would work. So if the options are in the order of microelectronvolts, then the answer should be an option greater than ~0.7 μeV.

But perhaps the calculation is different. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach. The energy uncertainty is given by the linewidth, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So for each state, the linewidth is Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth is the sum of these two (since the transitions from each state contribute to the broadening), so the minimum energy difference to resolve them is when the separation is greater than the sum of the linewidths.

But let's compute Γ1 and Γ2 separately.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J

Wait, hold on. That can't be. If τ1 is smaller (10^-9 s) than τ2 (10^-8 s), then Γ1 should be larger than Γ2. But above, Γ1 is 1.05e-25 J, Γ2 is 1.05e-26 J. So sum is 1.155e-25 J, which as before converts to ~0.724 μeV.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different convention. For example, sometimes the linewidth is given as Γ = ħ / τ, but other times people use ΔE = Γ = ħ / (2τ) or similar. Let me check the exact relation.

In the context of the natural linewidth, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Because the decay rate Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = 1/τ (in angular frequency units), so multiplying by ħ gives the energy uncertainty: ΔE = ħΓ = ħ / τ. So yes, Γ (the linewidth) is ħ / τ. Therefore, the previous calculation is correct.

Therefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So if the options are, say, 1 μeV, 0.1 μeV, 0.01 μeV, then 1 μeV would be sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the energy difference to be on the order of ħ divided by the average lifetime or something else. But according to the uncertainty principle and natural linewidth reasoning, the sum of the individual linewidths is the key factor.

Alternatively, sometimes in spectroscopy, the resolving power is determined by the Fourier limit, which states that the minimum resolvable frequency difference is approximately 1/(πτ), where τ is the coherence time. But in this case, each state has its own coherence time. Hmm.

Wait, another way: the frequency uncertainty is Δf = 1/(2πτ), so the energy uncertainty is ΔE = hΔf = h/(2πτ) = ħ / τ. Which is the same as before. So yes, that matches. So the energy uncertainty is ħ / τ for each state, so sum is ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). So energy difference must be greater than that.

Therefore, the answer is that the energy difference should be greater than ħ(1/10^-9 + 1/10^-8) = ħ(1e9 + 1e8) = 1.1e9 * ħ.

Calculating that:

1.1e9 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * s^-1 = 1.16e-25 J, which is 0.724 μeV as before.

Therefore, any energy difference larger than approximately 0.724 μeV would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved. So if the options include a value like 1 μeV, that would work. If the options are in different units, like milli-eV or nano-eV, need to adjust accordingly.

But since the problem is multiple-choice and the user hasn't provided the options, but given the calculation, the minimum energy difference required is about 0.7 μeV. Therefore, the correct answer should be an energy difference larger than that. So, for example, if the options are:

A) 0.1 μeV

B) 0.5 μeV

C) 1 μeV

D) 10 μeV

Then the answer would be C or D.

Alternatively, maybe the question considers the energy difference to be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. But that would be incorrect, because both contribute to the total linewidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the case where the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty in the measurement due to each state's lifetime. Since the two states have different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties are different, so the total uncertainty when measuring the energy difference would be the square root of the sum of the squares? Wait, but in terms of linewidths, which add directly.

Wait, if you have two Lorentzian peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2, the separation between them needs to be larger than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 to be resolved by the Rayleigh criterion. Wait, the Rayleigh criterion in optics states that two peaks are resolved if the separation is greater than the width of each peak. But if the peaks have different widths, then I think the criterion would be that the separation is greater than the sum of the half-widths? Hmm, maybe not. Let me recall.

In the Rayleigh criterion, for two peaks of equal width, the separation needs to be at least equal to the width (FWHM) of one peak. Then the combined intensity profile has a dip of about 20% between the peaks, which is considered resolved.

But if the peaks have different widths, then the required separation would be more complicated. However, in this case, since we are dealing with energy levels, perhaps the key is that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual linewidths to ensure that the peaks don't overlap significantly.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the energy-time uncertainty principle where ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy difference, and Δt is the minimum of the two lifetimes? That seems less likely.

Wait, another approach: the transition frequency between the two states is (E2 - E1)/ħ. The uncertainty in this frequency would be related to the lifetimes of both states. The frequency uncertainty Δω is given by 1/τ1 + 1/τ2, so Δω = 1/τ1 + 1/τ2. Then the energy uncertainty would be ΔE = ħΔω = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2), which is the same as before. Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than this uncertainty to be resolvable.

So, regardless of the approach, we end up with the same result: the energy difference must be greater than ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the correct answer is the energy difference that is larger than approximately 0.724 μeV. If the options given are in that range, then that's the one to choose.

Since I don't have the actual options, but based on standard multiple-choice questions, common choices might be in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-5 eV. For example, 1 μeV, 10 μeV, 0.1 μeV, etc. Given our calculation, 1 μeV is sufficient, 0.1 μeV is insufficient. So the answer should be 1 μeV or higher.

Alternatively, if the options are given in terms of ħ/(10^-9) or similar, but that's less common. In real exams, energy differences for such lifetimes are typically in the μeV range. For example, τ = 1e-9 s gives Γ = ħ / τ ≈ 1e-25 J ≈ 0.6 μeV. So τ = 1e-8 s gives Γ ≈ 0.06 μeV. So sum is ~0.66 μeV. Therefore, 1 μeV is safe.

Thus, the answer is likely 1 μeV or similar. So the box should be around that value.

I need to determine the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds that would allow us to clearly resolve the two energy levels. I recall that a state's lifetime relates to its energy uncertainty through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, meaning energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to a state's lifetime. This makes sense because shorter-lived states (smaller Δt) have less well-defined energies (larger ΔE), resulting in broader linewidths.

Energy levels aren't perfectly sharp but have natural linewidths due to their finite lifetimes. To properly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference needs to exceed the sum of their individual uncertainties; otherwise, the peaks would overlap and become indistinguishable.

This means the total energy difference ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

To calculate these uncertainties, I need to relate them to the lifetimes. While the uncertainty principle gives ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt), in spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is typically expressed as Γ = ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime and Γ represents the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Lorentzian profile.

From the energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2), if the lifetime is τ, then Δt is approximately τ, making ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Since the natural linewidth Γ equals 2ΔE, we get Γ ≈ ħ/τ.

Therefore, each energy level has an uncertainty of Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2. The total linewidth we need to consider for distinguishing the two energy levels would be the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Alright, I need to calculate the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The issue is determining which energy difference allows for a clear distinction between these energy levels. I recall the relationship between state lifetime and energy uncertainty is explained by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the product of energy uncertainty and time uncertainty is roughly equal to Planck's constant divided by 2π: ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. In fact, the principle states ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, meaning energy uncertainty is inversely related to the state's lifetime. This makes sense because shorter-lived states (smaller Δt) have less precisely defined energies (larger ΔE), resulting in a broader linewidth.

Each energy level is not sharply defined but has a natural linewidth due to its finite lifetime. To distinguish two energy levels, their energy difference must exceed the sum of their uncertainties; otherwise, the peaks would overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Here's the equation: The energy difference ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

How to calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2? Since ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt) with Δt as the level's lifetime, but often ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Solving for ΔE gives ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). Nevertheless, in practice, the linewidth is often considered as Γ = ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. There might be different conventions.

In spectroscopy, Γ is the natural linewidth and corresponds to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a Lorentzian profile, given by Γ = ħ / τ. However, remember that Planck's constant is 2πħ, so one might think Γ = (1/(2πτ)) * h, but that's incorrect. 

The energy-time uncertainty principle states ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. If the lifetime is τ, then Δt is approximately τ, leading to ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). The natural linewidth Γ is actually 2ΔE, so Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Upon checking, Γ is related to τ by Γ = ħ / τ, meaning each level's uncertainty is Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

Therefore, the total linewidth needed to distinguish the two energy levels is the sum of their individual linewidths, allowing us to clearly resolve them.

Wait, maybe not. The convolution would be if there is a broadening mechanism. Alternatively, if each energy level has its own Lorentzian profile, then the total profile would be the sum of two Lorentzians separated by ΔE and with widths Γ1 and Γ2. In that case, the criterion for resolution would be that the separation ΔE is greater than the widths of the individual peaks.\n\nBut actually, when you measure the transition between two energy levels, the linewidth is determined by the sum of the widths of the two levels. Because the transition linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Wait, yes! Because the upper state has a lifetime τ1 and the lower state has a lifetime τ2. The total linewidth of the transition is Γ1 + Γ2. Because the uncertainty in the transition energy is the sum of the uncertainties in each energy level. Therefore, if you have a transition between two states with energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the total uncertainty in the transition energy is ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, the linewidth of the transition is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than this total linewidth Γ.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference ΔE should satisfy:\n\nΔE > Γ = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)\n\nSo, substituting τ1 = 10^-9 s and τ2 = 10^-8 s.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute 1/τ1 + 1/τ2.\n\n1/10^-9 = 10^9 s^-1\n\n1/10^-8 = 10^8 s^-1\n\nTherefore, 1/τ1 + 1/τ2 = 10^9 + 10^8 = 1.1 * 10^9 s^-1\n\nThen Γ = ħ * 1.1 * 10^9 s^-1\n\nWe know that ħ = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s\n\nTherefore, Γ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 ≈ 1.16e-25 J\n\nBut the question asks for the energy difference. So 1.16e-25 J. But energy differences are often expressed in electronvolts (eV). Let\'s convert that.\n\n1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J\n\nTherefore, Γ ≈ 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be resolvable.\n\nBut let\'s check the calculation again step by step to make sure.\n\nFirst, Γ1 = ħ / τ1\n\nΓ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nTherefore, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J, which matches the previous result.\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n1 J = 1 / 1.602e-19 eV\n\nTherefore, 1.16e-25 J = 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV\n\nSo the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So any energy difference larger than this would be resolvable. The question is asking "which one of the following options could be their energy difference", but since the options aren\'t provided here, I need to see if my calculated value makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that Γ_total is Γ1 + Γ2. Let me think again. If you have two energy levels each with a certain linewidth, then the transition between them would have a linewidth of Γ1 + Γ2. But if we\'re just considering the energy levels themselves, not a transition, then perhaps the linewidths are separate. But in order to resolve the two energy levels, their individual linewidths must not overlap. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their linewidths. For example, if each energy level is broadened by Γ1 and Γ2, then the total broadening is Γ1 + Γ2, so the peaks are separated by ΔE, and to resolve them, ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Hmm, no, the standard Rayleigh criterion for resolution in spectroscopy is that the separation is greater than the FWHM. But if each peak has a FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2, then the required separation would be at least the average of the two? Or the maximum?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the convolution of two Lorentzians. If you have two Lorentzian peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2 separated by ΔE, the criterion for resolution might be similar to the Rayleigh criterion but adjusted for Lorentzians. However, Lorentzians have broader tails than Gaussians, so the standard Rayleigh criterion (which is for diffraction-limited spots, i.e., Airy disks which are similar to sinc functions) might not apply directly. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is that the observed linewidth when measuring the two energy levels would be the sum of their individual linewidths. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be greater than this total linewidth. So, ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2. That seems to be the case here. Therefore, the minimum energy difference required is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nBut let\'s see, the problem is asking "which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" Since the options aren\'t given, but the user is probably expecting me to compute the minimum energy difference required, which is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than this value. So possible options could be on the order of 1 μeV or higher. If the options are given in eV, then 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be a candidate. But since the user hasn\'t provided the options, I can only compute the required value.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if my approach is correct. Let me think again. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle gives the natural linewidth. Each energy level\'s width is Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the two energy levels have widths Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Therefore, the total width when considering both would be Γ1 + Γ2. Hence, the energy difference must be larger than this sum to be resolvable. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nYes, this seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, calculating Γ1 + Γ2 gives the minimum energy difference needed. So converting this into eV gives approximately 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than ~0.7 μeV. So if the options include something like 1 μeV, that would work. If the options are much larger, like 1 meV (which is 1000 μeV), that would also work. But since the problem states "could be their energy difference", any value larger than 0.724 μeV is acceptable. However, since the user hasn\'t provided the options, I can only present the calculated value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s another approach. Sometimes, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). In that case, Γ1 = ħ/(2τ1) and Γ2 = ħ/(2τ2). Then the sum would be Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * (1.1e9) ≈ 5.8e-26 J, which is about 0.362 μeV. Then the energy difference should be greater than 0.36 μeV. But this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, the natural linewidth Γ is actually given by Γ = ħ / τ, not Γ = ħ/(2τ). Let me check a reference. The natural linewidth is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Because the decay rate Γ is equal to 1/τ (in angular frequency units), and since E = ħω, then Γ (in energy units) is ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct. Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than approximately 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the answer should be an energy difference greater than this value. If the options given are, say, 1 μeV, 0.5 μeV, 0.1 meV, etc., then 1 μeV would be the correct choice. Since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but given that this is a multiple-choice question and the user is expecting me to provide the answer in a box, perhaps the answer is 1 × 10^-6 eV, which is 1 μeV. But according to the calculation, even 0.724 μeV is the minimum, so any value above that is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where Δt is the difference in lifetimes? Wait, no, the lifetimes are for each state. The energy difference\'s uncertainty is related to the combination of both lifetimes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the Fourier transform limit. The energy uncertainty is related to the coherence time. But I think the correct approach is what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, some sources define the linewidth as Γ = 2πħ / τ, but that would be if Γ is in angular frequency units. Let me check. The relation between the lifetime τ and the angular frequency linewidth Δω is Δω = 1/τ (for exponential decay). Then, since E = ħω, ΔE = ħ Δω = ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ΔE = ħ / τ. So that\'s correct. So Γ is in energy units here.\n\nTherefore, Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the minimum energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nSo if the options are:\n\nA) 1e-7 eV\n\nB) 1e-6 eV\n\nC) 1e-5 eV\n\nD) 1e-4 eV\n\nThen B) 1 μeV would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are in Joules, then 1.16e-25 J. But the question says "energy difference", which is commonly expressed in eV in quantum contexts. So probably the answer is 1e-6 eV or similar.\n\nBut since the user hasn\'t given the options, I need to present the calculated value. So approximately 0.7 μeV. But let\'s compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate Γ1 + Γ2 again:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nSum Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J\n\nSo 1.16e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. Since the problem is multiple-choice, the closest higher value would be the answer. If given options are 0.1 μeV, 1 μeV, 10 μeV, 100 μeV, then 1 μeV is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are in terms of Joules, then 1.16e-25 J. But since the user mentions "energy difference" in a quantum context, eV is more likely. So I think the answer is approximately 1 μeV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) of each state is given by \(\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\), where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant and \(\tau\) is the lifetime.

1. Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state:
   - For the first state with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - For the second state with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. Sum the energy uncertainties to find the total linewidth:
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} + 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. Convert the total linewidth to electronvolts (eV):
   \[
   1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
   \]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than this total linewidth. The closest higher value typically considered is \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) (1 \(\mu\text{eV}\)).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

uncertainties? Wait, but when two Lorentzian peaks are overlapping, the criterion for resolving them is that the separation between the peaks should be greater than the sum of their FWHM. Or is it the square root of the sum of squares? Or maybe the maximum of the two?

Wait, in optics, the Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the sum of their FWHM. But I'm not sure if that's the same here. Alternatively, the criterion might be that the energy difference is larger than the linewidths. But if each energy level has a linewidth Γ1 and Γ2, then the combined linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2, so the energy difference should be greater than this sum to be resolvable.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the full width at half maximum of each. If the energy levels are separated by more than their linewidths, then they can be resolved. For example, if each line has a width Γ, then the separation should be greater than Γ. But in this case, the two energy levels have different lifetimes, so their linewidths are different. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths. Let me check.

Suppose Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then the total linewidth might be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2. Alternatively, maybe the average or something else. Wait, but I need to recall the exact criterion.

In spectroscopy, the resolution criterion often used is the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two peaks are resolvable if the peak separation is at least equal to the FWHM of the peaks. However, if the peaks have different widths, then the required separation would be the average or the sum? Let me check.

Suppose two peaks with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2. The Rayleigh criterion in terms of wavelength is that the separation is greater than the FWHM. But if the two peaks have different widths, the criterion is modified. One possible approach is that the separation should be greater than the average of the two FWHM. Another is that it should be greater than the sum. Alternatively, the resolution is determined by the broader of the two widths. But I think in the case of different linewidths, the standard approach is to take the sum, but I might need to confirm.

Alternatively, the resolving power is determined by the minimum of the two, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the formula for the resolution of two Lorentzian profiles with different widths. Wait, but since I can't actually look things up right now, I need to recall.

Alternatively, think of it as the convolution of two Lorentzians. If you have two Lorentzian peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2, the convolution would result in a Lorentzian with width Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, if the separation between the peaks is greater than Γ1 + Γ2, then they can be resolved. Hmm, but actually, the convolution is the lineshape when you have both transitions happening? Wait, maybe not. The convolution would be if there is a broadening mechanism. Alternatively, if each energy level has its own Lorentzian profile, then the total profile would be the sum of two Lorentzians separated by ΔE and with widths Γ1 and Γ2. In that case, the criterion for resolution would be that the separation ΔE is greater than the widths of the individual peaks.

But actually, when you measure the transition between two energy levels, the linewidth is determined by the sum of the widths of the two levels. Because the transition linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Wait, yes! Because the upper state has a lifetime τ1 and the lower state has a lifetime τ2. The total linewidth of the transition is Γ1 + Γ2. Because the uncertainty in the transition energy is the sum of the uncertainties in each energy level. Therefore, if you have a transition between two states with energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the total uncertainty in the transition energy is ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, the linewidth of the transition is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than this total linewidth Γ.

Therefore, the energy difference ΔE should satisfy:

ΔE > Γ = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)

So, substituting τ1 = 10^-9 s and τ2 = 10^-8 s.

First, let's compute 1/τ1 + 1/τ2.

1/10^-9 = 10^9 s^-1

1/10^-8 = 10^8 s^-1

Therefore, 1/τ1 + 1/τ2 = 10^9 + 10^8 = 1.1 * 10^9 s^-1

Then Γ = ħ * 1.1 * 10^9 s^-1

We know that ħ = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s

Therefore, Γ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 ≈ 1.16e-25 J

But the question asks for the energy difference. So 1.16e-25 J. But energy differences are often expressed in electronvolts (eV). Let's convert that.

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J

Therefore, Γ ≈ 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be resolvable.

But let's check the calculation again step by step to make sure.

First, Γ1 = ħ / τ1

Γ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Therefore, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J, which matches the previous result.

Convert to eV:

1 J = 1 / 1.602e-19 eV

Therefore, 1.16e-25 J = 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So any energy difference larger than this would be resolvable. The question is asking "which one of the following options could be their energy difference", but since the options aren't provided here, I need to see if my calculated value makes sense.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that Γ_total is Γ1 + Γ2. Let me think again. If you have two energy levels each with a certain linewidth, then the transition between them would have a linewidth of Γ1 + Γ2. But if we're just considering the energy levels themselves, not a transition, then perhaps the linewidths are separate. But in order to resolve the two energy levels, their individual linewidths must not overlap. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their linewidths. For example, if each energy level is broadened by Γ1 and Γ2, then the total broadening is Γ1 + Γ2, so the peaks are separated by ΔE, and to resolve them, ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Hmm, no, the standard Rayleigh criterion for resolution in spectroscopy is that the separation is greater than the FWHM. But if each peak has a FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2, then the required separation would be at least the average of the two? Or the maximum?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the convolution of two Lorentzians. If you have two Lorentzian peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2 separated by ΔE, the criterion for resolution might be similar to the Rayleigh criterion but adjusted for Lorentzians. However, Lorentzians have broader tails than Gaussians, so the standard Rayleigh criterion (which is for diffraction-limited spots, i.e., Airy disks which are similar to sinc functions) might not apply directly. 

Alternatively, another approach is that the observed linewidth when measuring the two energy levels would be the sum of their individual linewidths. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be greater than this total linewidth. So, ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2. That seems to be the case here. Therefore, the minimum energy difference required is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.

But let's see, the problem is asking "which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" Since the options aren't given, but the user is probably expecting me to compute the minimum energy difference required, which is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than this value. So possible options could be on the order of 1 μeV or higher. If the options are given in eV, then 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be a candidate. But since the user hasn't provided the options, I can only compute the required value.

Wait, but maybe I should check if my approach is correct. Let me think again. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle gives the natural linewidth. Each energy level's width is Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the two energy levels have widths Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Therefore, the total width when considering both would be Γ1 + Γ2. Hence, the energy difference must be larger than this sum to be resolvable. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Yes, this seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, calculating Γ1 + Γ2 gives the minimum energy difference needed. So converting this into eV gives approximately 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than ~0.7 μeV. So if the options include something like 1 μeV, that would work. If the options are much larger, like 1 meV (which is 1000 μeV), that would also work. But since the problem states "could be their energy difference", any value larger than 0.724 μeV is acceptable. However, since the user hasn't provided the options, I can only present the calculated value.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Sometimes, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). In that case, Γ1 = ħ/(2τ1) and Γ2 = ħ/(2τ2). Then the sum would be Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * (1.1e9) ≈ 5.8e-26 J, which is about 0.362 μeV. Then the energy difference should be greater than 0.36 μeV. But this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, the natural linewidth Γ is actually given by Γ = ħ / τ, not Γ = ħ/(2τ). Let me check a reference. The natural linewidth is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Because the decay rate Γ is equal to 1/τ (in angular frequency units), and since E = ħω, then Γ (in energy units) is ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct. Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than approximately 0.724 μeV. Therefore, the answer should be an energy difference greater than this value. If the options given are, say, 1 μeV, 0.5 μeV, 0.1 meV, etc., then 1 μeV would be the correct choice. Since the user hasn't provided the options, but given that this is a multiple-choice question and the user is expecting me to provide the answer in a box, perhaps the answer is 1 × 10^-6 eV, which is 1 μeV. But according to the calculation, even 0.724 μeV is the minimum, so any value above that is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where Δt is the difference in lifetimes? Wait, no, the lifetimes are for each state. The energy difference's uncertainty is related to the combination of both lifetimes.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the Fourier transform limit. The energy uncertainty is related to the coherence time. But I think the correct approach is what I did before.

Alternatively, some sources define the linewidth as Γ = 2πħ / τ, but that would be if Γ is in angular frequency units. Let me check. The relation between the lifetime τ and the angular frequency linewidth Δω is Δω = 1/τ (for exponential decay). Then, since E = ħω, ΔE = ħ Δω = ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ΔE = ħ / τ. So that's correct. So Γ is in energy units here.

Therefore, Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the minimum energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.

So if the options are:

A) 1e-7 eV

B) 1e-6 eV

C) 1e-5 eV

D) 1e-4 eV

Then B) 1 μeV would be the answer.

Alternatively, if the options are in Joules, then 1.16e-25 J. But the question says "energy difference", which is commonly expressed in eV in quantum contexts. So probably the answer is 1e-6 eV or similar.

But since the user hasn't given the options, I need to present the calculated value. So approximately 0.7 μeV. But let's compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate Γ1 + Γ2 again:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J

Sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J

Convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J

So 1.16e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. Since the problem is multiple-choice, the closest higher value would be the answer. If given options are 0.1 μeV, 1 μeV, 10 μeV, 100 μeV, then 1 μeV is the answer.

Alternatively, if the options are in terms of Joules, then 1.16e-25 J. But since the user mentions "energy difference" in a quantum context, eV is more likely. So I think the answer is approximately 1 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be at least about 1 μeV to resolve the two levels.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two levels.

Alternatively, sometimes the criterion is that the separation should be greater than the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each peak. But to be safe, we can use the sum of their linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) as the minimum energy difference needed.\n\nLet me check that. Suppose each energy level has a linewidth Γ, then the peaks are considered resolvable if their separation is greater than Γ1 + Γ2. Alternatively, the Rayleigh criterion in optics states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is at least equal to the FWHM of one peak. But since both peaks have different linewidths here, maybe the sum is needed. However, perhaps the correct approach is to take the sum of their uncertainties. Let me think again.\n\nIf the energy difference is ΔE, and each energy level has an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the total uncertainty would be ΔE1 + ΔE2, so ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 would be needed to resolve them. So applying that.\n\nBut according to the Heisenberg principle, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9), and for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Then the total required energy difference would be ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/2 (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ/2 (1.1e9). Wait, but 1e9 + 1e8 is 1.1e9, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake here. 10^-9 s is a shorter lifetime, so the uncertainty is larger. Wait, 1/1e-9 is 1e9, and 1/1e-8 is 1e8, so yes, the first state has a larger ΔE.\n\nBut maybe the linewidth Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ, so Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then the total linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Wait, I\'m getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn spectroscopy, the natural linewidth (FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. So each energy level\'s linewidth is Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth when considering both transitions would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2. So to resolve the two peaks, the energy difference between them must be larger than Γ_total. Alternatively, according to the Rayleigh criterion, the separation should be at least equal to the linewidth. But if each peak has a linewidth Γ1 and Γ2, then the separation should be at least the average of the two linewidths? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each peak and ensure that their separation is larger than the sum of their FWHM divided by 2. Wait, let me recall the Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines. In optics, the Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are resolvable if the peak of one coincides with the first minimum of the other. For Gaussian profiles, this corresponds to a separation of about the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles (which is the case here for natural linewidth), the situation is different because Lorentzians have broader tails. However, perhaps the same general idea applies: the separation should be greater than the sum of the FWHM of each line.\n\nWait, no. For two Lorentzian peaks with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2, the combined line profile would be a convolution. But to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the average of their linewidths. Alternatively, a common rule of thumb is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. Let me check a reference.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s think in terms of energy-time uncertainty. The energy uncertainty of each state is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties: ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, to resolve the energy levels, the actual energy difference should be greater than this total uncertainty. So, the minimum energy difference required would be ΔE_min = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).\n\nAlternatively, if each energy level\'s width is Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2, then the total linewidth when considering both would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy separation should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Or greater than Γ1 + Γ2?\n\nHmm. Let me think again. If each energy level has a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2, the convolution of these would result in a line shape with FWHM Γ1 + Γ2. Wait, no, the convolution of two Lorentzians is a Lorentzian whose FWHM is the sum of the individual FWHM. So if you\'re measuring the transition between these two states, the linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. But in this case, we are considering two separate energy levels, each with their own linewidth. If the energy levels are separated by an energy ΔE, then the observed lines would each have widths Γ1 and Γ2. To resolve them, the separation ΔE must be greater than the sum of their FWHM divided by 2, maybe? Or is it the sum of the FWHM?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But since the uncertainties add in quadrature? Wait, the uncertainties in energy for each state are independent, so the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But I\'m not sure if that\'s the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual linewidths. For example, if each line has a width of Γ1 and Γ2, then their separation should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to avoid overlap. Let me think of two peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2. If they are separated by more than Γ1 + Γ2, then there\'s a valley between them, making them distinguishable. If they are separated by less than that, they start to overlap significantly.\n\nAlternatively, using the Rayleigh criterion for two peaks: the separation should be at least equal to the FWHM of one of the peaks. But since the peaks have different FWHM, maybe the average or the sum. However, in practice, the more conservative approach is to require the separation to be greater than the sum of the linewidths. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s look at the formula. The natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So for the first state, Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. To convert these to energy differences, we can write them in eV. Since 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, Γ1 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. Therefore, Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. But wait, looking at the answer options, which are not provided, but the user says "which one of the following options could be their energy difference...". Since the options are not here, but perhaps the original question had specific numbers, but in the current prompt, the user hasn\'t provided them. Wait, no, the user has given the lifetimes and asks for the energy difference that can be clearly resolved, and the options are not here. Wait, the problem statement says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" but the options are not included here. However, since the user wants me to provide a thought process leading to the answer, perhaps I need to compute the minimal energy difference required and see which option is above that.\n\nBut since the options are not given, maybe the answer is supposed to be calculated as the sum of the energy uncertainties, so ΔE >= Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2.\n\nBut let\'s compute that. Let me compute Γ1 and Γ2.\n\nFirst, calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.\n\nτ1 = 1e-9 s, so Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nSo Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J.\n\nConvert that to electron volts (1 J = 6.242e18 eV):\n\n1.16e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 microelectronvolts (μeV). So any energy difference larger than this would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved. If the options given are in the order of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) or higher, then that would work. If there are options like 1e-7 eV, that would be too small.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference. The energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in this difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. So ΔE_diff = sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ). Wait, but Γ is already the FWHM, which is 2ΔE (since ΔE is the standard deviation, but for a Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2ΔE). Wait, actually, the Heisenberg uncertainty gives ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. The FWHM Γ is related to ΔE as Γ = 2ΔE. So Γ = 2ΔE = ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ. So the FWHM is Γ, so each energy level has a linewidth Γ. Therefore, the uncertainty in energy for each state is Γ/2. Therefore, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ) = (1/2) sqrt(Γ1^2 + Γ2^2 ). Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this uncertainty to be resolvable. But this is a different approach. Let\'s compute this.\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1.05e-25 J, which is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nΓ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.05e-26 J, which is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo Γ1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nUncertainty in energy difference: sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15 ) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 1.04e-6 eV. Wait, that gives around 1.04e-6 eV, which is approximately 1 μeV. But this contradicts the previous sum of Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV (0.724 μeV). So which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the FWHM of each line. Since each line has a width Γ1 and Γ2, then to resolve two peaks, their separation should be greater than the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2. But since Γ1 is larger (6.58e-7 eV) than Γ2 (6.58e-8 eV), then the separation should be greater than Γ1. But this seems less strict than the sum.\n\nBut in practice, when two spectral lines have different widths, the resolving power required would depend on their separation relative to their linewidths. However, the standard approach for resolution is that two peaks are considered resolved if their separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Wait, but for Gaussian profiles, the Rayleigh criterion is a separation equal to the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles, which have broader tails, the criterion is different. However, without getting into the exact line shapes, a common approach is to require the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2). Alternatively, the quadrature sum.\n\nBut let\'s check some references. For example, in spectroscopy, the resolution criterion often used is that two peaks are resolved if the valley between them is at least a certain fraction of the peak height. For two Lorentzian peaks of equal width Γ separated by ΔE, the criterion for resolution is approximately ΔE > Γ. However, when the widths are unequal, the required separation would be more complicated. However, a safe assumption is to take the sum of the linewidths. \n\nAlternatively, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the energy uncertainty of each state is ΔE = ħ/(2τ). Therefore, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) = sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than this uncertainty. Let\'s compute that.\n\nΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nUncertainty in the difference: sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 1.04e-6 eV.\n\nSo if the actual energy difference is greater than ~1.04e-6 eV, then they can be resolved. Comparing this to the sum of linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV), this is a stricter condition. However, this depends on the criterion used. If we use the quadrature sum (which is more accurate for independent uncertainties), then the required energy difference is approximately 1 μeV. If we use the sum of the linewidths, it\'s ~0.72 μeV. \n\nSince the question asks for the energy difference so that they can be "clearly" resolved, it\'s safer to take the larger value, which would be the quadrature sum, requiring approximately 1 μeV. However, in practice, different sources might use different criteria. For instance, if the natural linewidth is Γ, then a separation of Γ would mean the peaks are just touching. To clearly resolve them, a separation of several times Γ might be needed, but the question is likely expecting the minimum energy difference based on the uncertainty principle.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider that the energy uncertainty from the lifetime leads to a broadening of the spectral line. The width of each energy level is Γ = ħ/τ. Therefore, the first level has Γ1 = ħ/10^-9 and the second Γ2 = ħ/10^-8. The total broadening when considering the transition between these states would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this total broadening to be resolvable. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nCalculating Γ1 + Γ2:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nΓ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J = 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSum Γ1 + Γ2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So if the options include a value larger than this, that would be the answer. For example, if an option is 1 μeV, that would work. If an option is 0.5 μeV, that\'s too small.\n\nSince the problem gives the two lifetimes and asks for the energy difference that allows clear resolution, the correct approach is to calculate the sum of the natural linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) and ensure the energy difference is larger than this sum. Therefore, the minimum energy difference required is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV. Therefore, any energy difference larger than this would suffice. But since the options are not provided, and given that this is a standard problem, the answer is likely ΔE > ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2), which is the sum of the energy uncertainties. However, in terms of linewidths, the sum of Γ1 and Γ2. But since Γ = ħ/τ, the sum is ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, the answer should be on the order of 1e-6 eV or 1 μeV. But let\'s compute the numerical value.\n\nCompute Γ1 + Γ2:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.\n\n1.0545718e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So the correct answer would be an energy difference larger than this value. If the options are, say, 1 μeV, 0.5 μeV, 0.1 μeV, then 1 μeV is the answer.\n\nBut since the problem is from an exam or textbook question, and the options are not provided here, but the user is asking for the thought process, the final answer should be boxed as approximately 7.24e-7 eV or 0.724 μeV. However, given that sometimes in such problems, the answer is taken as ħ divided by the average lifetime or something else, but I think the correct approach is the sum of the linewidths.\n\nAlternatively, in some references, the minimal resolvable energy difference is taken as the larger of the two uncertainties. But since Γ1 is larger than Γ2, then ΔE > Γ1 would suffice. Γ1 is 6.58e-7 eV, so if the energy difference is larger than that, maybe it\'s enough. But this might not be sufficient because both energy levels contribute to the uncertainty.\n\nHowever, given that the problem states "clearly distinguish", it\'s safer to take the sum of the linewidths. Therefore, the minimal energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nBut let me check with actual formulas. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). For each state, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum in quadrature: sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2) = ħ/2 * sqrt(1/τ1^2 + 1/τ2^2). Let\'s compute that.\n\nsqrt( (1e9)^2 + (1e8)^2 ) = sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) = sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9.\n\nThen, the total uncertainty would be (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.27e-26 * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.3e-17 J. Converting to eV: 5.3e-17 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.3e-1 eV. Wait, that can\'t be right. Wait, no, wait, that calculation is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, let\'s do it step by step.\n\nΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.\n\nΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J.\n\nThen, sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) = sqrt(2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 ) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So approximately 0.329 μeV. So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 0.33 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this to be resolvable. But this is less than the sum of the linewidths.\n\nBut this seems conflicting. Wait, but this is the uncertainty in the energy difference calculated as the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties. However, the linewidths themselves are Γ1 = 2ΔE1 and Γ2 = 2ΔE2. Therefore, Γ1 = 1.05e-25 J (as before) and Γ2 = 1.05e-26 J. The sum of the linewidths is Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV. While the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) ≈ 0.329 μeV. So which one is the correct criterion?\n\nThis depends on how the measurement is done. If we are measuring the energy of each state independently, then each has a linewidth Γ, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the linewidths to resolve the peaks. If we are considering the uncertainty in the difference of energies, then it\'s the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties, which is smaller. But in spectroscopy, when you have two emission lines, their linewidths add when considering the overlap. Therefore, to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Hence, the correct answer should be based on Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be clearly resolvable. Therefore, the answer is on the order of 1 μeV. If the options given are in that range, that\'s the one to choose.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy difference should be at least \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two levels.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385749, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6165, prompt_tokens=446, total_tokens=6611, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the concept of natural linewidth.

1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The energy uncertainty \(\Delta E\) is related to the lifetime \(\tau\) by \(\Delta E \cdot \tau \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The natural linewidth (FWHM) is given by \(\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\).

2. **Calculate Linewidths**:
   - For the first state with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) s:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to eV:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \times 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV/J} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
     \]

   - For the second state with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) s:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to eV:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \times 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV/J} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
     \]

3. **Sum of Linewidths**:
   \[
   \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference should be greater than the sum of their natural linewidths. The minimum energy difference required is approximately \(0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}\). However, for clarity and practical purposes, an energy difference of \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) (1 \(\mu\text{eV}\)) is sufficient.

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

However, when considering the separation required to resolve two peaks, the standard approach is that the peaks should be separated by at least the sum of their half-widths. Alternatively, sometimes the criterion is that the separation should be greater than the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each peak. But to be safe, we can use the sum of their linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) as the minimum energy difference needed.

Let me check that. Suppose each energy level has a linewidth Γ, then the peaks are considered resolvable if their separation is greater than Γ1 + Γ2. Alternatively, the Rayleigh criterion in optics states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is at least equal to the FWHM of one peak. But since both peaks have different linewidths here, maybe the sum is needed. However, perhaps the correct approach is to take the sum of their uncertainties. Let me think again.

If the energy difference is ΔE, and each energy level has an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the total uncertainty would be ΔE1 + ΔE2, so ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 would be needed to resolve them. So applying that.

But according to the Heisenberg principle, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9), and for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Then the total required energy difference would be ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/2 (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ/2 (1.1e9). Wait, but 1e9 + 1e8 is 1.1e9, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake here. 10^-9 s is a shorter lifetime, so the uncertainty is larger. Wait, 1/1e-9 is 1e9, and 1/1e-8 is 1e8, so yes, the first state has a larger ΔE.

But maybe the linewidth Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ, so Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then the total linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

In spectroscopy, the natural linewidth (FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. So each energy level's linewidth is Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth when considering both transitions would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2. So to resolve the two peaks, the energy difference between them must be larger than Γ_total. Alternatively, according to the Rayleigh criterion, the separation should be at least equal to the linewidth. But if each peak has a linewidth Γ1 and Γ2, then the separation should be at least the average of the two linewidths? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each peak and ensure that their separation is larger than the sum of their FWHM divided by 2. Wait, let me recall the Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines. In optics, the Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are resolvable if the peak of one coincides with the first minimum of the other. For Gaussian profiles, this corresponds to a separation of about the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles (which is the case here for natural linewidth), the situation is different because Lorentzians have broader tails. However, perhaps the same general idea applies: the separation should be greater than the sum of the FWHM of each line.

Wait, no. For two Lorentzian peaks with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2, the combined line profile would be a convolution. But to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the average of their linewidths. Alternatively, a common rule of thumb is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. Let me check a reference.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of energy-time uncertainty. The energy uncertainty of each state is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties: ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, to resolve the energy levels, the actual energy difference should be greater than this total uncertainty. So, the minimum energy difference required would be ΔE_min = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Alternatively, if each energy level's width is Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2, then the total linewidth when considering both would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy separation should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Or greater than Γ1 + Γ2?

Hmm. Let me think again. If each energy level has a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2, the convolution of these would result in a line shape with FWHM Γ1 + Γ2. Wait, no, the convolution of two Lorentzians is a Lorentzian whose FWHM is the sum of the individual FWHM. So if you're measuring the transition between these two states, the linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. But in this case, we are considering two separate energy levels, each with their own linewidth. If the energy levels are separated by an energy ΔE, then the observed lines would each have widths Γ1 and Γ2. To resolve them, the separation ΔE must be greater than the sum of their FWHM divided by 2, maybe? Or is it the sum of the FWHM?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But since the uncertainties add in quadrature? Wait, the uncertainties in energy for each state are independent, so the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual linewidths. For example, if each line has a width of Γ1 and Γ2, then their separation should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to avoid overlap. Let me think of two peaks with widths Γ1 and Γ2. If they are separated by more than Γ1 + Γ2, then there's a valley between them, making them distinguishable. If they are separated by less than that, they start to overlap significantly.

Alternatively, using the Rayleigh criterion for two peaks: the separation should be at least equal to the FWHM of one of the peaks. But since the peaks have different FWHM, maybe the average or the sum. However, in practice, the more conservative approach is to require the separation to be greater than the sum of the linewidths. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, let's look at the formula. The natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So for the first state, Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. To convert these to energy differences, we can write them in eV. Since 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, Γ1 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. Therefore, Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. But wait, looking at the answer options, which are not provided, but the user says "which one of the following options could be their energy difference...". Since the options are not here, but perhaps the original question had specific numbers, but in the current prompt, the user hasn't provided them. Wait, no, the user has given the lifetimes and asks for the energy difference that can be clearly resolved, and the options are not here. Wait, the problem statement says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" but the options are not included here. However, since the user wants me to provide a thought process leading to the answer, perhaps I need to compute the minimal energy difference required and see which option is above that.

But since the options are not given, maybe the answer is supposed to be calculated as the sum of the energy uncertainties, so ΔE >= Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2.

But let's compute that. Let me compute Γ1 and Γ2.

First, calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

τ1 = 1e-9 s, so Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

So Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J.

Convert that to electron volts (1 J = 6.242e18 eV):

1.16e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 microelectronvolts (μeV). So any energy difference larger than this would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved. If the options given are in the order of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) or higher, then that would work. If there are options like 1e-7 eV, that would be too small.

But wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference. The energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in this difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. So ΔE_diff = sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ). Wait, but Γ is already the FWHM, which is 2ΔE (since ΔE is the standard deviation, but for a Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2ΔE). Wait, actually, the Heisenberg uncertainty gives ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. The FWHM Γ is related to ΔE as Γ = 2ΔE. So Γ = 2ΔE = ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ. So the FWHM is Γ, so each energy level has a linewidth Γ. Therefore, the uncertainty in energy for each state is Γ/2. Therefore, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ) = (1/2) sqrt(Γ1^2 + Γ2^2 ). Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this uncertainty to be resolvable. But this is a different approach. Let's compute this.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1.05e-25 J, which is 6.58e-7 eV.

Γ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.05e-26 J, which is 6.58e-8 eV.

So Γ1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Uncertainty in energy difference: sqrt( (Γ1/2)^2 + (Γ2/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15 ) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 1.04e-6 eV. Wait, that gives around 1.04e-6 eV, which is approximately 1 μeV. But this contradicts the previous sum of Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV (0.724 μeV). So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the FWHM of each line. Since each line has a width Γ1 and Γ2, then to resolve two peaks, their separation should be greater than the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2. But since Γ1 is larger (6.58e-7 eV) than Γ2 (6.58e-8 eV), then the separation should be greater than Γ1. But this seems less strict than the sum.

But in practice, when two spectral lines have different widths, the resolving power required would depend on their separation relative to their linewidths. However, the standard approach for resolution is that two peaks are considered resolved if their separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Wait, but for Gaussian profiles, the Rayleigh criterion is a separation equal to the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles, which have broader tails, the criterion is different. However, without getting into the exact line shapes, a common approach is to require the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2). Alternatively, the quadrature sum.

But let's check some references. For example, in spectroscopy, the resolution criterion often used is that two peaks are resolved if the valley between them is at least a certain fraction of the peak height. For two Lorentzian peaks of equal width Γ separated by ΔE, the criterion for resolution is approximately ΔE > Γ. However, when the widths are unequal, the required separation would be more complicated. However, a safe assumption is to take the sum of the linewidths. 

Alternatively, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the energy uncertainty of each state is ΔE = ħ/(2τ). Therefore, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) = sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than this uncertainty. Let's compute that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Uncertainty in the difference: sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15) ≈ sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ 1.04e-6 eV.

So if the actual energy difference is greater than ~1.04e-6 eV, then they can be resolved. Comparing this to the sum of linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV), this is a stricter condition. However, this depends on the criterion used. If we use the quadrature sum (which is more accurate for independent uncertainties), then the required energy difference is approximately 1 μeV. If we use the sum of the linewidths, it's ~0.72 μeV. 

Since the question asks for the energy difference so that they can be "clearly" resolved, it's safer to take the larger value, which would be the quadrature sum, requiring approximately 1 μeV. However, in practice, different sources might use different criteria. For instance, if the natural linewidth is Γ, then a separation of Γ would mean the peaks are just touching. To clearly resolve them, a separation of several times Γ might be needed, but the question is likely expecting the minimum energy difference based on the uncertainty principle.

Alternatively, let's consider that the energy uncertainty from the lifetime leads to a broadening of the spectral line. The width of each energy level is Γ = ħ/τ. Therefore, the first level has Γ1 = ħ/10^-9 and the second Γ2 = ħ/10^-8. The total broadening when considering the transition between these states would be Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this total broadening to be resolvable. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Calculating Γ1 + Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J = 6.58e-7 eV.

Γ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J = 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So if the options include a value larger than this, that would be the answer. For example, if an option is 1 μeV, that would work. If an option is 0.5 μeV, that's too small.

Since the problem gives the two lifetimes and asks for the energy difference that allows clear resolution, the correct approach is to calculate the sum of the natural linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) and ensure the energy difference is larger than this sum. Therefore, the minimum energy difference required is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV. Therefore, any energy difference larger than this would suffice. But since the options are not provided, and given that this is a standard problem, the answer is likely ΔE > ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2), which is the sum of the energy uncertainties. However, in terms of linewidths, the sum of Γ1 and Γ2. But since Γ = ħ/τ, the sum is ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, the answer should be on the order of 1e-6 eV or 1 μeV. But let's compute the numerical value.

Compute Γ1 + Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.

1.0545718e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. So the correct answer would be an energy difference larger than this value. If the options are, say, 1 μeV, 0.5 μeV, 0.1 μeV, then 1 μeV is the answer.

But since the problem is from an exam or textbook question, and the options are not provided here, but the user is asking for the thought process, the final answer should be boxed as approximately 7.24e-7 eV or 0.724 μeV. However, given that sometimes in such problems, the answer is taken as ħ divided by the average lifetime or something else, but I think the correct approach is the sum of the linewidths.

Alternatively, in some references, the minimal resolvable energy difference is taken as the larger of the two uncertainties. But since Γ1 is larger than Γ2, then ΔE > Γ1 would suffice. Γ1 is 6.58e-7 eV, so if the energy difference is larger than that, maybe it's enough. But this might not be sufficient because both energy levels contribute to the uncertainty.

However, given that the problem states "clearly distinguish", it's safer to take the sum of the linewidths. Therefore, the minimal energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.

But let me check with actual formulas. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). For each state, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum in quadrature: sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2) = ħ/2 * sqrt(1/τ1^2 + 1/τ2^2). Let's compute that.

sqrt( (1e9)^2 + (1e8)^2 ) = sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) = sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9.

Then, the total uncertainty would be (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.27e-26 * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.3e-17 J. Converting to eV: 5.3e-17 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.3e-1 eV. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, that calculation is incorrect.

Wait, no, let's do it step by step.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J.

Then, sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) = sqrt(2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 ) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So approximately 0.329 μeV. So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 0.33 μeV. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this to be resolvable. But this is less than the sum of the linewidths.

But this seems conflicting. Wait, but this is the uncertainty in the energy difference calculated as the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties. However, the linewidths themselves are Γ1 = 2ΔE1 and Γ2 = 2ΔE2. Therefore, Γ1 = 1.05e-25 J (as before) and Γ2 = 1.05e-26 J. The sum of the linewidths is Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV. While the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) ≈ 0.329 μeV. So which one is the correct criterion?

This depends on how the measurement is done. If we are measuring the energy of each state independently, then each has a linewidth Γ, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the linewidths to resolve the peaks. If we are considering the uncertainty in the difference of energies, then it's the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties, which is smaller. But in spectroscopy, when you have two emission lines, their linewidths add when considering the overlap. Therefore, to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Hence, the correct answer should be based on Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be clearly resolvable. Therefore, the answer is on the order of 1 μeV. If the options given are in that range, that's the one to choose.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two levels.

Therefore, the answer should be an energy difference larger than this value.\n\nBut the question is phrased as "which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" Since the options are not provided, but in the original problem, perhaps the user expects to recall that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the linewidths. The exact calculation leads to ~0.7 μeV. Therefore, the correct answer would be an energy difference greater than this value, so the closest option would be in that range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. If each energy uncertainty is ħ / τ, then the sum is (ħ / τ1) + (ħ / τ2). But that\'s the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ) for each, so the sum is (ħ / 2τ1) + (ħ / 2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then, in that case, the total uncertainty would be half of the previous value, so ~0.36 μeV. Then the energy difference should be greater than that. But this depends on the exact interpretation of the uncertainty principle.\n\nBut in spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is usually given by Γ = ħ / τ, so the full width at half maximum is Γ. Therefore, the energy uncertainty is Γ/2. Wait, maybe confusion here.\n\nWait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. If Δt is the lifetime τ, then ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ). So the uncertainty in energy is at least ħ/(2τ). But the natural linewidth Γ is related to the uncertainty. For a transition between two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Wait, no. Wait, if each state has a lifetime τ, then the linewidth for each state\'s energy is Γ = ħ / τ. When two states are involved in a transition, the total linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths. Therefore, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). So the energy difference must be greater than Γ_total to be resolved. Therefore, the answer should be ΔE > Γ_total = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).\n\nSo, let\'s compute that. Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s. Then:\n\nΓ_total = ħ (1/1e-9 + 1/1e-8) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.16e-25 J, which is the same as before. Converting to eV again, 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV. So, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be an energy difference larger than this value. If the options given are, for example, 1 μeV, 0.1 μeV, 10 μeV, etc., then the answer is 1 μeV or higher. Since the problem asks which option "could be" their energy difference, so the answer is any energy difference greater than approximately 0.7 μeV. But since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but in the original problem (assuming this is from a known source), the answer is likely in the order of 10^-6 eV, which is 1 μeV. However, based on exact calculation, it\'s ~0.7 μeV, so the closest higher option would be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy uncertainty from each state, and then the combined uncertainty. Let me check again.\n\nIf each state has an energy uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2), then the total uncertainty would be the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then, converting to energy:\n\nΔE_total = (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * (1e9 + 1e8) = (5.272859e-35) * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.272859e-35 * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.8e-26 J. Then converting to eV: 5.8e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV ≈ 0.362 μeV. Then, the energy difference must be greater than this. But this contradicts the previous result. Which is correct?\n\nWait, the confusion arises from whether the linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ or Γ = 2ΔE. In spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ/τ, and the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ/2. Therefore, when considering the linewidth (FWHM), which is Γ, the sum of the linewidths would be Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to resolve them. Hence, the correct calculation is Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than 0.724 μeV. So, the possible answer is on the order of 1 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ΔE = ħ/(2τ) for each state, then the total uncertainty would be the sum of the two uncertainties, which would be (ħ/2)(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). However, in spectroscopy, the linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so perhaps the correct approach is to use Γ1 + Γ2. Let me check a reference.\n\nFrom what I recall, the natural linewidth Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. For a transition between two states each with lifetimes τ_upper and τ_lower, the linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths. So, Γ_total = Γ_upper + Γ_lower = ħ (1/τ_upper + 1/τ_lower). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than Γ_total to be resolved. Hence, the calculation leading to ~0.724 μeV is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. If the options are, say, 1 μeV, 0.1 μeV, 10 μeV, then 1 μeV is the minimal option that satisfies the condition. However, without the actual options, I can\'t specify which one. But since the user hasn\'t provided them, perhaps in the original problem, the answer is 10^-6 eV (1 μeV), which is the closest standard option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach. Let me check with the uncertainty principle as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. If we take Δt as the average of the two lifetimes? Wait, no. The uncertainty in time is related to each state\'s lifetime. So, when considering two energy levels, each has an uncertainty in energy due to their own lifetimes. Therefore, the total uncertainty is the sum of both uncertainties. Hence, the same calculation as before.\n\nAnother approach: The frequency width Δν is related to the lifetime by Δν ≈ 1/(2πτ). Then, ΔE = hΔν = h/(2πτ) = ħ / τ. Wait, that\'s the same as Γ. So the energy uncertainty is indeed Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2, and the energy difference must exceed this sum. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, final answer: The energy difference must be greater than ~0.724 μeV. Therefore, the correct option is the one with energy difference greater than this value. If the options are numerical, then the closest higher value would be appropriate. If the options are orders of magnitude, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy difference should be at least approximately \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two states.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386052, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2928, prompt_tokens=597, total_tokens=3525, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state is given by \( \Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \).

1. Calculate the linewidths for each state:
   - For the first state: \( \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \)
   - For the second state: \( \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)

2. Sum the linewidths to find the total linewidth:
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} + 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. Convert the total linewidth from Joules to electron volts (eV):
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} \, (\text{eV}) = \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
   \]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than this total linewidth. The closest standard value greater than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2.

So, let's compute Γ1 and Γ2. Let's first convert lifetimes to seconds: τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1
Γ2 = ħ / τ2

But ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Therefore, Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J
Similarly, Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Adding them together: Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J

But energy differences are often expressed in electron volts (eV). Let's convert Joules to eV. 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So, Γ_total in eV: 1.16e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV to be clearly resolved.

But wait, the options given (though not listed here) might be in different units or have different orders of magnitude. However, since the problem is conceptual, the answer is likely based on the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Adding them: 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J

Convert to eV: 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

So, the energy difference should be greater than ~0.724 μeV. Therefore, the answer should be an energy difference larger than this value.

But the question is phrased as "which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" Since the options are not provided, but in the original problem, perhaps the user expects to recall that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the linewidths. The exact calculation leads to ~0.7 μeV. Therefore, the correct answer would be an energy difference greater than this value, so the closest option would be in that range.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. If each energy uncertainty is ħ / τ, then the sum is (ħ / τ1) + (ħ / τ2). But that's the same as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ) for each, so the sum is (ħ / 2τ1) + (ħ / 2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then, in that case, the total uncertainty would be half of the previous value, so ~0.36 μeV. Then the energy difference should be greater than that. But this depends on the exact interpretation of the uncertainty principle.

But in spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is usually given by Γ = ħ / τ, so the full width at half maximum is Γ. Therefore, the energy uncertainty is Γ/2. Wait, maybe confusion here.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. If Δt is the lifetime τ, then ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ). So the uncertainty in energy is at least ħ/(2τ). But the natural linewidth Γ is related to the uncertainty. For a transition between two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Wait, no. Wait, if each state has a lifetime τ, then the linewidth for each state's energy is Γ = ħ / τ. When two states are involved in a transition, the total linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths. Therefore, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). So the energy difference must be greater than Γ_total to be resolved. Therefore, the answer should be ΔE > Γ_total = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

So, let's compute that. Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s. Then:

Γ_total = ħ (1/1e-9 + 1/1e-8) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.16e-25 J, which is the same as before. Converting to eV again, 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV. So, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the correct answer would be an energy difference larger than this value. If the options given are, for example, 1 μeV, 0.1 μeV, 10 μeV, etc., then the answer is 1 μeV or higher. Since the problem asks which option "could be" their energy difference, so the answer is any energy difference greater than approximately 0.7 μeV. But since the user hasn't provided the options, but in the original problem (assuming this is from a known source), the answer is likely in the order of 10^-6 eV, which is 1 μeV. However, based on exact calculation, it's ~0.7 μeV, so the closest higher option would be acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy uncertainty from each state, and then the combined uncertainty. Let me check again.

If each state has an energy uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2), then the total uncertainty would be the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ1) + ħ/(2τ2) = ħ/2 (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then, converting to energy:

ΔE_total = (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * (1e9 + 1e8) = (5.272859e-35) * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.272859e-35 * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.8e-26 J. Then converting to eV: 5.8e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV ≈ 0.362 μeV. Then, the energy difference must be greater than this. But this contradicts the previous result. Which is correct?

Wait, the confusion arises from whether the linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ or Γ = 2ΔE. In spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ/τ, and the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ/2. Therefore, when considering the linewidth (FWHM), which is Γ, the sum of the linewidths would be Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to resolve them. Hence, the correct calculation is Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) ≈ 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than 0.724 μeV. So, the possible answer is on the order of 1 μeV.

Alternatively, if we use ΔE = ħ/(2τ) for each state, then the total uncertainty would be the sum of the two uncertainties, which would be (ħ/2)(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). However, in spectroscopy, the linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so perhaps the correct approach is to use Γ1 + Γ2. Let me check a reference.

From what I recall, the natural linewidth Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. For a transition between two states each with lifetimes τ_upper and τ_lower, the linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths. So, Γ_total = Γ_upper + Γ_lower = ħ (1/τ_upper + 1/τ_lower). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than Γ_total to be resolved. Hence, the calculation leading to ~0.724 μeV is correct.

Therefore, the answer is that the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV. If the options are, say, 1 μeV, 0.1 μeV, 10 μeV, then 1 μeV is the minimal option that satisfies the condition. However, without the actual options, I can't specify which one. But since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps in the original problem, the answer is 10^-6 eV (1 μeV), which is the closest standard option.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach. Let me check with the uncertainty principle as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. If we take Δt as the average of the two lifetimes? Wait, no. The uncertainty in time is related to each state's lifetime. So, when considering two energy levels, each has an uncertainty in energy due to their own lifetimes. Therefore, the total uncertainty is the sum of both uncertainties. Hence, the same calculation as before.

Another approach: The frequency width Δν is related to the lifetime by Δν ≈ 1/(2πτ). Then, ΔE = hΔν = h/(2πτ) = ħ / τ. Wait, that's the same as Γ. So the energy uncertainty is indeed Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, the total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2, and the energy difference must exceed this sum. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

So, final answer: The energy difference must be greater than ~0.724 μeV. Therefore, the correct option is the one with energy difference greater than this value. If the options are numerical, then the closest higher value would be appropriate. If the options are orders of magnitude, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) is the answer.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least approximately \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two states.
