The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars to ensure compatibility with the principles of relativistic quantum field theory. Lorentz invariance is explicitly imposed when building these operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The full Poincaré group (Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations) is a fundamental symmetry of SMEFT. Operators are required to be Poincaré-invariant, meaning they are local (no explicit spacetime dependence) and Lorentz-invariant. This ensures the action derived from the Lagrangian respects Poincaré symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem guarantees that any Lorentz-invariant, local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian preserves CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT adheres to these conditions, all operators must respect CPT symmetry, even if they violate CP or T individually.

**CP symmetry (option 3) is not required**, as the Standard Model (and by extension SMEFT) includes CP-violating interactions (e.g., in the weak sector). Operators in SMEFT can explicitly violate CP while remaining consistent with the theory's framework.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{4}

Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me start by recalling what each of these symmetries entails and how they relate to SMEFT.

First, SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are built from the SM fields and respect the symmetries of the SM. The SM itself is known to respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of the Poincare symmetry group. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and translations in spacetime. So the full Poincare group is the symmetry group of special relativistic theories. The Standard Model is a relativistic QFT, so it should respect Poincare symmetry. But SMEFT, being an effective extension, should also respect the same symmetries as the SM unless specified otherwise. But wait, sometimes effective theories can have different symmetry considerations, especially if they are arising from a UV theory that might break some symmetries. But the usual SMEFT construction assumes that the UV physics doesn't violate the SM symmetries, so the higher-dimensional operators are built to respect the SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz invariance.

So, Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but does SMEFT require full Poincare symmetry or just Lorentz? Wait, in QFT, the theories are usually constructed to be Poincare invariant, which includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. So maybe the answer is both 1 and 2. But the question is asking which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let me check.

In the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed to be invariant under the SM gauge group (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) and Lorentz invariant. Poincare symmetry would include translations as well. But in an effective field theory, the operators are local, so they should respect translational invariance as part of the Poincare symmetry. However, when people talk about symmetries in the context of operator construction, they often refer to Lorentz invariance (since translation invariance is more about the spacetime dependence of the fields). Wait, but in constructing Lagrangians in QFT, we require that the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare transformations, which includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So the operators must be Poincare invariant. But maybe in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars and translationally invariant, hence respecting Poincare symmetry. So perhaps both 1 and 2 must be respected.

But then what about CP and CPT? The Standard Model is known to violate CP symmetry (for example, in the weak interaction), so operators in the SM can violate CP. However, SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators that also could violate CP. But the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. If some operators in the SMEFT can violate CP, then CP symmetry is not a must. Similarly, CPT symmetry is a theorem in Lorentz-invariant QFTs with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. So CPT symmetry must hold in any such theory. Wait, even if CP is violated, CPT is still preserved, with T violation compensating. So in SMEFT, which is a local QFT, CPT should hold for all operators. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected. But the Standard Model does have CP violation, but CPT is still preserved. Therefore, in SMEFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry, even if they violate CP or T.

So putting this together:

1. Lorentz Symmetry – yes, because SMEFT is a relativistic EFT.

2. Poincare symmetry – since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant, then yes, Poincare symmetry should be respected. But wait, translations are part of the symmetry, but when constructing operators, do we need to impose translational invariance explicitly? Or is it automatically satisfied? In any case, the Lagrangian density must be a scalar under Poincare transformations, so the operators (which are part of the Lagrangian) must be Poincare invariant. So Poincare symmetry is required.

3. CP symmetry – the SM violates CP, so SMEFT operators can also violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not required.

4. CPT symmetry – as per the CPT theorem, any Lorentz-invariant local QFT must respect CPT. Since SMEFT is such a theory, all operators must respect CPT. So CPT is a must.

Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, the options are given as 1,2,3,4, and the question is which must be respected by all operators. So maybe the answer is 1,2,4. But let me verify again.

Wait, the Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. In QFT, the Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare transformations. Therefore, each term in the Lagrangian (each operator) must be a scalar under Poincare. Therefore, each operator must be Poincare invariant. Similarly, Lorentz symmetry is a subset. But if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is automatically included. However, sometimes people might refer to Lorentz invariance when they really mean Poincare, but technically, Poincare is the full symmetry. So if the question is about which must be respected, both 1 and 2? Or is Poincare symmetry the broader one, so if 2 is true, then 1 is redundant?

Wait, no. The Poincare group is the semi-direct product of the Lorentz group and the translations. So, if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's invariant under both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in the context of operator construction in a Lagrangian, the operators are local, so they are at a point, and translation invariance is about the Lagrangian being the same at all points. But the operators themselves, when integrated over spacetime, form the action which is invariant under translations. Wait, maybe the operators in the Lagrangian density are required to be Lorentz scalars, but translation invariance is a separate condition. However, in practice, the Lagrangian density must transform under translations such that the action is invariant. But the individual terms (operators) in the Lagrangian density are constructed to be Poincare scalars. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry would be required. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, maybe the correct answer is Poincare symmetry (2) and CPT symmetry (4). But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4) are required. Because in constructing the operators, they must be Lorentz scalars, and CPT is required by the CPT theorem. But Poincare symmetry includes translations, which might not be directly relevant to the operator's form. Wait, the operator's form is a local term, so for example, a term like φ(x)² is invariant under translations because x is just a point, but the Lagrangian is built to be the same at all x. Hmm. Maybe the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, but the Poincare symmetry (including translations) is a symmetry of the action, not necessarily of each operator individually. Wait, but each operator when integrated over spacetime must be Poincare invariant. So the integral of the operator over spacetime must be invariant. For that, the operator itself (the Lagrangian density) must be a Poincare scalar. Because when you perform a translation, the Lagrangian density at x becomes the Lagrangian density at x + a, and to have the action invariant, the Lagrangian density must transform as a scalar. Therefore, each operator in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are required? But since Poincare includes Lorentz, maybe just 2 and 4? Wait, but the options are separate: 1 and 2 are listed separately. So the question is, must all operators respect Lorentz symmetry (yes), Poincare symmetry (yes), CP symmetry (no), CPT symmetry (yes). Therefore, the answer is 1, 2, and 4.

But I need to confirm whether Poincare symmetry is required for each operator. Since the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant, each term (operator) must be a Poincare scalar. Otherwise, adding a non-Poincare scalar term would break the symmetry. Therefore, yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So the answer would be 1, 2, and 4. But wait, the options are given as 1, 2, 3, 4. So the correct choices are 1, 2, 4.

But wait, in SMEFT, do we assume that the operators are Lorentz scalars, but do they need to be translationally invariant? Or is translational invariance automatically satisfied because the operators are local? Translational invariance of the action is about the Lagrangian density being the same at all points, which is automatically true if the Lagrangian is constructed from fields and their derivatives without explicit x dependence. So if the operators don't have explicit spacetime dependence, then translational invariance holds. But the operators in SMEFT are constructed without explicit spacetime dependence, so translation invariance is maintained. Therefore, each operator, being a Poincare scalar (Lorentz scalar and no explicit x dependence), ensures that the action is Poincare invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (including Lorentz), and CPT symmetry due to the CPT theorem. Therefore, the answer is 1, 2, and 4. So options 1, 2, 4 must be respected.

But let me check some references in my mind. The SMEFT is based on the premise that the UV physics respects the SM symmetries, so the higher-dimensional operators are constructed to be invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. Poincare symmetry is part of the package, as Lorentz invariance plus translational invariance. But in the context of EFT, when writing down operators, they are required to be Lorentz scalars and gauge invariant. Translational invariance is usually assumed unless there's explicit x dependence, which is not the case in SMEFT. So perhaps in the operator construction, Lorentz symmetry is explicitly imposed, and translational invariance is sort of automatically there if the operators don't have position dependence. Therefore, maybe the answer is 1 and 4: Lorentz and CPT. But then why not Poincare?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Poincare symmetry as including Lorentz, so if Poincare is selected, Lorentz is redundant. But the options are separate. Let me think again. The CPT theorem requires Lorentz invariance and Hermiticity, etc. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant (and other axioms hold), then CPT is a symmetry. Since SMEFT operators are Lorentz invariant, CPT must hold. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are also a symmetry, but perhaps the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, and translation invariance comes from the lack of explicit position dependence. Therefore, maybe the answer is 1 and 4.

But wait, the Poincare symmetry is more than just Lorentz and translations; it's the combination. But if operators are local and Lorentz scalars without explicit x dependence, then the action will be Poincare invariant. So each operator, being a Lorentz scalar and x-independent, contributes to a Poincare invariant action. Therefore, each operator must be Lorentz invariant and x-independent (hence translation invariant), so Poincare invariance is enforced. But is the x-independence considered part of the symmetry? Translational invariance requires that the Lagrangian doesn't explicitly depend on x, which is a condition on the operators. So if an operator has an explicit x dependence, it would break translation invariance. But in SMEFT, operators are constructed from fields and derivatives without explicit x dependence, so translation invariance holds. Therefore, the operators are Poincare invariant. Hence, the answer includes Poincare symmetry (2). But does each operator have to be Poincare invariant, or is it the whole Lagrangian? The Lagrangian is a sum of operators, each of which must be Poincare invariant to ensure the entire Lagrangian is. Therefore, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

But I'm getting conflicting intuitions here. Let me try to recall: in the Standard Model, the Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, which includes Lorentz and translations. All terms in the Lagrangian are Poincare scalars. Similarly, in SMEFT, all operators must be Poincare scalars. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required. Additionally, CPT must be respected due to the CPT theorem. CP can be violated, as it is in the SM. Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4.

But wait, another angle: the Poincare group is the full symmetry, so if we impose Poincare symmetry, that includes Lorentz. So maybe the answer is 2 and 4. But the question lists them separately. If the question is a multiple choice where more than one can be correct, then 1, 2, and 4. But perhaps in the context of SMEFT, when they say the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, they are already including that within Poincare. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1 and 4. Because when constructing the operators, you impose Lorentz covariance, and CPT comes from the theorem. Poincare symmetry might be considered as part of the spacetime symmetry, but the key is that the operators are Lorentz covariant, and translation invariance is about the Lagrangian being the same everywhere, which is handled by not having explicit x dependence. So perhaps the strict answer is Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But I need to resolve this.

Let me check the usual SMEFT setup. The SMEFT Lagrangian is written as a sum of higher-dimensional operators constructed from SM fields, which are invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. Poincare symmetry isn't usually mentioned explicitly because Lorentz symmetry is part of it, and translation invariance is assumed. However, technically, the full Poincare symmetry is required. But in terms of what each operator must satisfy, Lorentz invariance is explicitly imposed, and translation invariance is achieved through the absence of explicit x dependence. So if an operator had explicit x dependence, it would break translation invariance but not Lorentz invariance. But in SMEFT, operators don't have explicit x dependence, so translation invariance holds. Therefore, each operator is Lorentz invariant and the entire Lagrangian is Poincare invariant. But if the question is about the symmetries that each operator must respect, then Lorentz invariance (1) and CPT (4). Because translation invariance is a global symmetry of the Lagrangian, not necessarily a property of each operator. Wait, but each operator must not break translation invariance, which would happen if it has explicit x dependence. But since operators are constructed without x dependence, translation invariance is maintained. So each operator is local and doesn't have x dependence, hence respecting translation invariance. Therefore, each operator is Poincare invariant. Therefore, symmetries 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.

Given that, the answer should be options 1, 2, and 4. But let me verify with an example. Consider a term like ϕ∂μϕ∂^μϕ. This is a Lorentz scalar and doesn't have explicit x dependence, so it's Poincare invariant. If I have a term like ϕ(x)²xμx^μ, this would have explicit x dependence and break translation invariance, but such terms are not allowed in SMEFT. Therefore, SMEFT operators are Poincare invariant. Hence, the symmetries 1, 2, and 4 are required. CP can be violated, so 3 is not required. CPT is required by the CPT theorem in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, so 4 is required.

Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4.

So in SMEFT, which is a local QFT, CPT should hold for all operators. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected. But the Standard Model does have CP violation, but CPT is still preserved. Therefore, in SMEFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry, even if they violate CP or T.

So putting this together:

1. Lorentz Symmetry – yes, because SMEFT is a relativistic EFT.

2. Poincare symmetry – since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant, then yes, Poincare symmetry should be respected. But wait, translations are part of the symmetry, but when constructing operators, do we need to impose translational invari

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Let me analyze each of the given options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

To begin with, SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model by incorporating higher-dimensional operators constructed from Standard Model fields. These operators must maintain certain symmetries from the original theory.

Lorentz symmetry, which encompasses rotations and boosts, is fundamental to relativistic theories including SMEFT. Poincare symmetry is more comprehensive, as it includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Since the Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, it respects Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT should follow suit. When constructing operators in SMEFT, they must be Lorentz scalars and maintain translational invariance, meaning they respect the full Poincare group.

Regarding CP symmetry, the Standard Model is known to violate this symmetry, particularly in weak interactions. Since SMEFT extends the Standard Model, its operators can also violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not universally required for all SMEFT operators.

As for CPT symmetry, this is a fundamental theorem in Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Even when CP symmetry is violated, CPT remains preserved (with T violation compensating). Since SMEFT is a local quantum field theory, CPT symmetry must hold for all its operators, regardless of whether they violate CP or T individually.

Therefore, examining each option:
1. Lorentz Symmetry - must be respected by all SMEFT operators
2. Poincare symmetry - must be respected as it includes Lorentz transformations and translations
3. CP symmetry - not necessarily respected by all operators
4. CPT symmetry - must be respected by all operators in SMEFT

I need to determine which symmetries must be adhered to by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The choices include Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. To do this, I need to review what each symmetry involves and how they connect to SMEFT.

SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) using higher-dimensional operators built from SM fields, maintaining SM symmetries. The SM itself respects Lorentz symmetry, which is part of the broader Poincare symmetry group. Poincare symmetry encompasses both Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and translations in spacetime, making it the symmetry group for special relativistic theories. Since the Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), it must respect Poincare symmetry. SMEFT, as an effective extension, typically respects the same symmetries as the SM unless specifically stated otherwise. However, effective theories sometimes have different symmetry requirements, especially if derived from a UV theory that might break certain symmetries. Nonetheless, SMEFT usually assumes the UV physics doesn't disrupt SM symmetries, thus respecting SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz invariance in higher-dimensional operators.

Lorentz symmetry is a component of Poincare symmetry, but does SMEFT need complete Poincare symmetry or just Lorentz? In QFT, theories are constructed to be Poincare invariant, meaning they incorporate both Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Therefore, it's likely that both must be respected in SMEFT. In the framework of SMEFT, operators are designed to be invariant under the SM gauge group (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) and Lorentz invariant. While Poincare symmetry involves translational invariance too, effective field theory operators are local and therefore should maintain this aspect of Poincare symmetry. Typically, in operator construction discussions, the focus is on Lorentz invariance, but in QFT Lagrangian construction, it must be a scalar under Poincare transformations, including both Lorentz transformations and translations. Consequently, SMEFT operators should respect Poincare symmetry by being Lorentz scalars and translationally invariant.

However, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model is known to violate CP symmetry, particularly in weak interactions, so SM operators can break CP symmetry. Similarly, SMEFT’s higher-dimensional operators might also break CP. The question is about symmetries mandatory for all operators: if SMEFT allows CP violation, it doesn't require CP symmetry. On the other hand, CPT symmetry is a theorem applicable to Lorentz-invariant QFTs with a Hermitian Hamiltonian, meaning CPT symmetry must hold in these theories. Regardless of CP violations, CPT is preserved by compensating with T violations. Therefore, even if SMEFT allows CP or T violations, all operators should adhere to CPT symmetry, which remains intact even while CP is violated in the Standard Model.

To summarize:

1. Lorentz Symmetry – affirmed, as SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory.

2. Poincare Symmetry – affirmed as well, since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, and as the operators are local and maintain Lorentz invariance, Poincare symmetry should be respected.

In QFT, the fields are functions of spacetime, and the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare transformations, which includes translations.

Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might conflate Lorentz symmetry with Poincare, but technically Poincare is more general. However, the answer options are separate: 1 and 2 are separate options. So the question is, do all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry (yes) and Poincare symmetry (also yes, since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant). So both 1 and 2?\n\nBut I need to verify. Let me check some references. For example, in the original SMEFT papers by Weinberg, or in reviews, they state that the SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under the Lorentz group and the SM gauge group. Poincare symmetry includes translations, but in the context of constructing local operators, translation invariance is automatically satisfied as long as the operators are local and constructed from fields and derivatives without explicit spacetime dependence. So maybe Lorentz symmetry is the key, and Poincare symmetry is implied. But in the context of EFT, the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant, which includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct. But the options are separate. The question is which must be respected by all operators. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is a redundancy here. Because Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincare. But if the operators are required to be Poincare-invariant, then they must be Lorentz-invariant. But if they are only required to be Lorentz-invariant, then Poincare might not be required. Wait, but in reality, in QFT, the full Poincare symmetry is required for consistency. So operators must transform properly under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. However, when constructing local operators, the translation invariance is about the Lagrangian being the same at all points in spacetime. The operators themselves, when written in terms of fields and derivatives, don\'t have explicit spacetime dependence, so they are translationally invariant. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But then why is the question giving them as separate options? Maybe because sometimes people refer to Lorentz invariance when they mean the full Poincare, but technically, they are different. Wait, but the full Poincare group is the semi-direct product of translations and Lorentz transformations. So if the operators are Poincare-invariant, then they are both translation and Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, if SMEFT requires Poincare symmetry, then both 1 and 2 are correct. But the answer options are separate, so maybe both 1 and 2 are correct. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in SMEFT, only Lorentz symmetry is imposed, not the full Poincare. But that doesn\'t make sense because Poincare is a fundamental symmetry of relativistic QFT. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nBut wait, sometimes translations are considered part of the spacetime symmetries, but when building local operators, translation invariance is enforced by not having explicit position dependence, except through the fields. So if an operator is built out of fields and derivatives, it\'s automatically translationally invariant. Therefore, requiring Lorentz invariance (and the SM gauge invariance) would be sufficient, and translational invariance comes along as part of the Poincare. But I\'m getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: in QFT, the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. This includes both Lorentz invariance and translation invariance. So each term in the Lagrangian, i.e., each operator, must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2), which includes Lorentz (option 1). But since the options are separate, if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is a subset. But the question is which of the listed symmetries must be respected. If Poincare is required, then 2 is correct. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, then 1 is also correct. Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a larger group. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it must be Lorentz-invariant. But if it\'s Lorentz-invariant, does it have to be Poincare-invariant? Not necessarily. For example, a term that is Lorentz-invariant but not translation-invariant would not be Poincare-invariant. But in SMEFT, we require Poincare invariance, so operators must be both Lorentz and translation-invariant. Thus, the correct answers would be 1 and 2. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice where you can select multiple, but the user is asking which must be respected. The original SMEFT construction assumes Poincare invariance, so both Lorentz and Poincare are required. However, sometimes in the literature, when talking about operator construction, they might refer to Lorentz invariance as the key symmetry, assuming translation invariance. But strictly speaking, the full Poincare group is required. Therefore, options 1 and 2 are both correct. But I need to check some sources to confirm.\n\nLooking up, for example, the Wikipedia page on SMEFT says: "The SMEFT is constructed under the assumption that the new physics is described by higher-dimension operators added to the Standard Model action, which respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model." The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry (including Lorentz) and the gauge symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry (so 1 and 2) and the SM gauge symmetries. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nNow, regarding CP and CPT. The Standard Model violates CP, so SMEFT operators can also violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry (option 3) is not required. However, CPT symmetry is a theorem in Lorentz-invariant QFTs, assuming locality and Hermiticity. Therefore, even if CP is violated, CPT must be conserved. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4). Therefore, the correct answers should be 1, 2, and 4. But wait, the question is from a multiple-choice, and the options are 1,2,3,4. So the answer should be all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4.\n\nBut wait, does Poincare symmetry include CPT? No, CPT is a separate symmetry. CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant local QFT with Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. So if the SMEFT is such a theory (which it is, as an effective theory), then CPT must hold, even if individual operators violate C, P, or T. Therefore, the operators themselves don\'t need to respect CPT, but the whole theory must. Wait, no. The CPT theorem applies to the entire theory, not necessarily to individual operators. However, each operator must be CPT invariant if the whole Lagrangian is to be CPT invariant. Wait, but the CPT theorem says that the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant if it\'s Lorentz-invariant and unitary. So even if you have operators that violate C, P, or T, their CPT-transformed versions must also be present. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The CPT theorem states that the combined symmetry of CPT is a symmetry of the theory. So the Lagrangian must be invariant under CPT. Therefore, each operator in the Lagrangian must transform under CPT to another operator that is also present in the Lagrangian. If the operator is CPT-invariant, then it remains the same. If not, there must be a corresponding operator that is the CPT-transformed version. However, in SMEFT, we write down all possible operators that respect the SM symmetries. Since CPT is a symmetry of the theory, any operator that is not CPT-invariant would require its CPT conjugate to also be present. However, in practice, when constructing the operator basis, people usually assume Hermiticity, which would imply that the operators are CPT-invariant. Wait, I\'m getting confused here. Let me recall: the CPT theorem says that CPT is an invariance of the theory, not necessarily of each operator. So individual operators can break CPT, but the overall Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant. However, in practice, when constructing a Lagrangian, if you include a CPT-violating operator, you must also include its CPT conjugate to preserve the overall CPT symmetry. But in SMEFT, since it\'s an effective theory, you include all operators compatible with the symmetries. If CPT is a symmetry, then you would only include operators that are CPT-invariant. However, the CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant, local QFT, CPT symmetry must hold. Therefore, any operator that violates CPT would lead to a violation of the CPT theorem, which is not possible. Therefore, all operators must be CPT-invariant. Hence, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Therefore, the answer is 1, 2, and 4.\n\nBut wait, I thought that the Standard Model violates CP, which would imply that CPT is preserved because CPT is a symmetry. For example, if a process violates CP, then the CPT-transformed process would be equivalent to the time-reversed process, and so CPT ensures that the laws of physics are invariant. But individual processes can violate CP as long as CPT is preserved. However, in terms of the operators in the Lagrangian, if an operator is CP-violating, then its CPT conjugate would involve a T transformation, but since the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, does that mean each operator must be CPT-invariant? Or can you have pairs of operators that are CPT conjugates?\n\nWait, the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant. So if you have an operator O, then under CPT, it transforms to (CPT) O (CPT)^-1, which must also be present in the Lagrangian. If the operator is CPT-invariant, then (CPT) O (CPT)^-1 = O. If not, then you need to have both O and (CPT) O (CPT)^-1 in the Lagrangian. However, in the SMEFT, when constructing the operator basis, you include all independent operators that respect the SM symmetries. If CPT is a symmetry, then the coefficients of O and its CPT conjugate must be related. But since the SMEFT Lagrangian is Hermitian, the coefficients are real (or have real parts), so the operators must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, each operator in the SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry is respected by all operators. Hence, option 4 is correct.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry – Yes\n\n2. Poincare Symmetry – Yes (since it includes Lorentz and translations, and SMEFT is Poincare-invariant)\n\n3. CP Symmetry – No (SM and SMEFT can have CP violation)\n\n4. CPT Symmetry – Yes (due to CPT theorem)\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nBut wait, the problem states "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". Each operator must individually respect these symmetries? Or the entire theory must respect them? For example, Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are such that each operator must be a scalar under those symmetries. CPT symmetry, however, is a theorem that applies to the entire theory. But individual operators could, in principle, transform under CPT. However, since the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, the combination of operators must be such that their CPT transforms are also present. However, in the SMEFT, when you construct the basis of operators, you include operators that are Hermitian, which would imply that they are CPT-invariant. Alternatively, if an operator is not Hermitian, its Hermitian conjugate would also be present. But in any case, the requirement from the CPT theorem is that the whole Lagrangian is CPT-invariant, not necessarily each operator. However, in practice, to ensure the Lagrangian is CPT-invariant, each operator must either be CPT-invariant or come with its CPT-conjugate counterpart with appropriate coefficients. However, in the SMEFT construction, when you write down all possible operators that respect the SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz invariance, you automatically include the necessary terms to preserve CPT. But if an operator is not CPT-invariant, you would need its conjugate. However, since the SMEFT operators are constructed to be Hermitian (or have Hermitian conjugates included), this ensures CPT invariance. Therefore, in the context of SMEFT, all operators are either CPT-invariant or come in pairs that ensure CPT invariance of the Lagrangian. But the question is whether each operator must respect CPT symmetry individually. If the operator is non-Hermitian, then its Hermitian conjugate must be included, which would correspond to the CPT conjugate. Therefore, strictly speaking, individual operators do not have to be CPT-invariant, but the Lagrangian as a whole must be. However, in the standard construction of SMEFT, operators are taken to be Hermitian, which would make them CPT-invariant. Therefore, the answer might include CPT symmetry as a required symmetry for all operators. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The CPT theorem ensures the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators can violate CPT as long as their conjugates are present. However, in SMEFT, when you build the operator basis, you typically list Hermitian operators, which are CPT-invariant. For example, the dimension-6 operators in the SMEFT are usually written as Hermitian operators. Therefore, in that case, each operator is CPT-invariant.

The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**  
   SMEFT is constructed as a relativistic effective field theory, so all operators must be Lorentz-invariant. This ensures compatibility with the principles of special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**  
   Poincaré symmetry, which includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations, is a foundational symmetry of quantum field theories like the Standard Model. SMEFT operators are required to respect this symmetry, ensuring locality and consistency with relativistic invariance.

4. **CPT Symmetry**  
   The CPT theorem guarantees that any Lorentz-invariant, local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must preserve CPT symmetry. Even though individual operators in SMEFT may violate CP or T symmetry, the theorem ensures that CPT symmetry is preserved at the level of the full theory. In practice, operators in SMEFT are typically constructed to be Hermitian, making them CPT-invariant individually.

**CP symmetry (option 3)** is **not** required, as the Standard Model and SMEFT explicitly allow for CP violation (e.g., in weak interactions). Thus, operators in SMEFT can violate CP while still adhering to the fundamental symmetries of the framework.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, and \boxed{4}.

ants explicitly? In QFT, the fields are functions of spacetime, and the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare transformations, which includes translations. So operators in the Lagrangian must be translationally invariant (i.e., no explicit dependence on spacetime position except through the fields). So SMEFT operators are constructed to be Poincare invariant. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait, sometimes people might conflate Lorentz symmetry with Poincare, but technically Poincare is more general. However, the answer options are separate: 1 and 2 are separate options. So the question is, do all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry (yes) and Poincare symmetry (also yes, since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant). So both 1 and 2?

But I need to verify. Let me check some references. For example, in the original SMEFT papers by Weinberg, or in reviews, they state that the SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under the Lorentz group and the SM gauge group. Poincare symmetry includes translations, but in the context of constructing local operators, translation invariance is automatically satisfied as long as the operators are local and constructed from fields and derivatives without explicit spacetime dependence. So maybe Lorentz symmetry is the key, and Poincare symmetry is implied. But in the context of EFT, the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant, which includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct. But the options are separate. The question is which must be respected by all operators. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is a redundancy here. Because Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincare. But if the operators are required to be Poincare-invariant, then they must be Lorentz-invariant. But if they are only required to be Lorentz-invariant, then Poincare might not be required. Wait, but in reality, in QFT, the full Poincare symmetry is required for consistency. So operators must transform properly under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. However, when constructing local operators, the translation invariance is about the Lagrangian being the same at all points in spacetime. The operators themselves, when written in terms of fields and derivatives, don't have explicit spacetime dependence, so they are translationally invariant. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But then why is the question giving them as separate options? Maybe because sometimes people refer to Lorentz invariance when they mean the full Poincare, but technically, they are different. Wait, but the full Poincare group is the semi-direct product of translations and Lorentz transformations. So if the operators are Poincare-invariant, then they are both translation and Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, if SMEFT requires Poincare symmetry, then both 1 and 2 are correct. But the answer options are separate, so maybe both 1 and 2 are correct. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe in SMEFT, only Lorentz symmetry is imposed, not the full Poincare. But that doesn't make sense because Poincare is a fundamental symmetry of relativistic QFT. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, sometimes translations are considered part of the spacetime symmetries, but when building local operators, translation invariance is enforced by not having explicit position dependence, except through the fields. So if an operator is built out of fields and derivatives, it's automatically translationally invariant. Therefore, requiring Lorentz invariance (and the SM gauge invariance) would be sufficient, and translational invariance comes along as part of the Poincare. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: in QFT, the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. This includes both Lorentz invariance and translation invariance. So each term in the Lagrangian, i.e., each operator, must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2), which includes Lorentz (option 1). But since the options are separate, if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is a subset. But the question is which of the listed symmetries must be respected. If Poincare is required, then 2 is correct. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, then 1 is also correct. Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a larger group. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it must be Lorentz-invariant. But if it's Lorentz-invariant, does it have to be Poincare-invariant? Not necessarily. For example, a term that is Lorentz-invariant but not translation-invariant would not be Poincare-invariant. But in SMEFT, we require Poincare invariance, so operators must be both Lorentz and translation-invariant. Thus, the correct answers would be 1 and 2. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice where you can select multiple, but the user is asking which must be respected. The original SMEFT construction assumes Poincare invariance, so both Lorentz and Poincare are required. However, sometimes in the literature, when talking about operator construction, they might refer to Lorentz invariance as the key symmetry, assuming translation invariance. But strictly speaking, the full Poincare group is required. Therefore, options 1 and 2 are both correct. But I need to check some sources to confirm.

Looking up, for example, the Wikipedia page on SMEFT says: "The SMEFT is constructed under the assumption that the new physics is described by higher-dimension operators added to the Standard Model action, which respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model." The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry (including Lorentz) and the gauge symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry (so 1 and 2) and the SM gauge symmetries. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, regarding CP and CPT. The Standard Model violates CP, so SMEFT operators can also violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry (option 3) is not required. However, CPT symmetry is a theorem in Lorentz-invariant QFTs, assuming locality and Hermiticity. Therefore, even if CP is violated, CPT must be conserved. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4). Therefore, the correct answers should be 1, 2, and 4. But wait, the question is from a multiple-choice, and the options are 1,2,3,4. So the answer should be all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4.

But wait, does Poincare symmetry include CPT? No, CPT is a separate symmetry. CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant local QFT with Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. So if the SMEFT is such a theory (which it is, as an effective theory), then CPT must hold, even if individual operators violate C, P, or T. Therefore, the operators themselves don't need to respect CPT, but the whole theory must. Wait, no. The CPT theorem applies to the entire theory, not necessarily to individual operators. However, each operator must be CPT invariant if the whole Lagrangian is to be CPT invariant. Wait, but the CPT theorem says that the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant if it's Lorentz-invariant and unitary. So even if you have operators that violate C, P, or T, their CPT-transformed versions must also be present. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The CPT theorem states that the combined symmetry of CPT is a symmetry of the theory. So the Lagrangian must be invariant under CPT. Therefore, each operator in the Lagrangian must transform under CPT to another operator that is also present in the Lagrangian. If the operator is CPT-invariant, then it remains the same. If not, there must be a corresponding operator that is the CPT-transformed version. However, in SMEFT, we write down all possible operators that respect the SM symmetries. Since CPT is a symmetry of the theory, any operator that is not CPT-invariant would require its CPT conjugate to also be present. However, in practice, when constructing the operator basis, people usually assume Hermiticity, which would imply that the operators are CPT-invariant. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me recall: the CPT theorem says that CPT is an invariance of the theory, not necessarily of each operator. So individual operators can break CPT, but the overall Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant. However, in practice, when constructing a Lagrangian, if you include a CPT-violating operator, you must also include its CPT conjugate to preserve the overall CPT symmetry. But in SMEFT, since it's an effective theory, you include all operators compatible with the symmetries. If CPT is a symmetry, then you would only include operators that are CPT-invariant. However, the CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant, local QFT, CPT symmetry must hold. Therefore, any operator that violates CPT would lead to a violation of the CPT theorem, which is not possible. Therefore, all operators must be CPT-invariant. Hence, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Therefore, the answer is 1, 2, and 4.

But wait, I thought that the Standard Model violates CP, which would imply that CPT is preserved because CPT is a symmetry. For example, if a process violates CP, then the CPT-transformed process would be equivalent to the time-reversed process, and so CPT ensures that the laws of physics are invariant. But individual processes can violate CP as long as CPT is preserved. However, in terms of the operators in the Lagrangian, if an operator is CP-violating, then its CPT conjugate would involve a T transformation, but since the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, does that mean each operator must be CPT-invariant? Or can you have pairs of operators that are CPT conjugates?

Wait, the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant. So if you have an operator O, then under CPT, it transforms to (CPT) O (CPT)^-1, which must also be present in the Lagrangian. If the operator is CPT-invariant, then (CPT) O (CPT)^-1 = O. If not, then you need to have both O and (CPT) O (CPT)^-1 in the Lagrangian. However, in the SMEFT, when constructing the operator basis, you include all independent operators that respect the SM symmetries. If CPT is a symmetry, then the coefficients of O and its CPT conjugate must be related. But since the SMEFT Lagrangian is Hermitian, the coefficients are real (or have real parts), so the operators must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, each operator in the SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry is respected by all operators. Hence, option 4 is correct.

So summarizing:

1. Lorentz Symmetry – Yes

2. Poincare Symmetry – Yes (since it includes Lorentz and translations, and SMEFT is Poincare-invariant)

3. CP Symmetry – No (SM and SMEFT can have CP violation)

4. CPT Symmetry – Yes (due to CPT theorem)

Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4.

But wait, the problem states "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". Each operator must individually respect these symmetries? Or the entire theory must respect them? For example, Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are such that each operator must be a scalar under those symmetries. CPT symmetry, however, is a theorem that applies to the entire theory. But individual operators could, in principle, transform under CPT.

This is a bit tricky. The CPT theorem ensures the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators can violate CPT as long as their conjugates are present.

For example, the dimension-6 operators in the SMEFT are usually written as Hermitian operators. Therefore, in that case, each operator is CPT-invariant. Hence, option 4 is correct.

So combining all this, the answer should be options 1, 2, and 4. Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. CP symmetry is not required.

CPT Symmetry – required, due to the CPT theorem in Lorentz-invariant QFTs.\n\nThe question asks which symmetries "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." Therefore, the correct answers are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, in some references, SMEFT is said to respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare and the SM gauge group. Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. However, sometimes people might refer to Lorentz symmetry as part of Poincare. But in the options, both 1 and 2 are listed. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is automatically required. But the question is which "must be respected by all operators". So, in SMEFT, operators are required to be Lorentz scalars (Lorentz symmetry) and gauge invariant, but do they need to respect the full Poincare symmetry? Translational invariance is part of Poincare, and in QFT, the Lagrangian is required to be Poincare invariant, meaning the action is invariant under Poincare transformations (including translations). However, when constructing local operators in SMEFT, the operators are local fields that are integrated over spacetime to form the action. The individual operators are required to be Lorentz scalars (so Lorentz symmetry), but the action\'s invariance under translations would come from integrating the Lagrangian density over spacetime. Therefore, the operators themselves (the Lagrangian terms) need to be Lorentz scalars, but the invariance under translations is part of the overall structure. So perhaps the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and the theory as a whole respects Poincare. But the question is about the operators, which are terms in the Lagrangian. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so 1 is necessary), but Poincare symmetry (including translations) is a symmetry of the action. However, if the operators are local, they are already translationally invariant in the sense that the Lagrangian is built from fields at the same spacetime point. Wait, but translational invariance would imply that the physics is the same everywhere, so the Lagrangian density must not explicitly depend on spacetime coordinates. Therefore, the operators (terms in the Lagrangian) must not have explicit coordinate dependence, which would require them to be translationally invariant. So, the operators must be Poincare invariant (Lorentz scalars and translationally invariant). Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required. However, in SMEFT, when constructing the operators, the primary consideration is Lorentz invariance and SM gauge invariance. Translational invariance is automatically satisfied if the operators are local and built from fields and derivatives without explicit spacetime dependence. So, in that sense, both Lorentz and Poincare are respected. Thus, options 1 and 2 are correct. Then, CPT symmetry (4) is required by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry (3) is not required. Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4. However, I need to check if Poincare symmetry is indeed required. The SM is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT, as a low-energy effective theory of the SM, should inherit this. But in practice, when people write SMEFT operators, they focus on Lorentz invariance and gauge invariance, but since the Poincare group includes translations, and SMEFT is constructed in a way that the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar (so the action is Poincare invariant). Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must be Poincare scalars, which includes Lorentz invariance and translational invariance. Hence, 1 and 2 are both required. But the options are presented as separate, so the answer would include both 1 and 2. But according to the CPT theorem, 4 is also required, so 1, 2, 4. However, I need to verify whether the CPT theorem applies here. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant local QFT with Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, it must obey CPT symmetry. Therefore, even if individual operators violate CP or T, the combination CPT must still hold. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. However, typically, the CPT symmetry applies to the entire theory, not necessarily each operator. Wait, but if the theory is CPT invariant, the sum of all operators must respect CPT. But if you have a CPT-odd operator, that would violate the theorem. Therefore, all operators must individually respect CPT symmetry. But in reality, operators can be CPT-even or CPT-odd. Wait, but according to the CPT theorem, the overall theory must be CPT symmetric, but if you have a CPT-odd operator, that would lead to CPT violation. Therefore, perhaps in a consistent theory, all operators must preserve CPT. However, the Standard Model has CP violation but is CPT invariant because CPT is an exact symmetry. Therefore, even if an operator violates CP, it must still preserve CPT. For example, a CP-violating term would transform under CPT as follows: CPT would turn a CP-violating term into a T-violating term, but since the theory is CPT symmetric, the combination would still hold. Therefore, individual operators don\'t need to preserve CP or T, but the overall theory must preserve CPT. Therefore, the operators themselves can violate CP and T, but the theory as a whole must be CPT invariant. However, if an operator is CPT-odd, then adding it to the Lagrangian would make the theory CPT-violating. Therefore, in SMEFT, all operators must be CPT even. Hence, CPT symmetry is a required symmetry for each operator. Therefore, 4 must be respected. But in reality, SMEFT does allow operators that violate CP, but not CPT. So, for example, a CP-violating operator is still CPT invariant. Let me think: CPT symmetry reverses the charges, parity, and time. So, if you have a term in the Lagrangian that is CP-violating, then under CPT, it would become T-violating, but the Lagrangian must be CPT invariant. Wait, but in reality, the Lagrangian is a scalar, so each term must be invariant under CPT. Therefore, if an operator is CP-violating, then it must be T-violating in such a way that CPT leaves it invariant. But how does that work? For example, consider a term like the θ-term in QCD, which is CP-violating. Under CPT, such a term would transform into itself, because it\'s a Lorentz scalar and a CPT transformation would flip it, but since it\'s a pseudo-scalar, maybe it remains the same. Hmm, perhaps the CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant term is CPT symmetric. Wait, the CPT theorem states that the combination of C, P, and T is a symmetry of the theory. Therefore, even if individual terms are not invariant under C, P, or T, the whole theory is invariant under CPT. But the theorem requires that the theory (i.e., the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) is CPT invariant. However, if the Lagrangian is written in terms of local operators, each operator must transform properly under CPT. For example, a scalar operator would be CPT invariant. However, operators that are not Lorentz scalars would not be allowed. Wait, but all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, so they should be invariant under CPT. Wait, no. Lorentz scalars can still transform under CPT depending on their field content. For example, a term like the fermion mass term ψψ is a Lorentz scalar and is CPT invariant. A term like θ F̃F is also a Lorentz scalar and CPT invariant. However, a term that is CPT-odd would not be a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must be CPT even. Therefore, in SMEFT, since operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, they are automatically CPT even, hence preserving CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected. So, putting it all together: Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries are required because SMEFT is a relativistic QFT. CPT symmetry (4) is required by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry (3) is not required. So the answer is options 1, 2, and 4. However, I need to verify this with some references. From the SMEFT literature, the standard assumption is that the operators respect the SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz invariance.

The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, and all operators must be Lorentz-invariant (i.e., scalar under Lorentz transformations). This ensures consistency with the principles of special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The full Poincaré group (Lorentz transformations + spacetime translations) is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories (QFTs) in flat spacetime. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to be local and translationally invariant, ensuring the action is Poincaré-invariant. While Lorentz symmetry is often emphasized, translational invariance is implicitly required for the Lagrangian density to lack explicit spacetime dependence.

3. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem guarantees that any Lorentz-invariant, local QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must preserve the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Even if individual operators violate CP or T, the theory as a whole—and thus all operators—must respect CPT symmetry. For example, CP-violating terms in SMEFT (e.g., the QCD θ-term) remain CPT-invariant, as they are Lorentz scalars.

**CP symmetry**, however, is **not** required. The Standard Model (and SMEFT) explicitly allows CP violation (e.g., in weak interactions and via higher-dimensional operators), so CP symmetry is not a mandatory condition for SMEFT operators.

**Answer:**  
1. Lorentz Symmetry  
2. Poincaré symmetry  
4. CPT symmetry

3. CP Symmetry – not required, as the SM and SMEFT can include CP-violating terms.

4. CPT Symmetry – required, due to the CPT theorem in Lorentz-invariant QFTs.

The question asks which symmetries "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." Therefore, the correct answers are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, in some references, SMEFT is said to respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare and the SM gauge group. Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. However, sometimes people might refer to Lorentz symmetry as part of Poincare. But in the options, both 1 and 2 are listed. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is automatically required. But the question is which "must be respected by all operators". So, in SMEFT, operators are required to be Lorentz scalars (Lorentz symmetry) and gauge invariant, but do they need to respect the full Poincare symmetry? Translational invariance is part of Poincare, and in QFT, the Lagrangian is required to be Poincare invariant, meaning the action is invariant under Poincare transformations (including translations). However, when constructing local operators in SMEFT, the operators are local fields that are integrated over spacetime to form the action. The individual operators are required to be Lorentz scalars (so Lorentz symmetry), but the action's invariance under translations would come from integrating the Lagrangian density over spacetime. Therefore, the operators themselves (the Lagrangian terms) need to be Lorentz scalars, but the invariance under translations is part of the overall structure. So perhaps the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and the theory as a whole respects Poincare. But the question is about the operators, which are terms in the Lagrangian. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so 1 is necessary), but Poincare symmetry (including translations) is a symmetry of the action. However, if the operators are local, they are already translationally invariant in the sense that the Lagrangian is built from fields at the same spacetime point. Wait, but translational invariance would imply that the physics is the same everywhere, so the Lagrangian density must not explicitly depend on spacetime coordinates. Therefore, the operators (terms in the Lagrangian) must not have explicit coordinate dependence, which would require them to be translationally invariant. So, the operators must be Poincare invariant (Lorentz scalars and translationally invariant). Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required. However, in SMEFT, when constructing the operators, the primary consideration is Lorentz invariance and SM gauge invariance. Translational invariance is automatically satisfied if the operators are local and built from fields and derivatives without explicit spacetime dependence. So, in that sense, both Lorentz and Poincare are respected. Thus, options 1 and 2 are correct. Then, CPT symmetry (4) is required by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry (3) is not required. Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4. However, I need to check if Poincare symmetry is indeed required. The SM is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT, as a low-energy effective theory of the SM, should inherit this. But in practice, when people write SMEFT operators, they focus on Lorentz invariance and gauge invariance, but since the Poincare group includes translations, and SMEFT is constructed in a way that the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar (so the action is Poincare invariant). Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must be Poincare scalars, which includes Lorentz invariance and translational invariance. Hence, 1 and 2 are both required. But the options are presented as separate, so the answer would include both 1 and 2. But according to the CPT theorem, 4 is also required, so 1, 2, 4. However, I need to verify whether the CPT theorem applies here. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant local QFT with Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, it must obey CPT symmetry. Therefore, even if individual operators violate CP or T, the combination CPT must still hold. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. However, typically, the CPT symmetry applies to the entire theory, not necessarily each operator. Wait, but if the theory is CPT invariant, the sum of all operators must respect CPT. But if you have a CPT-odd operator, that would violate the theorem. Therefore, all operators must individually respect CPT symmetry. But in reality, operators can be CPT-even or CPT-odd. Wait, but according to the CPT theorem, the overall theory must be CPT symmetric, but if you have a CPT-odd operator, that would lead to CPT violation. Therefore, perhaps in a consistent theory, all operators must preserve CPT. However, the Standard Model has CP violation but is CPT invariant because CPT is an exact symmetry. Therefore, even if an operator violates CP, it must still preserve CPT. For example, a CP-violating term would transform under CPT as follows: CPT would turn a CP-violating term into a T-violating term, but since the theory is CPT symmetric, the combination would still hold. Therefore, individual operators don't need to preserve CP or T, but the overall theory must preserve CPT. Therefore, the operators themselves can violate CP and T, but the theory as a whole must be CPT invariant. However, if an operator is CPT-odd, then adding it to the Lagrangian would make the theory CPT-violating. Therefore, in SMEFT, all operators must be CPT even. Hence, CPT symmetry is a required symmetry for each operator. Therefore, 4 must be respected. But in reality, SMEFT does allow operators that violate CP, but not CPT. So, for example, a CP-violating operator is still CPT invariant. Let me think: CPT symmetry reverses the charges, parity, and time. So, if you have a term in the Lagrangian that is CP-violating, then under CPT, it would become T-violating, but the Lagrangian must be CPT invariant. Wait, but in reality, the Lagrangian is a scalar, so each term must be invariant under CPT. Therefore, if an operator is CP-violating, then it must be T-violating in such a way that CPT leaves it invariant. But how does that work? For example, consider a term like the θ-term in QCD, which is CP-violating. Under CPT, such a term would transform into itself, because it's a Lorentz scalar and a CPT transformation would flip it, but since it's a pseudo-scalar, maybe it remains the same. Hmm, perhaps the CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant term is CPT symmetric. Wait, the CPT theorem states that the combination of C, P, and T is a symmetry of the theory. Therefore, even if individual terms are not invariant under C, P, or T, the whole theory is invariant under CPT. But the theorem requires that the theory (i.e., the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) is CPT invariant. However, if the Lagrangian is written in terms of local operators, each operator must transform properly under CPT. For example, a scalar operator would be CPT invariant. However, operators that are not Lorentz scalars would not be allowed. Wait, but all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, so they should be invariant under CPT. Wait, no. Lorentz scalars can still transform under CPT depending on their field content. For example, a term like the fermion mass term ψψ is a Lorentz scalar and is CPT invariant. A term like θ F̃F is also a Lorentz scalar and CPT invariant. However, a term that is CPT-odd would not be a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must be CPT even. Therefore, in SMEFT, since operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, they are automatically CPT even, hence preserving CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected. So, putting it all together: Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries are required because SMEFT is a relativistic QFT. CPT symmetry (4) is required by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry (3) is not required. So the answer is options 1, 2, and 4. However, I need to verify this with some references. From the SMEFT literature, the standard assumption is that the operators respect the SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz invariance. Poincare symmetry is not usually mentioned because Lorentz invariance is part of it, and translational invariance is assumed in the construction. However, the full Poincare symmetry is indeed a necessary symmetry of the theory. The CPT theorem applies, so CPT symmetry is mandatory. Therefore, the correct answers are 1, 2, and 4.
