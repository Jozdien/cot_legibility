To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \(X^0\) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we need to consider the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Calculate the velocity (\(\beta\))**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.917)^2}} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Calculate the dilated lifetime (\(\tau_{\text{lab}}\))**:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average decay length (\(L_{\text{avg}}\))**:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.884 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

5. **Determine the decay length corresponding to 30% of the decays**:
   The probability that a decay occurs at a distance greater than \(\delta\) is given by \(e^{-\delta / L_{\text{avg}}}\). Setting this equal to 0.3:
   \[
   e^{-\delta / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.3 \implies \delta = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3)
   \]
   \[
   \delta = -1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times \ln(0.3) \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.268 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (2.268 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a particle X^0 decaying into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime of 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. They also mention that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, right. 

First, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, which is the Bubble Chamber here, the lifetime would be dilated due to relativistic effects. So the actual lifetime we observe in the lab frame should be longer. The resolution needed would relate to how far the particle travels before decaying, right? Because if the detector can't resolve that distance, we might miss the decay. 

So, the key idea is to find the average distance the particle travels before decaying, which is the speed times the dilated lifetime. Then, the detector needs to have a spatial resolution at least as good as that distance to observe the decay. But since they want to observe at least 30% of the decays, maybe we need to consider the mean path length and then use some probability distribution to find the distance within which 30% of the decays occur. 

Wait, the lifetime follows an exponential decay law. So the probability that the particle decays after time t is 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where τ is the dilated lifetime. So to have at least 30% of the decays, we need to find the time t such that 1 - e^{-t/τ} = 0.3. Solving for t, that would be t = -τ ln(1 - 0.3) = -τ ln(0.7). Then, the distance would be speed multiplied by that time. So the minimum resolution would need to be able to resolve that distance. 

But first, we need to compute the Lorentz factor gamma, since the dilated lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. To find gamma, we need the velocity of the X^0 particle. But they give us the energy in the Bubble Chamber, which is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. 

Assuming that the energy given is the total energy of the X^0 particle, so total energy E = gamma * m c^2. Since they are using GeV units, and mass is given in GeV/c², probably. So E = gamma * m. Therefore, gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13, so 3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917. So gamma ≈ 7.917. 

Then, the dilated lifetime τ_lab = gamma * τ_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3336e-15 s. 

Now, the speed of the particle. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so we can solve for v. Let me compute beta = v/c. 

gamma = 7.917, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute 1/gamma²: 1/(7.917)^2 ≈ 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 ≈ 0.98405. Then beta = sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c. 

So the speed is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. 

Now, the mean lifetime is τ_lab ≈ 6.3336e-15 s. 

But to find the distance for 30% of the decays, we need to find the time t such that the probability of decay is 30%, then multiply that by the speed. 

As I thought earlier, the decay probability is 1 - e^{-t/τ_lab} = 0.3. So solving for t: 

t = - τ_lab * ln(1 - 0.3) 

ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667 

So t ≈ 6.3336e-15 s * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s 

Then, the distance L = v * t = 0.992c * 2.26e-15 s 

We know that c ≈ 3e8 m/s, so 

L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s 

Calculate that: 

0.992 * 3 ≈ 2.976 

2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = 2.976 * 2.26 * 1e-7 

2.976 * 2.26 ≈ 6.726 

So L ≈ 6.726e-7 meters, which is 672.6e-9 meters or approximately 672.6 nanometers. 

Wait, that seems really small. The spatial resolution needed is on the order of hundreds of nanometers? But bubble chambers typically have resolutions on the order of micrometers or millimeters, maybe? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check the steps again. 

First, gamma calculation: 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV is indeed approximately 7.917. That seems right. 

Beta calculation: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). 1/gamma² ≈ 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01595, so beta ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. That seems okay. 

Tau_lab: 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.33e-15 s. Correct. 

Then, for 30% decay probability: t = -tau * ln(0.7). Wait, ln(0.7) is negative, so t = tau * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 6.33e-15 * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s. Then, L = v * t = 0.992c * 2.26e-15 s. 

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 2.26e-15 s: 

2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = 2.976 * 2.26 * 1e-7 = 6.72576e-7 meters. Which is 672.576 nanometers. 

Hmm, 672 nanometers. That's 0.672 micrometers. Is that realistic? Bubble chambers have resolution in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers, I think. So if the required resolution is sub-micrometer, that's beyond typical bubble chamber resolution. So maybe I messed up units somewhere? 

Wait, let's check the energy. The problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy of the X^0 particle or the kinetic energy? 

If it's the total energy, then gamma = E / m = 27 / 3.41. If it's the kinetic energy, then gamma would be (K + m c²)/m c². But since they just say "energy", maybe it's total energy. But in high-energy physics, sometimes energy is given as kinetic. Wait, but the mass is 3.41 GeV, so if the total energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If it's kinetic energy, then K = 27 GeV = (gamma - 1) m c². Then, gamma = 1 + 27 / 3.41 ≈ 1 + 7.917 ≈ 8.917. Hmm, that would change the result. 

Wait, the problem states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". Maybe that refers to the rest energy? No, rest energy would be m c², which is 3.41 GeV. So probably, 27 GeV is the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic energy. The problem is ambiguous. Hmm. 

Wait, in particle physics, when they say "the energy of the beam" or "the energy in the detector", it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, for particles, they might refer to total energy. Let me check. 

If the energy is the total energy, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If it's the kinetic energy, then gamma is (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. 

Wait, but the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Since the X^0 is moving in the Bubble Chamber, the energy here is likely the total energy. Because in collider experiments, the energy is often given as the total energy. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the center-of-mass energy? But since it's a Bubble Chamber, which is a fixed target experiment, the energy is probably the lab frame energy. Hmm. 

Wait, the problem is about the decay of X^0, so the energy of X^0 in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber) is 27 GeV. If that's the case, then total energy E = gamma m c², so gamma = E / (m c²). Since the mass is given as 3.41 GeV, which is m c². Therefore, gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So that seems correct. 

Therefore, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 0.992. 

Then, the calculation proceeds as before, leading to L ≈ 672 nanometers. 

But 672 nm is 0.672 micrometers. Bubble chambers have a resolution typically on the order of 100 micrometers (0.1 mm), I think. So 0.6 micrometers is much smaller than that. So does that mean that with a resolution of 0.6 micrometers, you can observe 30% of the decays? But bubble chambers can't resolve that. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not asking for the path length corresponding to 30% probability, but rather the mean path length multiplied by some factor. Wait, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. So the detector must have a spatial resolution better than the average decay length multiplied by some factor related to 30% of the decays. 

But the average decay length is L_avg = gamma * v * tau_0 * c. Wait, let's compute the average decay length. 

Wait, L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0. Because the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the average lifetime is gamma * tau_0, and the distance is v * t. 

So L_avg = beta * gamma * c * tau_0. 

Compute that: beta is 0.992, gamma ≈7.917, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s. 

So L_avg = 0.992 *7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s. 

Calculate step by step: 

0.992 *7.917 ≈ 7.85 

3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.4e-7 m 

Then, 7.85 *2.4e-7 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers. 

So the average decay length is about 1.88 micrometers. 

But the question is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So if the detector can't resolve decay lengths shorter than some minimum, then you only observe decays that occur at a distance greater than the resolution. Wait, no. Actually, if the resolution is delta, then you can't distinguish two points closer than delta. So the decay length has to be at least delta to be observed. Therefore, the number of decays observed would be those with decay lengths greater than delta. Wait, but that would mean the observed fraction is the probability that the decay length is greater than delta, which is e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. 

Wait, let's think again. 

The decay length L follows the distribution f(L) = (1/(gamma beta c tau_0)) e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. 

Therefore, the probability that the decay length is greater than delta is e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. 

But the question is to observe at least 30% of the decays. So we need the probability that L >= delta to be at least 30%. So e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)} >= 0.3 

Solving for delta: 

delta <= - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3) 

Wait, but the problem states "the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If the resolution is delta, meaning the detector can resolve distances down to delta, then all decay lengths longer than delta can be observed. Therefore, the fraction observed is the integral from delta to infinity of f(L) dL = e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. 

So we need e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)} >= 0.3 

Therefore, solving for delta: 

delta <= - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3) 

So delta_max = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3) 

But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. So if the resolution is worse (larger delta), then the observed fraction is smaller. To have at least 30%, the resolution needs to be at least as good as delta_max. So the minimum resolution is delta_max. 

Wait, but minimum resolution required is the smallest delta such that e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)} >= 0.3. So delta <= - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). Therefore, the minimum resolution (smallest delta) is delta = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). Wait, no. If delta is smaller, then e^{-delta/(...)} is larger. So to have at least 30%, delta needs to be less than or equal to that value. Therefore, the required resolution is the maximum delta that still allows 30% observation, which is delta = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

But the problem is phrased as "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%". So resolution is the ability to distinguish; so a better resolution (smaller delta) allows you to see more decays. Therefore, to observe at least 30%, you need the resolution to be at least as good as (i.e., delta <= ... ) that value. So the minimum resolution required is the one where delta is such that the observed fraction is exactly 30%. So delta = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

Therefore, let's compute that. 

First, gamma beta c tau_0. 

gamma =7.917, beta=0.992, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s. 

gamma beta c tau_0 =7.917 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 

Calculate step by step: 

7.917 *0.992 ≈7.85 

3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 

7.85 *2.4e-7 ≈1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884e-6 m = 1.884 micrometers. 

Wait, that's the average decay length. Then, delta = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3) ≈1.884e-6 m * (-ln(0.3)) 

ln(0.3)≈-1.20397, so delta≈1.884e-6 m *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m≈2.268 micrometers. 

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation where for 30% probability, the distance was 0.672 micrometers. Hmm, so which is correct? 

Wait, no. The average decay length L_avg is gamma beta c tau_0 ≈1.884 micrometers. The probability that the decay occurs at a length greater than delta is e^{-delta / L_avg}. So setting that equal to 0.3, we solve e^{-delta / 1.884e-6} =0.3, so -delta /1.884e-6 = ln(0.3)≈-1.20397, so delta=1.20397 *1.884e-6≈2.268e-6 m≈2.268 micrometers. 

But earlier, when I calculated the time for 30% probability and multiplied by velocity, I got 0.672 micrometers. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? 

Wait, the confusion comes from two different approaches. Let me clarify. 

First approach: 

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}. The distance is L = beta c t. So solving 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} =0.3, we get t= - gamma tau_0 ln(0.7). Then, L= beta c * (- gamma tau_0 ln(0.7))= - beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.7). 

Second approach: 

Using the decay length distribution. The decay length L follows f(L)= (1/(gamma beta c tau_0)) e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. The probability that L >= delta is e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. To have this probability >=0.3, delta <= - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

Wait, so depending on whether we consider the time corresponding to 30% cumulative probability or the length corresponding to 30% survival, we get different expressions. 

Wait, in the first approach, 30% decay probability corresponds to t such that 30% have decayed by time t, so 70% remain. Then, the distance is beta c t. 

In the second approach, observing at least 30% of the decays would require delta such that the probability L >= delta is 30%, meaning 30% of the decays occur beyond delta. But the question says "observe at least 30% of the decays". If the detector can't resolve distances smaller than delta, then you can only observe decays that happen at a distance greater than delta. So the fraction observed is the probability that L >= delta, which is e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Therefore, to have at least 30% observed, e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)} >=0.3. Therefore, delta <= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

But in the first approach, if you consider the time by which 30% have decayed, then the distance is L = beta c t = beta c (-gamma tau_0 ln(0.7)) = -beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.7). 

So which is the correct interpretation? 

The problem states: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" 

If the detector has a resolution delta, then it can only see decays where the decay vertex is separated from the production vertex by at least delta. Therefore, the number of decays observed is the number of decays with L >= delta, which is N = N0 e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Therefore, to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need e^{-delta/(gamma beta c tau_0)} >=0.3. Therefore, delta <= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is delta= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3). 

But let's compute both to see the difference. 

First approach (30% decayed): 

L1 = -beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.7) ≈0.992 *7.917 *3e8 *8e-16 *0.35667 

Wait, 0.992*7.917≈7.85, 3e8*8e-16=2.4e-7, so 7.85*2.4e-7≈1.884e-6 m. Then multiply by ln(0.7)≈-0.35667, so L1≈1.884e-6 *0.35667≈6.72e-7 m≈0.672 micrometers. 

Second approach (30% observed): 

L2= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3)≈1.884e-6 m *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m≈2.268 micrometers. 

So which one is correct? 

The key is in the wording: "observe at least 30% of the decays". If the detector can't resolve decay lengths shorter than delta, then the observed decays are those with L >= delta. The fraction observed is the integral from delta to infinity of f(L)dL = e^{-delta/(L_avg)}, where L_avg=gamma beta c tau_0. Therefore, to have this fraction >=0.3, delta <= -L_avg ln(0.3). 

Therefore, the correct answer should be L2≈2.27 micrometers. 

But why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, 30% decayed corresponds to t where 30% have decayed, so 70% remain. But observing decays requires that the decay has happened, so if you wait for a time t, the number of decays is 30%, but the detector needs to resolve the decay length, which depends on how far the particle traveled before decaying. But in reality, the detector is continuously observing. So the proper way is that the number of decays that occur at a distance >= delta is 30% of the total decays. Therefore, the resolution delta needs to be such that 30% of the decays occur at distances greater than delta. Hence, the second approach is correct. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But let's compute it precisely. 

Given: 

gamma =27 /3.41≈7.91727287 

beta=sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) 

Calculate gamma^2= (27/3.41)^2≈(7.91727287)^2≈62.683 

1/gamma^2≈0.01595 

1 -1/gamma^2≈0.98405 

beta≈sqrt(0.98405)=≈0.9920238 

Then, gamma*beta=7.91727287*0.9920238≈7.85 

c=3e8 m/s 

tau_0=8e-16 s 

gamma*beta*c*tau_0=7.85*3e8*8e-16=7.85*2.4e-7=1.884e-6 m=1.884 micrometers 

Then, delta= -gamma*beta*c*tau_0*ln(0.3)=1.884e-6 m *1.203972≈1.884e-6 *1.203972≈2.268e-6 m=2.268 micrometers. 

So approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But the problem says "minimum resolution needed". So the answer is about 2.27 micrometers. However, maybe they want the answer in meters or another unit. Let's convert 2.268e-6 meters to more standard units. 

2.268e-6 meters is 2.268 micrometers, which is 2.268 microns. Alternatively, 2.27e-6 m. 

But bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers (0.1 mm), so 2 micrometers seems too small. However, perhaps in this case, due to the high gamma factor, the decay length is longer. Wait, but we got 1.88 micrometers as the average decay length. So even the average decay length is less than 2 micrometers. 

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me check again. 

Energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. 

If the energy is total energy, then gamma = E / m =27 /3.41≈7.917. 

If the energy is kinetic energy, then gamma = (K + m)/m = (27 +3.41)/3.41≈30.41/3.41≈8.917. 

But the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle in a detector, it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, for particles, the total energy is given. Hmm. 

Wait, the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. If the total energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is 7.917. If it's kinetic energy, then gamma is (27 +3.41)/3.41≈8.917. 

This would affect the result. Let's check both possibilities. 

First, assuming total energy: 

gamma=7.917, beta≈0.992, average decay length≈1.88 micrometers, required resolution≈2.27 micrometers. 

Second, assuming kinetic energy: 

gamma=8.917, beta= sqrt(1 -1/(8.917)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/79.51)=sqrt(0.98742)=≈0.9937. 

Then, average decay length=gamma beta c tau_0=8.917 *0.9937*3e8*8e-16. 

Compute: 

8.917*0.9937≈8.86 

3e8*8e-16=2.4e-7 

8.86*2.4e-7≈2.126e-6 m≈2.126 micrometers. 

Then, delta= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3)=2.126e-6 *1.20397≈2.56e-6 m≈2.56 micrometers. 

So even if gamma is 8.917, delta is about 2.56 micrometers. 

But the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Since the Bubble Chamber is at rest, and the X^0 is moving, the energy of the X^0 is total energy. Therefore, it's more likely that 27 GeV is the total energy. Therefore, gamma=7.917, leading to delta≈2.27 micrometers. 

But given that bubble chambers have resolution around 100 micrometers, this seems impossible. Maybe the question is using a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the proper lifetime and asking for the lab frame decay length without considering the probability, but just calculating the average decay length, and then saying that the resolution needs to be at least the average decay length to observe a reasonable number of decays. But the question specifically says 30%. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a classical approximation, but no, gamma is 8, so relativistic effects are significant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the center-of-mass energy, but in a bubble chamber, it's usually a fixed target, so the lab frame energy is different. Wait, but the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which would be the lab frame energy. 

Alternatively, maybe there is confusion between the lifetime and the path length. Let's re-express all formulas. 

The decay length distribution is f(L) = (1/L_avg) e^{-L/L_avg}, where L_avg=gamma beta c tau_0. 

The probability that L >= delta is e^{-delta/L_avg}. 

We need e^{-delta/L_avg} >=0.3 

Therefore, delta <= -L_avg ln(0.3) 

So delta= -L_avg ln(0.3)= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.3) 

Given that, and using the numbers: 

gamma=27 /3.41≈7.917 

beta=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.016)=sqrt(0.984)=≈0.992 

tau_0=8e-16 s 

c=3e8 m/s 

L_avg=7.917 *0.992*3e8*8e-16≈7.85*2.4e-7≈1.884e-6 m=1.884 micrometers 

delta=1.884e-6 * (-ln(0.3))≈1.884e-6 *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m≈2.27 micrometers 

So, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

Converting to meters: 2.27e-6 meters, or 2.27 micrometers. 

But maybe the answer is expected in centimeters or millimeters? Let's see: 

2.27e-6 meters is 2.27e-4 cm, which is 0.000227 cm, or 0.00227 mm, or 2.27 micrometers. 

Yes, so 2.27 micrometers is the answer. 

But considering that in experimental physics, bubble chamber resolution is usually not that good, but maybe in this case, due to the high gamma factor, the decay length is longer. Wait, but even with gamma≈8, the decay length is still only about 2 micrometers. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in units somewhere. Let me check the calculation of L_avg again. 

gamma=7.917 

beta=0.992 

c=3e8 m/s 

tau_0=8e-16 s 

L_avg=gamma * beta * c * tau_0 

=7.917 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 

First multiply 7.917 *0.992≈7.85 

Then 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 

Then 7.85 *2.4e-7=1.884e-7? Wait, no: 7.85 *2.4e-7= (7 *2.4e-7) + (0.85*2.4e-7)=1.68e-6 +2.04e-7=1.884e-6. Yes, 1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884 micrometers. 

So that's correct. 

Then, delta=1.884e-6 *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m=2.268 micrometers. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But the problem might expect the answer in meters, so 2.27e-6 meters, or maybe in centimeters as 2.27e-4 cm. 

Alternatively, using scientific notation: 2.3e-6 m. 

But let's confirm once more. 

Alternatively, perhaps the proper lifetime is given in the rest frame, and the student is supposed to calculate the lab frame lifetime and then compute the distance. But the key is that the distance depends on the velocity and the dilated lifetime. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different formula, like L=gamma v tau_0, but that would be incorrect because L=gamma v tau_0 would be if the lifetime is multiplied by gamma, but actually, the lifetime is tau=gamma tau_0, so L=v tau= v gamma tau_0. 

Yes, so L= v gamma tau_0 = beta gamma c tau_0. 

Which is the same as L_avg=beta gamma c tau_0. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.27 micrometers, or 2.3e-6 meters. 

But let me check with gamma=8.917 (if energy is kinetic): 

gamma=8.917, beta≈0.9937 

L_avg=8.917*0.9937*3e8*8e-16≈8.86*2.4e-7≈2.126e-6 m=2.126 micrometers 

delta=2.126e-6 *1.20397≈2.56e-6 m=2.56 micrometers. 

Still, approximately 2.5 micrometers. 

But the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". If that's the total energy, then the first calculation holds. If it's kinetic energy, then the second. But without explicit mention, it's safer to assume total energy. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the momentum? No, the problem states energy. 

Alternatively, maybe they meant the center-of-mass energy, but in a bubble chamber, the target is stationary, so the lab frame energy is different. But the problem doesn't mention any other particles, just the decay of X^0, so the energy of X^0 is given as 27 GeV. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 2.27 micrometers, which is 2.27e-6 meters. 

But to confirm, let's see what 30% of the decays correspond to. If the average decay length is 1.88 micrometers, then 30% of the decays happening beyond 2.27 micrometers seems reasonable. 

In summary, after careful consideration and checking, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a particle X^0 decaying into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime of 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. They also mention that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, right. 

First, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, which is the Bubble Chamber here, the lifetime would be dilated due to relativistic effects. So the actual lifetime we observe in the lab frame should be longer. The resolution needed would relate to how far the particle travels before decaying, right? Because if the detector can't resolve that distance, we might miss the decay. 

So, the key idea is to find the average distance the particle travels before decaying, which is the speed times the dilated lifetime. Then, the detector needs to have a spatial resolution at least as good as that distance to observe the decay. But since they want to observe at least 30% of the decays, maybe we need to consider the mean path length and then use some probability distribution to find the distance within which 30% of the decays occur. 

Wait, the lifetime follows an exponential decay law. So the probability that the particle decays after time t is 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where τ is the dilated lifetime. So to have at least 30% of the decays, we need to find the time t such that 1 - e^{-t/τ} = 0.3. Solving for t, that would be t = -τ ln(1 - 0.3) = -τ ln(0.7). Then, the distance would be speed multiplied by that time. So the minimum resolution would need to be able to resolve that distance. 

But first, we need to compute the Lorentz factor gamma, since the dilated lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. To find gamma, we need the velocity of the X^0 particle. But they give us the energy in the Bubble Chamber, which is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. 

Assuming that the energy given is the total energy of the X^0 particle, so total energy E = gamma * m c^2. Since they are using GeV units, and mass is given in GeV/c², probably. So E = gamma * m. Therefore, gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13, so 3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917. So gamma ≈ 7.917. 

Then, the dilated lifetime τ_lab = gamma * τ_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3336e-15 s. 

Now, the speed of the particle. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so we can solve for v. Let me compute beta = v/c. 

gamma = 7.917, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute 1/gamma²: 1/(7.917)^2 ≈ 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 ≈ 0.98405. Then beta = sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c. 

So the speed is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. 

Now, the mean lifetime is τ_lab ≈ 6.3336e-15 s. 

But to find the distance for 30% of the decays, we need to find the time t such that the probability of decay is 30%, then multiply that by the speed. 

As I thought earlier, the decay probability is 1 - e^{-t/τ_lab} = 0.3. So solving for t: 

t = - τ_lab * ln(1 - 0.3) 

ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667 

So t ≈ 6.3336e-15 s * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s 

Then, the distance L = v * t = 0.992c * 2.26e-15 s 

We know that c ≈ 3e8 m/s, so 

L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s 

Calculate that: 

0.992 * 3 ≈ 2.976 

2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = 2.976 * 2.26 * 1e-7 

2.976 * 2.26 ≈ 6.726 

So L ≈ 6.726e-7 meters, which is 672.6e-9 meters or approximately 672.6 nanometers. 

Wait, that seems really small. The spatial resolution needed is on the order of hundreds of nanometers? But bubble chambers typically have resolutions on the order of micrometers or millimeters, maybe? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check the steps again. 

First, gamma calculation: 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV is indeed approximately 7.917. That seems right. 

Beta calculation: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). 1/gamma² ≈ 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01595, so beta ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. That seems okay. 

Tau_lab: 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.33e-15 s. Correct. 

Then, for 30% decay probability: t = -tau * ln(0.7). Wait, ln(0.7) is negative, so t = tau * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 6.33e-15 * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s. Then, L = v * t = 0.992c * 2.26e-15 s. 

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 2.26e-15 s: 

2.976e8 * 2.26e-15 = 2.976 * 2.26 * 1e-7 = 6.72576e-7 meters. Which is 672.576 nanometers. 

Hmm, 672 nanometers. That's 0.672 micrometers. Is that realistic? Bubble chambers have resolution in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers, I think. So if the required resolution is sub-micrometer, that's beyond typical bubble chamber resolution. So maybe I messed up units somewhere? 

Wait, let's check the energy. The problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy of the X^0 particle or the kinetic energy? 

If it's the total energy, then gamma = E / m = 27 / 3.41. If it's the kinetic energy, then gamma would be (K + m c²)/m c². But since they just say "energy", maybe it's total energy. But in high-energy physics, sometimes energy is given as kinetic. Wait, but the mass is 3.41 GeV, so if the total energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If it's kinetic energy, then K = 27 GeV = (gamma - 1) m c². Then, gamma = 1 + 27 / 3.41 ≈ 1 + 7.917 ≈ 8.917. Hmm, that would change the result. 

Wait, the problem states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". Maybe that refers to the rest energy? No, rest energy would be m c², which is 3.41 GeV. So probably, 27 GeV is the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic energy. The problem is ambiguous. Hmm. 

Wait, in particle physics, when they say "the energy of the beam" or "the energy in the detector", it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, for particles, they might refer to total energy. Let me check. 

If the energy is the total energy, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If it's the kinetic energy, then gamma is (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. 

Wait, but the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Since the X^0 is moving in the

# Anthropic completion

Let me analyze this problem regarding a particle decay. We have a particle X^0 decaying into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime of 8e-16 seconds. I need to determine the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and X^0 has a mass of 3.41 GeV.

I recall that proper lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame, but in the laboratory frame (Bubble Chamber), this lifetime experiences relativistic dilation. The resolution needed relates to the distance the particle travels before decaying, as we need to resolve this distance to observe the decay.

To find the average travel distance, I'll multiply the particle's speed by its dilated lifetime. Since decay follows an exponential law, the probability of decay after time t is 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where τ is the dilated lifetime. For 30% of decays, I need to find t where 1 - e^{-t/τ} = 0.3, which gives t = -τ ln(0.7).

First, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor gamma. Assuming 27 GeV represents the particle's total energy, gamma = E/m = 27 GeV/3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.

The dilated lifetime becomes τ_lab = gamma × τ_0 = 7.917 × 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3336e-15 s.

For the particle's speed, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1-v²/c²), I can solve for v/c (beta). With gamma = 7.917, I calculate beta = sqrt(1-1/gamma²) = sqrt(1-1/62.68) = sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c.

For 30% decay probability, t = -τ_lab × ln(0.7) ≈ 6.3336e-15 s × 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s.

The distance traveled is L = v × t = 0.992c × 2.26e-15 s ≈ 0.992 × 3e8 m/s × 2.26e-15 s ≈ 2.976e8 × 2.26e-15 ≈ 6.726e-7 meters, which equals approximately 672.6 nanometers.

This result seems small considering bubble chambers typically have resolutions in micrometers or millimeters. I should verify my calculations and interpretation of the given energy.

If 27 GeV represents kinetic energy rather than total energy, then gamma would be (K+mc²)/mc² = 1+K/mc² = 1+27/3.41 ≈ 8.917, which would change my result. The problem statement "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV" is somewhat ambiguous - it could refer to total energy or kinetic energy, both interpretations being plausible in particle physics contexts.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I'll try to solve this problem. We have a particle X^0 decaying into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime of 8e-16 seconds. The task is to determine the minimum resolution required to detect at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

First, I recall that the proper lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime will appear longer. The needed resolution should correspond to the distance traveled by the particle before decaying. If the detector can't distinguish this distance, the decay might not be observed.

We need to compute the average distance the particle travels before it decays, which involves multiplying the speed by the dilated lifetime. The detector's spatial resolution must be at least this distance to observe the decay. To detect at least 30% of the decays, consider the mean path length and use a probability distribution to find the distance that covers 30% of the decays.

Recall that the lifetime follows an exponential decay law: the probability of decay after time t is 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where τ is the dilated lifetime. For at least 30% decay detection, solve for t: 1 - e^{-t/τ} = 0.3, giving t = -τ ln(0.7). The distance is the speed multiplied by this time, determining the necessary resolution.

First, calculate the Lorentz factor gamma; the dilated lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. With the total energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV and the mass as 3.41 GeV, and assuming the energy represents the total energy of X^0, then E = gamma * m, so gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.

Now, compute the dilated lifetime τ_lab = gamma * τ_0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3336e-15 s.

For velocity v, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), calculate beta = v/c. With gamma ≈ 7.917, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Therefore, 1 - 1/62.68 ≈ 0.98405; beta ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c.

Now, solve for the time t for a 30% decay probability: t = -τ_lab * ln(0.7) ≈ 6.3336e-15 s * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s.

Then, the distance L = v * t = 0.992c * 2.26e-15 s. With c ≈ 3e8 m/s, L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s. Calculating gives L ≈ 6.726e-7 meters, approximately 672.6 nanometers or 0.672 micrometers.

Check if this resolution is reasonable. Bubble chambers usually have resolutions in the micrometer range, suggesting the necessary resolution here is smaller. The energy was given as 27 GeV, assumed total. If it's kinetic, gamma would be larger, potentially affecting final results, but based on given data, total energy seems correct.

This calculation suggests a very fine resolution, possibly indicating an error in assumptions or context, if bubble chamber capabilities are indeed less precise.

But to be sure, maybe we need to check both possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 27 GeV is the center-of-mass energy? But no, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber", so probably the lab frame energy. \n\nWait, but let\'s think: if X^0 is produced at rest, then it would decay in its rest frame with lifetime tau_0. But in the Bubble Chamber, the X^0 is moving, so it must have been produced with some energy. The problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So probably, that\'s the total energy of the X^0 particle. \n\nBut let\'s verify. If the total energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If the kinetic energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 8.918. Depending on which it is, gamma could be different. \n\nBut let\'s see, if we take 27 GeV as total energy, then gamma is ~8, speed is ~0.992c. If gamma is ~8.918, then beta would be even closer to 1. Let\'s compute that. \n\nIf gamma is 8.918, then 1/gamma² ≈ 1/(8.918)^2 ≈ 1/79.53 ≈ 0.01257. So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.01257) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937. So v ≈ 0.9937c. \n\nSo even if gamma is 8.9, the speed is only a bit higher. Let\'s see how much difference that makes. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting us to take 27 GeV as the total energy, so gamma ≈ 7.917. Let\'s proceed with that, but note that if it\'s kinetic energy, the answer would be a bit different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is per particle? Wait, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Maybe it\'s the collision energy? But the X^0 is the product of a collision? Hmm, not sure. Maybe the problem is a bit ambiguous, but given that the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, it\'s likely the total energy of X^0. So gamma = E / m = 27 / 3.41. \n\nSo proceeding with gamma ≈7.917, beta≈0.992, dilated lifetime≈6.33e-15 s. \n\nThen, for 30% of the decays, t= -tau_lab * ln(0.7)≈6.33e-15 *0.356≈2.26e-15 s. \n\nThen, L = v t =0.992 *3e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s≈6.72e-7 m≈672 nm. \n\nThat\'s 0.672 micrometers. \n\nBut bubble chambers have resolutions typically on the order of 100 micrometers (which is 0.1 mm). So 0.67 micrometers is much smaller than that. That would imply that the required resolution is higher than typical bubble chambers. But maybe in some cases, they can do better? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let\'s check again. \n\nWait, 3e8 m/s is 3e8 meters per second. 2.26e-15 seconds. So multiplying 3e8 *2.26e-15 = 6.78e-7 meters. Then times 0.992 gives approximately 6.72e-7 meters. So 672 nanometers. \n\nYes, that\'s correct. \n\nBut if the resolution required is 672 nm, that\'s 0.672 micrometers. Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting the answer in meters, centimeters, millimeters, or micrometers? \n\nBut bubble chambers can\'t resolve nanometers. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach? \n\nWait, maybe the question is about the length contraction? Wait, no. The decay happens in the lab frame, so the lifetime is dilated. The distance is gamma * v * tau_0. Wait, actually, wait. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the average distance is gamma v tau_0. But then, if we want 30% of the decays, which would correspond to a certain fraction of the mean path length. \n\nWait, the mean path length is L_avg = gamma v tau_0. Then, the probability distribution for decay length is f(L) = (1 / L_avg) e^{-L / L_avg}. \n\nTherefore, the cumulative distribution function is P(L < x) = 1 - e^{-x / L_avg}. \n\nSo setting this equal to 0.3: 1 - e^{-x / L_avg} = 0.3 => e^{-x / L_avg} = 0.7 => -x / L_avg = ln(0.7) => x = - L_avg ln(0.7). \n\nBut L_avg = gamma v tau_0. So x = - gamma v tau_0 ln(0.7). \n\nWait, but this is the same as before. So x = v t, where t = - gamma tau_0 ln(0.7). So that\'s the same as before. \n\nBut then, perhaps the problem is just asking for the average decay length? Wait, no, because average decay length would correspond to L_avg = gamma v tau_0 ≈7.917 *0.992c *8e-16 s. \n\nWait, let\'s compute that: \n\ngamma v tau_0 =7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s. \n\nFirst, 7.917 *0.992 ≈7.85. \n\nThen, 3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7. \n\nMultiply by 7.85: 7.85 *2.4e-7≈1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884 micrometers. \n\nSo average decay length is ~1.88 micrometers. Then, to observe 30% of the decays, we need to resolve distances up to x = - L_avg ln(0.7) ≈1.88e-6 m *0.356≈6.69e-7 meters≈0.669 micrometers. \n\nSo similar to before. \n\nBut again, this is sub-micrometer. Bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers. So unless there\'s a miscalculation here, perhaps the problem is expecting a different interpretation. \n\nWait, maybe the energy given is not the total energy but the kinetic energy. Let\'s try that. \n\nIf the kinetic energy K =27 GeV, then total energy E = K + m =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. Then, gamma = E / m =30.41 /3.41≈8.918. \n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2))≈sqrt(1 -1/(8.918)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.01257)=sqrt(0.9874)=approx0.9937. \n\nThen, tau_lab=gamma tau0=8.918 *8e-16≈7.134e-15 s. \n\nThen, t= - tau_lab ln(0.7)=7.134e-15 *0.356≈2.54e-15 s. \n\nThen, L =v t=0.9937 *3e8 *2.54e-15≈0.9937 *7.62e-7≈7.57e-7 meters≈757 nanometers≈0.757 micrometers. \n\nStill, same order of magnitude. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in natural units where c=1, but we need to convert properly. Wait, the mass is given in GeV, which is GeV/c². The energy is in GeV, which is GeV c² (since E=gamma m c²). So when they say energy is 27 GeV, that\'s E=27 GeV c². The mass is m=3.41 GeV/c². Then, gamma = E / (m c²) * c²? Wait, no. Wait, in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c². So E = gamma m c². But if we set c=1, then E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m. So in natural units, yes, gamma = 27 /3.41≈7.917. Then, when converting to regular units, we need to consider c. \n\nBut when calculating the distance, L = v gamma tau0. But tau0 is given in seconds. So we need to multiply by c to get the distance. Wait, no. Wait, in natural units, c=1, so time and distance are related by c. But here, we have to compute L = v tau_lab. \n\nWait, tau_lab is gamma tau0, which is in seconds, and v is in meters per second. So L is v * gamma tau0. \n\nBut in any case, regardless of natural units or not, the calculation seems consistent. \n\nBut 0.67 micrometers is still too small. Maybe the problem is expecting the resolution to be the mean path length? If we need to observe 30% of decays, maybe the resolution should be equal to the mean path length multiplied by some factor. \n\nBut according to the exponential distribution, 63% of decays occur within one mean lifetime. So 30% is less than the mean. So the required resolution is less than the mean path length. \n\nBut according to the calculation, to observe 30% of the decays, you need a resolution of ~0.67 micrometers. But bubble chambers can\'t do that. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question? Maybe it\'s not considering relativistic effects? Let\'s check. \n\nIf we naively compute the distance as v * tau0, where v is non-relativistic. But the speed would be much less. But given that the energy is 27 GeV, which is way higher than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are significant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the lab frame energy to calculate the velocity using classical mechanics? That would be wrong, but maybe as a check. \n\nIf we do kinetic energy = (1/2)mv². But with K=27 GeV and m=3.41 GeV/c². \n\nBut K = (gamma -1) m c². If we use classical, K=(1/2)mv². Let\'s see: \n\nIn natural units where c=1, K=(1/2) m v². So v= sqrt(2K/m). \n\nBut K=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV/c². Wait, but units are messy. \n\nWait, if we use K=27 GeV =27e9 eV, m=3.41 GeV/c²=3.41e9 eV/c². Then, classical speed v= sqrt(2K/m). \n\nBut this would be v= sqrt(2*27e9 eV /3.41e9 eV/c²)=sqrt(2*27 /3.41) c≈sqrt(15.835) c≈3.98c. Which is faster than light, so impossible. So classical mechanics is invalid here. \n\nThus, we must use relativistic equations. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, but the result is surprisingly small. Maybe the problem is in different units? Let me check the unit conversions again. \n\nTau0 is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nGamma is ~8. \n\nTau_lab is ~6.3e-15 seconds. \n\nv is ~0.993c. \n\nt=2.26e-15 seconds. \n\nL=0.993 *3e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s=0.993*3*2.26 *1e-7=0.993*6.78e-7≈6.73e-7 meters=673 nm. \n\nYes, that\'s right. \n\nBut if the answer is expected in meters, it\'s 6.73e-7 meters. Or 673 nanometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert to centimeters: 6.73e-5 cm, which is 0.0000673 cm. \n\nBut bubble chambers can\'t resolve that. So maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps the energy is given per particle, but it\'s a collider? Wait, maybe the X^0 is moving at a speed such that its kinetic energy is 27 GeV. Wait, but even then, the gamma would be as we calculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is the center-of-mass energy? But the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber", which is the lab frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay products Y+ and Z- are charged particles, and the resolution refers to the ability to detect the vertex separation. But even so, the displacement is 0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut maybe the answer is in the lab frame\'s gamma multiplied by c tau0. Wait, gamma c tau0 is the mean path length. Which is 7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.917*2.4e-8=1.9e-7 meters≈0.19 micrometers. Wait, no, that\'s different. Wait, 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-8, multiplied by 7.917≈1.9e-7 meters, which is 0.19 micrometers. Wait, but earlier we had L_avg=gamma v tau0=7.917*0.992c *8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. So which is correct? \n\nWait, gamma c tau0 is the mean path length if the particle were moving at c. But since it\'s moving at v=0.992c, then L_avg=gamma v tau0. So gamma c tau0 would be an overestimate. But actually, L_avg=gamma v tau0. So in this case, v=0.992c, so L_avg=gamma v tau0≈7.917*0.992c *8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. \n\nBut earlier, when calculating for 30% decays, we got 0.67 micrometers. \n\nSo the mean path length is 1.88 micrometers. To observe 30% of the decays, you need to resolve 0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is asking for the mean path length, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". So the resolution should be at least the distance within which 30% of the decays happen, which we found to be ~0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut given that bubble chambers can\'t resolve that, maybe the answer is expecting a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is not considering relativistic speeds? Let\'s try that. \n\nIf we ignore relativity, then the lifetime is tau0=8e-16 s. \n\nThe speed is determined via kinetic energy. But as before, with K=27 GeV, but that leads to speed exceeding c. So invalid. \n\nAlternatively, if the energy is total energy, then gamma=1, which would mean v=0, which is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using velocity from momentum? \n\nIf we have energy E=27 GeV, mass m=3.41 GeV, then the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². \n\nSo p = sqrt(E² - m²)/c. \n\nIn natural units where c=1, p = sqrt(27² -3.41²)≈sqrt(729 -11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThen, beta = p c / E = (26.78 GeV/c *c)/27 GeV =26.78 /27≈0.992, which matches our previous calculation. \n\nSo velocity is still 0.992c. \n\nSo the calculation seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, unless there\'s a misunderstanding in the problem\'s wording, the required resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut since the problem is from a textbook or an exam, perhaps there is a different approach. Let me check the formula for the decay length. \n\nThe decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau0. \n\nWhich is the same as gamma*v*tau0. \n\nThen, the probability that the decay occurs within length L is P = 1 - exp(-L / (gamma beta c tau0)). Wait, but L = gamma beta c tau0 * x, where x is some multiple. Then P =1 - exp(-x). So to have P=0.3, x= -ln(0.7)=0.3566. \n\nTherefore, L=0.3566 * gamma beta c tau0. \n\nBut gamma beta c tau0 is the mean decay length. So L=0.3566 * mean decay length. \n\nBut the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau0≈7.917*0.992*3e8*8e-16≈1.88e-6 meters. \n\nThen, 0.3566*1.88e-6≈6.72e-7 meters, same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nanometers. \n\nConverting to more standard units, that\'s 0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut bubble chambers typically have a resolution of about 100 micrometers (0.1 mm), which is much larger. Therefore, this seems inconsistent. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is not referring to spatial resolution but to time resolution? Because if you can measure the time of the decay with sufficient precision, you can observe it. But bubble chambers detect ionized tracks, so the spatial resolution is what\'s important. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed, without considering gamma? Let\'s check. \n\nIf someone naively does L = v tau0 =0.992c *8e-16 s≈0.992*3e8*8e-16≈2.38e-8 meters≈23.8 nanometers. But even that is way too small. \n\nAlternatively, if they forget to multiply by gamma, but use lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau0. So L= v gamma tau0≈0.992c *7.917*8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. \n\nBut even 1.88 micrometers is still too small for a bubble chamber. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon or something else? But the problem states the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in reverse. If you need to observe 30% of the decays, the resolution should be such that the uncertainty in the position is less than the decay length. But I think the way we did it is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the length contraction, but that would be shorter, not longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting time resolution. If the decay time is tau_lab≈6.3e-15 s, but to observe 30% you need to measure times on the order of 2.26e-15 s. But I don\'t know how time resolution relates to detecting decays. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the proper lifetime and the velocity to compute L = v tau0, but that would be 0.992c *8e-16≈23.8 nanometers. But that\'s even smaller. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem made a mistake in the numbers? For example, if the proper lifetime was 8e-10 seconds instead of 8e-16, then the decay length would be 0.67 meters, which would make sense. But the given proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is 27 MeV instead of GeV? Then gamma would be 27 /3.41≈7.9, same as before. Wait, no, 27 MeV divided by 3.41 GeV would be 0.0079, which is non-relativistic. So, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass is 3.41 MeV? Then gamma=27e3 /3.41≈7917, which would give a huge gamma. But the problem states 3.41 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in different units. If the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds, but maybe it\'s 8e-10? Then, the decay length would be 0.67 millimeters. That would make sense. But since the problem says 8e-16, which is typical for weak decays, but maybe a typo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to present the answer as 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nm, and that\'s the answer. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an error, but given the numbers, this is the result. \n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting into meters, 6.7 x10^-7 meters. \n\nBut to present the answer properly, maybe in centimeters: 6.7e-5 cm, which is 0.000067 cm. But that\'s still 0.67 micrometers. \n\nAlternatively, in millimeters: 6.7e-4 mm, which is 0.00067 mm. \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in meters with scientific notation. So 6.7e-7 meters. \n\nAlternatively, using the proper number of significant figures. The given values are 27 GeV (two significant figures), 3.41 GeV (three significant figures), and 8e-16 s (one significant figure). So the least number is one significant figure, but the answer probably should have two. \n\nBut the proper lifetime is given as 8x10^-16, which is one significant figure. So the answer should be one significant figure? \n\nBut the calculation gives 6.7e-7, which is two. If we take one significant figure, it\'s 7e-7 meters. \n\nAlternatively, since 8 is one sig fig, 27 is two, 3.41 is three. Maybe the answer should be two sig figs. \n\nBut in high-energy physics, sometimes they are lenient with sig figs. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is expected in micrometers, so 0.67 micrometers. \n\nBut given that the problem is in the context of a bubble chamber, which I think typically has a resolution of ~100 micrometers, this result seems inconsistent. However, given the numbers provided, this is the calculation. \n\nTherefore, unless there is a misunderstanding, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \\boxed{6.7 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387356, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5588, prompt_tokens=2041, total_tokens=7629, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we need to consider the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and the distance it travels before decaying.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   The total energy of \( X^0 \) is 27 GeV, and its rest mass is 3.41 GeV. The Lorentz factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Calculate the dilated lifetime (\(\tau_{\text{lab}}\))**:
   The proper lifetime \(\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}\). The dilated lifetime in the lab frame is:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 \approx 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Determine the velocity (\(v\))**:
   Using the Lorentz factor, the velocity \(v\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.917^2}} \approx 0.992
   \]
   \[
   v \approx 0.992c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time for 30% decay probability**:
   The probability of decay within time \(t\) is \(1 - e^{-t/\tau_{\text{lab}}}\). Setting this equal to 0.3:
   \[
   t = -\tau_{\text{lab}} \ln(1 - 0.3) \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \times 0.3567 \approx 2.26 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

5. **Calculate the decay distance (\(L\))**:
   The distance traveled by the particle in this time is:
   \[
   L = v \times t \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.26 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \approx 6.726 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Bubble Chamber, perhaps the energy given is the total energy. But to be sure, maybe we need to check both possibilities. 

Alternatively, maybe the 27 GeV is the center-of-mass energy? But no, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber", so probably the lab frame energy. 

Wait, but let's think: if X^0 is produced at rest, then it would decay in its rest frame with lifetime tau_0. But in the Bubble Chamber, the X^0 is moving, so it must have been produced with some energy. The problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So probably, that's the total energy of the X^0 particle. 

But let's verify. If the total energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. If the kinetic energy is 27 GeV, then gamma is (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 8.918. Depending on which it is, gamma could be different. 

But let's see, if we take 27 GeV as total energy, then gamma is ~8, speed is ~0.992c. If gamma is ~8.918, then beta would be even closer to 1. Let's compute that. 

If gamma is 8.918, then 1/gamma² ≈ 1/(8.918)^2 ≈ 1/79.53 ≈ 0.01257. So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.01257) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937. So v ≈ 0.9937c. 

So even if gamma is 8.9, the speed is only a bit higher. Let's see how much difference that makes. 

But perhaps the problem is expecting us to take 27 GeV as the total energy, so gamma ≈ 7.917. Let's proceed with that, but note that if it's kinetic energy, the answer would be a bit different. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy is per particle? Wait, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Maybe it's the collision energy? But the X^0 is the product of a collision? Hmm, not sure. Maybe the problem is a bit ambiguous, but given that the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, it's likely the total energy of X^0. So gamma = E / m = 27 / 3.41. 

So proceeding with gamma ≈7.917, beta≈0.992, dilated lifetime≈6.33e-15 s. 

Then, for 30% of the decays, t= -tau_lab * ln(0.7)≈6.33e-15 *0.356≈2.26e-15 s. 

Then, L = v t =0.992 *3e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s≈6.72e-7 m≈672 nm. 

That's 0.672 micrometers. 

But bubble chambers have resolutions typically on the order of 100 micrometers (which is 0.1 mm). So 0.67 micrometers is much smaller than that. That would imply that the required resolution is higher than typical bubble chambers. But maybe in some cases, they can do better? 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's check again. 

Wait, 3e8 m/s is 3e8 meters per second. 2.26e-15 seconds. So multiplying 3e8 *2.26e-15 = 6.78e-7 meters. Then times 0.992 gives approximately 6.72e-7 meters. So 672 nanometers. 

Yes, that's correct. 

But if the resolution required is 672 nm, that's 0.672 micrometers. Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting the answer in meters, centimeters, millimeters, or micrometers? 

But bubble chambers can't resolve nanometers. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach? 

Wait, maybe the question is about the length contraction? Wait, no. The decay happens in the lab frame, so the lifetime is dilated. The distance is gamma * v * tau_0. Wait, actually, wait. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the average distance is gamma v tau_0. But then, if we want 30% of the decays, which would correspond to a certain fraction of the mean path length. 

Wait, the mean path length is L_avg = gamma v tau_0. Then, the probability distribution for decay length is f(L) = (1 / L_avg) e^{-L / L_avg}. 

Therefore, the cumulative distribution function is P(L < x) = 1 - e^{-x / L_avg}. 

So setting this equal to 0.3: 1 - e^{-x / L_avg} = 0.3 => e^{-x / L_avg} = 0.7 => -x / L_avg = ln(0.7) => x = - L_avg ln(0.7). 

But L_avg = gamma v tau_0. So x = - gamma v tau_0 ln(0.7). 

Wait, but this is the same as before. So x = v t, where t = - gamma tau_0 ln(0.7). So that's the same as before. 

But then, perhaps the problem is just asking for the average decay length? Wait, no, because average decay length would correspond to L_avg = gamma v tau_0 ≈7.917 *0.992c *8e-16 s. 

Wait, let's compute that: 

gamma v tau_0 =7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s. 

First, 7.917 *0.992 ≈7.85. 

Then, 3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7. 

Multiply by 7.85: 7.85 *2.4e-7≈1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884 micrometers. 

So average decay length is ~1.88 micrometers. Then, to observe 30% of the decays, we need to resolve distances up to x = - L_avg ln(0.7) ≈1.88e-6 m *0.356≈6.69e-7 meters≈0.669 micrometers. 

So similar to before. 

But again, this is sub-micrometer. Bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers. So unless there's a miscalculation here, perhaps the problem is expecting a different interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the energy given is not the total energy but the kinetic energy. Let's try that. 

If the kinetic energy K =27 GeV, then total energy E = K + m =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. Then, gamma = E / m =30.41 /3.41≈8.918. 

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2))≈sqrt(1 -1/(8.918)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.01257)=sqrt(0.9874)=approx0.9937. 

Then, tau_lab=gamma tau0=8.918 *8e-16≈7.134e-15 s. 

Then, t= - tau_lab ln(0.7)=7.134e-15 *0.356≈2.54e-15 s. 

Then, L =v t=0.9937 *3e8 *2.54e-15≈0.9937 *7.62e-7≈7.57e-7 meters≈757 nanometers≈0.757 micrometers. 

Still, same order of magnitude. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in natural units where c=1, but we need to convert properly. Wait, the mass is given in GeV, which is GeV/c². The energy is in GeV, which is GeV c² (since E=gamma m c²). So when they say energy is 27 GeV, that's E=27 GeV c². The mass is m=3.41 GeV/c². Then, gamma = E / (m c²) * c²? Wait, no. Wait, in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c². So E = gamma m c². But if we set c=1, then E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m. So in natural units, yes, gamma = 27 /3.41≈7.917. Then, when converting to regular units, we need to consider c. 

But when calculating the distance, L = v gamma tau0. But tau0 is given in seconds. So we need to multiply by c to get the distance. Wait, no. Wait, in natural units, c=1, so time and distance are related by c. But here, we have to compute L = v tau_lab. 

Wait, tau_lab is gamma tau0, which is in seconds, and v is in meters per second. So L is v * gamma tau0. 

But in any case, regardless of natural units or not, the calculation seems consistent. 

But 0.67 micrometers is still too small. Maybe the problem is expecting the resolution to be the mean path length? If we need to observe 30% of decays, maybe the resolution should be equal to the mean path length multiplied by some factor. 

But according to the exponential distribution, 63% of decays occur within one mean lifetime. So 30% is less than the mean. So the required resolution is less than the mean path length. 

But according to the calculation, to observe 30% of the decays, you need a resolution of ~0.67 micrometers. But bubble chambers can't do that. 

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question? Maybe it's not considering relativistic effects? Let's check. 

If we naively compute the distance as v * tau0, where v is non-relativistic. But the speed would be much less. But given that the energy is 27 GeV, which is way higher than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are significant. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the lab frame energy to calculate the velocity using classical mechanics? That would be wrong, but maybe as a check. 

If we do kinetic energy = (1/2)mv². But with K=27 GeV and m=3.41 GeV/c². 

But K = (gamma -1) m c². If we use classical, K=(1/2)mv². Let's see: 

In natural units where c=1, K=(1/2) m v². So v= sqrt(2K/m). 

But K=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV/c². Wait, but units are messy. 

Wait, if we use K=27 GeV =27e9 eV, m=3.41 GeV/c²=3.41e9 eV/c². Then, classical speed v= sqrt(2K/m). 

But this would be v= sqrt(2*27e9 eV /3.41e9 eV/c²)=sqrt(2*27 /3.41) c≈sqrt(15.835) c≈3.98c. Which is faster than light, so impossible. So classical mechanics is invalid here. 

Thus, we must use relativistic equations. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct, but the result is surprisingly small. Maybe the problem is in different units? Let me check the unit conversions again. 

Tau0 is 8e-16 seconds. 

Gamma is ~8. 

Tau_lab is ~6.3e-15 seconds. 

v is ~0.993c. 

t=2.26e-15 seconds. 

L=0.993 *3e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s=0.993*3*2.26 *1e-7=0.993*6.78e-7≈6.73e-7 meters=673 nm. 

Yes, that's right. 

But if the answer is expected in meters, it's 6.73e-7 meters. Or 673 nanometers. 

Alternatively, maybe convert to centimeters: 6.73e-5 cm, which is 0.0000673 cm. 

But bubble chambers can't resolve that. So maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps the energy is given per particle, but it's a collider? Wait, maybe the X^0 is moving at a speed such that its kinetic energy is 27 GeV. Wait, but even then, the gamma would be as we calculated earlier. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy is the center-of-mass energy? But the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber", which is the lab frame. 

Alternatively, perhaps the decay products Y+ and Z- are charged particles, and the resolution refers to the ability to detect the vertex separation. But even so, the displacement is 0.67 micrometers. 

But maybe the answer is in the lab frame's gamma multiplied by c tau0. Wait, gamma c tau0 is the mean path length. Which is 7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.917*2.4e-8=1.9e-7 meters≈0.19 micrometers. Wait, no, that's different. Wait, 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-8, multiplied by 7.917≈1.9e-7 meters, which is 0.19 micrometers. Wait, but earlier we had L_avg=gamma v tau0=7.917*0.992c *8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. So which is correct? 

Wait, gamma c tau0 is the mean path length if the particle were moving at c. But since it's moving at v=0.992c, then L_avg=gamma v tau0. So gamma c tau0 would be an overestimate. But actually, L_avg=gamma v tau0. So in this case, v=0.992c, so L_avg=gamma v tau0≈7.917*0.992c *8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. 

But earlier, when calculating for 30% decays, we got 0.67 micrometers. 

So the mean path length is 1.88 micrometers. To observe 30% of the decays, you need to resolve 0.67 micrometers. 

But perhaps the problem is asking for the mean path length, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". So the resolution should be at least the distance within which 30% of the decays happen, which we found to be ~0.67 micrometers. 

But given that bubble chambers can't resolve that, maybe the answer is expecting a different approach. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not considering relativistic speeds? Let's try that. 

If we ignore relativity, then the lifetime is tau0=8e-16 s. 

The speed is determined via kinetic energy. But as before, with K=27 GeV, but that leads to speed exceeding c. So invalid. 

Alternatively, if the energy is total energy, then gamma=1, which would mean v=0, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using velocity from momentum? 

If we have energy E=27 GeV, mass m=3.41 GeV, then the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². 

So p = sqrt(E² - m²)/c. 

In natural units where c=1, p = sqrt(27² -3.41²)≈sqrt(729 -11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c. 

Then, beta = p c / E = (26.78 GeV/c *c)/27 GeV =26.78 /27≈0.992, which matches our previous calculation. 

So velocity is still 0.992c. 

So the calculation seems consistent. 

Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem's wording, the required resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. 

But since the problem is from a textbook or an exam, perhaps there is a different approach. Let me check the formula for the decay length. 

The decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau0. 

Which is the same as gamma*v*tau0. 

Then, the probability that the decay occurs within length L is P = 1 - exp(-L / (gamma beta c tau0)). Wait, but L = gamma beta c tau0 * x, where x is some multiple. Then P =1 - exp(-x). So to have P=0.3, x= -ln(0.7)=0.3566. 

Therefore, L=0.3566 * gamma beta c tau0. 

But gamma beta c tau0 is the mean decay length. So L=0.3566 * mean decay length. 

But the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau0≈7.917*0.992*3e8*8e-16≈1.88e-6 meters. 

Then, 0.3566*1.88e-6≈6.72e-7 meters, same as before. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nanometers. 

Converting to more standard units, that's 0.67 micrometers. 

But bubble chambers typically have a resolution of about 100 micrometers (0.1 mm), which is much larger. Therefore, this seems inconsistent. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is not referring to spatial resolution but to time resolution? Because if you can measure the time of the decay with sufficient precision, you can observe it. But bubble chambers detect ionized tracks, so the spatial resolution is what's important. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed, without considering gamma? Let's check. 

If someone naively does L = v tau0 =0.992c *8e-16 s≈0.992*3e8*8e-16≈2.38e-8 meters≈23.8 nanometers. But even that is way too small. 

Alternatively, if they forget to multiply by gamma, but use lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau0. So L= v gamma tau0≈0.992c *7.917*8e-16≈1.88 micrometers. 

But even 1.88 micrometers is still too small for a bubble chamber. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon or something else? But the problem states the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in reverse. If you need to observe 30% of the decays, the resolution should be such that the uncertainty in the position is less than the decay length. But I think the way we did it is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the length contraction, but that would be shorter, not longer. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting time resolution. If the decay time is tau_lab≈6.3e-15 s, but to observe 30% you need to measure times on the order of 2.26e-15 s. But I don't know how time resolution relates to detecting decays. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the proper lifetime and the velocity to compute L = v tau0, but that would be 0.992c *8e-16≈23.8 nanometers. But that's even smaller. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem made a mistake in the numbers? For example, if the proper lifetime was 8e-10 seconds instead of 8e-16, then the decay length would be 0.67 meters, which would make sense. But the given proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy is 27 MeV instead of GeV? Then gamma would be 27 /3.41≈7.9, same as before. Wait, no, 27 MeV divided by 3.41 GeV would be 0.0079, which is non-relativistic. So, no. 

Alternatively, maybe the mass is 3.41 MeV? Then gamma=27e3 /3.41≈7917, which would give a huge gamma. But the problem states 3.41 GeV. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in different units. If the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds, but maybe it's 8e-10? Then, the decay length would be 0.67 millimeters. That would make sense. But since the problem says 8e-16, which is typical for weak decays, but maybe a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to present the answer as 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nm, and that's the answer. 

Alternatively, the problem might have an error, but given the numbers, this is the result. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting into meters, 6.7 x10^-7 meters. 

But to present the answer properly, maybe in centimeters: 6.7e-5 cm, which is 0.000067 cm. But that's still 0.67 micrometers. 

Alternatively, in millimeters: 6.7e-4 mm, which is 0.00067 mm. 

But the problem might expect the answer in meters with scientific notation. So 6.7e-7 meters. 

Alternatively, using the proper number of significant figures. The given values are 27 GeV (two significant figures), 3.41 GeV (three significant figures), and 8e-16 s (one significant figure). So the least number is one significant figure, but the answer probably should have two. 

But the proper lifetime is given as 8x10^-16, which is one significant figure. So the answer should be one significant figure? 

But the calculation gives 6.7e-7, which is two. If we take one significant figure, it's 7e-7 meters. 

Alternatively, since 8 is one sig fig, 27 is two, 3.41 is three. Maybe the answer should be two sig figs. 

But in high-energy physics, sometimes they are lenient with sig figs. 

Alternatively, the answer is expected in micrometers, so 0.67 micrometers. 

But given that the problem is in the context of a bubble chamber, which I think typically has a resolution of ~100 micrometers, this result seems inconsistent. However, given the numbers provided, this is the calculation. 

Therefore, unless there is a misunderstanding, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers. 

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}}.

Gamma = E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917. Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. Then, the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.33e-15 s. The time for 30% decay is tau_lab * ln(1/(1-0.3)) ≈ 6.33e-15 * 0.3567 ≈ 2.26e-15 s. Then, distance L = beta*c*t ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 * 2.26e-15 = 0.992 * 6.78e-7 ≈ 6.73e-7 meters, which is 673 nanometers. That\'s 0.673 micrometers. Bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers, so 0.67 micrometers seems challenging. But maybe the problem expects a more approximate calculation, or perhaps there\'s a different consideration.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation of the 27 GeV. If the X^0 is produced at rest, then its energy would just be its rest mass, but that doesn\'t make sense here. The problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Perhaps that\'s the kinetic energy of the X^0? If that\'s the case, then total energy E = K + m = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma would be E/m = 30.41/3.41 ≈ 8.917. Then beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(8.917^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.51) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.\n\nThen, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 8.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.13e-15 s.\n\nTime for 30% decay: t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7) ≈ 7.13e-15 * 0.3567 ≈ 2.54e-15 s.\n\nDistance L = beta*c*t ≈ 0.9937 * 3e8 * 2.54e-15 ≈ 0.9937 * 7.62e-7 ≈ 7.57e-7 m, which is 0.757 micrometers. Still around the same order of magnitude. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum? If the X^0 is moving with energy E = 27 GeV, but its rest mass is 3.41 GeV, then gamma would be E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917 as before. So perhaps my initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut the answer of around 0.67 micrometers seems very small for a bubble chamber\'s resolution. From what I remember, bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers (0.1 mm) or better. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, which is 1000 nanometers. So 0.67 micrometers is 670 nanometers, which is 0.67 micrometers, which is 670 nm. But typical bubble chambers can resolve tracks down to maybe 50-100 micrometers (50,000-100,000 nanometers). So 0.67 micrometers would be beyond their resolution. Hmm, that suggests maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement. The question is: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" So the resolution here refers to the spatial resolution required to detect the decay vertex. The idea is that if the particle decays after traveling a certain distance, the detector must be able to resolve that distance from the production point to see the decay as a displaced vertex. If the decay length is shorter than the detector\'s resolution, then most decays would not be observed as separate from the production point.\n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution needed would correspond to the average decay length multiplied by some factor related to the 30% observation. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I calculated the time required for 30% of the particles to decay, which gives a certain decay length. However, maybe the problem is phrased such that the resolution should be such that the decay length is at least equal to the resolution to observe 30% of the decays. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0, and the probability that a decay occurs within a length L is 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. So to have 30% probability, set 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.3, so L = - gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(0.7). Wait, that\'s the same as before.\n\nWait, but in this case, L would be the decay length required such that 30% of the particles have decayed by that point, so the detector needs to resolve this length. So the resolution must be better than L to observe those decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution required would be L, because if the resolution is worse than L, you can\'t distinguish decays that happen within L. Wait, but actually, if the resolution is ΔL, then you can only see decay vertices that are separated by more than ΔL from the production point. So the number of observable decays would be the integral from ΔL to infinity of the decay probability distribution. Wait, maybe this is a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might simply be asking for the average decay length multiplied by gamma beta c tau_0, but given that we need to have 30% of the decays observed, perhaps the required resolution is the average decay length multiplied by the factor such that 30% of the decays occur beyond that distance, requiring the resolution to be at least that distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean path length multiplied by some factor. Let me check the standard approach.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays after a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}. The average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance L from the production point. The detector\'s resolution ΔL must be such that decays occurring at L >= ΔL can be distinguished from the production point, allowing us to observe them. However, the problem states "observe at least 30% of the decays". So we need that the fraction of decays occurring at distances greater than ΔL is 30%. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the total number of decays observed would be the integral from 0 to infinity of the decay probability, but if the detector can\'t resolve decay lengths below ΔL, then the number of observed decays would be the integral from ΔL to infinity. Therefore, we need that integral to be 30% of the total possible decays. Wait, but that would mean that the observed decays are 30% of the total. So the required ΔL would satisfy:\n\nIntegral from ΔL to ∞ of (1/(gamma beta c tau_0)) e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} dL = 0.3\n\nWhich is equivalent to e^{-ΔL/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7\n\nTherefore, ΔL = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the previous calculation. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is ΔL = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)\n\nSo substituting the numbers:\n\ngamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01596) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992\n\ntau_0 = 8e-16 s\n\nThen:\n\nΔL = - 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s * ln(0.7)\n\nFirst compute gamma * beta * c * tau_0:\n\n7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.853\n\n7.853 * 3e8 ≈ 2.356e9 m/s\n\n2.356e9 m/s * 8e-16 s ≈ 1.885e-6 meters (≈ 1.885 micrometers)\n\nThen multiply by -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567\n\nΔL ≈ 1.885e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 6.724e-7 meters ≈ 672.4 nanometers ≈ 0.672 micrometers\n\nSo the minimum resolution required is approximately 0.672 micrometers. However, as I thought earlier, bubble chambers typically have resolutions in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers. For example, the resolution might be around 100 micrometers (0.1 mm). If that\'s the case, then this required resolution of 0.67 micrometers is much finer than typical bubble chamber resolutions. This might suggest that either the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I made an error in calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again step by step.\n\nFirst, gamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917 (correct).\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992 (correct).\n\ntau_0 = 8e-16 s (given).\n\ngamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.3336e-15 s.\n\nBeta * gamma * c * tau_0 = 0.992 * 7.917 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.\n\nCompute 0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.853.\n\n7.853 * 3e8 ≈ 2.356e9 m/s.\n\n2.356e9 m/s * 8e-16 s ≈ 1.885e-6 m (≈ 1.885 micrometers).\n\nMultiply by -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567:\n\n1.885e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 6.724e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers.\n\nYes, the calculation checks out. But if bubble chambers can\'t resolve such small distances, then maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let\'s check that scenario.\n\nIf the energy is the kinetic energy K = 27 GeV, then total energy E = K + m = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV.\n\nThen gamma = E/m = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.917.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(30.41^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/924.7681) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01257) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.\n\nThen gamma * beta * c * tau_0 = 8.917 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16.\n\nCompute 8.917 * 0.9937 ≈ 8.86.\n\n8.86 * 3e8 ≈ 2.658e9 m/s.\n\n2.658e9 * 8e-16 ≈ 2.126e-6 m (≈ 2.126 micrometers).\n\nMultiply by 0.3567: 2.126e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 7.58e-7 m ≈ 0.758 micrometers.\n\nStill about 0.76 micrometers. Still too small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum? If E is the total energy, then momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)/c. For E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV, then p = sqrt(27^2 - 3.41^2) ≈ sqrt(729 - 11.6281) ≈ sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.\n\nBeta would be pc/E = (26.78 GeV/c * c)/27 GeV ≈ 26.78/27 ≈ 0.9919, which matches the previous beta. So gamma is E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the energy given is the kinetic energy, then as before, we get gamma ≈ 8.917. But even then, the result is about 0.76 micrometers.\n\nSo perhaps the problem expects the answer in those terms, even if it\'s smaller than typical detector resolutions. Maybe the answer is indeed around 0.67 micrometers. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a non-relativistic approximation, but that seems unlikely given the energies involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let\'s check the decay probability again.\n\nThe probability that the particle decays within time t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}. We want P(t) = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} → e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} = 0.7 → -t/(gamma tau_0) = ln(0.7) → t = -gamma tau_0 ln(0.7). Then the distance L = beta c t = beta c (-gamma tau_0 ln(0.7)) = -beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.7). Which is what I calculated. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the mean decay length multiplied by some factor. The mean decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. Then, the mean decay length here would be beta gamma c tau_0 ≈ 0.992 * 7.917 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 1.885e-6 meters ≈ 1.885 micrometers. Then, maybe the problem wants the mean decay length multiplied by some factor to get 30%? But according to the exponential distribution, the mean is L_avg, and the probability that the decay length is less than L is 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}. So to have 30% probability, L = -L_avg ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L_avg. So the required resolution is 0.3567 * L_avg ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 6.72e-7 m, which is the same as before. So this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, despite seeming small, the answer is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Maybe in experimental terms, they might express this as 670 nm or 0.67 µm. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo in the given numbers, but given the information, this is the calculation.\n\nSo the minimum resolution required is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting to meters, it\'s 6.7e-7 meters. The problem might expect the answer in centimeters or millimeters, but given the scale, micrometers would be appropriate. Therefore, the answer is roughly 0.67 micrometers, which is 6.7e-4 millimeters or 6.7e-7 meters.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \(X^0\) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we start by considering the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27\ \text{GeV}}{3.41\ \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Calculate the speed parameter (\(\beta\))**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3.41}{27}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Determine the dilated lifetime (\(\tau_{\text{lab}}\))**:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{s} \approx 6.3336 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time required for 30% of the particles to decay**:
   \[
   t = -\tau_{\text{lab}} \ln(0.7) \approx 6.3336 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s} \times 0.3567 \approx 2.26 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s}
   \]

5. **Calculate the decay length (\(L\))**:
   \[
   L = \beta c t = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s} \times 2.26 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s} \approx 0.992 \times 6.78 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \(6.7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters, or 0.67 micrometers.

\[
\boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m}}
\]

However, given that X^0's mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, it's more likely that 27 GeV is the total energy, since particles in accelerators are often discussed in terms of their total energy.

But let me check the calculation again. Gamma = E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917. Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. Then, the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.33e-15 s. The time for 30% decay is tau_lab * ln(1/(1-0.3)) ≈ 6.33e-15 * 0.3567 ≈ 2.26e-15 s. Then, distance L = beta*c*t ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 * 2.26e-15 = 0.992 * 6.78e-7 ≈ 6.73e-7 meters, which is 673 nanometers. That's 0.673 micrometers. Bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers, so 0.67 micrometers seems challenging. But maybe the problem expects a more approximate calculation, or perhaps there's a different consideration.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation of the 27 GeV. If the X^0 is produced at rest, then its energy would just be its rest mass, but that doesn't make sense here. The problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Perhaps that's the kinetic energy of the X^0? If that's the case, then total energy E = K + m = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma would be E/m = 30.41/3.41 ≈ 8.917. Then beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(8.917^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.51) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 8.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.13e-15 s.

Time for 30% decay: t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7) ≈ 7.13e-15 * 0.3567 ≈ 2.54e-15 s.

Distance L = beta*c*t ≈ 0.9937 * 3e8 * 2.54e-15 ≈ 0.9937 * 7.62e-7 ≈ 7.57e-7 m, which is 0.757 micrometers. Still around the same order of magnitude. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum? If the X^0 is moving with energy E = 27 GeV, but its rest mass is 3.41 GeV, then gamma would be E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917 as before. So perhaps my initial calculation is correct.

But the answer of around 0.67 micrometers seems very small for a bubble chamber's resolution. From what I remember, bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers (0.1 mm) or better. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, which is 1000 nanometers. So 0.67 micrometers is 670 nanometers, which is 0.67 micrometers, which is 670 nm. But typical bubble chambers can resolve tracks down to maybe 50-100 micrometers (50,000-100,000 nanometers). So 0.67 micrometers would be beyond their resolution. Hmm, that suggests maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement. The question is: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" So the resolution here refers to the spatial resolution required to detect the decay vertex. The idea is that if the particle decays after traveling a certain distance, the detector must be able to resolve that distance from the production point to see the decay as a displaced vertex. If the decay length is shorter than the detector's resolution, then most decays would not be observed as separate from the production point.

Therefore, the minimum resolution needed would correspond to the average decay length multiplied by some factor related to the 30% observation. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I calculated the time required for 30% of the particles to decay, which gives a certain decay length. However, maybe the problem is phrased such that the resolution should be such that the decay length is at least equal to the resolution to observe 30% of the decays. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0, and the probability that a decay occurs within a length L is 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. So to have 30% probability, set 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.3, so L = - gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(0.7). Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but in this case, L would be the decay length required such that 30% of the particles have decayed by that point, so the detector needs to resolve this length. So the resolution must be better than L to observe those decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution required would be L, because if the resolution is worse than L, you can't distinguish decays that happen within L. Wait, but actually, if the resolution is ΔL, then you can only see decay vertices that are separated by more than ΔL from the production point. So the number of observable decays would be the integral from ΔL to infinity of the decay probability distribution. Wait, maybe this is a different approach.

Alternatively, the problem might simply be asking for the average decay length multiplied by gamma beta c tau_0, but given that we need to have 30% of the decays observed, perhaps the required resolution is the average decay length multiplied by the factor such that 30% of the decays occur beyond that distance, requiring the resolution to be at least that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean path length multiplied by some factor. Let me check the standard approach.

The probability that a particle decays after a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}. The average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance L from the production point. The detector's resolution ΔL must be such that decays occurring at L >= ΔL can be distinguished from the production point, allowing us to observe them. However, the problem states "observe at least 30% of the decays". So we need that the fraction of decays occurring at distances greater than ΔL is 30%. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the total number of decays observed would be the integral from 0 to infinity of the decay probability, but if the detector can't resolve decay lengths below ΔL, then the number of observed decays would be the integral from ΔL to infinity. Therefore, we need that integral to be 30% of the total possible decays. Wait, but that would mean that the observed decays are 30% of the total. So the required ΔL would satisfy:

Integral from ΔL to ∞ of (1/(gamma beta c tau_0)) e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} dL = 0.3

Which is equivalent to e^{-ΔL/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7

Therefore, ΔL = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)

Which is exactly the same as the previous calculation. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is ΔL = - gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)

So substituting the numbers:

gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01596) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992

tau_0 = 8e-16 s

Then:

ΔL = - 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s * ln(0.7)

First compute gamma * beta * c * tau_0:

7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.853

7.853 * 3e8 ≈ 2.356e9 m/s

2.356e9 m/s * 8e-16 s ≈ 1.885e-6 meters (≈ 1.885 micrometers)

Then multiply by -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567

ΔL ≈ 1.885e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 6.724e-7 meters ≈ 672.4 nanometers ≈ 0.672 micrometers

So the minimum resolution required is approximately 0.672 micrometers. However, as I thought earlier, bubble chambers typically have resolutions in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers. For example, the resolution might be around 100 micrometers (0.1 mm). If that's the case, then this required resolution of 0.67 micrometers is much finer than typical bubble chamber resolutions. This might suggest that either the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again step by step.

First, gamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917 (correct).

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992 (correct).

tau_0 = 8e-16 s (given).

gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.3336e-15 s.

Beta * gamma * c * tau_0 = 0.992 * 7.917 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute 0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.853.

7.853 * 3e8 ≈ 2.356e9 m/s.

2.356e9 m/s * 8e-16 s ≈ 1.885e-6 m (≈ 1.885 micrometers).

Multiply by -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567:

1.885e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 6.724e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers.

Yes, the calculation checks out. But if bubble chambers can't resolve such small distances, then maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let's check that scenario.

If the energy is the kinetic energy K = 27 GeV, then total energy E = K + m = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV.

Then gamma = E/m = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.917.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(30.41^2)) = sqrt(1 - 11.6281/924.7681) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01257) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.

Then gamma * beta * c * tau_0 = 8.917 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16.

Compute 8.917 * 0.9937 ≈ 8.86.

8.86 * 3e8 ≈ 2.658e9 m/s.

2.658e9 * 8e-16 ≈ 2.126e-6 m (≈ 2.126 micrometers).

Multiply by 0.3567: 2.126e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 7.58e-7 m ≈ 0.758 micrometers.

Still about 0.76 micrometers. Still too small.

Alternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum? If E is the total energy, then momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)/c. For E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV, then p = sqrt(27^2 - 3.41^2) ≈ sqrt(729 - 11.6281) ≈ sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.

Beta would be pc/E = (26.78 GeV/c * c)/27 GeV ≈ 26.78/27 ≈ 0.9919, which matches the previous beta. So gamma is E/m = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.917. So same as before.

Alternatively, if the energy given is the kinetic energy, then as before, we get gamma ≈ 8.917. But even then, the result is about 0.76 micrometers.

So perhaps the problem expects the answer in those terms, even if it's smaller than typical detector resolutions. Maybe the answer is indeed around 0.67 micrometers. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a non-relativistic approximation, but that seems unlikely given the energies involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let's check the decay probability again.

The probability that the particle decays within time t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}. We want P(t) = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} → e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} = 0.7 → -t/(gamma tau_0) = ln(0.7) → t = -gamma tau_0 ln(0.7). Then the distance L = beta c t = beta c (-gamma tau_0 ln(0.7)) = -beta gamma c tau_0 ln(0.7). Which is what I calculated. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps they want the mean decay length multiplied by some factor. The mean decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. Then, the mean decay length here would be beta gamma c tau_0 ≈ 0.992 * 7.917 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 1.885e-6 meters ≈ 1.885 micrometers. Then, maybe the problem wants the mean decay length multiplied by some factor to get 30%? But according to the exponential distribution, the mean is L_avg, and the probability that the decay length is less than L is 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}. So to have 30% probability, L = -L_avg ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567 L_avg. So the required resolution is 0.3567 * L_avg ≈ 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 6.72e-7 m, which is the same as before. So this seems correct.

Therefore, despite seeming small, the answer is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Maybe in experimental terms, they might express this as 670 nm or 0.67 µm. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo in the given numbers, but given the information, this is the calculation.

So the minimum resolution required is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting to meters, it's 6.7e-7 meters. The problem might expect the answer in centimeters or millimeters, but given the scale, micrometers would be appropriate. Therefore, the answer is roughly 0.67 micrometers, which is 6.7e-4 millimeters or 6.7e-7 meters. So written in scientific notation, approximately 6.7 × 10^-7 meters.

But let me check once more the exact calculation:

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9173.

beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.9920.

tau_0 = 8e-16 s.

Then, L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Calculating each term:

beta * gamma = 0.9920 * 7.9173 ≈ 7.853.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 = 8e-16 s.

Multiply them together: 7.853 * 3e8 * 8e-16 = 7.853 * 24e-8 = 7.853 * 2.4e-7 ≈ 1.8847e-6 meters.

Multiply by -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567:

1.8847e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 0.672e-6 meters = 6.72e-7 meters = 672 nanometers = 0.672 micrometers.

Yes, so the exact answer is approximately 6.7e-7 meters or 0.67 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is about 0.67 micrometers. Given that, the answer should be presented in meters using scientific notation, likely 6.7 × 10^-7 meters, which is 670 nm. However, the problem may expect the answer in centimeters or millimeters, but 6.7e-7 meters is 6.7e-5 cm or 0.000067 cm, which is 0.67 micrometers. Since resolution is often expressed in micrometers in such contexts, the answer is 0.67 µm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in units. Let me check the units again:

gamma is unitless, beta is unitless, c is in m/s, tau_0 is in seconds. So beta * gamma * c * tau_0 has units (m/s) * s = meters. Correct. Then multiplied by the dimensionless ln(0.7), so the unit is meters. Correct.

Yes, so the calculation is correct. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 6.7 × 10^-7 meters, which is 0.67 micrometers. So the answer should be boxed as \boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m}} or \boxed{0.67\ \mu\text{m}}.

But let me check once more if the energy is indeed the total energy. The problem states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". In particle physics, when they talk about the energy in the lab frame or in the detector, it's often the total energy of the beam or the center-of-mass energy. However, in this case, if the X^0 is produced, then its energy would depend on the production mechanism. But the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Assuming that this refers to the total energy of the X^0 particle, then the calculation is correct. If it's the center-of-mass energy or something else, it might change, but given the problem statement, I think the initial approach is correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the minimum resolution required is approximately 0.67 micrometers, or 6.7 × 10^-7 meters.

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m}}.

To observe at least 30% of decays, we need the resolution to be such that the decay length is at least the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed. So solving for L where the cumulative probability is 30%.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function for decay length is P(L) = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Setting P(L) = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Therefore, e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7. Taking natural log: -L/(gamma beta c tau_0) = ln(0.7). Therefore, L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7).\n\nCompute this:\n\ngamma beta c tau_0 is the mean decay length, which we found as 1.88e-6 m.\n\nMultiply by -ln(0.7): ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, so L ≈ 1.88e-6 m * 0.35667 ≈ 6.71e-7 m ≈ 0.671 micrometers.\n\nThus, the required resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. This seems extremely small, but bubble chambers do have high spatial resolution. However, I should check if the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mean decay length multiplied by some factor. But according to the exponential decay, the required length for 30% decay is indeed L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7). So 0.67 micrometers.\n\nBut let\'s verify the steps again:\n\n1. Compute gamma: E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Correct.\n\n2. Compute beta: sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. Correct.\n\n3. Compute gamma * beta * c * tau_0: 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 * 8e-16. Let\'s compute step by step:\n\n7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85.\n\n7.85 * 3e8 = 2.355e9.\n\n2.355e9 * 8e-16 = 1.884e-6 m. Correct.\n\nThen, L = 1.884e-6 * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 1.884e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 6.72e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers. So the resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers.\n\nBut bubble chambers typically have a spatial resolution of around 100 micrometers or worse. This seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy? If E is kinetic energy, then gamma would be different.\n\nWait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Typically, in such contexts, the energy refers to the kinetic energy. If that\'s the case, then the total energy is kinetic energy plus rest energy. So E_total = KE + m. Then gamma would be (KE + m)/m = 1 + KE/m. So in this case, KE = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. Thus, E_total = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918.\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.5) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.\n\nThen, gamma * beta * c * tau_0 ≈ 8.918 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ Let\'s compute:\n\n8.918 * 0.9937 ≈ 8.86.\n\n8.86 * 3e8 = 2.658e9.\n\n2.658e9 * 8e-16 = 2.126e-6 m ≈ 2.126 micrometers. Then, L = 2.126e-6 * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 2.126e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 7.58e-7 m ≈ 0.758 micrometers.\n\nHmm, so if the energy is total energy, gamma is 7.917, giving L ≈ 0.67 micrometers. If it\'s kinetic energy, gamma is higher, leading to L ≈ 0.76 micrometers. The problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics, when they mention the energy of a particle in a detector, it\'s usually the kinetic energy. However, sometimes "energy" can refer to the total energy. But given that the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so even if it\'s kinetic, the total energy is 30.41 GeV. However, the problem might have intended the total energy as 27 GeV, perhaps. The wording is unclear.\n\nBut given that the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which is likely the total energy of the X^0 particle. Because in collider experiments, the energy is often given as the center-of-mass energy, but here it\'s a fixed target (Bubble Chamber), so perhaps the beam energy. But if it\'s the total energy, we use E = gamma m. If it\'s the kinetic energy, then E_k = (gamma - 1) m. Since the problem says "energy", which can be ambiguous. But given that the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, which is much larger, it\'s possible that 27 GeV is the kinetic energy. Let\'s check both scenarios.\n\nIf E is total energy: gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Then L ≈ 0.67 micrometers.\n\nIf E is kinetic energy: gamma = (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. Then L ≈ 0.76 micrometers.\n\nBut even so, the resolution required is sub-micrometer. However, bubble chambers typically have a spatial resolution on the order of 50-100 micrometers. This inconsistency makes me think perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the decay length, but the proper lifetime. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 s. The dilated lifetime is gamma * tau_0. The mean path length is gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Then, the length for 30% decay is L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7), which is what I calculated. So if E is total energy, then 0.67 micrometers. If E is kinetic energy, 0.76 micrometers.\n\nBut bubble chambers can\'t resolve such small distances. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum?\n\nWait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". If "energy" refers to the momentum, but no, energy is different. Wait, perhaps it\'s the lab frame energy of the X^0 particle. If X^0 is moving with energy 27 GeV, then gamma = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Then beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0159) ≈ sqrt(0.9841) ≈ 0.992.\n\nThus, the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau_0 ≈ 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.917*0.992≈7.85, then 7.85*3e8≈2.355e9, then 2.355e9*8e-16≈1.884e-6 m≈1.884 micrometers. Then, for 30% probability, L≈1.884e-6 * (-ln(0.7))≈1.884e-6 * 0.3567≈6.72e-7 m≈0.672 micrometers.\n\nBut again, 0.67 micrometers is way beyond the resolution of a bubble chamber. The required resolution here is about 0.67 micrometers. But bubble chambers have a resolution of about 100 micrometers. So either there\'s a mistake or perhaps the problem is theoretical, expecting the answer as calculated, regardless of experimental feasibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using natural units where c=1, but no, the units are given in GeV and seconds. Wait, maybe we need to convert the lifetime into meters using c.\n\nWait, the proper lifetime is given in seconds. To find the decay length, we can compute c * tau_0 in the lab frame. But since the particle is moving relativistically, the decay length is gamma * v * tau_0. Which is the same as gamma beta c tau_0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me check the formulas again.\n\nThe decay length L is given by:\n\nL = gamma * v * tau_0 = gamma * beta * c * tau_0\n\nThen, the number of particles that decay within a length L is N = N0 (1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)})\n\nSo to have N/N0 = 0.3, solve for L:\n\n0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} => e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7 => -L/(gamma beta c tau_0) = ln(0.7) => L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is expecting this answer, then the minimum resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. However, given that bubble chambers can\'t resolve this, maybe the problem is in different units or there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy is given per particle? If the Bubble Chamber has energy 27 GeV, but X^0\'s energy is different. Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV". So perhaps the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy of the X^0 particle. Then, as before, total energy E = KE + m = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma = E/m = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. Then beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(8.918²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.5) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.\n\nThen, gamma beta c tau_0 ≈ 8.918 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 8.918*0.9937≈8.86; 8.86*3e8≈2.658e9; 2.658e9*8e-16≈2.126e-6 m≈2.126 micrometers. Then L = 2.126e-6 * (-ln(0.7))≈2.126e-6 * 0.3567≈7.58e-7 m≈0.758 micrometers.\n\nStill, approximately 0.76 micrometers. So even if it\'s kinetic energy, the required resolution is around 0.7 micrometers, which is still too small. Therefore, the answer must be presented as such, even if it seems unrealistic. Maybe in the problem\'s context, they consider gamma as E/m regardless of kinetic or total. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the momentum. Wait, if the energy is 27 GeV, but if it\'s actually the momentum p, then gamma would be different. Let\'s check.\n\nIf the problem by "energy" actually meant momentum p (which is possible in some contexts), then E = sqrt(p²c² + m²c^4)/c². But if they say energy is 27 GeV, but actually mean momentum p = 27 GeV/c, then:\n\nE = sqrt( (27 GeV/c)^2 c^4 + (3.41 GeV/c²)^2 c^4 ) / c² = sqrt( (27)^2 + (3.41)^2 ) GeV ≈ sqrt(729 + 11.628) ≈ sqrt(740.628) ≈ 27.21 GeV. Then gamma = E/m ≈ 27.21 / 3.41 ≈ 7.98. Beta would be (pc)/E = 27 / 27.21 ≈ 0.992. Then similar to previous calculation, gamma ≈ 7.98, beta ≈ 0.992. So same as before, leading to L ≈ 0.67 micrometers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe "energy" refers to the center-of-mass energy, but in a fixed target experiment, the lab frame energy would be different. However, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which likely refers to the lab frame energy of the X^0 particle. So regardless, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the minimal resolution required is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting this into more standard units, 0.67 micrometers is 670 nanometers. Bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of micrometers, so this would require a very high-resolution detector. But since the problem asks for the minimum resolution, regardless of experimental feasibility, the answer is approximately 0.67 micrometers.\n\nBut let\'s verify the calculation once more:\n\nGamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.\n\nDilated lifetime: gamma * tau_0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.333e-15 s.\n\nTime for 30% decay: t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7) ≈ 6.333e-15 * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s.\n\nDistance: L = v * t ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 * 2.26e-15 ≈ 0.992 * 6.78e-7 ≈ 6.72e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers.\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So the answer should be approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting to meters: 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nanometers. However, the problem might expect the answer in centimeters or millimeters, but micrometers is more appropriate here.\n\nThus, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \\boxed{0.67\\ \\mu\\text{m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387811, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4357, prompt_tokens=837, total_tokens=5194, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we need to calculate the average distance traveled by the particle before decaying. This involves relativistic time dilation and exponential decay probability.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27\ \text{GeV}}{3.41\ \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Calculate the velocity factor (\(\beta\))**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.917^2}} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Calculate the dilated lifetime (\(\tau_{\text{lab}}\))**:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{s} \approx 6.333 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s}
   \]

4. **Determine the time for 30% decay probability**:
   \[
   t = -\tau_{\text{lab}} \ln(0.7) \approx 6.333 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s} \times 0.3567 \approx 2.26 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s}
   \]

5. **Calculate the decay distance (\(L\))**:
   \[
   L = v \cdot t = \beta c \cdot t \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s} \times 2.26 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m} \approx 0.67\ \mu\text{m}
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{0.67\ \mu\text{m}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

But according to the problem statement, we need to provide the minimum resolution, so 0.67 micrometers. However, perhaps the problem expects using the mean lifetime multiplied by velocity for gamma*beta*c*tau_0, but considering 30% requires scaling.

Wait, perhaps the average decay length is gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Then, the mean decay length L_avg = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Then, to observe 30% of the decays, we need to resolve a length where 30% of the particles have decayed. The exponential distribution implies that the probability the particle decays within length L is 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Setting this equal to 0.3, solving for L: L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(1 - 0.3) = gamma beta c tau_0 ln(1/0.7). So the resolution needed would be L. Wait, so the calculation I did earlier is correct, but let's re-express in terms of gamma and beta.

Wait, actually, the decay length L = v * t, where t is the dilated lifetime multiplied by the factor from the exponential. So L = beta c * gamma tau_0 (from the time being gamma tau_0), but the actual time for 30% decay is gamma tau_0 multiplied by (-ln(0.7)), so L = beta c gamma tau_0 (-ln(0.7)).

Alternatively, since gamma tau_0 is the dilated lifetime, so L = v * t = beta c * gamma tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

But let's compute this step by step.

First, gamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.

Beta is calculated from gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

Then, the mean decay length is gamma * beta * c * tau_0 ≈ 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute that: 7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85.

Then, 7.85 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.355e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.355e9 * 8e-16 = 1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884 micrometers. The mean decay length is approximately 1.88 micrometers.

But the question is to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. If the resolution is too low, the detector can't distinguish the decay point from the production point. So if the decay occurs at a distance shorter than the resolution, it's not observed. To observe at least 30% of decays, we need the resolution to be such that the decay length is at least the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed. So solving for L where the cumulative probability is 30%.

The cumulative distribution function for decay length is P(L) = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Setting P(L) = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}. Therefore, e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7. Taking natural log: -L/(gamma beta c tau_0) = ln(0.7). Therefore, L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7).

Compute this:

gamma beta c tau_0 is the mean decay length, which we found as 1.88e-6 m.

Multiply by -ln(0.7): ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, so L ≈ 1.88e-6 m * 0.35667 ≈ 6.71e-7 m ≈ 0.671 micrometers.

Thus, the required resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. This seems extremely small, but bubble chambers do have high spatial resolution. However, I should check if the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mean decay length multiplied by some factor. But according to the exponential decay, the required length for 30% decay is indeed L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7). So 0.67 micrometers.

But let's verify the steps again:

1. Compute gamma: E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Correct.

2. Compute beta: sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. Correct.

3. Compute gamma * beta * c * tau_0: 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 * 8e-16. Let's compute step by step:

7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85.

7.85 * 3e8 = 2.355e9.

2.355e9 * 8e-16 = 1.884e-6 m. Correct.

Then, L = 1.884e-6 * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 1.884e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 6.72e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers. So the resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers.

But bubble chambers typically have a spatial resolution of around 100 micrometers or worse. This seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy? If E is kinetic energy, then gamma would be different.

Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Typically, in such contexts, the energy refers to the kinetic energy. If that's the case, then the total energy is kinetic energy plus rest energy. So E_total = KE + m. Then gamma would be (KE + m)/m = 1 + KE/m. So in this case, KE = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. Thus, E_total = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.5) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.

Then, gamma * beta * c * tau_0 ≈ 8.918 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ Let's compute:

8.918 * 0.9937 ≈ 8.86.

8.86 * 3e8 = 2.658e9.

2.658e9 * 8e-16 = 2.126e-6 m ≈ 2.126 micrometers. Then, L = 2.126e-6 * (-ln(0.7)) ≈ 2.126e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 7.58e-7 m ≈ 0.758 micrometers.

Hmm, so if the energy is total energy, gamma is 7.917, giving L ≈ 0.67 micrometers. If it's kinetic energy, gamma is higher, leading to L ≈ 0.76 micrometers. The problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics, when they mention the energy of a particle in a detector, it's usually the kinetic energy. However, sometimes "energy" can refer to the total energy. But given that the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so even if it's kinetic, the total energy is 30.41 GeV. However, the problem might have intended the total energy as 27 GeV, perhaps. The wording is unclear.

But given that the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which is likely the total energy of the X^0 particle. Because in collider experiments, the energy is often given as the center-of-mass energy, but here it's a fixed target (Bubble Chamber), so perhaps the beam energy. But if it's the total energy, we use E = gamma m. If it's the kinetic energy, then E_k = (gamma - 1) m. Since the problem says "energy", which can be ambiguous. But given that the mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV, which is much larger, it's possible that 27 GeV is the kinetic energy. Let's check both scenarios.

If E is total energy: gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Then L ≈ 0.67 micrometers.

If E is kinetic energy: gamma = (27 + 3.41)/3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. Then L ≈ 0.76 micrometers.

But even so, the resolution required is sub-micrometer. However, bubble chambers typically have a spatial resolution on the order of 50-100 micrometers. This inconsistency makes me think perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the decay length, but the proper lifetime. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 s. The dilated lifetime is gamma * tau_0. The mean path length is gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Then, the length for 30% decay is L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7), which is what I calculated. So if E is total energy, then 0.67 micrometers. If E is kinetic energy, 0.76 micrometers.

But bubble chambers can't resolve such small distances. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the energy given is the momentum?

Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". If "energy" refers to the momentum, but no, energy is different. Wait, perhaps it's the lab frame energy of the X^0 particle. If X^0 is moving with energy 27 GeV, then gamma = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Then beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0159) ≈ sqrt(0.9841) ≈ 0.992.

Thus, the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau_0 ≈ 7.917 * 0.992 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.917*0.992≈7.85, then 7.85*3e8≈2.355e9, then 2.355e9*8e-16≈1.884e-6 m≈1.884 micrometers. Then, for 30% probability, L≈1.884e-6 * (-ln(0.7))≈1.884e-6 * 0.3567≈6.72e-7 m≈0.672 micrometers.

But again, 0.67 micrometers is way beyond the resolution of a bubble chamber. The required resolution here is about 0.67 micrometers. But bubble chambers have a resolution of about 100 micrometers. So either there's a mistake or perhaps the problem is theoretical, expecting the answer as calculated, regardless of experimental feasibility.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using natural units where c=1, but no, the units are given in GeV and seconds. Wait, maybe we need to convert the lifetime into meters using c.

Wait, the proper lifetime is given in seconds. To find the decay length, we can compute c * tau_0 in the lab frame. But since the particle is moving relativistically, the decay length is gamma * v * tau_0. Which is the same as gamma beta c tau_0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me check the formulas again.

The decay length L is given by:

L = gamma * v * tau_0 = gamma * beta * c * tau_0

Then, the number of particles that decay within a length L is N = N0 (1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)})

So to have N/N0 = 0.3, solve for L:

0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} => e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} = 0.7 => -L/(gamma beta c tau_0) = ln(0.7) => L = -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7)

Which is the same as before. So the calculation seems correct.

Therefore, if the problem is expecting this answer, then the minimum resolution is approximately 0.67 micrometers. However, given that bubble chambers can't resolve this, maybe the problem is in different units or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given per particle? If the Bubble Chamber has energy 27 GeV, but X^0's energy is different. Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV". So perhaps the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy of the X^0 particle. Then, as before, total energy E = KE + m = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma = E/m = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.918. Then beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(8.918²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/79.5) ≈ sqrt(0.9874) ≈ 0.9937.

Then, gamma beta c tau_0 ≈ 8.918 * 0.9937 * 3e8 * 8e-16 ≈ 8.918*0.9937≈8.86; 8.86*3e8≈2.658e9; 2.658e9*8e-16≈2.126e-6 m≈2.126 micrometers. Then L = 2.126e-6 * (-ln(0.7))≈2.126e-6 * 0.3567≈7.58e-7 m≈0.758 micrometers.

Still, approximately 0.76 micrometers. So even if it's kinetic energy, the required resolution is around 0.7 micrometers, which is still too small. Therefore, the answer must be presented as such, even if it seems unrealistic. Maybe in the problem's context, they consider gamma as E/m regardless of kinetic or total. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the momentum. Wait, if the energy is 27 GeV, but if it's actually the momentum p, then gamma would be different. Let's check.

If the problem by "energy" actually meant momentum p (which is possible in some contexts), then E = sqrt(p²c² + m²c^4)/c². But if they say energy is 27 GeV, but actually mean momentum p = 27 GeV/c, then:

E = sqrt( (27 GeV/c)^2 c^4 + (3.41 GeV/c²)^2 c^4 ) / c² = sqrt( (27)^2 + (3.41)^2 ) GeV ≈ sqrt(729 + 11.628) ≈ sqrt(740.628) ≈ 27.21 GeV. Then gamma = E/m ≈ 27.21 / 3.41 ≈ 7.98. Beta would be (pc)/E = 27 / 27.21 ≈ 0.992. Then similar to previous calculation, gamma ≈ 7.98, beta ≈ 0.992. So same as before, leading to L ≈ 0.67 micrometers.

Alternatively, maybe "energy" refers to the center-of-mass energy, but in a fixed target experiment, the lab frame energy would be different. However, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which likely refers to the lab frame energy of the X^0 particle. So regardless, the calculation seems consistent.

Therefore, the minimal resolution required is approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting this into more standard units, 0.67 micrometers is 670 nanometers. Bubble chambers have resolutions on the order of micrometers, so this would require a very high-resolution detector. But since the problem asks for the minimum resolution, regardless of experimental feasibility, the answer is approximately 0.67 micrometers.

But let's verify the calculation once more:

Gamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

Dilated lifetime: gamma * tau_0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.333e-15 s.

Time for 30% decay: t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7) ≈ 6.333e-15 * 0.35667 ≈ 2.26e-15 s.

Distance: L = v * t ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 2.26e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 * 2.26e-15 ≈ 0.992 * 6.78e-7 ≈ 6.72e-7 m ≈ 0.672 micrometers.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be approximately 0.67 micrometers. Converting to meters: 6.7e-7 meters, which is 670 nanometers. However, the problem might expect the answer in centimeters or millimeters, but micrometers is more appropriate here.

Thus, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 0.67 micrometers.

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \boxed{0.67\ \mu\text{m}}.
