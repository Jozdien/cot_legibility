To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the matrix \( P \) and the state vector \( | \psi \rangle \):**
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{pmatrix}, \quad | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Find the eigenvalues of \( P \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( P \) are 0, 1, and -1.

3. **Determine the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:**
   Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector:
   \[
   \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Normalize the state vector \( | \psi \rangle \):**
   The norm of \( | \psi \rangle \) is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \). The normalized state is:
   \[
   | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

5. **Calculate the inner product with the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0:**
   \[
   \langle \phi | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

6. **Compute the probability:**
   The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:
   \[
   \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

Okay, so I need to calculate the probability that measuring the observable P will give a result of 0 at time t, given that the state of the system is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let me try to recall how this works in quantum mechanics. 

First, I think the general idea is that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, if I can find the eigenvectors of the matrix P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then I can project the state onto those eigenvectors and add up the probabilities. 

But let me start step by step. The observable P is represented by a matrix. Let me write it out to make sure I have it right. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, it's a 3x3 matrix:

P = [ 0        1/√2      0      ]
    [ 1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
    [ 0        1/√2      0      ]

Okay, that seems correct. Now, the state of the system at time t is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this state vector as |ψ>:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ> onto those eigenvectors. 

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To do this, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me compute the eigenvalues first.

But before diving into that, maybe I can notice something about the matrix P. It looks symmetric, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and in real matrices, Hermitian means symmetric. So, P is symmetric, which is good because it ensures that it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

So, let's compute the eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial is det(P - λI) = 0.

Calculating the determinant for the matrix:

[ -λ       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    -λ        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ      ]

To compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix, I can use the expansion along the first row:

-λ * det[ -λ        1/√2   ]
        [ 1/√2     -λ      ]
 
minus (1/√2) * det[ 1/√2      1/√2   ]
                  [ 0         -λ      ]

plus 0 * det[ ... ]

Wait, since the first row is [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], the determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is 0.

Therefore, determinant is:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Therefore, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. Therefore, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the possible outcomes of the measurement are 0, 1, and -1. But we are interested in the probability of getting 0.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ = 0, then project the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector (or eigenvectors, if the eigenspace is multi-dimensional), and then take the squared magnitude.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ = 0. To do this, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0.

So, the system of equations is:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. So, they can be written as:

v = [ v1 ]
    [ 0  ]
    [ -v1 ]

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional (since v1 can be any scalar, but once v1 is chosen, v3 is determined). So, a basis for this eigenspace can be written as:

[ 1 ]
[ 0 ]
[ -1 ]

But normalized? Wait, let's check. If we take v1 = 1, then the vector is [1, 0, -1]. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

But let me confirm:

Let me compute the norm of [1, 0, -1]. The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, so norm is √2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is:

|φ> = 1/√2 [1; 0; -1]

So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so there is only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples). Therefore, the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector is just the inner product of |ψ> and |φ>, and then the probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.

So, let's compute the inner product <φ|ψ>.

First, |φ> is 1/√2 [1, 0, -1]^T, so its conjugate transpose is 1/√2 [1, 0, -1]. Since all components are real, we don't have to worry about complex conjugation.

The state |ψ> is [-1; 2; 1].

So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (1/√2)(-2) = -2/√2 = -√2

But the inner product is a scalar, which is -√2. However, probability is the square of the absolute value of this, so | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

Wait, that can't be. The probability can't be 2, since probabilities must be between 0 and 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again.

First, the inner product <φ|ψ> is computed as:

(1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2)(-1 -1) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

But the square of the absolute value is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2. But this is 2, which is greater than 1. That's impossible for a probability.

So, clearly, I messed up somewhere. Let me check my steps again.

First, eigenvalues: I found that the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. That seems correct.

Then, the eigenvectors for λ=0: solving Pv = 0. Let me check that again.

The equations are:

First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Therefore, the solution is v1 = -v3, v2 = 0. So, the eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So, if we take v1 = 1, then [1, 0, -1]^T. The norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, normalized eigenvector is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T. That seems correct.

Then, the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So, the inner product between |φ> and |ψ> is:

(1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2)(-1 -1) = -2/√2 = -√2.

So, the square of the absolute value is (√2)^2 = 2. But this is greater than 1. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait a second, maybe the eigenvector is not normalized? Wait, no. The eigenvector [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T has norm 1: (1/√2)^2 + 0 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1. So that's correct.

But then the inner product is -√2, whose square is 2. But how can the probability be 2? That's impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the process.

Wait, let's check the initial state. The state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Is this state normalized? Let's check its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is √6. Therefore, the state is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized, so perhaps we need to normalize the state first before computing the probability?

Wait, the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't specify whether it's normalized. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, but sometimes problems give unnormalized vectors and you have to work with them as is. However, when computing probabilities, you need to use the normalized state. Wait, but actually, the probability is computed as |<φ|ψ>|^2 divided by the norm of |ψ> squared, if |ψ> is not normalized. Wait, no. Wait, if the state is not normalized, then the actual state vector is |ψ> divided by its norm. Therefore, the probabilities are calculated using the normalized state.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the state is normalized. So perhaps I need to check if the state is normalized. Let me check again.

The given state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the norm is √6. So, the normalized state is (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Therefore, if the problem is following standard quantum mechanics conventions, the probabilities are calculated with the normalized state. However, sometimes in problems, even if the state isn't normalized, they just want you to compute the probability as if it's normalized. Wait, but that would be incorrect. The problem might be assuming that the given state is already normalized. Wait, but the norm here is √6, not 1. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting us to use the given vector as the state vector, even if it's not normalized. But in that case, the "probability" could be greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

Therefore, perhaps the mistake here is that I didn't normalize the state vector. Let me try that.

So, normalized |ψ> is (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, the inner product <φ|ψ> is (1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) multiplied by (1/√6). Wait, no. Wait, actually, the inner product is between the normalized eigenvector |φ> and the normalized state |ψ>.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If the original state is not normalized, then the actual state vector is |ψ> / ||ψ||. Therefore, the probability is |<φ| (|ψ> / ||ψ||) |² = |<φ|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Alternatively, if you don't normalize the state, you can compute |<φ|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||². Either way, you have to account for the norm of |ψ>.

But in the problem statement, it just says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix...". It doesn't specify whether it's normalized. In real quantum mechanics, states must be normalized because the total probability must be 1. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the given vector is already normalized. But in this case, it's not. The norm squared is 6. Therefore, this is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is formulated in such a way that even if the vector isn't normalized, you can still compute the probability as |<φ|ψ>|², but that would result in a probability greater than 1 here, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must intend for the state to be normalized. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

Therefore, let's proceed accordingly.

First, compute the normalized state vector:

|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, compute the inner product with |φ> = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T.

So, <φ|ψ_normalized> = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/√(2*6)) [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12)(-1 -1) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/√3.

Therefore, the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. Therefore, the answer should be 1/3.

But wait, let me check again. Let me go through the steps once more to make sure.

Original state: [-1, 2, 1]^T, norm squared is 6. Normalized state: 1/√6 [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Eigenvector for eigenvalue 0: 1/√2 [1, 0, -1]^T.

Compute inner product:

(1/√2)(1, 0, -1) • (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(√2√6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0 + (-1)(1) ] = (1/√12)(-1 -1) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.

Absolute value squared: (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Yes, so 1/3 is the correct probability.

But wait, initially, when I didn't normalize the state, I got 2, which is wrong. So the key step here was normalizing the state vector first.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

But let me just confirm once again by an alternative method. Since P is a Hermitian operator, the sum of the probabilities of all eigenvalues should be 1. Let's check if that's the case here.

The eigenvalues are -1, 0, 1. Let's compute the probabilities for each.

We already have the probability for 0 as 1/3. Let's compute the probabilities for 1 and -1.

First, find eigenvectors for λ = 1 and λ = -1.

Starting with λ = 1:

Solve (P - I)v = 0.

The matrix P - I is:

[ -1       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    -1        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     -1      ]

We need to find the eigenvectors for this matrix. Let's set up the equations.

First row: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = v1 => v2 = √2 v1

Second row: (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third row: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = v3 => v3 = (1/√2)v2

From first equation: v2 = √2 v1

From third equation: v3 = (1/√2)v2 = (1/√2)(√2 v1) = v1

Therefore, substituting into second equation:

(1/√2)v1 - √2 v1 + (1/√2)v3 = (1/√2)v1 - √2 v1 + (1/√2)v1 = [ (1/√2 + 1/√2) - √2 ] v1 = [ (2/√2) - √2 ] v1 = [ √2 - √2 ] v1 = 0.

So the second equation is satisfied for any v1. Therefore, the eigenvectors are parametrized by v1, with v2 = √2 v1 and v3 = v1.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are scalar multiples of [1, √2, 1]^T. Let's check the norm:

Norm squared is 1^2 + (√2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Therefore, norm is 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2)[1, √2, 1]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -1:

Solve (P + I)v = 0:

Matrix P + I:

[ 1       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    1        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     1      ]

Setting up equations:

First row: v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2)v2

Second row: (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third row: (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2)v2

From first equation: v1 = - (1/√2)v2

From third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2

Substituting into second equation:

(1/√2)( - (1/√2)v2 ) + v2 + (1/√2)( - (1/√2)v2 ) = (-1/2)v2 + v2 + (-1/2)v2 = (-1/2 -1/2 +1)v2 = (-1 +1)v2 = 0.

Therefore, the second equation is satisfied for any v2. Therefore, eigenvectors are parametrized by v2, with v1 = - (1/√2)v2 and v3 = - (1/√2)v2.

Taking v2 = √2, then v1 = -1, v3 = -1. Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1, √2, -1]^T. Norm squared is (-1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 2 +1 = 4. Norm is 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/2)[-1, √2, -1]^T.

Now, let's compute the probabilities for each eigenvalue.

First, for λ = 1:

Eigenvector |φ1> = (1/2)[1, √2, 1]^T.

Compute inner product with normalized |ψ> = (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

<φ1|ψ> = (1/2)(1, √2, 1) • (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(2√6))[1*(-1) + √2*2 + 1*1] = (1/(2√6))[ -1 + 2√2 + 1 ] = (1/(2√6))(2√2) = (2√2)/(2√6) = √2/√6 = 1/√3.

Therefore, probability is |1/√3|² = 1/3.

For λ = -1:

Eigenvector |φ-1> = (1/2)[-1, √2, -1]^T.

Inner product with |ψ>:

<φ-1|ψ> = (1/2)(-1, √2, -1) • (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(2√6))[ (-1)(-1) + √2*2 + (-1)(1) ] = (1/(2√6))[1 + 2√2 -1] = (1/(2√6))(2√2) = same as before, √2/√6 = 1/√3.

Probability is |1/√3|² = 1/3.

Therefore, the probabilities for eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 are each 1/3. Wait, but that can't be right because the total probability is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1, which is okay. But this seems symmetric, but let's check.

Wait, the original state is [-1, 2, 1]^T. When normalized, it's (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T. The eigenvectors for 1 and -1 are symmetric in a way, so maybe the probabilities are the same. But the eigenvector for 0 is [1, 0, -1]^T, which is different. However, in this case, the projection onto 0 was 1/3, and onto 1 and -1 also 1/3 each, totaling 1. So that seems okay.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

But let me check once again with the original non-normalized state. If we didn't normalize the state, the "probabilities" would be:

For 0: |<φ|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = 2

For 1: |<φ1|ψ>|² = | (1/2)(1, √2, 1) • (-1, 2, 1) |² = | ( -1 + 2√2 +1 )/2 |² = | 2√2 /2 |² = | √2 |² = 2

Similarly for -1: same as 1, giving 2. So total "probability" would be 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is the norm squared of the original state. Therefore, if we don't normalize, the probabilities sum to ||ψ||², which is 6. Therefore, to get actual probabilities, we must divide by ||ψ||² = 6. Therefore, each |<φ|ψ>|² is 2, so 2/6 = 1/3. Therefore, regardless of the method, we get 1/3.

Therefore, the correct probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3, so boxed, it's \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

Okay, so I need to calculate the probability that measuring the observable P will give a result of 0 at time t, given that the state of the system is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let me try to recall how this works in quantum mechanics. 

First, I think the general idea is that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, if I can find the eigenvectors of the matrix P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then I can project the state onto those eigenvectors and add up the probabilities. 

But let me start step by step. The observable P is represented by a matrix. Let me write it out to make sure I have it right. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, it's a 3x3 matrix:

P = [ 0        1/√2      0      ]
    [ 1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
    [ 0        1/√2      0      ]

Okay, that seems correct. Now, the state of the system at time t is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this state vector as |ψ>:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ> onto those eigenvectors. 

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To do this, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me compute the eigenvalues first.

But before diving into that, maybe I can notice something about the matrix P. It looks symmetric, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and in real matrices, Hermitian means symmetric. So, P is symmetric, which is good because it ensures that it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

So, let's compute the eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial is det(P - λI) = 0.

Calculating the determinant for the matrix:

[ -λ       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    -λ        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ      ]

To compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix, I can use the expansion along the first row:

-λ * det[ -λ        1/√2   ]
        [ 1/√2     -λ      ]
 
minus (1/√2) * det[ 1/√2      1/√2   ]
                  [ 0         -λ      ]

plus 0 * det[ ... ]

Wait, since the first row is [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], the determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is 0.

Therefore, determinant is:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Therefore, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. Therefore, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the possible outcomes of the measurement are 0, 1, and -1. But we are interested in the probability of getting 0.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ = 0, then project the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector (or eigenvectors, if the eigenspace is multi-dimensional), and then take the squared magnitude.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ = 0. To do this, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0.

So, the system of equations is:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. So, they can be written as:

v = [ v1 ]
    [ 0  ]
    [ -v1 ]

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional (since v1 can be any scalar, but once v1 is chosen, v3 is determined). So, a basis for this eigenspace can be written as:

[ 1 ]
[ 0 ]
[ -1 ]

But normalized? W

I need to compute the probability of getting a measurement result of 0 for the observable P, given that the system is in a state represented by the column vector (-1, 2, 1).

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue equals the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector. Therefore, I need to find the eigenvectors of matrix P that correspond to eigenvalue 0, then project the state onto those eigenvectors and calculate the probabilities.

Let me examine the observable P, which is represented by this 3×3 matrix:

P = [ 0        1/√2      0      ]
    [ 1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
    [ 0        1/√2      0      ]

The state of the system at time t is given by the column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

To find the probability of measuring 0, I must identify the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and then compute the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ> onto those eigenvectors.

I'll first determine the eigenvalues of P by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Since P is symmetric (which is expected for observables as they're represented by Hermitian matrices), it will have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

The characteristic polynomial comes from this determinant:

[ -λ       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    -λ        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ      ]

Using the first row for expansion:
-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [(1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0)] + 0

Simplifying:
First term: -λ * [λ² - (1/2)]
Second term: -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = λ/2
Third term: 0

Therefore, the determinant is: -λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

The characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0, which simplifies to λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Thus, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Now I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ = 0 by solving Pv = 0.

This gives the system of equations:
(1/√2)v₂ = 0
(1/√2)v₁ + (1/√2)v₃ = 0
(1/√2)v₂ = 0

From these equations, I get v₂ = 0 and v₁ = -v₃. Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=0 can be written as:

v = [ v₁ ]
    [ 0  ]
    [ -v₁]

The eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, and a basis vector for this eigenspace is:

[ 1 ]
[ 0 ]
[ -1]

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the probability that measuring the observable P at time t results in 0, given that the system's state is described by a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Let me remember how this works in quantum mechanics.

Generally, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector. Therefore, if I find the eigenvectors of the matrix P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, I can project the state onto these eigenvectors and sum up the probabilities.

Let me proceed step by step. The observable P is represented by a matrix. Here's its structure: the first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix:

P = [ 0        1/√2      0      ]
    [ 1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
    [ 0        1/√2      0      ]

That seems correct. Now, the system's state at time t is given by a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). I'll denote this state vector by |ψ>:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

To calculate the probability of measuring 0, I need to identify the eigenvectors of P with the eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared magnitude of |ψ>'s projection onto those eigenvectors.

First, I need to find P's eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me compute these eigenvalues.

Before going further, it's worth noting that P appears symmetric, which is expected since observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and symmetric in real matrices means Hermitian. This implies P has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Let's derive the eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial is given by det(P - λI) = 0.

Computing the determinant involves this matrix:

[ -λ       1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2    -λ        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ      ]

Expand along the first row to compute this 3x3 matrix's determinant:

-λ * det[ -λ        1/√2   ]
        [ 1/√2     -λ      ]

minus (1/√2) * det[ 1/√2      1/√2   ]
                  [ 0         -λ      ]

plus 0 * det[ ... ]

Since the first row is [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], the determinant becomes:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0

Let me compute each term.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = (λ)/(2)

Third term is 0.

Therefore, the determinant is:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Hence, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

The eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1, making the possible measurement outcomes 0, 1, and -1. Our focus is on the probability of measuring 0.

Next, we find the eigenvectors for λ = 0, project state |ψ> onto this eigenvector (or these eigenvectors if the eigenspace is multi-dimensional), and calculate the squared magnitude.

To find the eigenvectors for λ = 0, solve (P - 0I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.

The system of equations is:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

Thus, the eigenvectors for λ=0 have v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. Expressed as:

v = [ v1 ]
    [ 0  ]
    [ -v1 ]

The eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional (since choosing v1 determines v3). A basis for this eigenspace is:

[ 1 ]
[ 0 ]
[ -1 ]

For normalization...

The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], then its norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, to normalize it, we divide by sqrt(2), giving (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is:\n\n|v0> = 1/√2 [1; 0; -1]\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |ψ> and |v0>.\n\nSo, let's compute <v0 | ψ>.\n\nFirst, |v0> is a column vector [1/√2; 0; -1/√2], so the conjugate transpose is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]. Since all components are real, we don't have to worry about complex conjugation.\n\nTherefore, the inner product is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2\n\nThen, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.\n\nWait, that can't be. Probability can't be greater than 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, the state vector |ψ> is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me confirm that this is a column vector. Yes, it's written as a column matrix with elements -1, 2, 1.\n\nThe eigenvector |v0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. So, the inner product is:\n\n(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) = (-1/√2 - 1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2\n\nBut then the square of this is (√2)^2 = 2. But the total probability is 2, which is greater than 1. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but maybe the state vector isn't normalized. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized (i.e., their norm is 1). Let me check the norm of |ψ>.\n\nThe given state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is not normalized. Therefore, I need to normalize it first before calculating probabilities.\n\nAh! That's a crucial step I missed. The state vector given is not normalized. So, the actual state vector should be |ψ> divided by its norm. So, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. Therefore, when calculating the inner product, I need to use the normalized state vector.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the inner product with the normalized state.\n\nFirst, normalized |ψ> is:\n\n|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[ -1 ]\n                     [  2 ]\n                     [  1 ]\n\nTherefore, the inner product <v0 | ψ_normalized> is:\n\n[1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/√6)[ -1 ]\n                           [  2 ]\n                           [  1 ]\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√2√6) + 0 + (-1)/(√2√6) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3\n\nTherefore, the inner product is -1/√3. The square of the absolute value is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, check normalization of the given state:\n\nOriginal |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nEigenvector |v0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T, which is correctly normalized because (1/√2)^2 + 0 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nThen, the inner product between |v0> and |ψ_normalized> is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3\n\nThen, the absolute value squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut let me just check if the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1. From the characteristic equation, we had eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. So each with multiplicity 1. Therefore, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, so only one eigenvector (up to scaling). Therefore, the projection is onto that single eigenvector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut let me cross-verify this result by another method. Maybe by diagonalizing the matrix P or using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since P is a symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. The probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the squared inner product as we calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0 and apply it to |ψ>, then find the norm squared.\n\nThe projection operator for eigenvalue 0 is |v0><v0|. So, the projection of |ψ_normalized> onto this subspace is |v0><v0|ψ_normalized>, and the norm squared is |<v0|ψ_normalized>|², which is the same as we calculated, 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another eigenvector for λ=0 that I missed. Wait, when we solved Pv = 0, we found that v2 must be 0, and v1 = -v3. Therefore, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1; 0; -1]. So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, so only one normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using matrix multiplication. Let's confirm that P|v0> is indeed 0.\n\nCompute P multiplied by |v0>:\n\nP = [0, 1/√2, 0]\n    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n    [0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n|v0> = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2]\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = 0\n\nThird component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0\n\nSo, P|v0> = [0; 0; 0], which confirms that |v0> is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the probabilities for the other eigenvalues to see if they sum up to 1. If the total probability is 1, then 1/3 is plausible.\n\nThe eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. Let's compute the probabilities for each.\n\nFirst, find eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1, compute their probabilities, and check if the sum is 1.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming, but let's try.\n\nStarting with λ=1. Solve (P - I)v = 0.\n\nP - I = [ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]\n        [1/√2, -1, 1/√2]\n        [0, 1/√2, -1 ]\n\nWe need to solve (P - I)v = 0.\n\nFirst equation: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2)v2\n\nSecond equation: (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0\n\nThird equation: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2)v2\n\nFrom first equation: v1 = (1/√2)v2\n\nFrom third equation: v3 = (1/√2)v2\n\nTherefore, let v2 = a, then v1 = a/√2, v3 = a/√2\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a/√2; a; a/√2]. Let's normalize this.\n\nNorm squared is (a²/2) + a² + (a²/2) = (a²/2 + a²/2) + a² = a² + a² = 2a². Therefore, norm is a√2. To normalize, set a√2 = 1 => a = 1/√2.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (1/√2)/√2; 1/√2; (1/√2)/√2 ] = [ 1/2; 1/√2; 1/2 ]\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step. If a = 1/√2, then:\n\nv1 = (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2\n\nv2 = 1/√2\n\nv3 = (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T. Let's check its norm:\n\n(1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo, |v1> = [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T.\n\nSimilarly, for λ = -1, we need to solve (P + I)v = 0.\n\nP + I = [1, 1/√2, 0]\n        [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]\n        [0, 1/√2, 1]\n\nSo, (P + I)v = 0.\n\nFirst equation: v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2)v2\n\nSecond equation: (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0\n\nThird equation: (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2)v2\n\nFrom first equation: v1 = - (1/√2)v2\n\nFrom third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2\n\nTherefore, let v2 = a, then v1 = -a/√2, v3 = -a/√2\n\nSo the eigenvector is [-a/√2; a; -a/√2]. Let's normalize this.\n\nNorm squared is (a²/2) + a² + (a²/2) = 2a². Therefore, norm is a√2. Setting a√2 = 1 => a = 1/√2.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T.\n\nCheck norm: (1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = same as before, 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo, |v-1> = [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, for λ=1, the probability is |<v1 | ψ_normalized>|².\n\nCompute <v1 | ψ_normalized>:\n\n|v1> = [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T\n\n|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[ -1; 2; 1 ]^T\n\nInner product:\n\n(1/2)(-1/√6) + (1/√2)(2/√6) + (1/2)(1/√6)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(2√6)\n\nSecond term: (2)/(√2√6) = (2)/(√12) = (2)/(2√3) = 1/√3\n\nThird term: (1)/(2√6)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n(-1/(2√6) + 1/(2√6)) + 1/√3 = 0 + 1/√3 = 1/√3\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, for λ=-1, compute <v-1 | ψ_normalized>:\n\n|v-1> = [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T\n\nInner product:\n\n(-1/2)(-1/√6) + (1/√2)(2/√6) + (-1/2)(1/√6)\n\nFirst term: (1)/(2√6)\n\nSecond term: 2/(√2√6) = 2/√12 = 1/√3\n\nThird term: (-1)/(2√6)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n(1/(2√6) - 1/(2√6)) + 1/√3 = 0 + 1/√3 = 1/√3\n\nProbability is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for λ=1, 0, -1 are each 1/3. Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1, which makes sense because the state is normalized. Therefore, confirming that the probability for λ=0 is indeed 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3. So, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nBut let me just check once again. Wait, the three probabilities are each 1/3? That seems a bit symmetric. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the matrix P has eigenvalues -1, 0, 1, and the state |ψ_normalized> is such that when expanded in the eigenbasis of P, the coefficients squared give the probabilities. If all three probabilities are equal, that would mean that |ψ_normalized> is equally distributed among the three eigenvectors. But maybe the symmetry of the state vector leads to this result.\n\nLooking at the original state vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. When normalized, it's (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. The eigenvectors for P are symmetric in a certain way. For instance, |v0> is [1/√2; 0; -1/√2], which is antisymmetric in the first and third components. The original state has components -1, 2, 1. The projection onto |v0> is (-1)(1/√2) + 1*(-1/√2) divided by √6, leading to (-2/√2)/√6 = -√2/√6 = -1/√3. Squared, that's 1/3. Similarly, the other eigenvectors, when projected, give 1/√3 each. So, the symmetry here might be leading to equal probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way to see this. The matrix P looks similar to a spin-1 operator or some kind of angular momentum operator. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, note that the state vector is symmetric in the first and third components with respect to the middle component. Wait, the first component is -1, the third is 1. So, not symmetric.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **State Vector and Observable Matrix**:
   - The state vector is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The observable matrix \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

2. **Normalization of the State Vector**:
   - The norm of \( | \psi \rangle \) is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \).
   - The normalized state vector is:
     \[
     | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:
   - The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be 0, 1, and -1.
   - The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is:
     \[
     | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

4. **Projection and Probability Calculation**:
   - Compute the inner product \( \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \):
     \[
     \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:
     \[
     \left| \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

LOG, let's check if this vector is normalized. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Wait, let me check:

If the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], then its norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, to normalize it, we divide by sqrt(2), giving (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is:

|v0> = 1/√2 [1; 0; -1]

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |ψ> and |v0>.

So, let's compute <v0 | ψ>.

First, |v0> is a column vector [1/√2; 0; -1/√2], so the conjugate transpose is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]. Since all components are real, we don't have to worry about complex conjugation.

Therefore, the inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Then, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

Wait, that can't be. Probability can't be greater than 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Let me check my steps again.

First, the state vector |ψ> is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me confirm that this is a column vector. Yes, it's written as a column matrix with elements -1, 2, 1.

The eigenvector |v0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) = (-1/√2 - 1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2

But then the square of this is (√2)^2 = 2. But the total probability is 2, which is greater than 1. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, but maybe the state vector isn't normalized. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized (i.e., their norm is 1). Let me check the norm of |ψ>.

The given state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is not normalized. Therefore, I need to normalize it first before calculating probabilities.

Ah! That's a crucial step I missed. The state vector given is not normalized. So, the actual state vector should be |ψ> divided by its norm. So, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. Therefore, when calculating the inner product, I need to use the normalized state vector.

So, let's recalculate the inner product with the normalized state.

First, normalized |ψ> is:

|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[ -1 ]
                     [  2 ]
                     [  1 ]

Therefore, the inner product <v0 | ψ_normalized> is:

[1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/√6)[ -1 ]
                           [  2 ]
                           [  1 ]

Multiplying this out:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√2√6) + 0 + (-1)/(√2√6) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3

Therefore, the inner product is -1/√3. The square of the absolute value is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify the steps again.

First, check normalization of the given state:

Original |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Eigenvector |v0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T, which is correctly normalized because (1/√2)^2 + 0 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1.

Then, the inner product between |v0> and |ψ_normalized> is:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3

Then, the absolute value squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But let me just check if the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1. From the characteristic equation, we had eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. So each with multiplicity 1. Therefore, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, so only one eigenvector (up to scaling). Therefore, the projection is onto that single eigenvector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But let me cross-verify this result by another method. Maybe by diagonalizing the matrix P or using another approach.

Alternatively, since P is a symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. The probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the squared inner product as we calculated.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0 and apply it to |ψ>, then find the norm squared.

The projection operator for eigenvalue 0 is |v0><v0|. So, the projection of |ψ_normalized> onto this subspace is |v0><v0|ψ_normalized>, and the norm squared is |<v0|ψ_normalized>|², which is the same as we calculated, 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But let me make sure there isn't another eigenvector for λ=0 that I missed. Wait, when we solved Pv = 0, we found that v2 must be 0, and v1 = -v3. Therefore, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1; 0; -1]. So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, so only one normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can check using matrix multiplication. Let's confirm that P|v0> is indeed 0.

Compute P multiplied by |v0>:

P = [0, 1/√2, 0]
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
    [0, 1/√2, 0]

|v0> = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2]

First component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = 0

Third component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

So, P|v0> = [0; 0; 0], which confirms that |v0> is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, let's check the probabilities for the other eigenvalues to see if they sum up to 1. If the total probability is 1, then 1/3 is plausible.

The eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. Let's compute the probabilities for each.

First, find eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1, compute their probabilities, and check if the sum is 1.

But maybe that's too time-consuming, but let's try.

Starting with λ=1. Solve (P - I)v = 0.

P - I = [ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]
        [1/√2, -1, 1/√2]
        [0, 1/√2, -1 ]

We need to solve (P - I)v = 0.

First equation: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2)v2

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2)v2

From first equation: v1 = (1/√2)v2

From third equation: v3 = (1/√2)v2

Therefore, let v2 = a, then v1 = a/√2, v3 = a/√2

So the eigenvector is [a/√2; a; a/√2]. Let's normalize this.

Norm squared is (a²/2) + a² + (a²/2) = (a²/2 + a²/2) + a² = a² + a² = 2a². Therefore, norm is a√2. To normalize, set a√2 = 1 => a = 1/√2.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (1/√2)/√2; 1/√2; (1/√2)/√2 ] = [ 1/2; 1/√2; 1/2 ]

Wait, let's compute it step by step. If a = 1/√2, then:

v1 = (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2

v2 = 1/√2

v3 = (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T. Let's check its norm:

(1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Correct.

So, |v1> = [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -1, we need to solve (P + I)v = 0.

P + I = [1, 1/√2, 0]
        [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]
        [0, 1/√2, 1]

So, (P + I)v = 0.

First equation: v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2)v2

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2)v2

From first equation: v1 = - (1/√2)v2

From third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2

Therefore, let v2 = a, then v1 = -a/√2, v3 = -a/√2

So the eigenvector is [-a/√2; a; -a/√2]. Let's normalize this.

Norm squared is (a²/2) + a² + (a²/2) = 2a². Therefore, norm is a√2. Setting a√2 = 1 => a = 1/√2.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T.

Check norm: (1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = same as before, 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Correct.

So, |v-1> = [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T.

Now, let's compute the probabilities for each eigenvalue.

First, for λ=1, the probability is |<v1 | ψ_normalized>|².

Compute <v1 | ψ_normalized>:

|v1> = [1/2; 1/√2; 1/2]^T

|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[ -1; 2; 1 ]^T

Inner product:

(1/2)(-1/√6) + (1/√2)(2/√6) + (1/2)(1/√6)

Compute each term:

First term: (-1)/(2√6)

Second term: (2)/(√2√6) = (2)/(√12) = (2)/(2√3) = 1/√3

Third term: (1)/(2√6)

Adding them up:

(-1/(2√6) + 1/(2√6)) + 1/√3 = 0 + 1/√3 = 1/√3

Therefore, the probability is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Similarly, for λ=-1, compute <v-1 | ψ_normalized>:

|v-1> = [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]^T

Inner product:

(-1/2)(-1/√6) + (1/√2)(2/√6) + (-1/2)(1/√6)

First term: (1)/(2√6)

Second term: 2/(√2√6) = 2/√12 = 1/√3

Third term: (-1)/(2√6)

Adding them up:

(1/(2√6) - 1/(2√6)) + 1/√3 = 0 + 1/√3 = 1/√3

Probability is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Therefore, the probabilities for λ=1, 0, -1 are each 1/3. Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1, which makes sense because the state is normalized. Therefore, confirming that the probability for λ=0 is indeed 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3. So, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

But let me just check once again. Wait, the three probabilities are each 1/3? That seems a bit symmetric. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, since the matrix P has eigenvalues -1, 0, 1, and the state |ψ_normalized> is such that when expanded in the eigenbasis of P, the coefficients squared give the probabilities. If all three probabilities are equal, that would mean that |ψ_normalized> is equally distributed among the three eigenvectors. But maybe the symmetry of the state vector leads to this result.

Looking at the original state vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. When normalized, it's (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. The eigenvectors for P are symmetric in a certain way. For instance, |v0> is [1/√2; 0; -1/√2], which is antisymmetric in the first and third components. The original state has components -1, 2, 1. The projection onto |v0> is (-1)(1/√2) + 1*(-1/√2) divided by √6, leading to (-2/√2)/√6 = -√2/√6 = -1/√3. Squared, that's 1/3. Similarly, the other eigenvectors, when projected, give 1/√3 each. So, the symmetry here might be leading to equal probabilities. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way to see this. The matrix P looks similar to a spin-1 operator or some kind of angular momentum operator. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, note that the state vector is symmetric in the first and third components with respect to the middle component. Wait, the first component is -1, the third is 1. So, not symmetric. If it were symmetric (a, b, a), then maybe the projection onto |v0> would be zero. But here it's (-1, 2, 1), so not symmetric.

But regardless, the calculations step by step lead us to the result 1/3. Since all probabilities sum to 1, and each eigenvalue's probability is 1/3, this seems consistent.

Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple checks, I believe the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring 0 is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nHowever, wait, the system of equations gives v₁ = -v₃, so if we choose v₁ = 1, then v₃ = -1, giving the vector (1, 0, -1). Normalizing, we divide by sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is |v0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.\n\nNow, to compute the probability of measuring 0, we need the projection of the state |ψ> onto |v0>, then take the squared magnitude.\n\nFirst, compute the inner product <v0|ψ>:\n\n<v0|ψ> = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2\n\nThen, the probability is |<v0|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.\n\nWait, that can\'t be possible because probabilities can\'t exceed 1.

So the state is not normalized. However, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. Wait, this is a problem. The problem statement gives the state as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), but does it specify that it\'s normalized? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." There\'s no mention of normalization. Therefore, I need to normalize the state vector before computing probabilities.\n\nSo first, I must normalize |ψ>.\n\nThe norm squared of |ψ> is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

Each with algebraic multiplicity 1. Since the matrix is 3x3, the sum of multiplicities is 3, so each eigenvalue has multiplicity 1. Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, so only one eigenvector. So the probability calculation is as above.\n\nBut wait, when I first calculated the inner product without normalizing the state, I got a probability of 2, which is impossible, but then after normalizing the state, the probability becomes 1/3, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/3.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again to confirm whether the state is given as a normalized vector. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically normalized, but the problem here just says "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so maybe the user expects that the vector is not normalized. But in that case, the probability would be 2, which is impossible, so the user must have intended for the state to be normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the state is not normalized, but then the answer would have to be 2, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the vector is already normalized. Let\'s check its norm: sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = sqrt{6} ≈ 2.45. Therefore, the vector is not normalized. Hence, in order to compute the probability correctly, we must normalize it.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem does not require normalization. Let me check the problem statement again. The problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are required to be normalized. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in not normalizing the vector. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as is, and the answer is 2. But since probabilities can\'t exceed 1, that\'s impossible. So perhaps the problem expects the state to be normalized, so we need to divide by sqrt(6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not concerned with the normalization and uses the vector as given. But even then, when calculating probabilities, the squared amplitudes must sum to 1, so in that case, the user would have to normalize the state.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first, leading to a probability of 1/3.\n\nWait, but let\'s verify the entire process once again.\n\nGiven the state vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1], which is not normalized.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **State Normalization**:
   The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm of this vector is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \). The normalized state vector is:
   \[
   | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:
   The matrix \( P \) is:
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find the eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

3. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)**:
   Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:
   \[
   | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Projection and Probability**:
   The inner product of \( | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \) and \( | v_0 \rangle \) is:
   \[
   \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0(2) + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:
   \[
   \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

But we need to normalize this eigenvector. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

However, wait, the system of equations gives v₁ = -v₃, so if we choose v₁ = 1, then v₃ = -1, giving the vector (1, 0, -1). Normalizing, we divide by sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is |v0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

Now, to compute the probability of measuring 0, we need the projection of the state |ψ> onto |v0>, then take the squared magnitude.

First, compute the inner product <v0|ψ>:

<v0|ψ> = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2

Then, the probability is |<v0|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

Wait, that can't be possible because probabilities can't exceed 1. There's a mistake here.

Where did I go wrong? Let's check the calculation again.

First, the state |ψ> is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). The eigenvector |v0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

The inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2

But the norm squared of |ψ> is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the state is not normalized. However, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. Wait, this is a problem. The problem statement gives the state as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), but does it specify that it's normalized? Let me check the problem statement again.

Original problem: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." There's no mention of normalization. Therefore, I need to normalize the state vector before computing probabilities.

So first, I must normalize |ψ>.

The norm squared of |ψ> is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)^T.

Therefore, when I compute the inner product <v0|ψ>, it's actually (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) multiplied by (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Let's compute this:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

Therefore, the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but let's verify if there's another eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. Wait, the eigenvalue 0 for matrix P might have multiplicity more than 1. Let me check again.

Wait, when solving for eigenvalues, we found that the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. Each with algebraic multiplicity 1. Since the matrix is 3x3, the sum of multiplicities is 3, so each eigenvalue has multiplicity 1. Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, so only one eigenvector. So the probability calculation is as above.

But wait, when I first calculated the inner product without normalizing the state, I got a probability of 2, which is impossible, but then after normalizing the state, the probability becomes 1/3, which is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/3.

But let me check the problem statement again to confirm whether the state is given as a normalized vector. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically normalized, but the problem here just says "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so maybe the user expects that the vector is not normalized. But in that case, the probability would be 2, which is impossible, so the user must have intended for the state to be normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the state is not normalized, but then the answer would have to be 2, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the vector is already normalized. Let's check its norm: sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = sqrt{6} ≈ 2.45. Therefore, the vector is not normalized. Hence, in order to compute the probability correctly, we must normalize it.

Therefore, the correct probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem does not require normalization. Let me check the problem statement again. The problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are required to be normalized. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in not normalizing the vector. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as is, and the answer is 2. But since probabilities can't exceed 1, that's impossible. So perhaps the problem expects the state to be normalized, so we need to divide by sqrt(6).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not concerned with the normalization and uses the vector as given. But even then, when calculating probabilities, the squared amplitudes must sum to 1, so in that case, the user would have to normalize the state.

Therefore, I think the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first, leading to a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but let's verify the entire process once again.

Given the state vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1], which is not normalized. The norm is sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))[-1; 2; 1].

The observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. The eigenvector corresponding to 0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

The inner product between |v0> and |ψ_normalized> is:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

Therefore, the probability is (-1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

Hence, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

But let me check if there are any other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Suppose there's another eigenvector, but given the matrix is 3x3 with distinct eigenvalues (0, 1, -1), each eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 1, so the geometric multiplicity must also be 1. Therefore, there's only one eigenvector for λ=0.

Hence, the probability is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the eigenvector. Let me verify the eigenvector again.

For λ=0, solving (P - 0I)v = 0:

The system is:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1.

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, so v2=0.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1), so the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. Normalized, it's (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the probability is indeed 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring 0 is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

The magnitude squared is (-√2)^2 = 2. But probability can\'t be 2. So, clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nHmm. What did I do wrong?\n\nFirst, let\'s check the eigenvector. The eigenvector |v₀> is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], which is normalized because (1/√2)^2*(1 + 0 + 1) = (1/2)*2 = 1. So that\'s correct.\n\nThe state |ψ> is given as [-1; 2; 1]. Let\'s check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So |ψ> is not normalized. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? Because probabilities are calculated as squared amplitudes, and the total probability should be 1. If the state isn\'t normalized, then the probabilities would sum to the squared norm of the state. But in the problem statement, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). It\'s possible that the state is not normalized, and we need to normalize it first before calculating probabilities.\n\nAh, that\'s the mistake! The state vector given is not normalized.

Therefore, the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. However, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn\'t specify whether it\'s normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize it first. Because otherwise, the probabilities would sum to 6, which is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first.\n\nSo, compute the normalized vector:\n\n|ψ> = (1/√6) * [-1; 2; 1]\n\nThen, compute the inner product with |v₀>:\n\n<v₀ | ψ> = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] * (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1] = (1/√12)[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/(2√3))[ -1 -1 ] = (1/(2√3))(-2) = -1/√3\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, and the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that\'s better. So the key mistake was not normalizing the state vector. The problem didn\'t specify that the state is normalized, so we need to normalize it first. Then, compute the inner product with the eigenvector, and square the magnitude.\n\nBut let me confirm once again.\n\nOriginal state vector: [-1; 2; 1]. Norm squared is 6. Therefore, normalized vector is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. Then, the inner product with |v₀> = (1/√2)[1; 0; -1] is:\n\n(1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(√2√6))[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12)(-1 -1) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nSquared magnitude is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3. So, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut let me check again if the problem requires normalized states. Because sometimes, in physics problems, even if the state isn\'t normalized, you can still compute the probability as |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|². But in this case, the problem says "calculate the probability", so if the state isn\'t normalized, then the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ>. But in this case, since the inner product <v₀|ψ> is -√2, and |ψ> has norm squared 6, then the probability is |√2|² / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So same result. Therefore, either way, whether you normalize the state first and then compute the squared amplitude, or compute the squared amplitude and divide by the norm squared of the state, you get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the state is already normalized. But in that case, the inner product would be -√2, leading to probability 2, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must expect us to normalize the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where the state doesn\'t need to be normalized, and the probabilities are given by |<v₀|ψ>|², even if the total is not 1. But that\'s unconventional. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. Therefore, if the problem gives a non-normalized state, it\'s a trick question where you have to normalize it first. Therefore, the correct answer is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector.\n\nWait, let\'s check again.\n\nThe eigenvalue λ=0. The equations are:\n\nFrom Pv = 0:\n\nFirst equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.\n\nThird equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are indeed [v1; 0; -v1] = v1[1; 0; -1]. So the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], up to scaling. Then, when normalized, it\'s (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], as before. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the inner product calculation is correct. So, if we take the given vector as non-normalized, then the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|² = |(-√2)|² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if we first normalize |ψ> to (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1], then compute the inner product with |v₀>, which is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], then the inner product is (1/√6)(-1)(1) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1) = ( -1 -1 ) / √6 = -2 / √6 = -√(2/3). Then, the squared magnitude is (2/3). Wait, that contradicts the previous result. Wait, what\'s happening here?\n\nWait, hold on. If |v₀> is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], and |ψ_normalized> is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1], then:\n\n<v₀ | ψ_normalized> = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(√2√6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0 + (-1)(1) ] = (1/√12)( -1 -1 ) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.\n\nThen, | -1/√3 |² = 1/3. So that\'s correct. So, the probability is 1/3.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of |ψ> not normalized, the inner product was -√2, then squared is 2, divided by |ψ|²=6, gives 1/3. So same result. Therefore, both methods give the same answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether we first normalize the state or compute the probability as |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|², we get 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3.\n\nBut let me check once more, maybe there\'s another eigenvector for λ=0. Wait, the eigenvalue λ=0. The matrix P has rank 2, since the first and third rows are [0,1/√2,0] and [0,1/√2,0], which are the same except scaled. Wait, no, first row is [0,1/√2,0], second row is [1/√2,0,1/√2], third row is [0,1/√2,0]. So, rows 1 and 3 are the same. Therefore, the rank of P is 2, since rows 1 and 3 are the same, and row 2 is different. Therefore, the rank is 2, so the null space (eigenvectors for λ=0) is 3 - 2 = 1 dimensional. Therefore, only one eigenvector for λ=0, which is [1;0;-1], as before.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So, the projection is only onto that vector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a miscalculation in the inner product.\n\nWait, let\'s compute the inner product again.\n\nOriginal vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1], |v₀> = [1; 0; -1].\n\nThe inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. Then, if we don\'t normalize, the amplitude is -2, but since |v₀> is not normalized, we have to divide by the norm of |v₀> and the norm of |ψ>.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the standard formula, the probability is |<v₀ | ψ>|² divided by (|<v₀|v₀> * <ψ|ψ>). But since |v₀> is normalized, <v₀|v₀> = 1, and <ψ|ψ> = 6. Therefore, the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² / 6. <v₀|ψ> is (-2), so squared is 4, divided by 6 is 2/3. Wait, now this contradicts the previous result.\n\nWait, but hold on.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given state and observable matrix:**
   - The state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The observable matrix \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

2. **Find the eigenvalues of \( P \):**
   - Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find the eigenvalues to be 0, 1, and -1.

3. **Determine the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:**
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - Normalizing this eigenvector gives \( | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

4. **Normalize the given state vector:**
   - The norm of \( | \psi \rangle \) is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \).
   - The normalized state vector is \( | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

5. **Calculate the inner product and probability:**
   - Compute the inner product \( \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \):
     \[
     \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is the squared magnitude of this inner product:
     \[
     \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

Wait, since eigenvectors can be scaled, but we need an orthonormal basis. Let's check if this vector is normalized:

The vector [1; 0; -1] has a norm squared of 1² + 0 + (-1)² = 2. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1].

Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is:

|v₀> = (1/√2) [1, 0, -1]^T

Wait, let's confirm this. Let me compute P acting on |v₀>:

P |v₀> = (1/√2) * [0, 1/√2, 0; 1/√2, 0, 1/√2; 0, 1/√2, 0] * [1; 0; -1]

First element: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

Second element: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2) - (1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

Hence, P |v₀> = [0; 0; 0] = 0 * |v₀>, which confirms that |v₀> is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by |v₀> = (1/√2)[1; 0; -1].

Now, the state |ψ> is given as:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

To find the probability of measuring 0, we need the projection of |ψ> onto |v₀>, then take the squared magnitude.

First, compute the inner product <v₀ | ψ>:

<v₀ | ψ> = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] [ -1 ]
                         [  2 ]
                         [  1 ]

Multiply component-wise:

(1/√2)[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√2)[ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/√2)(-2) = -2/√2 = -√2

Therefore, the amplitude is -√2, and the probability is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

Wait, that's a probability of 2? But probabilities can't exceed 1. That's impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's check the calculation again.

Wait, the inner product is (1/√2)[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√2)(-1 -1) = (1/√2)(-2) = -2/√2 = -√2. The magnitude squared is (-√2)^2 = 2. But probability can't be 2. So, clearly, something is wrong here.

Hmm. What did I do wrong?

First, let's check the eigenvector. The eigenvector |v₀> is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], which is normalized because (1/√2)^2*(1 + 0 + 1) = (1/2)*2 = 1. So that's correct.

The state |ψ> is given as [-1; 2; 1]. Let's check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So |ψ> is not normalized. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? Because probabilities are calculated as squared amplitudes, and the total probability should be 1. If the state isn't normalized, then the probabilities would sum to the squared norm of the state. But in the problem statement, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). It's possible that the state is not normalized, and we need to normalize it first before calculating probabilities.

Ah, that's the mistake! The state vector given is not normalized. So, I need to normalize it first. Let me confirm.

The given state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. However, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't specify whether it's normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize it first. Because otherwise, the probabilities would sum to 6, which is not valid.

Therefore, the correct approach is to normalize the state vector first.

So, compute the normalized vector:

|ψ> = (1/√6) * [-1; 2; 1]

Then, compute the inner product with |v₀>:

<v₀ | ψ> = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] * (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1] = (1/√12)[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/(2√3))[ -1 -1 ] = (1/(2√3))(-2) = -1/√3

Therefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, and the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that's better. So the key mistake was not normalizing the state vector. The problem didn't specify that the state is normalized, so we need to normalize it first. Then, compute the inner product with the eigenvector, and square the magnitude.

But let me confirm once again.

Original state vector: [-1; 2; 1]. Norm squared is 6. Therefore, normalized vector is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1]. Then, the inner product with |v₀> = (1/√2)[1; 0; -1] is:

(1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(√2√6))[1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12)(-1 -1) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

Squared magnitude is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3. So, the probability is 1/3.

But let me check again if the problem requires normalized states. Because sometimes, in physics problems, even if the state isn't normalized, you can still compute the probability as |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|². But in this case, the problem says "calculate the probability", so if the state isn't normalized, then the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ>. But in this case, since the inner product <v₀|ψ> is -√2, and |ψ> has norm squared 6, then the probability is |√2|² / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So same result. Therefore, either way, whether you normalize the state first and then compute the squared amplitude, or compute the squared amplitude and divide by the norm squared of the state, you get the same result.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the state is already normalized. But in that case, the inner product would be -√2, leading to probability 2, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must expect us to normalize the state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where the state doesn't need to be normalized, and the probabilities are given by |<v₀|ψ>|², even if the total is not 1. But that's unconventional. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. Therefore, if the problem gives a non-normalized state, it's a trick question where you have to normalize it first. Therefore, the correct answer is 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector.

Wait, let's check again.

The eigenvalue λ=0. The equations are:

From Pv = 0:

First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are indeed [v1; 0; -v1] = v1[1; 0; -1]. So the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], up to scaling. Then, when normalized, it's (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], as before. So that's correct.

Therefore, the inner product calculation is correct. So, if we take the given vector as non-normalized, then the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|² = |(-√2)|² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if we first normalize |ψ> to (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1], then compute the inner product with |v₀>, which is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], then the inner product is (1/√6)(-1)(1) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1) = ( -1 -1 ) / √6 = -2 / √6 = -√(2/3). Then, the squared magnitude is (2/3). Wait, that contradicts the previous result. Wait, what's happening here?

Wait, hold on. If |v₀> is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1], and |ψ_normalized> is (1/√6)[-1; 2; 1], then:

<v₀ | ψ_normalized> = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/(√2√6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0 + (-1)(1) ] = (1/√12)( -1 -1 ) = (-2)/√12 = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.

Then, | -1/√3 |² = 1/3. So that's correct. So, the probability is 1/3.

But earlier, when I thought of |ψ> not normalized, the inner product was -√2, then squared is 2, divided by |ψ|²=6, gives 1/3. So same result. Therefore, both methods give the same answer.

Therefore, regardless of whether we first normalize the state or compute the probability as |<v₀|ψ>|² / |ψ|², we get 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

But let me check once more, maybe there's another eigenvector for λ=0. Wait, the eigenvalue λ=0. The matrix P has rank 2, since the first and third rows are [0,1/√2,0] and [0,1/√2,0], which are the same except scaled. Wait, no, first row is [0,1/√2,0], second row is [1/√2,0,1/√2], third row is [0,1/√2,0]. So, rows 1 and 3 are the same. Therefore, the rank of P is 2, since rows 1 and 3 are the same, and row 2 is different. Therefore, the rank is 2, so the null space (eigenvectors for λ=0) is 3 - 2 = 1 dimensional. Therefore, only one eigenvector for λ=0, which is [1;0;-1], as before.

Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So, the projection is only onto that vector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the inner product.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again.

Original vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1], |v₀> = [1; 0; -1].

The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. Then, if we don't normalize, the amplitude is -2, but since |v₀> is not normalized, we have to divide by the norm of |v₀> and the norm of |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, in the standard formula, the probability is |<v₀ | ψ>|² divided by (|<v₀|v₀> * <ψ|ψ>). But since |v₀> is normalized, <v₀|v₀> = 1, and <ψ|ψ> = 6. Therefore, the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² / 6. <v₀|ψ> is (-2), so squared is 4, divided by 6 is 2/3. Wait, now this contradicts the previous result.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, if |v₀> is normalized, then the projection is <v₀|ψ>, and the probability is |<v₀|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ> if |ψ> is not normalized.

Wait, let me clarify.

In quantum mechanics, if the state is |ψ> and it's not normalized, then the probability of measuring eigenvalue λ is the sum over eigenvectors |v_i> of λ of |<v_i | ψ>|² divided by <ψ | ψ>.

Because the Born rule states that the probability is the squared modulus of the amplitude divided by the norm squared of the state vector.

But in this case, since the state is given without normalization, we need to compute:

Probability = |<v₀ | ψ>|² / <ψ | ψ>

Where <v₀ | ψ> is the inner product, and <ψ | ψ> is the norm squared of |ψ>.

In our case, <v₀ | ψ> = [1, 0, -1]^† [-1; 2; 1] = (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 -1 = -2.

Therefore, |<v₀ | ψ>|² = 4.

The norm squared of |ψ> is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, probability = 4 / 6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

But wait, this contradicts the previous result of 1/3. Which is correct?

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises from whether |v₀> is normalized or not.

If |v₀> is not normalized, then the projection would be <v₀ | ψ> divided by the norm of |v₀>, but since in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are typically normalized, so the formula is |<v₀ | ψ>|² / <ψ | ψ>, assuming |v₀> is normalized.

But in our case, |v₀> is normalized. Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvector we found was [1; 0; -1], which has norm squared 2, so to normalize it, we divide by √2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1; 0; -1].

Therefore, if we use the normalized eigenvector, then <v₀ | ψ> is (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) · (-1, 2, 1) = (1/√2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Then, |<v₀ | ψ>|² = (√2)^2 = 2.

Then, the norm squared of |ψ> is 6.

Therefore, the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But if we use the non-normalized eigenvector [1; 0; -1], then <v₀ | ψ> = -2, and |<v₀ | ψ>|² = 4. The norm squared of |v₀> is 2, so the correct probability would be |<v₀ | ψ>|² / (|<v₀|² |ψ|²) ) ?

Wait, no. The formula is that the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of the state. The projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace is given by the sum over i |<v_i | ψ>|² / <ψ | ψ>, where v_i are an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace.

But in our case, since the eigenspace is one-dimensional and spanned by the normalized eigenvector |v₀>, the probability is |<v₀ | ψ>|² / <ψ | ψ>.

But <v₀ | ψ> is computed with |v₀> normalized. Wait, but in the previous calculation, when we used the normalized |v₀>, we got <v₀ | ψ> = -√2, so |<v₀ | ψ>|² = 2, and then divided by <ψ | ψ> = 6, gives 2/6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if we use non-normalized |v₀>, then the projection is <v₀ | ψ> = -2, and the norm squared of |v₀> is 2, so the normalized projection would be (-2)/√2 = -√2, same as before. Then, the squared magnitude is 2, divided by <ψ | ψ> = 6, gives 1/3.

Either way, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the correct answer is 1/3.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but that would be incorrect because the norm squared is 6. So, the problem must expect us to compute the probability considering the state's norm. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.
