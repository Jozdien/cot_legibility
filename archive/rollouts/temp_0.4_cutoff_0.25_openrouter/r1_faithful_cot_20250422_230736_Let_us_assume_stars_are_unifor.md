Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. 

1. **Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \).

2. **Volume Element in Distance Space**: The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \).

3. **Change of Variables to Parallax**: Expressing distance in terms of parallax, \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The differential \( dd \) in terms of \( d(\text{plx}) \) is \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d(\text{plx}) \). Taking the absolute value, we get \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d(\text{plx}) \).

4. **Volume Element in Parallax Space**: Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( |dd| \) into the volume element:
   \[
   4\pi d^2 \, |dd| = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) d(\text{plx}) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d(\text{plx})
   \]

5. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the volume element in parallax space. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, parallax is related to distance, right? The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance, so plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. 

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is constant in space. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd. But since we're dealing with parallax instead of distance, I need to express this in terms of plx. 

Let me write d = 1/plx. Then, the differential dd would be the derivative of d with respect to plx. So dd/d(plx) = -1/plx². Taking the absolute value (since we can't have negative volume), |dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx). 

So substituting back into the volume element: 4πd² |dd| = 4π(1/plx²)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the substitution again. 

Original volume element is 4πd² dd. If d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx², and dd = -1/plx² d(plx). So substituting, the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx²)*(1/plx²) d(plx) when considering the absolute value. So that's 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, this seems like a very steep decline. If the number density is uniform in space, then the number of stars in a parallax bin d(plx) should be proportional to the volume element at the corresponding distance. Since volume element scales as d² dd, and d is 1/plx, then substituting gives the scaling as (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So yes, the number per unit parallax would be proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But let me think again. If I have more nearby stars, the closer you get, the more stars you can fit in a given parallax interval? Wait, but parallax is inversely related to distance. So a small parallax corresponds to a large distance. So as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases as 1/plx⁴? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, if we have larger distances (smaller plx), the volume per unit parallax would be larger? Let me see. 

Suppose plx is small (large distance). The volume element is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then a small plx corresponds to a large d. The term d² is (1/plx²), and dd is (1/plx²) d(plx). So multiplying them gives 1/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the volume element increases as plx decreases. So the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases (i.e., as you go to larger distances). But wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, then shouldn't the number of stars increase with distance cubed? Wait, no, because the volume element is a shell, which is proportional to d² dd. So for each shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. But when we change variables to plx, since dd = -1/plx² d(plx), the volume becomes 4π(1/plx²)(1/plx² d(plx)) = 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars in a parallax bin d(plx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But when plx is small (large distance), 1/plx⁴ is large, meaning that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. However, in reality, we know that stars are not uniformly distributed to infinite distance, so this would imply that the number of stars increases without bound as plx approaches zero. But in our case, the assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed, which might not account for the actual distribution or the finite number of stars. 

But given the problem statement, we have to assume uniformity, so the answer should follow the 1/plx⁴ relation. Let me check with an example. Suppose we have a parallax range from 0.1 to 0.2 arcseconds. The corresponding distances are from 10 to 5 parsecs. The volume between 5 and 10 parsecs is 4/3 π (10³ - 5³) ≈ 4/3 π (1000 - 125) ≈ 4/3 π * 875 ≈ 1166.666π. 

If we take a parallax range from 0.05 to 0.1, which corresponds to distances from 20 to 10 parsecs. The volume is 4/3 π (20³ - 10³) = 4/3 π (8000 - 1000) = 4/3 π * 7000 ≈ 9333.333π. 

So the volume (and hence number of stars, if uniform) is larger for the lower parallax (larger distance) bin. But the size of the parallax bins in the first case is 0.1 (from 0.1 to 0.2), and in the second case is 0.05 (from 0.05 to 0.1). Wait, but the question is about number per unit parallax. So for the first bin, 0.1 to 0.2 (Δplx = 0.1), the number is proportional to 1166.666π. So per unit parallax, that would be 1166.666π / 0.1 ≈ 11666.66π. 

For the second bin, 0.05 to 0.1 (Δplx = 0.05), the number is proportional to 9333.333π. So per unit parallax, that's 9333.333π / 0.05 ≈ 186,666.66π. 

Comparing the two, when plx is smaller (second bin), the number per unit parallax is higher. So 186k vs 11k, which is about 16 times higher. But the plx ratio is 0.1/0.05 = 2. So (1/plx⁴) would predict (0.1/0.05)^4 = 16. Indeed, 186,666 / 11,666 ≈ 16. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Therefore, the number increases as plx decreases. 

But wait, another way to think: since dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴. So the density in parallax space is ∝ plx^-4. So when you plot dN/d(plx) vs plx, it's a power law with exponent -4. 

But let me also consider if there's a Jacobian involved. When changing variables from distance to parallax, the number density transforms as n(d) * |dd/d plx|. If n(d) is constant (uniform distribution), then dN/d plx = n * 4πd² * |dd/d plx|. Since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/plx². So |dd/d plx| = 1/plx². Therefore, dN/d plx = 4πn * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 4πn / plx⁴. 

Yes, that's the same result. So the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. Therefore, as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases as 1/plx⁴. 

So the answer is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx^-4, so it increases with the inverse fourth power of parallax. But since plx is inversely related to distance, this means that at smaller parallaxes (larger distances), there are more stars per unit parallax. However, in reality, this would require an infinite number of stars at zero parallax (infinite distance), which is unphysical, but under the assumption of uniform distribution (ignoring the finite extent of the galaxy or the universe), this is the result. 

I think that's it. Let me just check if I made a mistake with the exponents. So dN/d plx = 4πn d² * |dd/d plx|. Since d = 1/plx, d² = 1/plx², and |dd/d plx| = 1/plx². So multiplying together gives 1/plx² * 1/plx² = 1/plx⁴. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is proportional to plx^-4. So the number per unit parallax decreases as plx increases. Wait, hold on. If you have a higher plx (closer stars), the number per unit parallax is lower? But in reality, we have more stars at larger distances (if uniform density), so in terms of parallax, which is inverse distance, the number per unit parallax should increase as plx decreases. 

Wait, but the formula says dN/d plx ∝ plx^-4. So when plx is large (close stars), dN/d plx is small, and when plx is small (distant stars), dN/d plx is large. That's correct, because even though the volume at larger distances is bigger, the parallax is getting smaller, and the unit parallax interval corresponds to a larger distance interval. Wait, actually, the relation is non-linear because parallax and distance are inversely related. 

But in terms of the number per parallax bin, if you have a fixed parallax bin Δplx, the corresponding distance bin is Δd = Δ(1/plx) ≈ -Δplx / plx². So for a given Δplx, the physical distance interval Δd is larger when plx is smaller. Therefore, even though the volume at larger distances (smaller plx) is larger, the fact that the parallax bin corresponds to a larger distance interval means that the volume (and hence number of stars) per Δplx increases. 

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. The number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases, following a plx^-4 relation. 

So the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4, so it increases with decreasing parallax. Therefore, the function is N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}.

**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Therefore, the relationship is \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies with parallax, assuming uniform stellar distribution across the sky. Parallax (plx) relates inversely to distance, expressed as plx = 1/d, where d represents distance in parsecs.

With uniform stellar distribution, the number density remains constant throughout space. The number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to that shell's volume, which equals 4πd² dd. However, since I'm working with parallax rather than distance, I must convert this expression.

Given that d = 1/plx, I need to find dd in terms of plx. The differential dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx, which equals -1/plx². Taking the absolute value (since volume can't be negative), |dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx).

Substituting into the volume element: 4πd² |dd| = 4π(1/plx²)² × (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx⁴ d(plx).

Let me verify this calculation. The original volume element is 4πd² dd. With d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx², and dd = -1/plx² d(plx). Substituting and using the absolute value gives 4π × (1/plx²) × (1/plx²) d(plx), which equals 4π/plx⁴ d(plx).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.

This steep decline makes sense when considering that volume scales as d² dd. Since d equals 1/plx, substitution yields (1/plx²) × (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). This confirms that the number per unit parallax is indeed proportional to 1/plx⁴.

As parallax decreases (meaning distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases proportionally to 1/plx⁴.

I need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, given a uniform distribution of stars across the sky. Parallax is indeed related to distance as it is inversely proportional; therefore, parallax (plx) equals 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs, so plx = 1/d.

With a uniform star distribution, their number density is constant in space. Thus, the number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the shell's volume. The volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd. But since we’re focusing on parallax, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Setting d = 1/plx, the differential dd becomes the derivative of d with respect to plx. Therefore, dd/d(plx) = -1/plx², and taking the absolute value (since a negative volume is non-physical), |dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx).

Substituting back into the volume element, we have: 4πd² |dd| = 4π(1/plx²)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Wait, there might be a mistake. Let me verify this substitution.

Initially, the volume element is 4πd² dd. With d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx², and dd = -1/plx² d(plx). Thus, after substitution, the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx²)*(1/plx²) d(plx) with the absolute value considered, resulting in 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Hence, the number of stars per unit parallax conforms to the inverse fourth power of parallax.

Wait, this conclusion appears to suggest a steep decline. Given uniform space density, the number of stars in a parallax bin d(plx) should be proportional to the volume at that distance. Volume scales with d² dd, and with d equivalent to 1/plx, substituting results in a scaling of (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). Thus, indeed, the number per unit parallax scales as 1/plx⁴.

But let me ponder further. With more stars nearby, the closer the proximity, the more stars you fit within a certain parallax interval. But parallax inversely relates to distance, so smaller parallax means a larger distance. Thus, as parallax drops (meaning distance grows), the number of stars per unit parallax boosts as 1/plx⁴. But that seems contradict…

Wait, let\'s take an example. Suppose we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + d(plx). The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + d(plx)). But since d(plx) is small, we can approximate dd ≈ -d(plx)/plx². The volume between d and d + dd is 4πd² |dd| = 4π (1/plx²) (d(plx)/plx²) = 4π d(plx)/plx⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is N(plx) d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So the number density per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive. If we have a uniform distribution, the number of stars should increase with distance cubed? Wait, no. Wait, in a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dd. So if you go to larger distances (smaller parallax), the volume per shell increases as d², but the thickness in distance dd corresponds to a smaller d(plx) as d increases. \n\nSo translating the volume element from distance to parallax, which we did, gives a steeper dependence. So even though the volume per distance interval increases with d², the fact that the parallax interval corresponds to a smaller distance interval at larger distances (since dd = -d(plx)/plx²) causes the number per parallax to go as 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut let me check another way. Suppose we consider a small interval in parallax, say from p to p + dp. The corresponding distances are from d = 1/p to d\' = 1/(p + dp). The difference in distance is Δd = 1/(p + dp) - 1/p ≈ -dp/p² (using a Taylor expansion). So the volume between d and d\' is approximately 4πd² |Δd| = 4π (1/p²) (dp/p²) = 4π dp / p⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 4π dp / p⁴. Therefore, the number per unit parallax (dp) is N(p) = 4π / p⁴. \n\nTherefore, the number density of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. So as parallax increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax increases? Wait, no. Wait, if N(p) dp is the number of stars between p and p + dp, then N(p) is 4π / p⁴. So when p is small (distant stars), N(p) is large. But since dp is a small interval in parallax, which corresponds to a large interval in distance. Wait, but no, because even though dp is small, when p is small (large distance), the corresponding dd is large (since dd ≈ dp / p²). But we are counting the number of stars in that parallax interval. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that even though the actual number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d², when we express this in terms of parallax, the number per unit parallax becomes steeper because the parallax and distance are inversely related. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different way to think about it. Let\'s consider the differential number density. If stars are uniformly distributed in space with a spatial density n (stars per pc³), then the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is dN = n * 4πd² dd. \n\nExpressing this in terms of parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, dN = n * 4π (1/p²)² * (1/p²) dp = n * 4π / p⁴ dp. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. \n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to p⁻⁴. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of the parallax. So as parallax increases (i.e., for closer stars), the number per unit parallax increases, but wait, no. Wait, if p is increasing (closer stars), then p⁻⁴ is decreasing. Wait, that can\'t be. If p increases, 1/p⁴ decreases. So the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as parallax increases. That seems contradictory. Wait, no, because when p is larger (closer stars), the volume element per unit parallax is smaller. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose p is the parallax. A unit range of parallax at small p (distant stars) corresponds to a larger volume than a unit range of parallax at large p (nearby stars). Therefore, if the stars are uniformly distributed, there should be more stars in a unit parallax interval at small p (distant stars) than at large p (nearby stars). \n\nBut according to the formula, dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. So as p increases (closer stars), dN/dp decreases. That is, there are fewer stars per unit parallax at larger p (nearby) than at smaller p (distant). But that seems counterintuitive because nearby volumes are smaller, so even though the volume per parallax interval is smaller, the density is uniform. Wait, maybe the key is that even though the actual volume at closer distances is smaller, the way parallax maps to distance causes the volume per unit parallax to increase as p decreases. \n\nWait, let\'s take concrete numbers. Suppose p is 1 arcsec (distance 1 pc). A unit parallax interval from 1 to 2 arcsec corresponds to distances from 1 pc to 0.5 pc. The volume is a shell from 0.5 to 1 pc. The volume is (4π/3)(1³ - 0.5³) = (4π/3)(1 - 0.125) = (4π/3)(0.875) ≈ 3.66 pc³. \n\nBut if p is 0.1 arcsec (distance 10 pc), a unit parallax interval from 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec corresponds to distances from 10 pc to 5 pc. The volume is (4π/3)(10³ - 5³) = (4π/3)(1000 - 125) = (4π/3)(875) ≈ 3660 pc³. \n\nSo even though the parallax interval is the same (1 arcsec), the corresponding volume is much larger at smaller p (larger distances). Therefore, the number of stars in that interval should be much larger, which is why dN/dp is proportional to 1/p⁴. For p=1, dN/dp is proportional to 1, and for p=0.1, it\'s proportional to 1/(0.1)^4 = 10000. But in my example, the volume at p=0.1 is 1000 times larger than at p=1 (since 3660 / 3.66 ≈ 1000). Wait, but according to the formula, dN/dp is proportional to 1/p⁴. So from p=1 to p=0.1, the factor is (1/0.1)^4 = 10000, but the actual volume only increased by 1000. \n\nWait, there\'s a discrepancy here. Wait, in my example, the parallax interval is 1 arcsec in both cases. But when p is 1, the interval is from 1 to 2, and when p is 0.1, the interval is from 0.1 to 1.1. Wait, actually, if we take a unit parallax interval, say from p to p + 1, but when p is already 1, adding 1 doubles the parallax, but when p is 0.1, adding 1 makes it 1.1, which is an order of magnitude larger. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when we talk about "per unit parallax", we need to consider differential intervals, not unit intervals. Because the relationship is non-linear. So actually, the correct way is to take an infinitesimal interval dp, and compute dN/dp. \n\nSo in the example, taking dp=0.1 for p=1, the corresponding dd is approximately -dp/p² = -0.1/1 = -0.1 pc. So the volume is 4π(1)^2 * 0.1 = 0.4π pc³. \n\nFor p=0.1, dp=0.1, then dd = -0.1/(0.1)^2 = -10 pc. The volume is 4π(10)^2 * 10 = 4000π pc³. So the volume at p=0.1 with dp=0.1 is 4000π, which is 10000 times larger than the volume at p=1 with dp=0.1 (0.4π). Which matches the formula dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. Because at p=1, it\'s 4πn /1, and at p=0.1, it\'s 4πn / (0.1)^4 = 4πn / 0.0001 = 40000πn. Which is 10000 times larger. \n\nBut in my initial example, when I took a unit parallax interval (from p to p+1), that\'s not a differential interval, so the scaling is different. But in the problem statement, it says "per unit range of parallax", which is dN/dp, the differential number per parallax. So in that case, the answer is that dN/dp ∝ p^-4. \n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as the fourth power of parallax. Wait, but if p increases, dN/dp decreases. So for larger parallaxes (closer stars), the number per unit parallax is smaller. That seems correct because a given dp corresponds to a smaller volume when p is larger (distance is smaller). For example, a small dp at large p (nearby) corresponds to a tiny shell in space, hence fewer stars. Whereas the same dp at small p (distant) corresponds to a much larger shell, hence more stars. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to p^-4.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. 

1. **Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d) in parsecs, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \).

2. **Volume Element in Distance Space**: For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \).

3. **Transforming to Parallax Space**: Expressing distance in terms of parallax, \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The differential distance \( dd \) in terms of parallax is \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d(\text{plx}) \). Taking the absolute value, we get \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d(\text{plx}) \).

4. **Volume Element in Parallax Space**: Substituting \( d \) and \( dd \) into the volume element:
   \[
   4\pi d^2 \, |dd| = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) d(\text{plx}) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d(\text{plx})
   \]

5. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the volume element in parallax space, which scales as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

founding. Wait, let's take an example. Suppose we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + d(plx). The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + d(plx)). But since d(plx) is small, we can approximate dd ≈ -d(plx)/plx². The volume between d and d + dd is 4πd² |dd| = 4π (1/plx²) (d(plx)/plx²) = 4π d(plx)/plx⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 4π/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is N(plx) d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So the number density per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If we have a uniform distribution, the number of stars should increase with distance cubed? Wait, no. Wait, in a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dd. So if you go to larger distances (smaller parallax), the volume per shell increases as d², but the thickness in distance dd corresponds to a smaller d(plx) as d increases. 

So translating the volume element from distance to parallax, which we did, gives a steeper dependence. So even though the volume per distance interval increases with d², the fact that the parallax interval corresponds to a smaller distance interval at larger distances (since dd = -d(plx)/plx²) causes the number per parallax to go as 1/plx⁴. 

But let me check another way. Suppose we consider a small interval in parallax, say from p to p + dp. The corresponding distances are from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p + dp). The difference in distance is Δd = 1/(p + dp) - 1/p ≈ -dp/p² (using a Taylor expansion). So the volume between d and d' is approximately 4πd² |Δd| = 4π (1/p²) (dp/p²) = 4π dp / p⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 4π dp / p⁴. Therefore, the number per unit parallax (dp) is N(p) = 4π / p⁴. 

Therefore, the number density of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. So as parallax increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax increases? Wait, no. Wait, if N(p) dp is the number of stars between p and p + dp, then N(p) is 4π / p⁴. So when p is small (distant stars), N(p) is large. But since dp is a small interval in parallax, which corresponds to a large interval in distance. Wait, but no, because even though dp is small, when p is small (large distance), the corresponding dd is large (since dd ≈ dp / p²). But we are counting the number of stars in that parallax interval. 

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that even though the actual number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d², when we express this in terms of parallax, the number per unit parallax becomes steeper because the parallax and distance are inversely related. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to think about it. Let's consider the differential number density. If stars are uniformly distributed in space with a spatial density n (stars per pc³), then the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is dN = n * 4πd² dd. 

Expressing this in terms of parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, dN = n * 4π (1/p²)² * (1/p²) dp = n * 4π / p⁴ dp. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to p⁻⁴. 

Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of the parallax. So as parallax increases (i.e., for closer stars), the number per unit parallax increases, but wait, no. Wait, if p is increasing (closer stars), then p⁻⁴ is decreasing. Wait, that can't be. If p increases, 1/p⁴ decreases. So the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as parallax increases. That seems contradictory. Wait, no, because when p is larger (closer stars), the volume element per unit parallax is smaller. Let me think again. 

Suppose p is the parallax. A unit range of parallax at small p (distant stars) corresponds to a larger volume than a unit range of parallax at large p (nearby stars). Therefore, if the stars are uniformly distributed, there should be more stars in a unit parallax interval at small p (distant stars) than at large p (nearby stars). 

But according to the formula, dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. So as p increases (closer stars), dN/dp decreases. That is, there are fewer stars per unit parallax at larger p (nearby) than at smaller p (distant). But that seems counterintuitive because nearby volumes are smaller, so even though the volume per parallax interval is smaller, the density is uniform. Wait, maybe the key is that even though the actual volume at closer distances is smaller, the way parallax maps to distance causes the volume per unit parallax to increase as p decreases. 

Wait, let's take concrete numbers. Suppose p is 1 arcsec (distance 1 pc). A unit parallax interval from 1 to 2 arcsec corresponds to distances from 1 pc to 0.5 pc. The volume is a shell from 0.5 to 1 pc. The volume is (4π/3)(1³ - 0.5³) = (4π/3)(1 - 0.125) = (4π/3)(0.875) ≈ 3.66 pc³. 

But if p is 0.1 arcsec (distance 10 pc), a unit parallax interval from 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec corresponds to distances from 10 pc to 5 pc. The volume is (4π/3)(10³ - 5³) = (4π/3)(1000 - 125) = (4π/3)(875) ≈ 3660 pc³. 

So even though the parallax interval is the same (1 arcsec), the corresponding volume is much larger at smaller p (larger distances). Therefore, the number of stars in that interval should be much larger, which is why dN/dp is proportional to 1/p⁴. For p=1, dN/dp is proportional to 1, and for p=0.1, it's proportional to 1/(0.1)^4 = 10000. But in my example, the volume at p=0.1 is 1000 times larger than at p=1 (since 3660 / 3.66 ≈ 1000). Wait, but according to the formula, dN/dp is proportional to 1/p⁴. So from p=1 to p=0.1, the factor is (1/0.1)^4 = 10000, but the actual volume only increased by 1000. 

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, in my example, the parallax interval is 1 arcsec in both cases. But when p is 1, the interval is from 1 to 2, and when p is 0.1, the interval is from 0.1 to 1.1. Wait, actually, if we take a unit parallax interval, say from p to p + 1, but when p is already 1, adding 1 doubles the parallax, but when p is 0.1, adding 1 makes it 1.1, which is an order of magnitude larger. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that when we talk about "per unit parallax", we need to consider differential intervals, not unit intervals. Because the relationship is non-linear. So actually, the correct way is to take an infinitesimal interval dp, and compute dN/dp. 

So in the example, taking dp=0.1 for p=1, the corresponding dd is approximately -dp/p² = -0.1/1 = -0.1 pc. So the volume is 4π(1)^2 * 0.1 = 0.4π pc³. 

For p=0.1, dp=0.1, then dd = -0.1/(0.1)^2 = -10 pc. The volume is 4π(10)^2 * 10 = 4000π pc³. So the volume at p=0.1 with dp=0.1 is 4000π, which is 10000 times larger than the volume at p=1 with dp=0.1 (0.4π). Which matches the formula dN/dp = 4πn / p⁴. Because at p=1, it's 4πn /1, and at p=0.1, it's 4πn / (0.1)^4 = 4πn / 0.0001 = 40000πn. Which is 10000 times larger. 

But in my initial example, when I took a unit parallax interval (from p to p+1), that's not a differential interval, so the scaling is different. But in the problem statement, it says "per unit range of parallax", which is dN/dp, the differential number per parallax. So in that case, the answer is that dN/dp ∝ p^-4. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as the fourth power of parallax. Wait, but if p increases, dN/dp decreases. So for larger parallaxes (closer stars), the number per unit parallax is smaller. That seems correct because a given dp corresponds to a smaller volume when p is larger (distance is smaller). For example, a small dp at large p (nearby) corresponds to a tiny shell in space, hence fewer stars. Whereas the same dp at small p (distant) corresponds to a much larger shell, hence more stars. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to p^-4. So the number per unit parallax increases as parallax decreases (i.e., as you look at more distant stars). Therefore, if you plot the number of stars per unit parallax against parallax, it would be a steeply increasing function as parallax decreases. 

But wait, the question is "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So the answer is that it's proportional to plx^-4, meaning that as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases. So the function is a decreasing function of plx. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range falls off as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. 

I think that's the correct conclusion. Let me check if there's another way this is derived. 

In astronomy, the relation between the number density and parallax is a standard result. The general formula for the density of stars in parallax space is derived from the Jacobian determinant when changing variables from distance to parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the Jacobian is |dd/d plx| = 1/plx². Therefore, the volume element in parallax space is 4πd² * |dd/d plx| d plx = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π/plx⁴ d plx. Hence, the number per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. 

Yes, that's consistent with what I derived earlier. So the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax, i.e., N(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁴. 

**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Therefore, the relationship is given by \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) scales inversely with the fourth power of the parallax, \( N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4} \), under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution in space. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Parallax-Distance Relation**: Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) (where \( d \) is in parsecs).

2. **Volume Element**: For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the shell's volume:

3. **Convert to Parallax**: Substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d(\text{plx}) \):
   \[

However, the question is purely theoretical, assuming uniform distribution and all stars are detectable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let\'s think step by step.\n\nThe number of stars N in a parallax range [plx, plx + d(plx)] is equal to the number of stars in the corresponding distance range [d, d + dd], where d = 1/plx and dd = |d(1/plx)| = (1/plx²) d(plx). The number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density. Substituting d and dd, we get n * 4π*(1/plx²)*(1/plx²) d(plx) = n * 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number per unit parallax increases as the fourth power. However, in reality, this would mean that there are vastly more stars at smaller parallaxes (fainter, more distant stars), but since the assumption is uniform distribution, this holds. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as plx^-4.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive. If you have a uniform distribution in space, you expect more stars at larger distances because the volume is larger. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so larger distances mean smaller parallaxes. Therefore, the number per unit parallax should increase as the parallax decreases. But according to the calculation, it\'s proportional to 1/plx^4. So, for example, if you halve the parallax (double the distance), the number per unit parallax increases by 16 times. That seems correct because the volume element at distance d is 4πd² dd, and dd in terms of parallax is (1/plx²) d(plx). So substituting gives 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, yes, the number per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax range increases with the inverse fourth power of parallax. So, N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4. Hence, when plotting number per unit plx against plx, it would be a steeply decreasing function, dropping as the fourth power.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another approach. Suppose we have a distribution function. Let N be the number of stars. The differential number per unit parallax is dN/d(plx). Since dN = n * 4πd² dd, and d = 1/plx, then dd/d(plx) = -1/plx². Therefore, dN/d(plx) = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 4πn / plx^4. So, yes, the differential number per parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, the number per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. So if you have a uniform density, the number of stars per parallax bin scales with plx^-4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Hence, it decreases with the fourth power of parallax. Wait, but if plx is getting smaller (distance increasing), then plx^-4 is getting larger, so the number per unit parallax is increasing as plx decreases. So the curve of number per plx vs plx is a rising curve as plx approaches zero. But in terms of the function, it\'s N ∝ plx^-4. So, if you go to smaller plx (larger distances), the number per plx increases. But when plotted against plx, which is on the x-axis from high to low, the function would actually rise towards the left (lower plx). But the question is phrased as "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx". So as plx increases (moving to the right on the plx axis), the number per unit plx decreases as plx^-4. So the relation is a power law with exponent -4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. So, N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}. Hence, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of parallax. Therefore, the correct answer is that it scales as plx^{-4}, so the number decreases rapidly with increasing parallax. Wait, but parallax is distance^{-1}, so increasing parallax means getting closer. So if you have higher parallax (closer stars), the number per unit parallax is lower? But in reality, there are fewer stars nearby because the volume is smaller, so the number per unit parallax should be lower at higher parallaxes. For example, if you have a parallax bin from 1 to 2 mas (distance 500 to 1000 pc), and another bin from 2 to 3 mas (distance ~333 to 500 pc). The volume of the closer bin (higher parallax) is smaller, so fewer stars. Therefore, the number per unit parallax should decrease as parallax increases. Which aligns with N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}. So when plx increases (closer stars), N(plx) decreases. So the function is a decreasing function with plx. Hence, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. Therefore, the relation is inversely proportional to plx^4.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) in a uniformly distributed stellar population scales inversely with the fourth power of the parallax. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Parallax-Distance Relation**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d):  
   \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) (in parsecs).

2. **Volume Element**: For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \) is proportional to the shell's volume:  
   \( \Delta N \propto 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \).

3. **Substitute Distance with Parallax**: Express \( d \) and \( \Delta d \) in terms of parallax:  
   \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \),  
   \( \Delta d = \left| \frac{d}{d(\text{plx})} \right| \Delta \text{plx} = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \Delta \text{plx} \).

4. **Volume in Parallax Terms**: Substitute into the volume element:  
   \( \Delta N \propto 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \Delta \text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \Delta \text{plx} \).

5. **Dependence on Parallax**: The number of stars per unit parallax is therefore:  
   \( \frac{dN}{d(\text{plx})} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

**Conclusion**: The number of stars per unit parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax increases. This means that at smaller parallaxes (larger distances), there are more stars per unit parallax interval due to the rapidly increasing volume of space sampled. Conversely, at larger parallaxes (closer stars), the number of stars per unit parallax drops sharply. 

**Final Answer**:  
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(\mathbf{\text{plx}^{-4}}\), meaning it decreases rapidly with increasing parallax.

The number of stars N in a parallax range [plx, plx + d(plx)] is equal to the number of stars in the corresponding distance range [d, d + dd], where d = 1/plx and dd = |d(1/plx)| = (1/plx²) d(plx). The number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density. Substituting d and dd, we get n * 4π*(1/plx²)*(1/plx²) d(plx) = n * 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number per unit parallax increases as the fourth power. However, in reality, this would mean that there are vastly more stars at smaller parallaxes (fainter, more distant stars), but since the assumption is uniform distribution, this holds. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as plx^-4.

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If you have a uniform distribution in space, you expect more stars at larger distances because the volume is larger. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so larger distances mean smaller parallaxes. Therefore, the number per unit parallax should increase as the parallax decreases. But according to the calculation, it's proportional to 1/plx^4. So, for example, if you halve the parallax (double the distance), the number per unit parallax increases by 16 times. That seems correct because the volume element at distance d is 4πd² dd, and dd in terms of parallax is (1/plx²) d(plx). So substituting gives 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, yes, the number per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax range increases with the inverse fourth power of parallax. So, N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4. Hence, when plotting number per unit plx against plx, it would be a steeply decreasing function, dropping as the fourth power.

But wait, let me confirm with another approach. Suppose we have a distribution function. Let N be the number of stars. The differential number per unit parallax is dN/d(plx). Since dN = n * 4πd² dd, and d = 1/plx, then dd/d(plx) = -1/plx². Therefore, dN/d(plx) = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 4πn / plx^4. So, yes, the differential number per parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, the number per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. So if you have a uniform density, the number of stars per parallax bin scales with plx^-4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Hence, it decreases with the fourth power of parallax. Wait, but if plx is getting smaller (distance increasing), then plx^-4 is getting larger, so the number per unit parallax is increasing as plx decreases. So the curve of number per plx vs plx is a rising curve as plx approaches zero. But in terms of the function, it's N ∝ plx^-4. So, if you go to smaller plx (larger distances), the number per plx increases. But when plotted against plx, which is on the x-axis from high to low, the function would actually rise towards the left (lower plx). But the question is phrased as "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx". So as plx increases (moving to the right on the plx axis), the number per unit plx decreases as plx^-4. So the relation is a power law with exponent -4. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. So, N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}. Hence, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of parallax. Therefore, the correct answer is that it scales as plx^{-4}, so the number decreases rapidly with increasing parallax. Wait, but parallax is distance^{-1}, so increasing parallax means getting closer. So if you have higher parallax (closer stars), the number per unit parallax is lower? But in reality, there are fewer stars nearby because the volume is smaller, so the number per unit parallax should be lower at higher parallaxes. For example, if you have a parallax bin from 1 to 2 mas (distance 500 to 1000 pc), and another bin from 2 to 3 mas (distance ~333 to 500 pc). The volume of the closer bin (higher parallax) is smaller, so fewer stars. Therefore, the number per unit parallax should decrease as parallax increases. Which aligns with N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}. So when plx increases (closer stars), N(plx) decreases. So the function is a decreasing function with plx. Hence, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. Therefore, the relation is inversely proportional to plx^4. Thus, the conclusion is correct.
