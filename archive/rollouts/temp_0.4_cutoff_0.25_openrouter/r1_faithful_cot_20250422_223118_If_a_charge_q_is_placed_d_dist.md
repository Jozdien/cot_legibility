To calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge \( q \) is placed a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. 

1. **Image Charge Calculation**:
   - The image charge \( q' \) induced on the sphere is given by \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \).
   - The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between Charges**:
   - The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position near the sphere. This is calculated by integrating the force on \( q \) due to the induced charges (represented by the image charge \( q' \)).
   - The force on \( q \) at any position \( x \) during the process is given by Coulomb's law between \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \).
   - After performing the integral of the force over the distance from infinity to \( d \), the potential energy is found to be:

\[
U = -\frac{q^2 R}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}
\]

### Final Answer
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with charges and conducting spheres, the method of image charges is usually useful. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is maintained at zero. The grounding allows charges to flow to or from the earth to maintain that zero potential. So, when we place a charge q near the sphere, an image charge will be induced on the sphere's surface to satisfy the boundary condition (potential at the sphere's surface is zero). 

Wait, but how exactly does the image charge work here? If the sphere is grounded, the image charge should be such that the potential due to the real charge q and the image charge cancels out on the sphere's surface. Let me recall the formula for the image charge in a grounded conducting sphere. 

I think the image charge q' is located inside the sphere at a distance R^2/d from the center, along the line connecting the center to the real charge q. The magnitude of the image charge should be q' = -qR/d. Let me verify that. 

If the real charge is at distance d from the center, then the image charge is at position R^2/d from the center, which is inside the sphere because d > R (assuming the charge is outside the sphere; if d < R, the charge would be inside, but the sphere is conducting, so charges would rearrange. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe it can have charges induced even if the charge is inside? Wait, no, if the sphere is grounded, placing a charge inside might be a different scenario. But in this problem, the charge is placed a distance d from the center. If the sphere has radius R, then if d > R, the charge is outside; if d < R, it's inside. But the problem says "placed d distance away from the center", so maybe d > R? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. 

Wait, the sphere is of radius R, and the charge is placed a distance d from the center. So if d > R, the charge is outside the sphere. If d < R, the charge is inside. But if the sphere is conducting and grounded, then if the charge is inside, the induced charges would be different. However, in the case of a conducting sphere, charges reside on the surface, so if the charge is inside the sphere, maybe the sphere acts as a Faraday cage? But since it's grounded, the potential inside would be zero? Wait, no. If the charge is inside a grounded conducting shell, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, so the potential would adjust such that the interior has a potential due to the charge and the induced charges. Hmm, perhaps I need to be careful here.

But maybe in this problem, the charge is placed outside the sphere. The standard image charge problem is when a charge is outside a grounded conducting sphere. Then the image charge is inside the sphere. So perhaps assuming d > R. Maybe the problem assumes that. Let me check. The problem says "placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R". So, if the sphere has radius R, then the distance from the center is d. So if d > R, the charge is outside; if d < R, inside. But if the charge is inside, the sphere is a conductor, so the charge q would induce charges on the inner surface. But since the sphere is grounded, those induced charges would be such that the potential is zero. Wait, but if the charge is inside, the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, and since the sphere is grounded, does that mean that another charge can be induced on the outer surface? Wait, no. For a grounded conducting sphere, the total charge on the sphere is not necessarily zero. Because grounding allows charge to flow. So if there's a charge q inside the sphere, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, and since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can have any charge necessary to maintain zero potential. But actually, for a grounded conductor, the potential is zero everywhere on the conductor. So if the sphere is grounded and a charge q is placed inside, at radius d < R, then the induced charges would arrange such that the potential at the surface is zero. Hmm, perhaps the image charge method can still be applied here, but the location and magnitude would differ. 

But maybe the problem is assuming that the charge is outside. Let me proceed under that assumption first because that's the standard problem. So if the charge is outside, then the image charge is located at R^2/d from the center, with charge q' = -qR/d. Then, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between the real charge q and the image charge q', since the grounded sphere doesn't contribute any other energy. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere would be related to the interaction between q and the induced charges. But since the induced charges are represented by the image charge, maybe the potential energy is just (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance between q and q'). 

But let me think again. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble the system. In this case, the real charge q is brought from infinity to a distance d from the center of the sphere. However, the presence of the grounded sphere induces charges on its surface, which in turn creates an electric field. The work done to bring q into place would be against the electric field produced by the induced charges. Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, maybe the potential energy is just the interaction energy between the charge q and the image charge. 

Yes, I think that's the approach. The potential energy U is given by (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance between q and q'). Let's compute that. 

First, the image charge q' is located at a distance R^2/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is d - R^2/d. Wait, no. If the center of the sphere is at O, the real charge is at position d along, say, the z-axis. The image charge is inside the sphere at position R^2/d from O. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. 

Therefore, the potential energy U is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d) * (d / (d² - R²)) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R) / (d² - R²). 

But wait, the negative sign indicates that the potential energy is negative, which makes sense because the charge is attracted to the induced charges on the sphere, so the work done to bring it from infinity would be negative, meaning the system has lower potential energy. 

But here, the question is about the net potential energy of the system. So is this the correct expression? Let me check. 

Alternatively, sometimes the potential energy of a charge in the presence of a grounded conductor is considered to be half of the interaction energy between the charge and the induced charges. Wait, why? Because when you have two real charges, the potential energy is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, but in this case, the image charge is a fictitious charge. Hmm. Wait, no. The image charge is not a real charge, but a mathematical construct to represent the induced charges. Therefore, the actual charges are q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, since the sphere is grounded, the induced charge is just q' = -qR/d. So maybe the potential energy is indeed just the interaction energy between q and q', which is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance). But I need to confirm. 

Wait, the potential energy of a system of charges is (1/2) Σ q_i φ_i, where φ_i is the potential at the location of charge q_i due to all other charges. However, in this case, the induced charges on the sphere are not point charges, but spread over the surface. But using the method of images, we can replace the sphere with the image charge. So if we consider the image charge, then the potential energy is (1/2) [ q φ_image + q' φ_q ], but since q' is an image charge, maybe this approach isn't straightforward. 

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position is equal to the potential energy of the system. The force on the charge q due to the induced charges is the same as the force due to the image charge. Therefore, the work done is the integral of F · dr from infinity to d, which can be calculated as the potential energy between q and q'. However, since the image charge is induced as we bring q in, the calculation might not be straightforward. But in the method of images, the potential energy is indeed given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance between q and q'), which in this case gives us the expression we had before. 

But wait, another way to think about it is that the induced charge on the sphere is q', and the potential energy is (1/2) q φ, where φ is the potential at the location of q due to the induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential at the location of q due to the induced charges is equal to the potential due to the image charge q', which is (1/(4πε₀)) (q') / (distance between q and the center - distance of image charge). Wait, the image charge is at R²/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d, which is (d² - R²)/d. Therefore, the potential at q due to q' is (1/(4πε₀)) (q') / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R) / (d² - R²). 

Therefore, the potential energy U would be (1/2) q times this potential, because the induced charge is a result of q itself. Wait, but no. The factor of 1/2 comes when considering the energy stored in the electric field, which is (ε₀/2) ∫ E² dV. But in the case of point charges and conductors, the potential energy can also be calculated as (1/2) Σ q_i V_i. However, in this case, the conductor is grounded, so the charges on the conductor are induced, and their potential is zero. 

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's denote the real charge as q and the induced charges on the sphere as q'. The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the system. When we bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, the work done against the electric field is equal to the potential energy. The electric field is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, as we bring q in, the induced charges adjust such that the sphere remains at zero potential. The work done is then the integral of the force on q due to the induced charges times the displacement. 

Alternatively, since the induced charges can be represented by the image charge, the force on q is the same as the force between q and the image charge q'. Therefore, the work done in bringing q from infinity to distance d is the integral from infinity to d of F · dr, where F is the force between q and q'. However, the image charge q' is not fixed; as we move q, the position and magnitude of q' change. Wait, that complicates things. Because as we bring q closer, the image charge q' changes in magnitude and position. Therefore, the force isn't simply Coulomb's law between two fixed charges. 

Hmm, this seems more complicated. So maybe the initial approach of taking U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance between q and q') is incorrect because q' itself depends on the position of q. Therefore, the potential energy should be calculated by integrating the work done as q is brought in from infinity, taking into account the varying image charge. 

Wait, but in the method of images, when we have a static configuration (i.e., q is at rest at distance d), the image charge is fixed as q' = -qR/d at position R²/d. Therefore, once q is placed at d, the image charge is determined, and the potential energy can be considered as the interaction energy between q and q'. But in reality, the image charge is just a representation of the induced charges. So maybe the potential energy is indeed U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance between q and q'). 

Alternatively, we can calculate the energy by considering the work done to bring q from infinity to d in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on q at any point along the path is F = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / r², where q' is the image charge at that point. But since q' depends on the current position of q, which is changing as we move it. Let's denote the distance from the center as x (variable), then the image charge at each point is q'(x) = -q R/x, located at position R²/x. The distance between q and q' is x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x. Therefore, the force is F(x) = (1/(4πε₀)) (q * (-q R/x)) / ((x² - R²)/x)² ) * direction. 

Wait, but the direction is important. Since the image charge is negative, the force is attractive. So as we bring q from infinity to d, the work done by the electric field is negative (since the force is towards the sphere), so the work done by us is positive. Therefore, the potential energy U is the integral of F · dx from infinity to d. 

But let's compute this integral. Let me set up the coordinate system such that the sphere is centered at the origin, and we move the charge along the positive z-axis from infinity to x = d. The force on the charge q at position x is F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (x - x')², where x' is the position of the image charge. Since the image charge is located at x' = R²/x. Therefore, the distance between q and q' is x - x' = x - R²/x. The charge q' is -q R/x. Therefore, the force magnitude is F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-q R/x)) / (x - R²/x)^2. 

Therefore, the work done by the electric field is W = ∫_{∞}^{d} F dx = - (q² R)/(4πε₀) ∫_{∞}^{d} [1/(x (x - R²/x)^2)] dx. 

Hmm, this integral looks complicated. Let me simplify the denominator. Let's compute (x - R²/x)^2 = (x² - R²)^2 / x². Therefore, the integrand becomes [1/(x)] / [(x² - R²)^2 / x²] = x / (x² - R²)^2. 

Therefore, the integral becomes:

W = - (q² R)/(4πε₀) ∫_{∞}^{d} [x / (x² - R²)^2] dx.

Let me make a substitution: let u = x² - R², then du/dx = 2x, so (du/2) = x dx. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫ [x dx / (x² - R²)^2] = ∫ (du/2) / u² = -1/(2u) + C = -1/(2(x² - R²)) + C.

Therefore, evaluating from x = ∞ to x = d:

W = - (q² R)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2(x² - R²)) ] from ∞ to d

At x = d: -1/(2(d² - R²))

At x = ∞: -1/(2(∞ - R²)) = 0

Therefore, W = - (q² R)/(4πε₀) [ -1/(2(d² - R²)) - 0 ] = (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²)).

But this is the work done by the electric field, which is equal to the negative of the potential energy. Therefore, the potential energy U is -W = - (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²)).

Wait, but this contradicts the previous result where U was calculated as (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R)/(d² - R²). So which one is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is indeed (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R)/(2(d² - R²))). Wait, but according to the integral, we obtained U = - (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²)), but this seems inconsistent. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, let's re-examine the integral:

We had F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-q R/x)) / (x - R²/x)^2

But x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x, so (x - R²/x)^2 = (x² - R²)^2 / x². Therefore, the denominator is (x² - R²)^2 / x². Therefore, F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R/x) / ( (x² - R²)^2 / x² ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R/x) * (x² / (x² - R²)^2 ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R x ) / (x² - R²)^2.

Therefore, the force is F = - (q² R x ) / (4πε₀ (x² - R²)^2 ) (negative sign indicating attraction towards the sphere).

Therefore, the work done by the electric field when moving the charge from infinity to d is:

W = ∫_{∞}^{d} F dx = ∫_{∞}^{d} [ - (q² R x ) / (4πε₀ (x² - R²)^2 ) ] dx

= - (q² R)/(4πε₀) ∫_{∞}^{d} [ x / (x² - R²)^2 ] dx

As before, substitute u = x² - R², du = 2x dx, so (du)/2 = x dx. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫ [x / (x² - R²)^2 ] dx = ∫ (du/2) / u² = -1/(2u) + C = -1/(2(x² - R²)) + C.

Therefore, evaluating from ∞ to d:

At d: -1/(2(d² - R²))

At ∞: 0

Therefore, the integral is [ -1/(2(d² - R²)) - 0 ] = -1/(2(d² - R²))

Therefore, W = - (q² R)/(4πε₀) * [ -1/(2(d² - R²)) ] = (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²))

Since the work done by the electric field is W, the potential energy U is equal to -W, because the potential energy is the work done against the electric field. Therefore:

U = - W = - (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²))

But this is a positive or negative value? Let's see: if d > R, then d² - R² is positive, so U is negative. Wait, no: the result here is U = - (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²)), but since d > R, the denominator is positive, so U is negative. But earlier, when we calculated U as the interaction energy between q and q', we had U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R)/(d² - R²), which is also negative. But the two results differ by a factor of 1/2. 

So which one is correct? The discrepancy arises because when we calculate the work done to bring the charge in, we are considering the force at each point, which depends on the image charge at that position, which changes as we move the charge. However, when we just take the interaction energy between q and q', we are assuming that the image charge is fixed, which it isn't during the process. Therefore, the correct potential energy should come from the integral, which accounts for the varying image charge as q is moved. Therefore, the correct expression is U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

But wait, another way to calculate the potential energy is using the formula U = (1/2) ∫ σ φ da, where σ is the surface charge density and φ is the potential on the conductor. However, since the sphere is grounded, the potential φ is zero on the surface, so this integral would be zero. That can't be right. 

Alternatively, the energy is stored in the electric field. The electric field exists only outside the sphere, since it's a conducting sphere. The electric field is the same as that due to the charge q and the image charge q'. Therefore, the total electric field energy is (ε₀/2) ∫ E² dV. 

Let me try that approach. The electric field is due to the real charge q and the image charge q'. So the total electric field is the superposition of the fields from q and q'. The energy is then (ε₀/2) ∫ (E_q + E_{q'})² dV = (ε₀/2) [ ∫ E_q² dV + ∫ E_{q'}^2 dV + 2 ∫ E_q · E_{q'} dV ]

But the first term is the energy of the charge q alone, the second term is the energy of the image charge alone, and the third term is the interaction energy. However, since the image charge is a fictitious charge, maybe only the interaction term contributes to the potential energy of the system. Wait, but the real charges are q and the induced charges on the sphere. The image charge is just a representation. Therefore, the total energy should be the sum of the self-energies of q and the induced charges plus the interaction energy. But the self-energy of a point charge is infinite, but since we are considering only the potential energy due to the configuration, perhaps we neglect the self-energies and consider only the interaction energy. 

Alternatively, when we bring the charge q from infinity to its position, the work done is equal to the interaction energy between q and the induced charges. Since the induced charges are represented by q', the interaction energy would be (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance between them). However, since the induced charges are a result of q, maybe we need to account for the factor of 1/2. 

Wait, in general, the potential energy of a system of charges is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, where V_i is the potential at the location of q_i due to all other charges. In this case, we have two charges: q and the induced charges on the sphere. But the induced charges are distributed over the sphere. However, since the sphere is a conductor, the potential on its surface is constant (zero in this case). Therefore, the potential energy contributed by the induced charges would be (1/2) ∫ σ V da. But since V is zero on the sphere, this integral is zero. Therefore, the only contribution to the potential energy is from the charge q. The potential at the location of q due to the induced charges is V = (1/(4πε₀)) (q') / (distance between q and q'). Therefore, the potential energy is (1/2) q V. 

Wait, but why (1/2)? Because when you assemble the system, you first bring the charge q, which induces charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges adjust instantaneously. Therefore, the work done to bring q is just q times the potential due to the induced charges. However, since the induced charges are a response to q, maybe the energy is (1/2) q V, similar to the factor in capacitance. 

Let me check this. If we have a capacitor with charge Q and voltage V, the energy is (1/2) Q V. Similarly, here, if we consider the charge q and the induced charges, the energy might be (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at q due to the induced charges. 

In that case, V at the position of q due to the induced charges (which is equivalent to the potential due to the image charge q') is (1/(4πε₀)) (q') / (distance). So V = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R/d) / (d - R²/d) = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R) / (d² - R²). 

Therefore, the potential energy U is (1/2) q V = (1/2) q * [ (1/(4πε₀)) (-q R) / (d² - R²) ) ] = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

This matches the result from the integral calculation. Therefore, the correct potential energy is U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

But let me verify this with a specific case. Suppose the sphere has radius R, and the charge is placed very far away, d → ∞. Then, the potential energy should approach zero, which it does because the denominator becomes d², so U ~ - q² R / (8πε₀ d²) → 0. 

Another check: when the charge is brought very close to the sphere, d approaches R from above. Then, the denominator (d² - R²) approaches zero, and the potential energy becomes a large negative number, which makes sense because the attraction becomes stronger. 

Alternatively, consider the case when the sphere is ungrounded. Then, the image charge would be different. But since the sphere is grounded, the result here should hold. 

Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

Wait, but another way to write this is U = - (q² R) / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). Alternatively, factoring out a negative sign, U = - q² R / [8πε₀(d² - R²)]. 

Alternatively, some textbooks might present this as U = - (1/(4πε₀)) (q² R)/(2(d² - R²)) ), which is the same as the above. Yes, because 8πε₀ is 2*4πε₀, so - q² R/(8πε₀(d² - R²)) = - (q² R)/(2*4πε₀(d² - R²)) ). 

Therefore, the answer is U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

But I should check units. The units of potential energy should be joules. Let's see:

q²/(ε₀) has units of (C²)/(C²/(N·m²)) ) = N·m². Then, R/(d² - R²) has units of m/(m²) = 1/m. Therefore, overall, N·m² * 1/m = N·m = J. So the units are correct. 

Therefore, after careful consideration, the net potential energy of the system is U = - (q² R)/(8πε₀(d² - R²)). 

But wait, let me check with another source. In the classic image charge problem for a grounded sphere, the force between the charge and the sphere is given by F = (1/(4πε₀)) * q² R / (d² - R²)^2 * (d^3 - R² d)/d^3 ? Wait, no. The force is calculated as the derivative of the potential energy. If U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²)), then the force F = -dU/dd = - [ ( - q² R / (8πε₀) ) * d/dd (1/(d² - R²)) ) ] = - [ ( q² R / (8πε₀) ) * ( -2d ) / (d² - R²)^2 ) ] = ( q² R * 2d ) / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 ) ) = ( q² R d ) / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 )

But the force should also be equal to the Coulomb force between q and the image charge q'. The image charge is q' = - q R / d, located at distance R²/d from the center. The distance between q and q' is d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d. Therefore, the Coulomb force is F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q q') / (distance)^2 = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( - q² R / d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )² = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( - q² R / d ) * ( d² / (d² - R²)^2 ) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( - q² R d ) / (d² - R²)^2 )

But this is the force on q due to the image charge, which is attractive (negative sign indicates direction towards the sphere). However, the force calculated from the potential energy derivative was positive ( q² R d / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 ) ). There's a sign discrepancy here. 

Wait, but the potential energy U is defined such that F = - dU/dd. If U is negative and becomes more negative as d decreases, then dU/dd is positive (since U becomes more negative as d decreases), so F = - dU/dd would be negative, indicating an attractive force. Let's compute:

Given U = - q² R / (8πε₀(d² - R²))

Then dU/dd = - q² R / (8πε₀) * d/dd [ 1/(d² - R²) ] = - q² R / (8πε₀) * ( -2d ) / (d² - R²)^2 ) = ( q² R * 2d ) / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 ) ) = ( q² R d ) / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 )

Therefore, F = - dU/dd = - ( q² R d ) / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 )

Which matches the Coulomb force calculation (negative sign indicating attraction). 

But in the Coulomb force calculation, we had F = - ( q² R d ) / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)^2 ), which matches. Therefore, the potential energy expression U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)) is consistent with the force. 

Therefore, after all these checks, the net potential energy of the system is indeed U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

Alternatively, some textbooks might write this as U = - (1/(4πε₀)) (q² R)/(2(d² - R²)) ), which is equivalent. 

Therefore, the final answer is U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

But I should also consider if the charge is inside the sphere. Wait, the problem states that the charge is placed a distance d from the center of the grounded conducting sphere. If d < R, then the charge is inside the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, how does that affect the potential energy? 

Wait, if the charge is inside the sphere, the electric field inside a conductor is zero in electrostatics. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero. If there's a charge q inside the cavity of a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the inner surface would be -q, and since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can have any charge to maintain zero potential. However, for a grounded conductor, the total charge on the conductor is such that the potential is zero. 

But for a charge inside a spherical cavity inside a grounded conductor, the image charge would be different. Specifically, if the charge is inside the sphere (d < R), the image charge would be outside the sphere. Let me recall. 

The method of images for a charge inside a grounded conducting spherical shell: the image charge is located outside the sphere at a distance R²/d from the center, with charge q' = -q R/d. Wait, similar to the external charge case but inverted. 

Wait, let me check. If the charge is inside the sphere (d < R), then the image charge is q' = -q R/d located at D = R²/d. Since d < R, D = R²/d > R. So the image charge is outside the sphere. Then, the potential energy would be the interaction between q and q', which are separated by distance D - d = R²/d - d = (R² - d²)/d. 

Therefore, the potential energy would be U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance) = (1/(4πε₀)) (q (-q R/d)) / ((R² - d²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) (-q² R) / (R² - d²). 

But in this case, since the charge is inside, R² - d² is positive, so U is negative. 

But then, following the previous approach of calculating the work done to bring the charge from infinity to d < R, but since the charge is inside the sphere, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Therefore, the work done to bring the charge from infinity to the surface would require considering the field inside and outside. However, since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero everywhere on the sphere. 

Alternatively, if the charge is inside the sphere, the potential energy might still be given by the interaction with the image charge. But the problem statement doesn't specify whether the charge is inside or outside. It just says "placed d distance away from the center". Depending on the value of d relative to R, the answer would differ. 

But the problem mentions a "grounded conducting sphere of radius R", and a charge placed "d distance away from the center". Without loss of generality, we can assume d > R (charge outside), but the problem doesn't specify. However, in most standard problems, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, it's assumed to be outside unless stated otherwise. 

But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we need to present both cases? Wait, but the problem says "calculate the net potential energy of this system", without specifying d > R or d < R. However, the image charge method differs depending on whether the charge is inside or outside. 

Wait, but if the charge is inside the sphere (d < R), then the image charge is outside, and the potential energy would be U = - q² R / (4πε₀ (R² - d²)). But following the same method as before, calculating the work done to bring the charge from infinity to d < R, we have to consider the different regions. 

However, since the sphere is grounded, if we bring a charge inside the sphere, the electric field outside the sphere is zero (since the conductor shields the inside), but the potential on the sphere is zero. The image charge in this case would be q' = -q located at the center? Wait, no. For a charge inside a spherical cavity inside a grounded conductor, the image charge is q' = -q R/d at position R²/d outside the sphere. 

But the potential energy would still be the interaction between q and q', leading to U = (1/(4πε₀)) (q q') / (distance). 

But the problem statement doesn't specify whether the charge is inside or outside. Given that it's a conducting sphere, if the charge is inside, it's within a cavity, but the sphere being grounded complicates things. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should assume the charge is outside (d > R), which is the more typical problem. 

Assuming d > R, then the potential energy is U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer without the factor of 1/2, then it might be U = - q² R / (4πε₀ (d² - R²)). But according to our detailed calculation using the work integral and the (1/2) q V method, the correct answer includes the factor of 1/2, leading to U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

To resolve this discrepancy, let me refer to standard textbooks. 

In Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, for a point charge q outside a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is q' = -q R/d at position R²/d. The force between q and the sphere is the same as the force between q and q', which is F = (1/(4πε₀)) q q' / (d - R²/d)^2 = - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R d / (d² - R²)^2. 

The potential energy is then the work done in bringing q from infinity to d, which is the integral of F dx. As calculated earlier, this results in U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

However, in some textbooks, the formula for the potential energy is given as U = - (1/(4πε₀)) (q² R)/(2(d² - R²)) ), which is equivalent. 

Therefore, the correct answer is U = - q² R / (8πε₀ (d² - R²)). 

Hence, after thorough consideration and verification, the net potential energy of the system is negative, indicating an attractive interaction, and the magnitude depends on the inverse of (d² - R²). 

**Final Answer**
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with charges and conducting spheres, the method of image charges is usually useful. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is maintained at zero. The grounding allows charges to flow to or from the earth to maintain that zero potential. So, when we place a charge q near the sphere, an image charge will be induced on the sphere's surface to satisfy the boundary condition (potential at the sphere's surface is zero). 

Wait, but how exactly does the image charge work here? If the sphere is grounded, the image charge should be such that the potential due to the real charge q and the image charge cancels out on the sphere's surface. Let me recall the formula for the image charge in a grounded conducting sphere. 

I think the image charge q' is located inside the sphere at a distance R^2/d from the center, along the line connecting the center to the real charge q. The magnitude of the image charge should be q' = -qR/d. Let me verify that. 

If the real charge is at distance d from the center, then the image charge is at position R^2/d from the center, which is inside the sphere because d > R (assuming the charge is outside the sphere; if d < R, the charge would be inside, but the sphere is conducting, so charges would rearrange. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe it can have charges induced even if the charge is inside? Wait, no, if the sphere is grounded, placing a charge inside might be a different scenario. But in this problem, the charge is placed a distance d from the center. If the sphere has radius R, then if d > R, the charge is outside; if d < R, it's inside. But the problem says "placed d distance away from the center", so maybe d > R? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. 

Wait, the sphere is of radius R, and the charge is placed a distance d from the center. So if d > R, the charge is outside the sphere. If d < R, the charge is inside. But if the sphere is conducting and grounded, then if the charge is inside, the induced charges would be different. However, in the case of a conducting sphere, charges reside on the surface, so if the charge is inside the sphere, maybe the sphere acts as a Faraday cage? But since it's grounded, the potential inside would be zero? Wait, no. If the charge is inside a grounded conducting shell, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, so the potential would adjust such that the interior has a potential due to the charge and the induced charges. Hmm, perhaps I need to be careful here.

But maybe in this problem, the charge is placed outside the sphere. The standard image charge problem is when a charge is outside a grounded conducting sphere. Then the image charge is inside the sphere. So perhaps assuming d > R. Maybe the problem assumes that. Let me check. The problem says "placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R". So, if the sphere has radius R, then the distance from the center is d. So if d > R, the charge is outside; if d < R, inside. But if the charge is inside, the sphere is a conductor, so the charge q would induce charges on the inner surface. But since the sphere is grounded, those induced charges would be such that the potential is zero. Wait, but if the charge is inside, the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, and since the sphere is grounded, does that mean that another charge can be induced on the outer surface? Wait, no. For a grounded conducting sphere, the total charge on the sphere is not necessarily zero. Because grounding allows charge to flow. So if there's a charge q inside the sphere, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, and since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can have any charge necessary to maintain zero potential. But actually, for a grounded conductor, the potential is zero everywhere on the conductor. So if the sphere is grounded and a charge q is placed inside, at radius d < R, then the induced charges would arrange such that the potential at the surface is zero. Hmm, perhaps the image charge method can still be applied here, but the location and magnitude would differ. 

But maybe the problem is assuming that the charge is outside. Let me proceed under that assumption first because that's the standard problem. So if the charge is outside, then the image charge is located at R^2/d from the center, with charge q' = -qR/d. Then, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between the real charge q and the image charge q', since the grounded sphere doesn't contribute any other energy. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere would be related to the interaction between q and the induced charges. But since the induced charges are represented by the image charge, maybe the potential energy is just (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance between q and q'). 

But let me think again. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble the system. In this case, the real charge q is brought from infinity to a distance d from the center of the sphere. However, the presence of the grounded sphere induces charges on its surface, which in turn creates an electric field. The work done to bring q into place would be against the electric field produced by the induced charges. Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, maybe the potential energy is just the interaction energy between the charge q and the image charge. 

Yes, I think that's the approach. The potential energy U is given by (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance between q and q'). Let's compute that. 

First, the image charge q' is located at a distance R^2/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is d - R^2/d. Wait, no. If the center of the sphere is at O, the real charge is at position d along, say, the z-axis. The image charge is inside the sphere at position R^2/d from O. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. 

Therefore, the potential energy U is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d) * (d / (d² - R²)) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R) / (d² - R²). 

But wait, the negative sign indicates that the potential energy is negative, which makes sense because the charge is attracted to the induced charges on the sphere, so the work done to bring it from infinity would be negative, meaning the system has lower potential energy. 

But here, the question is about the net potential energy of the system. So is this the correct expression? Let me check. 

Alternatively, sometimes the potential energy of a charge in the presence of a grounded conductor is considered to be half of the interaction energy between the charge and the induced charges. Wait, why? Because when you have two real charges, the potential energy is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, but in this case, the image charge is a fictitious charge. Hmm. Wait, no. The image charge is not a real charge, but a mathematical construct to represent the induced charges. Therefore, the actual charges are q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, since the sphere is grounded, the induced charge is just q' = -qR/d. So maybe the potential energy is indeed just the interaction energy between q and q', which is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance). But I need to confirm. 

Wait, the potential energy of a system of charges is (1/2) Σ q_i φ_i, where φ_i is the potential at the location of charge q_i due to all other charges. However, in this case, the induced charges on the sphere are not point charges, but spread

Alright, I need to determine the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is positioned at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Let me consider this problem methodically.

When analyzing charges near conducting spheres, the method of image charges is typically beneficial. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential remains at zero, with charges flowing to or from earth to maintain this condition. Placing charge q near the sphere induces an image charge on the sphere's surface to satisfy the boundary condition of zero potential at the surface.

The image charge configuration depends on whether the charge is inside or outside the sphere. The problem states the charge is at distance d from the center of a sphere with radius R. If d > R, the charge is outside; if d < R, it's inside.

Let me assume the standard case where the charge is outside the sphere (d > R). In this scenario, the image charge q' is located inside the sphere at distance R²/d from the center, along the line connecting the center to the real charge. The magnitude of this image charge is q' = -qR/d.

To calculate the potential energy, I need to determine the work done to assemble this system. This equals the interaction energy between charge q and the image charge q'. The distance between these charges is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Therefore, the potential energy U is:
U = (1/4πε₀) × (q × q') / (distance between charges)
U = (1/4πε₀) × (q × (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d)
U = (1/4πε₀) × (-q²R/d) × (d/(d² - R²))
U = (1/4πε₀) × (-q²R) / (d² - R²)

The negative sign in this expression makes physical sense because the charge is attracted to the induced charges on the sphere, indicating that work would be done by the system when bringing the charge from infinity, resulting in lower potential energy for the system.

This expression represents the net potential energy of the system with a charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, assuming d > R.

Alright, I need to determine the net potential energy of a system with a charge q positioned at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Let me consider the best way to tackle this problem.

The method of image charges is often useful in scenarios involving charges and conducting spheres. With the sphere being grounded, its potential remains zero due to charge movement to or from the earth. Placing a charge q near the sphere induces an image charge on the surface to maintain the zero potential boundary condition.

How does the image charge work here? Since the sphere is grounded, the real charge q and the image charge must cancel out the potential on the sphere's surface. I remember the formula for the image charge for a grounded conducting sphere.

The image charge q' is inside the sphere at a distance R^2/d from the center along the axis connecting q and the center. The charge magnitude is q' = -qR/d. Let me verify this.

When the real charge is d from the center, the image is at R^2/d, positioned inside due to d > R when the charge is outside. If d < R, the charge would be inside. For a grounded conductor and a charge inside, the scenario differs. But the problem states the charge is "d distance" from the center, likely implying d > R, meaning outside. The sphere is conducting, so with d > R, the charge is beyond the surface. Let’s proceed assuming d > R, the typical problem setup.

For a grounded sphere, a charge inside would cause potential alteration due to induced inner surface charges. However, considering the charge is likely outside, assuming the typical scenario with an outside charge, the image q’ = -qR/d is positioned at R^2/d from the center.

The potential energy is between the real and image charges, as the grounded sphere contributes no additional energy. Despite grounding, the work to place q relates to q and the image interaction. Thus, the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance q to q').

Remembering the potential energy of a charge system is the assembly work: moving q from infinity to d, inducing sphere surface charges, generating an electric field. The work involves overcoming this field.

So, considering interaction energy between q and its image charge is valid. The potential energy U is given by (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance q to q'), which I’ll calculate.

q' is located at R^2/d, making the distance d - R^2/d or (d² - R²)/d. Therefore, U is:

(1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d) * (d / (d² - R²)) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R) / (d² - R²).

The negative sign indicates attraction to induced charges, lowering the system's potential energy. 

Regarding the net potential energy, this seems correct. Potential energy of charges is (1/2) Σ q_i φ_i, but induced charges are not point-like. The image charge is a theoretical construct representing induced charges, so the energy consideration involves q and q'. Actually, with q' = -qR/d and U as interaction energy, the expression seems accurate.

However, since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of charge q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But calculating that directly might be complicated. However, using the method of images, we can replace the sphere with the image charge, so the potential at q due to the image charge is φ = (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q'). Then, the potential energy of charge q is U = q * φ. But since the image charge is not a real charge, perhaps this is the correct expression? \n\nAlternatively, if we consider both the real charge and the image charge, then the potential energy would be (1/2) [ q * φ_image + q' * φ_real ]. But since the image charge is not real, maybe we only consider the potential energy of the real charge in the field of the image charge. However, the correct approach is probably to consider the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position in the presence of the grounded sphere. That work would be equal to the potential energy of the system. \n\nThe electric field that the charge q experiences is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the field produced by the image charge q'. Therefore, the potential at the position of q due to the induced charges is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q'). Therefore, the work done to bring q from infinity to that position is W = q * V, which is the potential energy U. \n\nTherefore, U = q * (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (d - R²/d). \n\nSubstituting q' = -qR/d, we get:\n\nU = q * (1/(4πε₀)) * (-qR/d) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) ) \n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n( d² - R² ) / d \n\nSo plugging in:\n\nU = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d ) * (d / (d² - R²)) )\n\nThe d cancels out:\n\nU = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R ) / (d² - R² )\n\nTherefore, U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )\n\nBut wait, the denominator is d² - R², which can be factored as (d - R)(d + R). However, let me check if this is dimensionally correct. The units of R and d are length, so the denominator is length squared, numerator is q squared times length. Then, 1/(4πε₀) has units of (length)/(charge²) * (charge²)/(length² * force) ??? Wait, maybe better not to check units here. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that when d > R, the expression makes sense. If d approaches R from above, the denominator approaches zero, so the potential energy becomes very negative, which might indicate that the force becomes attractive, which is expected because as the charge gets closer to the sphere, the attraction is stronger. \n\nBut let me verify this result with a standard reference or formula. \n\nWait, in the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere, the force between the charge and the sphere is given by F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (d - R²/d)^2, which would be the derivative of the potential energy with respect to d. So integrating the force over distance would give the potential energy. Alternatively, since the image charge is a way to compute the potential, the potential energy should be as we calculated. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the potential energy is to consider the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the center of the sphere. The work done is the integral of the force times distance. The electric field experienced by the charge q at a distance x from the center (as we bring it in from infinity to d) is due to the induced charges, which can be represented by the image charge at R²/x. So the force on q is F = q * E, where E is the electric field due to the image charge. The image charge at each point x is q'(x) = -q R / x, located at R²/x from the center. Therefore, the distance between q and q'(x) is x - R²/x. Therefore, the electric field at the position of q due to q'(x) is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q'(x) / (x - R²/x)^2. \n\nWait, but actually, when we move the charge q from infinity to d, the image charge's position and magnitude change as x changes. So integrating the work done requires considering the varying image charge. That complicates things. However, in reality, the image charge method gives the correct potential for the final configuration, so maybe the potential energy can be directly calculated as we did before. \n\nBut I need to verify if that's the case. Let me recall that when you have a system of charges, the potential energy is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, where V_i is the potential at the location of charge q_i due to all other charges. In this case, we have the real charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, since the induced charges are distributed over the sphere, calculating Σ q_i V_i would require integrating over the surface charge density. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. \n\nAlternatively, using the method of images, we can replace the sphere with the image charge, and then the potential energy is simply (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at q due to the image charge. Wait, but why half? \n\nWait, in the case of two real charges q1 and q2, the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) q1 q2 / r, which can also be written as (1/2) [ q1 V2 + q2 V1 ], where V2 is the potential at q1 due to q2, and V1 is the potential at q2 due to q1. Since V2 = (1/(4πε₀)) q2 / r and V1 = (1/(4πε₀)) q1 / r, then (1/2) [ q1 V2 + q2 V1 ] = (1/(4πε₀)) (q1 q2)/r, which matches. \n\nBut in our case, the image charge is not a real charge. So maybe the potential energy is just q V, where V is the potential at the position of q due to the image charge. Because the induced charges on the sphere are considered to be a result of the electrostatic induction, and the work done to bring q into place is against the electric field produced by the induced charges, which is equivalent to the field of the image charge. Therefore, the potential energy is simply U = q * (potential due to image charge at q's location). \n\nSo in that case, U = q * [ (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q') ]\n\nWhich gives us the same result as before. Therefore, the potential energy is U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )\n\nBut let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the capacitance of the system. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so maybe the capacitance approach isn't straightforward here. Alternatively, think about the induced charge on the sphere. The induced charge is q' = - q R / d. The potential energy can also be calculated as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charge q'. But since the induced charge is a result of the electrostatic induction, the work done is only due to moving q in the presence of the induced charges. \n\nAlternatively, the energy can be calculated by considering the electric field in all space and integrating the energy density. The electric field is due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, this might be complicated, but maybe we can use the image charge to find the field. \n\nThe electric field outside the sphere is the same as the field produced by q and the image charge q'. The electric field inside the sphere is zero because it's a conductor. So the total electric field energy would be the integral over all space of (ε₀/2) E². But since the sphere is grounded, the energy stored in the electric field should be equal to the potential energy of the system. \n\nCalculating this integral might be tedious, but let's see. The electric field is due to two point charges: q at position d and q' at position R²/d. The energy stored in the electric field is (ε₀/2) ∫ E² dV. But this integral would split into the energy due to each charge separately and the cross term. However, the self-energy of each charge is infinite, but when we consider the potential energy of the system, we are only interested in the interaction energy, not the self-energies. Therefore, the interaction energy would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q q' / (distance between them). Which brings us back to the same result. \n\nTherefore, it seems that the potential energy of the system is indeed U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )\n\nBut let me check the dimensions. The numerator is q² R, which has dimensions of [charge]^2 [length]. The denominator is d² - R², which is [length]^2. So the whole fraction has dimensions [charge]^2 / [length]. Then, multiplying by 1/(4πε₀), which has dimensions [length]/[charge]^2 * [force] [length]^2. Wait, ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²), so 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². Therefore, (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R)/(d² - R²) has units of (N·m²/C²) * (C² * m)/ (m²) ) = N·m, which is Joule. So the units check out. \n\nTherefore, the expression is dimensionally correct. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case when the sphere is far away, i.e., d >> R. Then, the potential energy should approximate that of a charge q and a point charge q' = - q R / d located at a distance d - R²/d ≈ d. Then, the potential energy would be approximately U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d², which is similar to the dipole interaction energy (since q' is proportional to 1/d, making the product q q' / d proportional to 1/d²). That makes sense, as at large distances, the induced charge appears as a dipole. \n\nWait, but actually, the leading term in the multipole expansion of the induced charge on the sphere would be a dipole moment p = q' * (R²/d) = (- q R/d) * (R²/d) = - q R³ / d². Therefore, the dipole potential is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d² = (1/(4πε₀)) (- q R³ / d² ) / d² = - (1/(4πε₀)) q R³ / d^4. Then, the potential energy of q in this dipole field would be U = q * (potential) = - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R³ / d^4. But our original expression when d >> R is U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d². These don't match, which suggests a problem. Wait, why the discrepancy? \n\nAh, because the image charge gives an exact result, while the dipole approximation is only the leading term. So if we expand our exact result for large d:\n\nU = - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² ) ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² (1 - R²/d² )^{-1} ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² (1 + R²/d² + ... )\n\nSo the leading term is - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d², which is different from the dipole approximation. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the image charge result isn't matching the dipole approximation. Wait, no. Wait, the dipole moment of the sphere is actually p = q' * (R²/d) = (- q R/d) * (R²/d) = - q R³ / d². Then, the potential due to a dipole p at a distance d is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d² * cosθ, but since the dipole is along the axis, at the position of the charge q (which is along the axis), θ = 0, so the potential is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d². Then, the potential energy is U = q * V = q * (1/(4πε₀)) (- q R³ / d² ) / d² = - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R³ / d^4. \n\nBut according to our exact result, the leading term is - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R / d². So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my exact result might be incorrect. Wait, but how? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge location and magnitude. Let me double-check. For a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' for a point charge q located at distance d from the center is q' = - q R / d, located at a distance R²/d from the center. That is correct. So the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d. Then, the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) q q' / (distance). So that gives the expression we had. \n\nBut why does the dipole approximation not match? Maybe because the image charge method accounts for all multipole moments, not just the dipole. So when we expand the exact result for large d, the leading term is - (q² R)/(4πε₀ d²) and the dipole term would be part of the expansion. Wait, but according to the dipole approximation, the potential energy is proportional to 1/d^4, but according to the image charge, it's 1/d². That can't be. There must be a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps the dipole approximation is not the right way to compare. Wait, the induced charge on the sphere is a single image charge, not a dipole. So actually, the potential due to the image charge is a monopole term, but since the image charge is inside the sphere, when we are outside the sphere, the potential due to the induced charges (which are on the sphere's surface) is the same as that of the image charge. However, the actual charge distribution on the sphere is a surface charge density that creates a monopole field outside equivalent to the image charge. So the monopole moment of the induced charges is q' = - q R / d. Therefore, the leading term in the multipole expansion is the monopole term, which is of order 1/d. But wait, the monopole term would give a potential that decreases as 1/d, but the image charge's potential at the position of q is q' / (distance), which is (- q R / d) / (d - R²/d) ≈ - q R / d² for large d. Therefore, the potential energy is U = q * (- q R / (4πε₀ d²)) = - q² R / (4πε₀ d²). \n\nBut the monopole moment of the sphere's induced charge is q' = - q R / d, which would produce a potential at the charge q (distance d from the center) of V = q' / (4πε₀ d) = (- q R / d ) / (4πε₀ d ) = - q R / (4πε₀ d² ). Then, the potential energy is U = q V = - q² R / (4πε₀ d² ), which matches the leading term of our exact result. \n\nSo where does the dipole moment come into play? The dipole moment of the induced charges is a higher-order term. The image charge method gives the exact result, which includes all multipole moments. Therefore, the discrepancy I was worried about earlier is because I was comparing the exact result (which is monopole) to the dipole approximation, which is not the leading term here. The monopole term is actually non-zero because the induced charge on the sphere has a net charge q' = - q R / d. Therefore, the leading term is monopole, and the dipole term is next order. So everything is consistent. \n\nTherefore, the result U = - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² ) is correct. \n\nBut let me check another edge case. If the sphere is very small, R → 0, then the potential energy should approach zero because the image charge becomes zero. Indeed, in that case, U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² → 0. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if the charge is very close to the sphere, d → R from above, then the denominator d² - R² approaches zero, and the potential energy becomes very negative, which implies a strong attraction, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I think the expression is correct. \n\nBut just to recap, the steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that the grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge q' = - q R / d located at a distance R²/d from the center.\n\n2.

To calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge \( q \) is placed a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. 

1. **Image Charge Calculation**:
   - The image charge \( q' \) induced on the grounded sphere is given by \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \).
   - The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between Charges**:
   - The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the interaction energy between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \):
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \cdot q'}{\text{distance between } q \text{ and } q'}
     \]
   - Substituting the values of \( q' \) and the distance:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \left( -\frac{qR}{d} \right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \left( -\frac{q^2 R}{d} \right) \frac{d}{d^2 - R^2}
     \]
     \[
     U = -\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}
     \]

### Final Answer
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

over the surface. However, since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of charge q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But calculating that directly might be complicated. However, using the method of images, we can replace the sphere with the image charge, so the potential at q due to the image charge is φ = (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q'). Then, the potential energy of charge q is U = q * φ. But since the image charge is not a real charge, perhaps this is the correct expression? 

Alternatively, if we consider both the real charge and the image charge, then the potential energy would be (1/2) [ q * φ_image + q' * φ_real ]. But since the image charge is not real, maybe we only consider the potential energy of the real charge in the field of the image charge. However, the correct approach is probably to consider the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position in the presence of the grounded sphere. That work would be equal to the potential energy of the system. 

The electric field that the charge q experiences is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the field produced by the image charge q'. Therefore, the potential at the position of q due to the induced charges is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q'). Therefore, the work done to bring q from infinity to that position is W = q * V, which is the potential energy U. 

Therefore, U = q * (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (d - R²/d). 

Substituting q' = -qR/d, we get:

U = q * (1/(4πε₀)) * (-qR/d) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) ) 

Simplify denominator:

( d² - R² ) / d 

So plugging in:

U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d ) * (d / (d² - R²)) )

The d cancels out:

U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R ) / (d² - R² )

Therefore, U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )

But wait, the denominator is d² - R², which can be factored as (d - R)(d + R). However, let me check if this is dimensionally correct. The units of R and d are length, so the denominator is length squared, numerator is q squared times length. Then, 1/(4πε₀) has units of (length)/(charge²) * (charge²)/(length² * force) ??? Wait, maybe better not to check units here. 

Alternatively, let's recall that when d > R, the expression makes sense. If d approaches R from above, the denominator approaches zero, so the potential energy becomes very negative, which might indicate that the force becomes attractive, which is expected because as the charge gets closer to the sphere, the attraction is stronger. 

But let me verify this result with a standard reference or formula. 

Wait, in the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere, the force between the charge and the sphere is given by F = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (d - R²/d)^2, which would be the derivative of the potential energy with respect to d. So integrating the force over distance would give the potential energy. Alternatively, since the image charge is a way to compute the potential, the potential energy should be as we calculated. 

Alternatively, another way to compute the potential energy is to consider the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the center of the sphere. The work done is the integral of the force times distance. The electric field experienced by the charge q at a distance x from the center (as we bring it in from infinity to d) is due to the induced charges, which can be represented by the image charge at R²/x. So the force on q is F = q * E, where E is the electric field due to the image charge. The image charge at each point x is q'(x) = -q R / x, located at R²/x from the center. Therefore, the distance between q and q'(x) is x - R²/x. Therefore, the electric field at the position of q due to q'(x) is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q'(x) / (x - R²/x)^2. 

Wait, but actually, when we move the charge q from infinity to d, the image charge's position and magnitude change as x changes. So integrating the work done requires considering the varying image charge. That complicates things. However, in reality, the image charge method gives the correct potential for the final configuration, so maybe the potential energy can be directly calculated as we did before. 

But I need to verify if that's the case. Let me recall that when you have a system of charges, the potential energy is (1/2) Σ q_i V_i, where V_i is the potential at the location of charge q_i due to all other charges. In this case, we have the real charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, since the induced charges are distributed over the sphere, calculating Σ q_i V_i would require integrating over the surface charge density. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. 

Alternatively, using the method of images, we can replace the sphere with the image charge, and then the potential energy is simply (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at q due to the image charge. Wait, but why half? 

Wait, in the case of two real charges q1 and q2, the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) q1 q2 / r, which can also be written as (1/2) [ q1 V2 + q2 V1 ], where V2 is the potential at q1 due to q2, and V1 is the potential at q2 due to q1. Since V2 = (1/(4πε₀)) q2 / r and V1 = (1/(4πε₀)) q1 / r, then (1/2) [ q1 V2 + q2 V1 ] = (1/(4πε₀)) (q1 q2)/r, which matches. 

But in our case, the image charge is not a real charge. So maybe the potential energy is just q V, where V is the potential at the position of q due to the image charge. Because the induced charges on the sphere are considered to be a result of the electrostatic induction, and the work done to bring q into place is against the electric field produced by the induced charges, which is equivalent to the field of the image charge. Therefore, the potential energy is simply U = q * (potential due to image charge at q's location). 

So in that case, U = q * [ (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q') ]

Which gives us the same result as before. Therefore, the potential energy is U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )

But let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the capacitance of the system. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so maybe the capacitance approach isn't straightforward here. Alternatively, think about the induced charge on the sphere. The induced charge is q' = - q R / d. The potential energy can also be calculated as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charge q'. But since the induced charge is a result of the electrostatic induction, the work done is only due to moving q in the presence of the induced charges. 

Alternatively, the energy can be calculated by considering the electric field in all space and integrating the energy density. The electric field is due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, this might be complicated, but maybe we can use the image charge to find the field. 

The electric field outside the sphere is the same as the field produced by q and the image charge q'. The electric field inside the sphere is zero because it's a conductor. So the total electric field energy would be the integral over all space of (ε₀/2) E². But since the sphere is grounded, the energy stored in the electric field should be equal to the potential energy of the system. 

Calculating this integral might be tedious, but let's see. The electric field is due to two point charges: q at position d and q' at position R²/d. The energy stored in the electric field is (ε₀/2) ∫ E² dV. But this integral would split into the energy due to each charge separately and the cross term. However, the self-energy of each charge is infinite, but when we consider the potential energy of the system, we are only interested in the interaction energy, not the self-energies. Therefore, the interaction energy would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q q' / (distance between them). Which brings us back to the same result. 

Therefore, it seems that the potential energy of the system is indeed U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )

But let me check the dimensions. The numerator is q² R, which has dimensions of [charge]^2 [length]. The denominator is d² - R², which is [length]^2. So the whole fraction has dimensions [charge]^2 / [length]. Then, multiplying by 1/(4πε₀), which has dimensions [length]/[charge]^2 * [force] [length]^2. Wait, ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²), so 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². Therefore, (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R)/(d² - R²) has units of (N·m²/C²) * (C² * m)/ (m²) ) = N·m, which is Joule. So the units check out. 

Therefore, the expression is dimensionally correct. 

Alternatively, let's consider the case when the sphere is far away, i.e., d >> R. Then, the potential energy should approximate that of a charge q and a point charge q' = - q R / d located at a distance d - R²/d ≈ d. Then, the potential energy would be approximately U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d², which is similar to the dipole interaction energy (since q' is proportional to 1/d, making the product q q' / d proportional to 1/d²). That makes sense, as at large distances, the induced charge appears as a dipole. 

Wait, but actually, the leading term in the multipole expansion of the induced charge on the sphere would be a dipole moment p = q' * (R²/d) = (- q R/d) * (R²/d) = - q R³ / d². Therefore, the dipole potential is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d² = (1/(4πε₀)) (- q R³ / d² ) / d² = - (1/(4πε₀)) q R³ / d^4. Then, the potential energy of q in this dipole field would be U = q * (potential) = - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R³ / d^4. But our original expression when d >> R is U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d². These don't match, which suggests a problem. Wait, why the discrepancy? 

Ah, because the image charge gives an exact result, while the dipole approximation is only the leading term. So if we expand our exact result for large d:

U = - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² ) ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² (1 - R²/d² )^{-1} ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² (1 + R²/d² + ... )

So the leading term is - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d², which is different from the dipole approximation. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the image charge result isn't matching the dipole approximation. Wait, no. Wait, the dipole moment of the sphere is actually p = q' * (R²/d) = (- q R/d) * (R²/d) = - q R³ / d². Then, the potential due to a dipole p at a distance d is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d² * cosθ, but since the dipole is along the axis, at the position of the charge q (which is along the axis), θ = 0, so the potential is (1/(4πε₀)) p / d². Then, the potential energy is U = q * V = q * (1/(4πε₀)) (- q R³ / d² ) / d² = - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R³ / d^4. 

But according to our exact result, the leading term is - (1/(4πε₀)) q² R / d². So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my exact result might be incorrect. Wait, but how? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge location and magnitude. Let me double-check. For a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' for a point charge q located at distance d from the center is q' = - q R / d, located at a distance R²/d from the center. That is correct. So the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d. Then, the potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) q q' / (distance). So that gives the expression we had. 

But why does the dipole approximation not match? Maybe because the image charge method accounts for all multipole moments, not just the dipole. So when we expand the exact result for large d, the leading term is - (q² R)/(4πε₀ d²) and the dipole term would be part of the expansion. Wait, but according to the dipole approximation, the potential energy is proportional to 1/d^4, but according to the image charge, it's 1/d². That can't be. There must be a mistake here. 

Wait, perhaps the dipole approximation is not the right way to compare. Wait, the induced charge on the sphere is a single image charge, not a dipole. So actually, the potential due to the image charge is a monopole term, but since the image charge is inside the sphere, when we are outside the sphere, the potential due to the induced charges (which are on the sphere's surface) is the same as that of the image charge. However, the actual charge distribution on the sphere is a surface charge density that creates a monopole field outside equivalent to the image charge. So the monopole moment of the induced charges is q' = - q R / d. Therefore, the leading term in the multipole expansion is the monopole term, which is of order 1/d. But wait, the monopole term would give a potential that decreases as 1/d, but the image charge's potential at the position of q is q' / (distance), which is (- q R / d) / (d - R²/d) ≈ - q R / d² for large d. Therefore, the potential energy is U = q * (- q R / (4πε₀ d²)) = - q² R / (4πε₀ d²). 

But the monopole moment of the sphere's induced charge is q' = - q R / d, which would produce a potential at the charge q (distance d from the center) of V = q' / (4πε₀ d) = (- q R / d ) / (4πε₀ d ) = - q R / (4πε₀ d² ). Then, the potential energy is U = q V = - q² R / (4πε₀ d² ), which matches the leading term of our exact result. 

So where does the dipole moment come into play? The dipole moment of the induced charges is a higher-order term. The image charge method gives the exact result, which includes all multipole moments. Therefore, the discrepancy I was worried about earlier is because I was comparing the exact result (which is monopole) to the dipole approximation, which is not the leading term here. The monopole term is actually non-zero because the induced charge on the sphere has a net charge q' = - q R / d. Therefore, the leading term is monopole, and the dipole term is next order. So everything is consistent. 

Therefore, the result U = - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² ) is correct. 

But let me check another edge case. If the sphere is very small, R → 0, then the potential energy should approach zero because the image charge becomes zero. Indeed, in that case, U ≈ - (1/(4πε₀)) ( q² R ) / d² → 0. That makes sense. 

Alternatively, if the charge is very close to the sphere, d → R from above, then the denominator d² - R² approaches zero, and the potential energy becomes very negative, which implies a strong attraction, which is correct. 

Therefore, after all these checks, I think the expression is correct. 

But just to recap, the steps are:

1. Recognize that the grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge q' = - q R / d located at a distance R²/d from the center.

2. The distance between the original charge q and the image charge q' is d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

3. The potential energy of the system is the interaction energy between q and q', which is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / (distance).

4. Substitute q' and the distance into the formula and simplify to get U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q² R ) / ( d² - R² )

Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is U = - ( q² R ) / [ 4πε₀ ( d² - R² ) ]

Yes, that seems right. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}.

The image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center. So, the separation between the original charge and the image charge is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the potential energy between two charges is (1/(4πε₀)) × (q1 q2)/r. Here, q1 is q, q2 is -qR/d, and r is (d² - R²)/d. So substituting:\n\n(1/(4πε₀)) × (q × (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) = (1/(4πε₀)) × (-q² R/d) × d/(d² - R²) = (-q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)). Yes, that simplifies correctly.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion seems right.\n\nBut let me check if there's another perspective. The potential energy of the system in electrostatics can also be considered as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the image charge is induced, and the work done against the electric field created by the image charge gives the potential energy.\n\nAlternatively, since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The presence of the charge q induces charges on the sphere, but since it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere is not necessarily zero. Wait, no, for a grounded sphere, the potential is zero, but the charge on the sphere can adjust. However, in the method of images, the image charge is calculated to satisfy the boundary condition (zero potential on the sphere). Therefore, the induced charge on the sphere is equal to the image charge. So in this case, the induced charge is q' = -q R/d.\n\nTherefore, the potential energy would be the interaction between the original charge and the image charge. Since the sphere is grounded, there is no energy stored in moving charges to/from the sphere. Therefore, the potential energy is purely the interaction between q and q'.\n\nHence, the calculation above should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the sphere were not grounded but isolated and neutral, the calculation would involve a different image charge (with an additional charge at the center to ensure the sphere remains neutral). But in this case, since it's grounded, the image charge is as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the net potential energy is U = - (q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)).\n\nBut let me check dimensions. The numerator is q² R, denominator is d² - R². The denominator has dimensions of length squared.

To calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. 

1. **Image Charge Configuration**:
   - The image charge \( q' \) induced on the sphere is given by \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \).
   - The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between Charges**:
   - The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - The potential energy \( U \) is the interaction energy between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \):
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \cdot q'}{\text{distance between charges}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values of \( q' \) and the distance:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \left( -\frac{qR}{d} \right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \left( -\frac{q^2 R}{d} \right) \cdot \frac{d}{d^2 - R^2}
     \]
     \[
     U = -\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}
     \]

### Final Answer
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{ -\dfrac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)} }.

If the charge were inside the sphere (d < R), the image charge would be different, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so assuming the charge is outside seems reasonable unless stated otherwise.

Alternatively, if the sphere were isolated and not grounded, we would also account for the induced charges, but grounding allows the sphere to maintain zero potential, so only the image charge is considered here.

Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is U = - (1/(4πε₀)) × (q²R)/(d² - R²).

Wait, but let me verify the distance again. The image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center. So, the separation between the original charge and the image charge is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. That seems correct.

Alternatively, the formula for the potential energy between two charges is (1/(4πε₀)) × (q1 q2)/r. Here, q1 is q, q2 is -qR/d, and r is (d² - R²)/d. So substituting:

(1/(4πε₀)) × (q × (-qR/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) = (1/(4πε₀)) × (-q² R/d) × d/(d² - R²) = (-q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)). Yes, that simplifies correctly.

Therefore, the conclusion seems right.

But let me check if there's another perspective. The potential energy of the system in electrostatics can also be considered as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the image charge is induced, and the work done against the electric field created by the image charge gives the potential energy.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The presence of the charge q induces charges on the sphere, but since it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere is not necessarily zero. Wait, no, for a grounded sphere, the potential is zero, but the charge on the sphere can adjust. However, in the method of images, the image charge is calculated to satisfy the boundary condition (zero potential on the sphere). Therefore, the induced charge on the sphere is equal to the image charge. So in this case, the induced charge is q' = -q R/d.

Therefore, the potential energy would be the interaction between the original charge and the image charge. Since the sphere is grounded, there is no energy stored in moving charges to/from the sphere. Therefore, the potential energy is purely the interaction between q and q'.

Hence, the calculation above should be correct.

Alternatively, if the sphere were not grounded but isolated and neutral, the calculation would involve a different image charge (with an additional charge at the center to ensure the sphere remains neutral). But in this case, since it's grounded, the image charge is as calculated.

Therefore, the net potential energy is U = - (q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)).

But let me check dimensions. The numerator is q² R, denominator is d² - R². The denominator has dimensions of length squared. The entire expression has dimensions of (charge²)/(length), multiplied by 1/(4πε₀), which has dimensions of (length × charge²)/(energy), so overall, the dimensions are energy. Correct.

Another way: Force is (1/(4πε₀)) (q²)/r², so energy would be (1/(4πε₀)) (q²)/r, which is consistent with the expression here. So the answer is dimensionally correct.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the net potential energy is given by:

U = - (q² R) / [4πε₀ (d² - R²)]

**Final Answer**
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{ -\dfrac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)} }.

To determine the net potential energy of a system with a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of image charges. 

1. **Image Charge Calculation**:
   - The image charge \( q' \) induced on the sphere is given by \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \).
   - The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between Charges**:
   - The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - The potential energy \( U \) between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is calculated using the formula for the potential energy between two point charges:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \cdot q'}{\text{distance between charges}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values of \( q' \) and the distance:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q \left( -\frac{qR}{d} \right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \left( -\frac{q^2 R}{d} \right) \frac{d}{d^2 - R^2} = -\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}
     \]

Thus, the net potential energy of the system is \(\boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}\).

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, the work done to bring q from infinity to d would be equal to the interaction energy between q and the image charge. However, in the formula for potential energy between two point charges, we use (1/(4πε₀)) * q1 q2 / r. Since the image charge is a result of the induction, but the actual induced charge is spread over the sphere. However, the method of images allows us to use the image charge as if it were a real charge for the purpose of calculating potentials and energies. So, even though the image charge is fictitious, the potential energy calculated this way is correct.

Therefore, the net potential energy is U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R) / (d² - R²). Let me check the units. q²/(ε₀) has units of (C²)/(C²·N⁻¹·m⁻²) ) = N·m², divided by (d² - R²) (m²), so units of N·m, which is Joules. Correct. The negative sign is also expected as the system is bound when the charge is attracted to the sphere.

Alternatively, if we consider the energy stored in the electric field, but since the sphere is grounded, the energy is only due to the charge and the image. Alternatively, the energy is half the sum of charges multiplied by their potentials. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so only the charge q contributes. However, the potential at q's position due to the image charge is φ = (1/(4πε₀)) * q' / (distance between q and q'). So the potential energy U is q * φ.

But in that case, U = q * (1/(4πε₀)) * (-qR/d) / (d - R²/d) = same as before. So yes, the same result. Therefore, the potential energy is indeed U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R) / (d² - R²).

Alternatively, the energy can be written as U = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R) / (d² - R²) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R) / (d² (1 - R²/d²)) ) = - (1/(4πε₀)) * (q² R) / d² (1 - (R/d)^2)^(-1). But that might not be necessary. So, the answer simplifies to U = - (q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)).

Wait, let me check the distance between the charge q and the image charge. The charge q is at distance d from the center, and the image charge is at R²/d from the center. So the separation between them is d - R²/d. Let's compute that:

d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d. So the distance between the two charges is (d² - R²)/d. Therefore, the denominator in the potential energy formula is (d² - R²)/d. So the formula becomes:

U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * (-q R/d)) / ((d² - R²)/d) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R / d) * (d / (d² - R²)) ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q² R) / (d² - R²)

Yes, that's correct. So the final expression is U = - (q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)).

Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is this expression. Let me check for R approaching zero, which would be a grounded conducting sphere shrinking to a point. The potential energy would then be - (q² R)/(4πε₀ d²). As R approaches zero, U approaches zero, which makes sense because a point conductor can't have induced charge. Wait, but if R is zero, the sphere is gone, so the charge q would just be in space with no conductor, so the potential energy would be zero. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, if d approaches R, meaning the charge is very close to the sphere's surface, then d² - R² approaches (d - R)(d + R) ≈ 2R(d - R). Then U ≈ - (q² R)/(4πε₀ * 2R (d - R)) ) = - (q²)/(8πε₀ (d - R)). As d approaches R, the potential energy becomes more negative, which is expected because the attraction becomes stronger as the charge is closer.

Alternatively, if d approaches infinity, the potential energy U tends to zero, which is correct as the charge is very far away, so the sphere's influence diminishes.

Therefore, the formula seems to have the correct limits and units. Hence, the net potential energy of the system is U = - (q² R)/(4πε₀ (d² - R²)).

**Final Answer**
The net potential energy of the system is \boxed{-\frac{q^2 R}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 (d^2 - R^2)}}.
