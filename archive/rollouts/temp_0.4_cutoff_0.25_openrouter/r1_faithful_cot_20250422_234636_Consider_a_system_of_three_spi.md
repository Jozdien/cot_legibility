The partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \) is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for all possible states. 

**Key steps:**
1. **Possible States and Energies:**
   - **All spins aligned (\( +1 \) or \( -1 \)):** Energy \( E = -3J \). There are 2 such states.
   - **Two spins \( +1 \), one \( -1 \) or vice versa:** Energy \( E = J \). There are 6 such states (3 configurations each for two \( +1 \) and one \( -1 \), and two \( -1 \) and one \( +1 \)).

2. **Partition Function Calculation:**
   - For the 2 states with energy \( -3J \): Contribution is \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
   - For the 6 states with energy \( J \): Contribution is \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

**Result:**
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

**Answer:**  
The partition function is \(\boxed{Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins, each being +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of the exponential of -βE, right? Let me recall that. 

First, let's figure out how many possible states there are. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. That's manageable. I need to list all these states, compute the energy for each, then calculate exp(-βE) for each state and sum them up. 

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states? Let me think. The energy expression is symmetric in all the spins. Maybe group the states by the number of +1 and -1 spins? But with three spins, the possible configurations could be all +1, two +1 and one -1, one +1 and two -1, and all -1. Let's see.

But the energy depends on the products of spins. For example, if all three spins are +1, then each product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 would be (+1)(+1) = +1. So the energy would be -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J. Similarly, if two are +1 and one is -1, let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Wait, same if the -1 is on another spin? Let's check S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[-1 +1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Similarly if S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1, same result. So all states with two +1 and one -1 have energy J. Similarly, states with two -1 and one +1 would be similar. Let's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Wait, same as before. Wait, is that right? Wait, if two are -1 and one is +1, the products would be two -1*+1 terms and one +1*+1 term. Wait, no: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1. So two -1 and one +1. So the sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Multiply by -J: energy is J. Similarly, if all three are -1, then each product is +1, so sum is 3, energy is -3J. So actually, the energy depends on whether the number of +1 spins is even or odd? Wait, no. Let's see. Let's list all possibilities:

Case 1: All spins +1. Then each S_iS_j = +1. So energy E = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins +1, one spin -1. Then two products will be -1, one product will be +1. Wait, no. Wait, if two are +1 and one is -1, then the product of the two +1s is +1, and the products of the +1 with -1 are -1 each. So total sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Case 3: One spin +1, two spins -1. Similarly, the product of the two -1s is +1, and the other two products are -1 each. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = J again.

Case 4: All spins -1. Then each product is +1. So sum is 3, E = -3J.

Wait, so actually, the energies are the same for two +1 and one -1 as for two -1 and one +1? That is, the energy only depends on whether the number of spins aligned in the same direction is even or odd? Wait, no. Wait, if all three are the same, energy is -3J. If two are same and one different, energy is J. So there are two distinct energy levels: -3J and J. How many states correspond to each?

For all spins +1: 1 state.

All spins -1: 1 state.

Two +1 and one -1: There are C(3,1) = 3 states.

Two -1 and one +1: Similarly, C(3,1) = 3 states.

So total states: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8, which checks out.

But wait, in terms of energy, all the states with two of one kind and one of the other have energy J. So total of 6 states with energy J, and 2 states with energy -3J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-βE). So for the two states with energy -3J, their contribution is 2 * exp(-β*(-3J)) = 2 exp(3βJ). For the six states with energy J, their contribution is 6 * exp(-β*J). Therefore, Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ).

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify with an example. Let's take one state from each category.

All +1: E = -3J, so exp(-βE) = exp(3βJ). Similarly for all -1.

Two +1 and one -1: E = J, exp(-βJ). There are three such states, but wait, no, actually, there are three ways to choose which spin is -1, so three states. Similarly, two -1 and one +1: three states. Each of those six states has energy J, so 6 * exp(-βJ). So total Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it by enumerating all states. Let's try that.

List all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = -3J
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: E = J
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: E = J
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: E = J (Wait, no, wait. Let me compute this one again. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Yes.)
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = J
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: E = J (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.)
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: E = J
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: E = -3J

So indeed, states 1 and 8 have energy -3J, the rest have energy J. Therefore, Z = 2*exp(3βJ) + 6*exp(-βJ).

Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

But let me check if that's the case. Wait, when β is 1/(kT), so the Boltzmann factor is exp(-βE). For E = -3J, the exponent becomes -β*(-3J) = 3βJ. For E = J, it's -β*J. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe factor out something. Let's see:

Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. Not sure if there's a simpler way to write it. Maybe factor out 2e^{-βJ}:

Z = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). But not sure if that's necessary. The problem just asks for the partition function, so either form is acceptable. But maybe the first form is more straightforward.

Alternatively, since there are two energy levels, -3J and J, with degeneracies 2 and 6, then Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Yes, that seems right. Let me confirm with another approach. Maybe using variables.

Let me denote the product terms. Let me compute E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let's see:

Note that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i^2 = 1. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2. Therefore, E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ].

So E = -J/2 ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) = (3J)/2 - (J/2)(S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Therefore, the energy can be written in terms of the square of the total spin. Let me denote M = S1 + S2 + S3. Then E = (3J)/2 - (J/2)M^2.

Therefore, the partition function can be written as sum over all states of exp( -β [ (3J)/2 - (J/2)M^2 ] ) = exp( -3βJ/2 ) sum_{states} exp( βJ/2 M^2 ).

But M can take values: since each S_i is ±1, the sum M can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), -3 (all -1). Wait, let's see:

Possible values of M:

All +1: 3.

Two +1, one -1: 1 +1 -1 = 1.

One +1, two -1: -1.

All -1: -3.

So M can be ±3, ±1. So M^2 is either 9 or 1.

Therefore, for M = ±3: M^2=9. For M=±1: M^2=1.

Number of states with M=3: 1 (all +1).

M=-3: 1 (all -1).

M=1: C(3,1)=3 (two +1, one -1).

M=-1: C(3,1)=3 (two -1, one +1).

So sum_{states} exp( βJ/2 M^2 ) = 2*exp( βJ/2 *9 ) + 6*exp( βJ/2 *1 ) = 2e^{(9/2)βJ} + 6e^{(1/2)βJ}.

Then Z = exp( -3βJ/2 ) * [ 2e^{(9/2)βJ} + 6e^{(1/2)βJ} ] = 2e^{(9/2 - 3/2)βJ} + 6e^{(1/2 - 3/2)βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Which matches the earlier result. So this confirms that Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. Alternatively, factorizing, but I think that's the simplest form. So the answer should be Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

But wait, let me check once more with actual enumeration. Let's compute each state's energy and the corresponding exponential:

1. All +1: E = -3J → exp(3βJ)
2. All -1: E = -3J → exp(3βJ)
3. Two +1, one -1 (three states): E = J → each contributes exp(-βJ)
4. Two -1, one +1 (three states): E = J → each contributes exp(-βJ)

Total contributions: 2*exp(3βJ) + 6*exp(-βJ). Yep, that's correct. So the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed here. So the final answer should be Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. Maybe written as 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}, but it's the same thing.

Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins, each being +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of the exponential of -βE, right? Let me recall that.

But the energy depends on the products of spins. For example, if all three spins are +1, then each product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 would be (+1)(+1) = +1. So the energy would be -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J. Similarly, if two are +1 and one is -1, let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Wait, same if the -1 is on another spin? Let's check S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[-1 +1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Similarly if S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1, same result. So all states with two +1 and one -1 have energy J. Similarly, states with two -1 and one +1 would be similar. Let's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So energy is -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Wait, same as before. Wait, is that right? Wait, if two are -1 and one is +1, the products would be two -1*+1 terms and one +1*+1 term. Wait, no: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1. So two -1 and one +1. So the sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Multiply by -J: energy is J. Similarly, if all three are -1, then each product is +1, so sum is 3, energy is -3J. So actually

# Anthropic completion

I need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, where each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is expressed as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum of e^(-βE) over all possible states.

For this system, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states since each of the three spins has two possible values. I could enumerate all states, calculate the energy for each, then sum up the exponentials, but perhaps there's a more efficient approach.

I notice the energy expression is symmetric with respect to all spins. Let me analyze the system by categorizing states according to their spin configurations.

For the state where all spins are +1, each product (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) equals (+1)(+1) = +1. The energy is therefore -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.

When two spins are +1 and one is -1, for example with S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1, the products are S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. The energy becomes -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J(-1) = J.

I can verify this holds for other configurations with two +1 and one -1. For instance, with S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1, we get S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1, yielding energy -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J(-1) = J.

For states with two -1 and one +1, such as S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1, the products are S1S2 = (+1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (-1). This gives energy -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J(-1) = J.

Finally, when all spins are -1, each product equals (+1), making the energy -3J, identical to the all +1 case.

Alright, so I need to determine the partition function Z for a system of three spins, each of which can be +1 or -1. The energy for the system is described by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. As I recall, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of the exponential of -βE.

First, let’s figure out the total number of possible states. Each spin can be either +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible configurations for three spins. That's a manageable number. I should list all these states, compute their respective energies, calculate exp(-βE) for each state, and sum them.

However, there might be a more efficient way than listing all 8 states one by one. The energy expression is symmetric with respect to the spins. Maybe I can group the states based on how many spins are +1 or -1. With three spins, the possible configurations are: all +1, two +1 and one -1, one +1 and two -1, and all -1. Let's explore this.

Now, the energy depends on the products of the spins. For instance, if all three spins are +1, then the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are each (+1)(+1) = +1. Therefore, the energy would be -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J. If two spins are +1 and one is -1, suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1, then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1, resulting in energy -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. It appears the energy remains J even if the -1 is assigned to a different spin. For example, with S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1, we find S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1, giving energy -J[-1 +1 -1] = -J(-1) = J. Similarly, with S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1, the result is the same. Thus, all states with two +1 and one -1 have energy J.

Analogously, for states with two -1 and one +1, we see a similar pattern. Take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1, then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1, which gives energy -J[1 -1 -1] = -J(-1) = J, matching the earlier configuration. Actually, the correct understanding is: if two spins are -1 and one is +1, the products include two terms of -1*+1 and one of +1*+1. So, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 gives S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1, resulting in a sum of -1. Multiplying by -J, the energy is J. Lastly, if all three spins are -1, each product becomes +1, leading to a sum of 3 and energy -3J. So indeed, this approach works.

Wait, all +1 is one state, all -1 is another state. So total of 2 states with energy -3J. Then the other 6 states (3 + 3) have energy J. So yes, Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ).\n\nWait, let me confirm this. Let me list all 8 states:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1): E = J\n\n4.

Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = J. Similarly, state 5: (-1, +1, +1). S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Same as above. So energy J. Similarly, state 6: (-1, +1, -1). S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J. State 7: (-1, -1, +1). S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1. E = J. So indeed, out of 8 states, two have energy -3J and six have energy J. Therefore, the partition function is:\n\nZ = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}\n\nWait, because for each state with energy E, we have exp(-βE). So for E = -3J, exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3βJ). And for E = J, exp(-β*J). So yes, two terms of exp(3βJ) and six terms of exp(-βJ). So Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.\n\nAlternatively, we can factor out 2 e^{-βJ}:\n\nZ = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ} = 2 e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} + 3). Hmm, not sure if that\'s useful, but maybe simplifies. Let me check:\n\ne^{3βJ} = e^{-βJ} * e^{4βJ}, so 2 e^{3βJ} = 2 e^{-βJ} e^{4βJ}\n\nTherefore, Z = 2 e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} + 3). But maybe it\'s better left as 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.\n\nAlternatively, factor 2:\n\nZ = 2 (e^{3βJ} + 3 e^{-βJ})\n\nEither way is correct. The question says "Find the partition function Z", so either form is acceptable, but maybe the expanded form is better. Let me check if there\'s another way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let\'s see: Let\'s denote the sum as Q = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J Q. So partition function is sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp(β J Q). So Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp(β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some variable substitution. Let me think. Let me consider variables S1, S2, S3 each ±1.\n\nAlternatively, note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Let\'s compute that:\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nBut since S1, S2, S3 are ±1, their squares are 1. Therefore:\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nTherefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2\n\nTherefore, Q = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2\n\nTherefore, E = -J Q = -J [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ]\n\nHence, Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp( (β J / 2)( 3 - (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 ) )\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but maybe we can express the partition function in terms of the possible values of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.\n\nLet me compute the possible values of M = S1 + S2 + S3. Since each S is ±1, the possible sums are:\n\n-3: all -1\n\n-1: two -1, one +1\n\n+1: two +1, one -1\n\n+3: all +1\n\nSo M can be -3, -1, +1, +3. Therefore, M^2 can be 9, 1, 1, 9. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 can be 9 or 1. So Q = (M^2 - 3)/2. Therefore, if M^2=9, Q=(9-3)/2=3. If M^2=1, Q=(1 -3)/2 = -1. Therefore, energy E = -J Q. So when Q=3, E = -3J; when Q=-1, E= J. Which matches our previous analysis. The number of states with M=3 or M=-3 (i.e., M^2=9) is 2, and with M=±1 (M^2=1) is 6. So the same as before.\n\nTherefore, another way to write Z is:\n\nZ = sum_{M^2} g(M^2) exp( (β J / 2)(3 - M^2) )\n\nWhere g(M^2) is the number of states with a given M^2. For M^2=9, g=2; for M^2=1, g=6. So:\n\nZ = 2 exp( (β J / 2)(3 - 9) ) + 6 exp( (β J / 2)(3 - 1) )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nFor M^2=9: (3 - 9)/2 = -3, so exp(-3β J)\n\nFor M^2=1: (3 - 1)/2 = 1, so exp(β J)\n\nWait, but hold on, that gives Z = 2 exp(-3β J) + 6 exp(β J). Wait, but this contradicts our previous result where we had 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, there\'s a sign error here. Let\'s go back. The energy is E = -J Q, where Q = (M^2 -3)/2. Therefore, E = -J * (M^2 -3)/2. So the exponent in the partition function is -β E = β J (M^2 -3)/2. So exp( β J (M^2 -3)/2 ). Therefore, in terms of M^2:\n\nIf M^2=9, exponent is β J (9 -3)/2 = β J * 3, so exp(3β J)\n\nIf M^2=1, exponent is β J (1 -3)/2 = β J (-1), so exp(-β J)\n\nTherefore, Z = 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Which matches our original calculation. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the partition function is Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out 2 e^{-β J}:\n\nZ = 2 e^{-β J} ( e^{4β J} + 3 )\n\nBut unless the problem specifies a particular form, both are acceptable. However, since the problem says "Find the partition function Z", and given that the answer is likely expected in the expanded form, I think 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J} is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with a different approach. Let\'s compute the partition function by summing over all possible spin configurations.\n\nEach spin can be ±1. Let\'s denote the possible configurations by their spin values.\n\nThere are 8 configurations:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1): E = J\n\n4. (+1, -1, -1): E = J\n\n5. (-1, +1, +1): E = J\n\n6. (-1, +1, -1): E = J\n\n7. (-1, -1, +1): E = J\n\n8. (-1, -1, -1): E = -3J\n\nSo for each of these, compute exp(-β E):\n\n1. exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J)\n\n2. exp(-β*J)\n\n3. exp(-β*J)\n\n4. exp(-β*J)\n\n5. exp(-β*J)\n\n6. exp(-β*J)\n\n7. exp(-β*J)\n\n8. exp(3β J)\n\nSo adding them up: 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Yep, same result. So that\'s the partition function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}. Alternatively, written with the variables given (β = 1/(kT)), so maybe we can write it as Z = 2 e^{3J/(kT)} + 6 e^{-J/(kT)}. But since the problem says "\\beta = 1/(kT)", so we should use β. So Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out 2 e^{-β J} as I did before: 2 e^{-β J}(e^{4β J} + 3). But unless specified, both forms are correct.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we need to consider all possible spin configurations and their corresponding energies.

1. **Possible Spin Configurations and Energies:**
   - Each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), leading to \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible configurations.
   - The energy \( E \) for each configuration is calculated as follows:
     - If all spins are the same (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)), the energy is \( -3J \).
     - If two spins are \( +1 \) and one is \( -1 \), or two spins are \( -1 \) and one is \( +1 \), the energy is \( J \).

2. **Number of States for Each Energy:**
   - **Energy \( -3J \):** 2 states (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
   - **Energy \( J \):** 6 states (three configurations with two \( +1 \) and one \( -1 \), and three configurations with two \( -1 \) and one \( +1 \)).

3. **Partition Function Calculation:**
   - The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state:
     \[
     Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E}
     \]
   - For the two states with energy \( -3J \):
     \[
     e^{-\beta (-3J)} = e^{3\beta J}
     \]
   - For the six states with energy \( J \):
     \[
     e^{-\beta J}
     \]
   - Summing these contributions gives:
     \[
     Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
     \]

Thus, the partition function \( Z \) is \(\boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

, the energy depends on whether the number of +1 spins is even or odd? Wait, no. Wait, if all three spins are the same, either all +1 or all -1, then each product is +1, so the energy is -3J. If two are +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1, then energy is J. Wait, but let's check a state with one +1 and two -1. Let me take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Multiply by -J: energy is J. So same as the two +1 and one -1 case. So regardless of whether you have two +1 and one -1 or two -1 and one +1, the energy is J. Then, the remaining case is when all three spins are different? Wait, no, with three spins, each either +1 or -1, you can't have all three different. So possible configurations are:

1. All +1: energy -3J

2. Two +1, one -1: energy J

3. One +1, two -1: energy J

4. All -1: energy -3J

So how many states correspond to each energy?

For all +1: 1 state

All -1: 1 state

Two +1, one -1: There are C(3,1) = 3 states (choosing which spin is -1)

Similarly, one +1, two -1: C(3,1) = 3 states

Therefore, the partition function Z will be:

Z = (number of states with energy -3J) * exp(-β*(-3J)) + (number of states with energy J) * exp(-β*J)

So that's:

Z = 2 * exp(3βJ) + 6 * exp(-βJ)

Wait, hold on: all +1 and all -1 are two states each? Wait, all +1 is one state, all -1 is another state. So total of 2 states with energy -3J. Then the other 6 states (3 + 3) have energy J. So yes, Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ).

Wait, let me confirm this. Let me list all 8 states:

1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J

2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J

3. (+1, -1, +1): E = J

4. (+1, -1, -1): E = J

5. (-1, +1, +1): E = J

6. (-1, +1, -1): E = J

7. (-1, -1, +1): E = J

8. (-1, -1, -1): E = -3J

Wait, hold on. Wait, in state 4: (+1, -1, -1). Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = J. Similarly, state 5: (-1, +1, +1). S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Same as above. So energy J. Similarly, state 6: (-1, +1, -1). S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = +1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J. State 7: (-1, -1, +1). S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1. E = J. So indeed, out of 8 states, two have energy -3J and six have energy J. Therefore, the partition function is:

Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}

Wait, because for each state with energy E, we have exp(-βE). So for E = -3J, exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3βJ). And for E = J, exp(-β*J). So yes, two terms of exp(3βJ) and six terms of exp(-βJ). So Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, we can factor out 2 e^{-βJ}:

Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ} = 2 e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} + 3). Hmm, not sure if that's useful, but maybe simplifies. Let me check:

e^{3βJ} = e^{-βJ} * e^{4βJ}, so 2 e^{3βJ} = 2 e^{-βJ} e^{4βJ}

Therefore, Z = 2 e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} + 3). But maybe it's better left as 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, factor 2:

Z = 2 (e^{3βJ} + 3 e^{-βJ})

Either way is correct. The question says "Find the partition function Z", so either form is acceptable, but maybe the expanded form is better. Let me check if there's another way to compute this.

Alternatively, consider that the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let's see: Let's denote the sum as Q = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J Q. So partition function is sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp(β J Q). So Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp(β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)).

Alternatively, maybe we can use some variable substitution. Let me think. Let me consider variables S1, S2, S3 each ±1.

Alternatively, note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Let's compute that:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)

But since S1, S2, S3 are ±1, their squares are 1. Therefore:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)

Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2

Therefore, Q = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2

Therefore, E = -J Q = -J [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ]

Hence, Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp( (β J / 2)( 3 - (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 ) )

Hmm, not sure if this helps, but maybe we can express the partition function in terms of the possible values of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Let me compute the possible values of M = S1 + S2 + S3. Since each S is ±1, the possible sums are:

-3: all -1

-1: two -1, one +1

+1: two +1, one -1

+3: all +1

So M can be -3, -1, +1, +3. Therefore, M^2 can be 9, 1, 1, 9. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 can be 9 or 1. So Q = (M^2 - 3)/2. Therefore, if M^2=9, Q=(9-3)/2=3. If M^2=1, Q=(1 -3)/2 = -1. Therefore, energy E = -J Q. So when Q=3, E = -3J; when Q=-1, E= J. Which matches our previous analysis. The number of states with M=3 or M=-3 (i.e., M^2=9) is 2, and with M=±1 (M^2=1) is 6. So the same as before.

Therefore, another way to write Z is:

Z = sum_{M^2} g(M^2) exp( (β J / 2)(3 - M^2) )

Where g(M^2) is the number of states with a given M^2. For M^2=9, g=2; for M^2=1, g=6. So:

Z = 2 exp( (β J / 2)(3 - 9) ) + 6 exp( (β J / 2)(3 - 1) )

Simplify exponents:

For M^2=9: (3 - 9)/2 = -3, so exp(-3β J)

For M^2=1: (3 - 1)/2 = 1, so exp(β J)

Wait, but hold on, that gives Z = 2 exp(-3β J) + 6 exp(β J). Wait, but this contradicts our previous result where we had 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Wait, which is correct?

Wait, there's a sign error here. Let's go back. The energy is E = -J Q, where Q = (M^2 -3)/2. Therefore, E = -J * (M^2 -3)/2. So the exponent in the partition function is -β E = β J (M^2 -3)/2. So exp( β J (M^2 -3)/2 ). Therefore, in terms of M^2:

If M^2=9, exponent is β J (9 -3)/2 = β J * 3, so exp(3β J)

If M^2=1, exponent is β J (1 -3)/2 = β J (-1), so exp(-β J)

Therefore, Z = 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Which matches our original calculation. So that's correct.

Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Alternatively, factor out 2 e^{-β J}:

Z = 2 e^{-β J} ( e^{4β J} + 3 )

But unless the problem specifies a particular form, both are acceptable. However, since the problem says "Find the partition function Z", and given that the answer is likely expected in the expanded form, I think 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J} is the answer.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check with a different approach. Let's compute the partition function by summing over all possible spin configurations.

Each spin can be ±1. Let's denote the possible configurations by their spin values.

There are 8 configurations:

1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -3J

2. (+1, +1, -1): E = J

3. (+1, -1, +1): E = J

4. (+1, -1, -1): E = J

5. (-1, +1, +1): E = J

6. (-1, +1, -1): E = J

7. (-1, -1, +1): E = J

8. (-1, -1, -1): E = -3J

So for each of these, compute exp(-β E):

1. exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J)

2. exp(-β*J)

3. exp(-β*J)

4. exp(-β*J)

5. exp(-β*J)

6. exp(-β*J)

7. exp(-β*J)

8. exp(3β J)

So adding them up: 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Yep, same result. So that's the partition function.

Therefore, the answer is Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}. Alternatively, written with the variables given (β = 1/(kT)), so maybe we can write it as Z = 2 e^{3J/(kT)} + 6 e^{-J/(kT)}. But since the problem says "\beta = 1/(kT)", so we should use β. So Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Alternatively, factor out 2 e^{-β J} as I did before: 2 e^{-β J}(e^{4β J} + 3). But unless specified, both forms are correct. But the simplest is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

So I think this is the correct partition function. Let me check once again for possible mistakes.

Wait, could I have miscalculated the number of states with each energy? Let's count again:

All +1: 1 state

All -1: 1 state

Total of 2 states with energy -3J.

Two +1 and one -1: 3 choose 1 = 3 states.

Two -1 and one +1: 3 choose 1 = 3 states.

Total of 6 states with energy J.

So yes, 2 + 6 = 8, which accounts for all states. So the numbers are correct.

Therefore, the partition function is indeed 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

**Final Answer**
The partition function \( Z \) is \boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}.

Because S_i are either +1 or -1, and the product of two spins will be +1 if they are the same and -1 if different. So, the energy depends on the number of pairs that are aligned. For three spins, each pair\'s alignment contributes to the energy.\n\nBut let\'s check the possible cases again. If all three spins are the same (all +1 or all -1), then all pairs are aligned, so each S_iS_j = +1. Therefore, energy is -3J. \n\nIf two spins are +1 and one is -1, then two of the pairs will be +1*-1 = -1, and one pair will be +1*+1 = +1. So, sum of products is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Therefore, energy is -J*(-1) = J. Similarly, if two spins are -1 and one is +1, the sum of products is again -1, leading to energy J.\n\nIf all spins are different? Wait, but with three spins each being ±1, it\'s impossible to have all three different. So the possible states are:\n\n- All spins +1: energy -3J\n\n- All spins -1: energy -3J\n\n- Two spins +1 and one -1 (there are 3 such states)\n\n- Two spins -1 and one +1 (there are 3 such states)\n\nEach of the six states (three with two +1 and one -1, three with two -1 and one +1) will have energy J.

So when we compute e^{-βE}, it\'s e^{βJ[sum S_iS_j]}.\n\nBut the energies are either -3J or J, so:\n\nFor all aligned spins (either all +1 or all -1), E = -3J. So e^{-βE} = e^{β*3J}.\n\nFor the states with two spins aligned and one opposite (six states), E = J. So e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}.\n\nAlternatively, since each spin configuration is counted once, and there are 8 total states. But according to the above analysis, 2 + 6 = 8 states. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me check:\n\nZ = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{βJ}(e^{2βJ} + 3e^{-2βJ}) )? Let\'s see:\n\n2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). Hmm, maybe that\'s a way to write it, but perhaps the original form is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} can be written as 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.\n\nAlternatively, factor 2e^{-βJ}:\n\n2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). Let\'s check:\n\n2e^{-βJ} * e^{4βJ} = 2e^{3βJ}; 2e^{-βJ} * 3 = 6e^{-βJ}. Correct.\n\nSo, Z = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3) = 2(e^{4βJ} + 3)e^{-βJ} = 2(e^{3βJ} + 3e^{-βJ}).\n\nBut both forms are equivalent.

Let\'s compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i^2 = 1, this is 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2.\n\nSo, substituting into the energy, E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ].\n\nTherefore, the exponent in the partition function becomes:\n\nβJ [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ] = (βJ/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 )\n\nTherefore, Z = sum_{S1, S2, S3} exp( (βJ/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) )\n\nBut since (S1 + S2 + S3) can take values from -3 to +3 in steps of 2.

Then, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 can be 9, 1, 1, 9. So, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 is either 9 or 1.\n\nTherefore, the exponent becomes (βJ/2)(x^2 - 3), where x^2 is either 9 or 1.\n\nSo, for x^2 = 9: (βJ/2)(9 - 3) = (βJ/2)(6) = 3βJ\n\nFor x^2 = 1: (βJ/2)(1 - 3) = (βJ/2)(-2) = -βJ\n\nTherefore, the energy exponent is either 3βJ or -βJ, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nMoreover, the number of states with x^2 = 9 (i.e., sum ±3) is 2 (all +1 or all -1).

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) where each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we consider all possible spin configurations and their corresponding energies.

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The energy for each state depends on the product of the spins:

1. **All spins aligned (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \))**:
   - Energy: \( E = -3J \)
   - Number of such states: 2
   - Contribution to partition function: \( 2e^{3\beta J} \)

2. **Two spins aligned and one opposite (e.g., two \( +1 \) and one \( -1 \), or two \( -1 \) and one \( +1 \))**:
   - Energy: \( E = J \)
   - Number of such states: 6 (three configurations with two \( +1 \) and one \( -1 \), and three configurations with two \( -1 \) and one \( +1 \))
   - Contribution to partition function: \( 6e^{-\beta J} \)

Summing these contributions, the partition function \( Z \) is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

Thus, the partition function of the system is \(\boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, that's interesting. Because S_i are either +1 or -1, and the product of two spins will be +1 if they are the same and -1 if different. So, the energy depends on the number of pairs that are aligned. For three spins, each pair's alignment contributes to the energy.

But let's check the possible cases again. If all three spins are the same (all +1 or all -1), then all pairs are aligned, so each S_iS_j = +1. Therefore, energy is -3J. 

If two spins are +1 and one is -1, then two of the pairs will be +1*-1 = -1, and one pair will be +1*+1 = +1. So, sum of products is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Therefore, energy is -J*(-1) = J. Similarly, if two spins are -1 and one is +1, the sum of products is again -1, leading to energy J.

If all spins are different? Wait, but with three spins each being ±1, it's impossible to have all three different. So the possible states are:

- All spins +1: energy -3J

- All spins -1: energy -3J

- Two spins +1 and one -1 (there are 3 such states)

- Two spins -1 and one +1 (there are 3 such states)

Each of the six states (three with two +1 and one -1, three with two -1 and one +1) will have energy J. The two states with all spins aligned have energy -3J.

Therefore, total partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(J)}.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy is E = -J[sum of S_iS_j]. So when we compute e^{-βE}, it's e^{βJ[sum S_iS_j]}.

But the energies are either -3J or J, so:

For all aligned spins (either all +1 or all -1), E = -3J. So e^{-βE} = e^{β*3J}.

For the states with two spins aligned and one opposite (six states), E = J. So e^{-βE} = e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, since each spin configuration is counted once, and there are 8 total states. But according to the above analysis, 2 + 6 = 8 states. So that's correct.

Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me check:

Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{βJ}(e^{2βJ} + 3e^{-2βJ}) )? Let's see:

2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). Hmm, maybe that's a way to write it, but perhaps the original form is acceptable.

Alternatively, note that 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} can be written as 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, factor 2e^{-βJ}:

2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). Let's check:

2e^{-βJ} * e^{4βJ} = 2e^{3βJ}; 2e^{-βJ} * 3 = 6e^{-βJ}. Correct.

So, Z = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3) = 2(e^{4βJ} + 3)e^{-βJ} = 2(e^{3βJ} + 3e^{-βJ}).

But both forms are equivalent. The question is to "find the partition function Z of the system." So either form is acceptable, but perhaps the simplest is 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} or 2(e^{3βJ} + 3e^{-βJ}).

Alternatively, maybe we can check by another method.

Let me try to compute the partition function by considering variables. Let me note that the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see if there's a smarter way to compute the sum over all possible S1, S2, S3.

Note that S1, S2, S3 each take values ±1.

The partition function is Z = sum_{S1, S2, S3} exp(-βE) = sum_{S1, S2, S3} exp(βJ(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)).

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity that for variables taking values ±1, we can use properties of products. Let me think.

Alternatively, notice that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let me compute:

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = S1(S2 + S3) + S2S3.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Let's compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i^2 = 1, this is 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2.

So, substituting into the energy, E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ].

Therefore, the exponent in the partition function becomes:

βJ [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ] = (βJ/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 )

Therefore, Z = sum_{S1, S2, S3} exp( (βJ/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) )

But since (S1 + S2 + S3) can take values from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Let's check possible values:

Each spin is ±1, so the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be:

- All three spins +1: 3

- Two +1, one -1: 1

- One +1, two -1: -1

- All three -1: -3

But wait, when you sum three spins each ±1, the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3. Let me confirm:

If all three are +1: 3

Two +1, one -1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1

One +1, two -1: 1 -1 -1 = -1

All three -1: -3

Therefore, the possible values of (S1 + S2 + S3) are 3, 1, -1, -3. Then, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 can be 9, 1, 1, 9. So, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 is either 9 or 1.

Therefore, the exponent becomes (βJ/2)(x^2 - 3), where x^2 is either 9 or 1.

So, for x^2 = 9: (βJ/2)(9 - 3) = (βJ/2)(6) = 3βJ

For x^2 = 1: (βJ/2)(1 - 3) = (βJ/2)(-2) = -βJ

Therefore, the energy exponent is either 3βJ or -βJ, which matches our earlier calculation.

Moreover, the number of states with x^2 = 9 (i.e., sum ±3) is 2 (all +1 or all -1). The number of states with x^2 = 1 (sum ±1) is 6 (three states with two +1 and one -1, and three states with two -1 and one +1).

Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}, which confirms the earlier result.

Alternatively, if we use the variable substitution:

Let me compute the number of states for each possible value of (S1 + S2 + S3):

- Sum = 3: 1 state (all +1)

- Sum = 1: 3 states (two +1, one -1)

- Sum = -1: 3 states (two -1, one +1)

- Sum = -3: 1 state (all -1)

But (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 is the same for sum = 3 and sum = -3 (both 9), and for sum = 1 and sum = -1 (both 1). Therefore, grouping them:

Number of states with x^2 = 9: 2

Number of states with x^2 = 1: 6

Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

So, this method arrives at the same conclusion. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}, which can also be written as 2(e^{3βJ} + 3e^{-βJ}).

Alternatively, perhaps factor 2e^{-βJ}:

Z = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3). Let me check:

2e^{-βJ} * e^{4βJ} = 2e^{3βJ}

2e^{-βJ} * 3 = 6e^{-βJ}

Yes, so that's correct. So, depending on how we present it, but the answer is either of these forms.

Alternatively, if we use hyperbolic functions, but I don't think that would simplify it here. Let's check:

e^{3βJ} + 3e^{-βJ} = e^{βJ}(e^{2βJ} + 3e^{-2βJ})

But perhaps not particularly useful.

Alternatively, if we set x = βJ, then Z = 2e^{3x} + 6e^{-x}

But the problem says to present the answer with β, J, so the most straightforward answer is 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, to make sure, let's compute it step by step:

List all possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = -3J, weight e^{3βJ}

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: E = J, weight e^{-βJ}

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: E = -3J, weight e^{3βJ}

Therefore, summing up:

Two states with weight e^{3βJ} and six states with weight e^{-βJ}

Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

This seems correct. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

**Final Answer**
The partition function of the system is \boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}.

Then, the other 6 states (since 8 total - 2 = 6) have two spins of one kind and one of the opposite. Each of these 6 states has energy J. Wait, but when I considered two +1 and one -1, there are 3 choose 1 = 3 states (choosing which spin is -1). Similarly, two -1 and one +1, also 3 states. So 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy J, and 2 states with energy -3J. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-βE). So, for the two states with energy -3J, their contribution is 2 * exp(-β*(-3J)) = 2 exp(3βJ). For the six states with energy J, their contribution is 6 * exp(-β*J). Therefore, Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ). Let me verify this.\n\nWait, let me check again. If E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ], then for all three spins +1, the sum inside the brackets is 1+1+1=3, so E = -3J, so exp(-βE) = exp(3βJ). Similarly, for two +1 and one -1, the sum inside the brackets is 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 1*1 = -1. Wait, no. Wait, let's compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for two +1 and one -1.\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = +1*+1=+1, S1S3=+1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=+1*(-1)=-1. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = +J. So exp(-βE) = exp(-βJ). Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, say S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1, then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1, sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Hence E=+J again. Therefore, all 6 states where the spins are not all aligned have energy +J, so their contribution is 6*exp(-βJ). The two aligned states have energy -3J, so their contribution is 2*exp(3βJ).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we consider all possible configurations of the spins and their corresponding energies.

1. **Possible configurations and energies:**
   - **All spins aligned (either all +1 or all -1):** There are 2 such configurations. The energy for each is \( E = -3J \).
   - **Two spins +1 and one -1 or two spins -1 and one +1:** There are 6 such configurations (3 ways to choose the position of the -1 in the first case and 3 ways in the second). The energy for each is \( E = J \).

2. **Calculating the partition function:**
   - For the 2 configurations with energy \( -3J \):
     \[
     2 \exp(-\beta(-3J)) = 2 \exp(3\beta J)
     \]
   - For the 6 configurations with energy \( J \):
     \[
     6 \exp(-\beta J)
     \]

3. **Summing contributions:**
   \[
   Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J)
   \]

Thus, the partition function is \(\boxed{Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}\).

Therefore, the possible energies are -3J and +J. Let's check how many states correspond to each energy. All spins the same: all +1 or all -1. That's 2 states. Then, the other 6 states (since 8 total - 2 = 6) have two spins of one kind and one of the opposite. Each of these 6 states has energy J. Wait, but when I considered two +1 and one -1, there are 3 choose 1 = 3 states (choosing which spin is -1). Similarly, two -1 and one +1, also 3 states. So 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy J, and 2 states with energy -3J. That's correct.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-βE). So, for the two states with energy -3J, their contribution is 2 * exp(-β*(-3J)) = 2 exp(3βJ). For the six states with energy J, their contribution is 6 * exp(-β*J). Therefore, Z = 2 exp(3βJ) + 6 exp(-βJ). Let me verify this.

Wait, let me check again. If E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ], then for all three spins +1, the sum inside the brackets is 1+1+1=3, so E = -3J, so exp(-βE) = exp(3βJ). Similarly, for two +1 and one -1, the sum inside the brackets is 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 1*1 = -1. Wait, no. Wait, let's compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for two +1 and one -1.

Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = +1*+1=+1, S1S3=+1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=+1*(-1)=-1. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Then E = -J*(-1) = +J. So exp(-βE) = exp(-βJ). Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, say S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1, then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1, sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Hence E=+J again. Therefore, all 6 states where the spins are not all aligned have energy +J, so their contribution is 6*exp(-βJ). The two aligned states have energy -3J, so their contribution is 2*exp(3βJ). Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. So that's the partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this by enumerating all 8 states and confirm. Let's try that.

The three spins S1, S2, S3 can each be +1 or -1. Let's list all possible configurations:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, compute energy for each:

1. S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 1+1+1=3 => E = -3J
2. S1S2 =1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 => sum =1-1-1=-1 => E=J
3. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 => sum=-1+1-1=-1 => E=J
4. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 => sum=-1-1+1=-1 => E=J
5. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 => same as 4? Wait, no. Let's check.

Wait, state 5 is (-1, +1, +1). Then S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1, S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 => E=J.

6. (-1, +1, -1): S1S2 = (-1)(+1)=-1, S1S3=(-1)(-1)=+1, S2S3=(+1)(-1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 => E=J.

7. (-1, -1, +1): S1S2=+1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1. Sum: +1 -1 -1=-1 => E=J.

8. (-1, -1, -1): All products are +1, sum=3 => E=-3J.

So indeed, states 1 and 8 have energy -3J, and states 2-7 (6 states) have energy J. So the partition function is indeed 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, the answer is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

But let me check once more for possible miscalculations. For example, in state 4: (+1, -1, -1). Then,

S1S2 = +1*(-1) = -1,

S1S3 = +1*(-1) = -1,

S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = +1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So energy E=J. Correct.

Similarly, state 7: (-1, -1, +1). S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3=(-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)(+1)=-1. Sum=1 -1 -1=-1. E=J. Correct.

Therefore, all six states with one spin different from the others have energy J, and the two fully aligned states have energy -3J. So the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recall that the partition function is the sum over all microstates of exp(-βE). Each term here is accounted for, so this should be the correct result.

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}.
