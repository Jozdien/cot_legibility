Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in the eigenstate \(|+z\rangle\) of \(S_z\) with the magnetic field aligned along the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes \(H = -\gamma B S_y\). The state of the particle remains \(|+z\rangle\) immediately after the switch and evolves under the new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution operator is \(U(t) = \exp(-i H t / \hbar)\). For the Hamiltonian \(H = -\gamma B S_y\), this operator can be expressed using the Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) and results in a rotation around the Y-axis. The state at time \(t\) is given by:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y\right) |+z\rangle
\]

Expressing \(|+z\rangle\) in terms of the eigenstates of \(S_y\) (which are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\)), we have:

\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle)
\]

The time-evolved state is:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+y\rangle + \exp\left(-i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-y\rangle \right)
\]

To find the expectation value of \(S_z\), we note that \(S_z\) in the Y-basis is \(\frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x\). Calculating the expectation value:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
\]

The oscillation frequency of \(\langle S_z \rangle\) is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is \(\gamma B t\). Therefore, the angular frequency is \(\gamma B\).

\[
\boxed{\gamma B}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this problem about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times the z-component of the spin, Sz. Initially, it's aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied to a particle with a magnetic moment, the Hamiltonian is given by H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ B S_z. Since the particle is aligned with this field, I suppose it's in the eigenstate of S_z. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. Since the particle is "aligned" with the field, it's probably in the |+z> state initially. That makes sense because the magnetic moment would be pointing in the same direction as the field.

But then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off along Z and turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -γ B S_y. The particle is now under the influence of a magnetic field in the Y direction, so its Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Now, the state of the particle just before the switch is |+z>, and after the switch, the Hamiltonian changes to H_final. Since the change is sudden, the state doesn't have time to evolve during the switch; it remains |+z> at t=0 when the field changes. Then, for t > 0, the state evolves according to the new Hamiltonian H_final.

So, to find the time evolution of the state, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation with H = -γ B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Therefore, the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>.

Once we have |ψ(t)>, we can compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>. The question states that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

Alright, let's break it down. Let me recall the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle. The Pauli matrices are useful here. In matrix form, S_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], S_y = (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], S_z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So H_final = -γ B S_y = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let's note that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the time evolution will involve rotations around the Y-axis.

The initial state |+z> can be written as a column vector: |+z> = [1, 0]^T. So we need to apply the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) to this state.

First, let's compute H_final / ħ. Since H_final = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], dividing by ħ gives H_final / ħ = -γ B (1/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let's denote ω = γ B, so H_final / ħ = -ω/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Therefore, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) = exp(i ω t/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]] / 1). Wait, actually, H_final t / ħ is (-γ B S_y / ħ) t. Let me re-express this. Since S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, then H_final = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, H_final t / ħ = (-γ B t / 2) σ_y. Therefore, U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) = exp(i (γ B t / 2) σ_y). Hmm, okay.

The exponential of a Pauli matrix can be expanded using the formula: exp(i θ σ_j) = I cosθ + i σ_j sinθ. So in this case, θ = γ B t / 2. Therefore, U(t) = I cos(γ B t / 2) + i σ_y sin(γ B t / 2). Let's write that out in matrix form. σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so multiplying by i gives [[0,1],[-1,0]]. Therefore, U(t) = [[cos(γ B t / 2), sin(γ B t / 2)], [-sin(γ B t / 2), cos(γ B t / 2)]]. Wait, let's check that. If we have exp(i θ σ_y) = I cosθ + i σ_y sinθ. Let me compute:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

i σ_y = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]

So exp(i θ σ_y) = [[cosθ, sinθ], [-sinθ, cosθ]]

Yes, that's correct. So U(t) is [[cos(ω t / 2), sin(ω t / 2)], [-sin(ω t / 2), cos(ω t / 2)]], where ω = γ B.

Therefore, applying U(t) to the initial state |+z> = [1, 0]^T gives:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Wait, hold on. Let's make sure. The first component is cos(ω t / 2)*1 + sin(ω t / 2)*0 = cos(ω t / 2). The second component is -sin(ω t / 2)*1 + cos(ω t / 2)*0 = -sin(ω t / 2). So yes, the state becomes [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Now, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z in this state. S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So <S_z> = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)] * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Let me compute this. The first component is (ħ/2)( |cos(ω t / 2)|^2 * 1 + | - sin(ω t / 2)|^2 * (-1) ). Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is ψ† S_z ψ. So:

ψ = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

ψ† = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)].

Then ψ† S_z ψ = (ħ/2) [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)] [[1,0],[0,-1]] [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Multiplying the matrix with the vector:

First component: 1 * cos(ω t / 2) + 0 * (-sin(ω t / 2)) = cos(ω t / 2)

Second component: 0 * cos(ω t / 2) + (-1) * (-sin(ω t / 2)) = sin(ω t / 2)

Then take the dot product with [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]:

cos(ω t / 2) * cos(ω t / 2) + (-sin(ω t / 2)) * sin(ω t / 2) = cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2)

Which is equal to cos(ω t) using the double angle formula. Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

But the problem mentions the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(ω t) = (gamma ħ / 2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B divided by 2π, but usually frequencies are given in angular terms, which is omega = gamma B. Wait, but in the cosine function, the argument is omega t, so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B/(2π). Wait, but let me check.

Wait, the time dependence is cos(gamma B t). The angular frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine, so angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the frequency f is omega/(2π) = gamma B/(2π). However, in physics, sometimes when they say "frequency" without specifying, they might mean the angular frequency. But the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which usually refers to the ordinary frequency (Hz), not angular frequency (rad/s). But let me check the context.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about energy differences leading to frequencies via E = ħ omega, the omega here is the angular frequency. The energy levels here are split by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian in the Y-direction will cause transitions between eigenstates of S_y, but the initial state is a superposition of those eigenstates. The time evolution leads to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z with a frequency corresponding to the energy difference divided by ħ.

Wait, in this case, the energy levels for the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y are E = -gamma B * eigenvalues of S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are +/- ħ/2, so the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. Therefore, the frequency associated with this energy difference is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is omega = gamma B, so the ordinary frequency is gamma B/(2pi). But the problem says "oscillation frequency", and in quantum mechanics contexts, sometimes angular frequency is referred to as frequency. But the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" So I need to check if they want angular frequency or ordinary frequency.

Looking back at the problem statement: it's a physics problem, likely from a quantum mechanics course or textbook. In such contexts, when they ask for the frequency of oscillation in the expectation value, they usually mean the angular frequency, since that's directly related to the energy difference (omega = Delta E / ħ). So here, the energy difference between the eigenstates of S_y is Delta E = gamma B ħ. Therefore, omega = Delta E / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the angular frequency is gamma B, so the answer is gamma B. However, let's confirm this with the calculation we did earlier.

From the expectation value <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). So the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. If they wanted the ordinary frequency, it's gamma B/(2pi), but I think given the context, it's more likely they want the angular frequency. However, let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The units of oscillation frequency in Hz would be 1/s, while angular frequency is rad/s. However, in the expression cos(gamma B t), the argument is in radians if gamma B is in rad/s. The gyromagnetic ratio gamma has units of (rad/s)/T (if B is in Tesla), so gamma B would have units of rad/s. Therefore, the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is that the oscillation frequency is gamma B divided by 2pi, but depending on the convention.

Wait, no. Wait, gamma is defined here as the gyromagnetic ratio, which relates the magnetic moment to the spin: mu = gamma S_z. The units of mu are J/T (joules per tesla), S_z is in units of ħ (dimensionless, since spin is dimensionless, but when multiplied by ħ/2 gives units of angular momentum). Wait, actually, S_z has units of ħ, since spin is in units of ħ. So mu = gamma S_z, so gamma has units of (J/T)/(ħ) ) = (J/T)/(J·s)) ) = 1/(T·s). Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is defined such that the Larmor frequency omega = gamma B. So gamma is the ratio of the angular frequency to the magnetic field. Therefore, gamma has units of rad/(s·T). Therefore, when multiplied by B (Tesla), gives rad/s. Therefore, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer is that the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So in terms of ordinary frequency, it's gamma B / (2pi), but unless specified, in physics, especially in quantum mechanics, when talking about transitions and expectation values oscillating, we refer to the angular frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations are often stated in terms of angular frequency.

But let me check the calculation again. From the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The time dependence is cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Suppose we go into the rotating frame. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution is governed by this Hamiltonian. The state |+z> can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

The states |+y> and |-y> are given by:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

Let me invert the above equations. Multiply the first by 1/sqrt(2) and add:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-z> = -i (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of H_final (since H_final is proportional to S_y). Therefore, when we express the state in terms of |+y> and |-y>, each component will pick up a phase factor over time.

The time evolution of each eigenstate is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z> = exp(-i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ) |+z>

Wait, no, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). Since H = -gamma B S_y, then H t / ħ = (-gamma B S_y t)/ħ. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ).

But since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, then:

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |+y> = exp(i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ) |+y> = exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y>

Similarly,

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |-y> = exp(i gamma B (-ħ/2) t / ħ) |-y> = exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y>

Therefore, the time-evolved state is:

|psi(t)> = exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Therefore, this can be rewritten as:

= [ |+y> exp(i gamma B t / 2) + |-y> exp(-i gamma B t / 2) ] / sqrt(2)

Now, to compute <S_z>, we can express S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> states. Alternatively, we can express |psi(t)> back in the z-basis and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, let's compute <S_z> using the |+y> and |-y> basis.

First, note that S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y> can be found by expressing S_z in terms of the y-basis.

From earlier, we have:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-z> = -i (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, S_z in the z-basis is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. To express S_z in the y-basis, we can use the transformation matrix. Let me compute S_z in the y-basis.

Let me denote the transformation matrix U that takes us from the z-basis to the y-basis. The columns of U are the y-basis vectors expressed in the z-basis.

So U = 1/sqrt(2) [[1, 1], [i, -i]]

Then, S_z in the y-basis is U† S_z U.

Calculating this:

First, compute U†:

U† = 1/sqrt(2) [[1, -i], [1, i]]

Then, S_z in the y-basis is U† S_z U = (ħ/2) U† [[1,0],[0,-1]] U

Compute this product step by step.

First, multiply [[1,0],[0,-1]] by U:

[[1,0],[0,-1]] * U = 1/sqrt(2) [[1*1 + 0*i, 1*1 + 0*(-i)], [0*1 + (-1)*i, 0*1 + (-1)*(-i)]]

Wait, no. Matrix multiplication: [[1,0],[0,-1]] * U:

First row: 1*column1 of U, 1*column2 of U

Wait, no. Let me do it properly.

The matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]] is diagonal, so multiplying by U on the right scales each column by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication is rows times columns. So the first row of [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [1, 0], which when multiplied by U gives the first row of the product as 1*(first column of U) + 0*(second column of U) = first column of U.

Similarly, the second row of [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [0, -1], so multiplying by U gives 0*(first column) + (-1)*(second column) = -second column of U.

Therefore, [[1,0],[0,-1]] * U = 1/sqrt(2) [ [1, 1], [-i, i] ]

Then, multiply by U†:

U† is 1/sqrt(2) [[1, -i], [1, i]]

So the product U† [[1,0],[0,-1]] U is (1/2) [[1, -i], [1, i]] * [ [1, 1], [-i, i] ]

Computing the first row of the first matrix times the first column of the second matrix:

1*1 + (-i)*(-i) = 1 + (-i)(-i) = 1 + (i^2) = 1 - 1 = 0

First row, second column:

1*1 + (-i)*i = 1 + (-i^2) = 1 - (-1) = 2

Second row, first column:

1*1 + i*(-i) = 1 + (-i^2) = 1 - (-1) = 2

Second row, second column:

1*1 + i*i = 1 + i^2 = 1 -1 = 0

Therefore, the product is (1/2)[[0, 2], [2, 0]] = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Therefore, S_z in the y-basis is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Therefore, in the y-basis, S_z is represented by (ħ/2) σ_x.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_z> in the state |psi(t)> is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the state [exp(i gamma B t / 2), exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] / sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, |psi(t)> is expressed in the y-basis as [exp(i gamma B t / 2), exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] / sqrt(2). Therefore, to compute <S_z>, which in the y-basis is (ħ/2) σ_x, we need to compute:

<psi(t)| (ħ/2) σ_x |psi(t)>.

So, let's compute this. The state |psi(t)> in the y-basis is:

1/sqrt(2) [exp(i gamma B t / 2), exp(-i gamma B t / 2)]^T.

So, the bra vector is 1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i gamma B t / 2), exp(i gamma B t / 2)].

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σ_x |psi(t)> is 1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i gamma B t / 2), exp(i gamma B t / 2)]^T.

Then, the inner product <psi(t)| σ_x |psi(t)> is:

1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i gamma B t / 2), exp(i gamma B t / 2)] * 1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i gamma B t / 2), exp(i gamma B t / 2)]^T

= (1/2)[ exp(-i gamma B t / 2) * exp(-i gamma B t / 2) + exp(i gamma B t / 2) * exp(i gamma B t / 2) ]

= (1/2)[ exp(-i gamma B t) + exp(i gamma B t) ]

= (1/2)(2 cos(gamma B t)) = cos(gamma B t)

Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), which matches our previous result. Therefore, the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Alternatively, if we consider the time between peaks in the oscillation, the period T is 2pi/(gamma B), so the frequency is 1/T = gamma B/(2pi). However, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about the frequency of oscillation in the expectation value, it's standard to refer to the angular frequency. For example, in the Rabi oscillation formula, the Rabi frequency is given as omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency.

Therefore, the answer should be the angular frequency gamma B. Hence, the oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Okay, so there's this problem about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times the z-component of the spin, Sz. Initially, it's aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied to a particle with a magnetic moment, the Hamiltonian is given by H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ B S_z. Since the particle is aligned with this field, I suppose it's in the eigenstate of S_z. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. Since the particle is "aligned" with the field, it's probably in the |+z> state initially. That makes sense because the magnetic moment would be pointing in the same direction as the field.

But then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off along Z and turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -γ B S_y. The particle is now under the influence of a magnetic field in the Y direction, so its Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Now, the state of the particle just before the switch is |+z>, and after the switch, the Hamiltonian changes to H_final. Since the change is sudden, the state doesn't have time to evolve during the switch; it remains |+z> at t=0 when the field changes. Then, for t > 0, the state evolves according to the new Hamiltonian H_final.

So, to find the time evolution of the state, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation with H = -γ B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Therefore, the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>.

Once we have |ψ(t)>, we can compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>. The question states that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

Alright, let's break it down. Let me recall the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle. The Pauli matrices are useful here. In matrix form, S_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], S_y = (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], S_z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So H_final = -γ B S_y = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let's note that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the time evolution will involve rotations around the Y-axis.

The initial state |+z> can be written as a column vector: |+z> = [1, 0]^T. So we need to apply the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) to this state.

First, let's compute H_final / ħ. Since H_final = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], dividing by ħ gives H_final / ħ = -γ B (1/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let's denote ω = γ B, so H_final / ħ = -ω/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Therefore, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) = exp(i ω t/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]] / 1). Wait, actually, H_final t / ħ is (-γ B S_y / ħ) t. Let me re-express this. Since S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, then H_final = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, H_final t / ħ = (-γ B t / 2) σ_y. Therefore, U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) = exp(i (γ B t / 2) σ_y). Hmm, okay.

The exponential of a Pauli matrix can be expanded using the formula: exp(i θ σ_j) = I cosθ + i σ_j sinθ. So in this case, θ = γ B t / 2. Therefore, U(t) = I cos(γ B t / 2) + i σ_y sin(γ B t / 2). Let's write that out in matrix form. σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so multiplying by i gives [[0,1],[-1,0]]. Therefore, U(t) = [[cos(γ B t / 2), sin(γ B t / 2)], [-sin(γ B t / 2), cos(γ B t / 2)]]. Wait, let's check that. If we have exp(i θ σ_y) = I cosθ + i σ_y sinθ. Let me compute:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

i σ_y = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]

So exp(i θ σ_y) = [[cosθ, sinθ], [-sinθ, cosθ]]

Yes, that's correct. So U(t) is [[cos(ω t / 2), sin(ω t / 2)], [-sin(ω t / 2), cos(ω t / 2)]], where ω = γ B.

Therefore, applying U(t) to the initial state |+z> = [1, 0]^T gives:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Wait, hold on. Let's make sure. The first component is cos(ω t / 2)*1 + sin(ω t / 2)*0 = cos(ω t / 2). The second component is -sin(ω t / 2)*1 + cos(ω t / 2)*0 = -sin(ω t / 2). So yes, th

# Anthropic completion

In this problem, we're examining a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment μ, which equals γ times the z-component of spin, Sz. Initially, the particle is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, this magnetic field is switched off and a new one of equal magnitude B is applied along the +Y direction. We need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

I'll approach this methodically. When a magnetic field acts on a particle with magnetic moment, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B · S, where γ represents the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. Initially, with the field along +Z, the Hamiltonian is Hinitial = -γ B Sz. Since the particle aligns with this field, it must be in the |+z⟩ eigenstate of Sz, with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for a spin-1/2 particle.

When the magnetic field suddenly switches to the Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes Hfinal = -γ B Sy. Because the change happens abruptly, the particle's state remains |+z⟩ at t=0, and then evolves according to the new Hamiltonian for t>0.

To find this evolution, I need to solve the Schrödinger equation with H = -γ B Sy. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ), making the state at time t: |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |+z⟩.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators relate to Pauli matrices: Sx = (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], Sy = (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and Sz = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. Therefore, Hfinal = -γ B (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]].

The initial state |+z⟩ is represented as [1, 0]T. Computing Hfinal/ħ gives us -γ B (1/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]. If we denote ω = γ B, then Hfinal/ħ = -ω/2[[0,-i],[i,0]].

Using the formula exp(i θ σj) = I cosθ + i σj sinθ for exponentials of Pauli matrices, with θ = γ B t / 2, we get U(t) = I cos(γ B t / 2) + i σy sin(γ B t / 2). In matrix form, this is U(t) = [[cos(ω t / 2), sin(ω t / 2)], [-sin(ω t / 2), cos(ω t / 2)]].

Applying U(t) to |+z⟩ yields |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]T.

There is a problem involving a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment μ, which is γ times the z-component of the spin, S_z. Initially, this particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, the field is suddenly switched off and replaced with a new one in the +Y direction, both having the same magnitude B. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Let’s consider this systematically.

First, when a magnetic field is affecting a particle with a magnetic moment, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S represents the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field is aligned along +Z, resulting in H_initial = -γ B S_z. Since the particle aligns with this field, it must be in the eigenstate of S_z. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. Being "aligned" indicates that the particle is initially in the |+z> state, which makes sense as the magnetic moment aligns with the field.

Subsequently, the magnetic field along Z is turned off, and another is turned on along Y. This changes the Hamiltonian to H_final = -γ B S_y, as the magnetic field now points in the Y direction. At this point, the particle, originally in the |+z> state, undergoes a sudden field switch, remaining in the |+z> state at t=0. For t > 0, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian H_final.

To find how the state evolves over time, we solve the Schrödinger equation with H = -γ B S_y. The time evolution operator is given by U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Therefore, the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>.

Once |ψ(t)> is determined, we can calculate the expectation value of S_z, given by <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>. The problem specifies that this expectation value oscillates, and we're tasked with finding the oscillation frequency.

Let's delve into it. For a spin-1/2 particle, the Pauli matrices are handy. S_x, S_y, and S_z can be represented as (ħ/2) multiplied by the corresponding matrices. Hence, H_final = -γ B S_y = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. The Hamiltonian implies the time evolution involves rotations around the Y-axis.

The initial state |+z> is the column vector [1, 0]^T. Applying the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) to this state requires calculating H_final / ħ. Since H_final = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], dividing by ħ gives H_final / ħ = -γ B (1/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let’s set ω = γ B, which results in H_final / ħ = -ω/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Thus, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) = exp(i ω t/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]]).

The formula for the exponential of a Pauli matrix is exp(i θ σ_j) = I cosθ + i σ_j sinθ, where θ = γ B t / 2. Consequently, U(t) = I cos(γ B t / 2) + i σ_y sin(γ B t / 2). In matrix form, σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], so i σ_y = [[0,1],[-1,0]]. Therefore, U(t) is [[cos(γ B t / 2), sin(γ B t / 2)], [-sin(γ B t / 2), cos(γ B t / 2)]].

So, by applying U(t) to |+z> = [1, 0]^T, we get:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

After rechecking, the components are correct: the first term is cos(ω t / 2)*1 + sin(ω t / 2)*0 = cos(ω t / 2), and the second is -sin(ω t / 2)*1 + cos(ω t / 2)*0 = -sin(ω t / 2).

Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t)\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(ω t), where ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is ω/(2π) = γ B / (2π). But wait, in the expression for <S_z>, the argument of the cosine is ω t, so the angular frequency is ω = γ B. Therefore, the frequency f is ω/(2π) = γ B / (2π). But in physics, sometimes we refer to angular frequency as just "frequency" in radians per second. The question says "oscillation frequency", which is usually the cyclic frequency (Hz), so f = γ B / (2π). However, sometimes in quantum mechanics, frequencies are given as angular frequencies. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" So they might be asking for angular frequency. Let me verify.\n\nThe time dependence is cos(γ B t), so the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz would be γ B / (2π). However, let\'s see what the problem expects. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma here is the gyromagnetic ratio. The energy levels are proportional to the magnetic field, and the transition frequency between them is gamma B. For example, for a spin in a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency here, which is the angular frequency, is gamma B. The problem might be expecting that as the answer.\n\nBut let\'s make sure. Let\'s recall that when you have a spin precessing in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. In this case, when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin precesses around the Y-axis. However, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating because the spin is rotating around Y, causing the z-component to oscillate. The frequency of that oscillation should be the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. So in the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, so the frequency is omega/(2pi). But the problem doesn\'t specify whether it wants angular frequency or regular frequency. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the question, the magnetic fields have the same magnitude B. The original Hamiltonian was H = -gamma B S_z, and after the switch, it\'s H = -gamma B S_y. The energy difference between eigenstates for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field is 2 gamma B (ħ/2) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency associated with that energy difference is (gamma B ħ)/ħ = gamma B. So that\'s the angular frequency. Therefore, if the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of <S_z>, which is cos(omega t), then the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. However, if they want the frequency in Hz, it\'s gamma B / (2pi). But in most quantum mechanics contexts, especially when dealing with expectation values oscillating, the angular frequency is usually referred to as the frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations are often quoted with their angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The answer is probably the angular frequency, so gamma B. However, let me verify with the calculation. From the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the period is 2pi / (gamma B). Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2pi). But maybe in the problem\'s context, since it\'s about quantum mechanics, they might be expecting the angular frequency. But I need to check.\n\nWait, the problem mentions "oscillation frequency". In physics, when someone says "frequency" without specifying, they usually mean the cyclic frequency (Hz), unless they specify angular frequency. However, in quantum mechanics, sometimes people use angular frequency. Let me see.\n\nThe energy levels of the system after the field is switched to Y are given by H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is Delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency associated with this transition is Delta E / ħ = gamma B. So that is the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in <S_z> is given by this energy difference, leading to angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer is omega = gamma B. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency, which is indeed gamma B. So I think that\'s the answer they are looking for.\n\nBut let\'s just recapitulate. The time evolution of the state after the field is switched to Y is a precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with the angular frequency equal to the energy difference divided by ħ, which is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nWait, but let me check again the steps. The time evolution operator was U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). The Hamiltonian here is H = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Therefore, H t / ħ = -gamma B t (sigma_y)/2. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i gamma B t sigma_y / 2). Using the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, this becomes cos(gamma B t / 2) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t / 2). Then, when we act this on the initial state |+z> = [1; 0], we get the state [cos(gamma B t / 2); -sin(gamma B t / 2)]. Then, when we compute <S_z>, which is (ħ/2)(|c1|^2 - |c2|^2), where c1 and c2 are the components. Wait, actually, no. The expectation value is (ħ/2)(|c1|^2 - |c2|^2). But |c1|^2 is cos^2(gamma B t / 2), |c2|^2 is sin^2(gamma B t / 2). Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2)(cos^2(gamma B t / 2) - sin^2(gamma B t / 2)) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, which matches our previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma B. If they want the frequency in Hz, it\'s gamma B / (2pi). But given that gamma is often expressed in terms of angular frequency per tesla, the answer is likely gamma B as the angular frequency. However, let\'s check units. If gamma has units of Hz/T (which is common, sometimes gamma is given as rad/s/T), but in the problem, gamma is just given as a proportionality constant in mu = gamma S_z. So mu has units of magnetic moment, S_z has units of ħ (since spin is in units of ħ), so gamma has units of magnetic moment / ħ. Then, gamma B has units of (magnetic moment * B) / ħ. The magnetic moment times B is energy, so gamma B has units of energy / ħ, which is 1/time, which is angular frequency. So yes, gamma B is an angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut the problem says "oscillation frequency". In standard terms, oscillation frequency is usually the number of cycles per second, which is omega / (2pi). But in quantum mechanics, sometimes people just say frequency when they mean angular frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is often quoted as omega = gamma B, which is angular frequency. So given that the problem is in a quantum mechanics context, they probably expect the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the time evolution, the period T is 2pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is gamma B / (2pi). But in the expression for <S_z>, we have cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, which is the coefficient multiplying t inside the cosine. So if the question is asking for the angular frequency, then gamma B. If it\'s asking for the cyclic frequency, then gamma B / (2pi). But since the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of quantum mechanics and spin precession, I think they mean the angular frequency. For example, when you have a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it precesses with the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. So the answer is likely gamma B.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let\'s use the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of the spin operator S_z can be found by solving the Heisenberg equation of motion. The Heisenberg equation is dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Therefore, [H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x) (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k). Therefore, [H, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x). Therefore, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)(-gamma B i ħ S_x) = gamma B S_x.\n\nSimilarly, dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_x]) = (i/ħ)(-gamma B (-i ħ S_z)) = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z) = -gamma B S_z.\n\nAnd dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_y]) = 0.\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\ndS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z\n\ndS_y/dt = 0\n\nThis is similar to the equations of motion for angular momentum in a magnetic field. Let me write these as:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = -gamma² B² S_z\n\nSo, the differential equation for S_z is d²S_z/dt² + gamma² B² S_z = 0. This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of S_z is gamma B. Therefore, the angular frequency is gamma B. So even in the Heisenberg picture, we arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) of the average z-component of the particle\'s moment is gamma B. So the answer is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe oscillation frequency is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387047, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3346, prompt_tokens=1503, total_tokens=4849, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in the eigenstate \(|+z\rangle\) of \(S_z\) due to the magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \(H = -\gamma B S_y\). The state of the particle evolves under this new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution operator is \(U(t) = \exp(-i H t / \hbar)\). For \(H = -\gamma B S_y\), this operator can be expressed using the Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) as \(U(t) = \exp(i (\gamma B t / 2) \sigma_y)\). Applying this operator to the initial state \(|+z\rangle = [1, 0]^T\) results in the state:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\gamma B t / 2) \\ -\sin(\gamma B t / 2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value of \(S_z\) is calculated as:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2(\gamma B t / 2) - \sin^2(\gamma B t / 2) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
\]

This shows that the expectation value of \(S_z\) oscillates with angular frequency \(\gamma B\). Using the Heisenberg picture, the equations of motion for \(S_z\) confirm that the oscillation frequency is indeed \(\gamma B\).

Thus, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

ψ(t) = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Now, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z in this state. S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So <S_z> = ψ(t)† S_z ψ(t). Let's compute that.

First, write ψ(t) as a column vector:
[cos(ω t / 2)]
[-sin(ω t / 2)]

Then, ψ(t)† is [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]

Multiplying S_z (which is (ħ/2) diag(1, -1)) into ψ(t):

S_z ψ(t) = (ħ/2) [cos(ω t / 2), sin(ω t / 2)]^T

Then, ψ(t)† S_z ψ(t) = (ħ/2) [cos^2(ω t / 2) - sin^2(ω t / 2)]

Wait, let's compute it step by step. ψ(t)† S_z ψ(t) = [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)] * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T

First, multiply the matrix S_z with the vector:

[[1,0],[0,-1]] * [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T = [cos(ω t / 2), sin(ω t / 2)]^T

Then, take the dot product with [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]:

cos(ω t / 2) * cos(ω t / 2) + (-sin(ω t / 2)) * sin(ω t / 2) = cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2)

Which is equal to cos(ω t) using the double-angle identity. Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t)

So the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(ω t), where ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is ω/(2π) = γ B / (2π). But wait, in the expression for <S_z>, the argument of the cosine is ω t, so the angular frequency is ω = γ B. Therefore, the frequency f is ω/(2π) = γ B / (2π). But in physics, sometimes we refer to angular frequency as just "frequency" in radians per second. The question says "oscillation frequency", which is usually the cyclic frequency (Hz), so f = γ B / (2π). However, sometimes in quantum mechanics, frequencies are given as angular frequencies. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" So they might be asking for angular frequency. Let me verify.

The time dependence is cos(γ B t), so the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz would be γ B / (2π). However, let's see what the problem expects. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma here is the gyromagnetic ratio. The energy levels are proportional to the magnetic field, and the transition frequency between them is gamma B. For example, for a spin in a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency here, which is the angular frequency, is gamma B. The problem might be expecting that as the answer.

But let's make sure. Let's recall that when you have a spin precessing in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. In this case, when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin precesses around the Y-axis. However, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating because the spin is rotating around Y, causing the z-component to oscillate. The frequency of that oscillation should be the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. So in the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, so the frequency is omega/(2pi). But the problem doesn't specify whether it wants angular frequency or regular frequency. Hmm.

Wait, in the question, the magnetic fields have the same magnitude B. The original Hamiltonian was H = -gamma B S_z, and after the switch, it's H = -gamma B S_y. The energy difference between eigenstates for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field is 2 gamma B (ħ/2) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency associated with that energy difference is (gamma B ħ)/ħ = gamma B. So that's the angular frequency. Therefore, if the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of <S_z>, which is cos(omega t), then the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. However, if they want the frequency in Hz, it's gamma B / (2pi). But in most quantum mechanics contexts, especially when dealing with expectation values oscillating, the angular frequency is usually referred to as the frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations are often quoted with their angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The answer is probably the angular frequency, so gamma B. However, let me verify with the calculation. From the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the period is 2pi / (gamma B). Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2pi). But maybe in the problem's context, since it's about quantum mechanics, they might be expecting the angular frequency. But I need to check.

Wait, the problem mentions "oscillation frequency". In physics, when someone says "frequency" without specifying, they usually mean the cyclic frequency (Hz), unless they specify angular frequency. However, in quantum mechanics, sometimes people use angular frequency. Let me see.

The energy levels of the system after the field is switched to Y are given by H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is Delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency associated with this transition is Delta E / ħ = gamma B. So that is the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in <S_z> is given by this energy difference, leading to angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the answer is omega = gamma B. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency, which is indeed gamma B. So I think that's the answer they are looking for.

But let's just recapitulate. The time evolution of the state after the field is switched to Y is a precession around the Y-axis. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with the angular frequency equal to the energy difference divided by ħ, which is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.

Wait, but let me check again the steps. The time evolution operator was U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). The Hamiltonian here is H = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Therefore, H t / ħ = -gamma B t (sigma_y)/2. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i gamma B t sigma_y / 2). Using the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, this becomes cos(gamma B t / 2) I + i sigma_y sin(gamma B t / 2). Then, when we act this on the initial state |+z> = [1; 0], we get the state [cos(gamma B t / 2); -sin(gamma B t / 2)]. Then, when we compute <S_z>, which is (ħ/2)(|c1|^2 - |c2|^2), where c1 and c2 are the components. Wait, actually, no. The expectation value is (ħ/2)(|c1|^2 - |c2|^2). But |c1|^2 is cos^2(gamma B t / 2), |c2|^2 is sin^2(gamma B t / 2). Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2)(cos^2(gamma B t / 2) - sin^2(gamma B t / 2)) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, which matches our previous conclusion.

Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma B. If they want the frequency in Hz, it's gamma B / (2pi). But given that gamma is often expressed in terms of angular frequency per tesla, the answer is likely gamma B as the angular frequency. However, let's check units. If gamma has units of Hz/T (which is common, sometimes gamma is given as rad/s/T), but in the problem, gamma is just given as a proportionality constant in mu = gamma S_z. So mu has units of magnetic moment, S_z has units of ħ (since spin is in units of ħ), so gamma has units of magnetic moment / ħ. Then, gamma B has units of (magnetic moment * B) / ħ. The magnetic moment times B is energy, so gamma B has units of energy / ħ, which is 1/time, which is angular frequency. So yes, gamma B is an angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

But the problem says "oscillation frequency". In standard terms, oscillation frequency is usually the number of cycles per second, which is omega / (2pi). But in quantum mechanics, sometimes people just say frequency when they mean angular frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is often quoted as omega = gamma B, which is angular frequency. So given that the problem is in a quantum mechanics context, they probably expect the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Alternatively, if we consider the time evolution, the period T is 2pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is gamma B / (2pi). But in the expression for <S_z>, we have cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, which is the coefficient multiplying t inside the cosine. So if the question is asking for the angular frequency, then gamma B. If it's asking for the cyclic frequency, then gamma B / (2pi). But since the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of quantum mechanics and spin precession, I think they mean the angular frequency. For example, when you have a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it precesses with the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. So the answer is likely gamma B.

But let me check with another approach. Let's use the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of the spin operator S_z can be found by solving the Heisenberg equation of motion. The Heisenberg equation is dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]. The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Therefore, [H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x) (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k). Therefore, [H, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x). Therefore, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)(-gamma B i ħ S_x) = gamma B S_x.

Similarly, dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_x]) = (i/ħ)(-gamma B (-i ħ S_z)) = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z) = -gamma B S_z.

And dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_y]) = 0.

So, we have the system of equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z

dS_y/dt = 0

This is similar to the equations of motion for angular momentum in a magnetic field. Let me write these as:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = -gamma² B² S_z

So, the differential equation for S_z is d²S_z/dt² + gamma² B² S_z = 0. This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of S_z is gamma B. Therefore, the angular frequency is gamma B. So even in the Heisenberg picture, we arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) of the average z-component of the particle's moment is gamma B. So the answer is \boxed{\gamma B}.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in the eigenstate \(|+z\rangle\) of \(S_z\) with eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \(H = -\gamma B S_y\). The time evolution of the state is governed by this new Hamiltonian.

The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + i|1\rangle)\) and \(|-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - i|1\rangle)\). The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates:
\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle)
\]

Under the new Hamiltonian, each eigenstate evolves in time with a phase factor:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle e^{-i E_+ t / \hbar} + |-y\rangle e^{-i E_- t / \hbar})
\]
where \(E_+ = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}\). Substituting these energies, we get:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle e^{i \gamma B t / 2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i \gamma B t / 2})
\]

Expressing this back in the \(S_z\) basis:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|0\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|1\rangle
\]

The expectation value of \(S_z\) is:
\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
\]

This shows that the average z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with angular frequency \(\gamma B\). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

To find the expectation value of Sz, we compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩. Since Sz is (ħ/2) diag(1, -1), the expectation value is (ħ/2)[cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2)] = (ħ/2) cos(ω t). This oscillates with frequency ω = γ B. However, since the argument of the cosine is γ B t, the frequency is γ B divided by 2π, which gives f = γ B/(2π). But typically, angular frequency ω is used here, so the oscillation frequency in terms of angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the answer should be γ B, but let me check for possible factors of 2.

Wait, in the time evolution, the exponent is H t / ħ. H is -γ B Sy, and Sy is ħ/2 σy. So H = -γ B ħ/2 σy. Therefore, H t / ħ = -γ B t / 2 σy. The exponential becomes exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B t / 2 σy). The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2, so the energy levels are E = ± γ B ħ/2. The energy difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency between states is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value should be γ B. But wait, the expectation value of Sz we found was (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). So the oscillation frequency is γ B. Hence, the answer is γ B divided by 2π if we need cyclic frequency, but since the problem says "oscillation frequency", which typically refers to angular frequency (ω), so the answer is γ B. But let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, the Larmor precession frequency when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field is ω = γ B. When the field is along Y, the spin precesses around the Y axis. The precession frequency is γ B. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate sinusoidally as the spin precesses around Y. The oscillation frequency of ⟨Sz⟩ would thus be the Larmor frequency, which is γ B. So the answer is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma times B. But let me check once more.

From the calculation above, ⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). The cosine function has angular frequency γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is γ B. So the answer is γ B. However, in some conventions, the Hamiltonian is written as H = -γ B S · n, leading to a Larmor frequency of γ B. So yes, the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B. But let me check the calculation again.

H = -γ B Sy. The energy levels are ± (1/2) γ B ħ. The time evolution of the state |+z⟩ under H is a superposition of energy eigenstates. The state |+z⟩ can be written in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, which are (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 and (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2, respectively. So |+z⟩ can be expressed as a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The time evolution will cause each component to pick up a phase factor e^{-i E t / ħ}. For |+y⟩, the phase is e^{-i (+γ B/2) t}, and for |-y⟩, e^{-i (-γ B/2) t}. The state |ψ(t)⟩ will be (|+y⟩ e^{-i γ B t /2} + |-y⟩ e^{i γ B t /2}) / √2. To compute ⟨Sz⟩, we can express Sz in terms of Sy eigenstates. Alternatively, compute it directly. Let's do that.

Express |ψ(t)⟩ as:

|ψ(t)⟩ = (|+y⟩ e^{-i γ B t /2} + |-y⟩ e^{i γ B t /2}) / √2.

But |+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2. Plugging these in:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 * e^{-i γ B t /2} + (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2 * e^{i γ B t /2} ] / √2

Multiply through:

= [ |0⟩ (e^{-i γ B t /2} + e^{i γ B t /2}) + i |1⟩ (e^{-i γ B t /2} - e^{i γ B t /2}) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula:

= [ |0⟩ * 2 cos(γ B t / 2) + i |1⟩ * (-2i) sin(γ B t / 2) ] / 2

= |0⟩ cos(γ B t / 2) + |1⟩ sin(γ B t / 2)

So |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γ B t / 2) |0⟩ + sin(γ B t / 2) |1⟩. Wait, but earlier when I did the matrix multiplication, I got |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(γ B t / 2), -sin(γ B t / 2)]^T, which is the same as cos(γ B t / 2) |0⟩ - sin(γ B t / 2) |1⟩. But here, it's cos |0⟩ + sin |1⟩. There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me check my previous calculation.

In the first approach, using U(t) = exp(i γ B t / 2 σy). The matrix is [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]] where θ = γ B t / 2. So applying this to |+z⟩ = [1, 0]^T gives [cos(θ), -sin(θ)]^T. So that's correct. However, in the second approach, when expanding in |±y⟩, I ended up with |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(θ) |0⟩ + sin(θ) |1⟩, which would correspond to [cos(θ), sin(θ)]^T. There's a sign difference. Where did I go wrong?

Let me check the expansion again. Starting with |+z⟩ expressed in terms of |±y⟩.

|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2. Wait, let's verify:

|+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2

|−y⟩ = (|0⟩ − i|1⟩)/√2

Therefore, |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩ + |0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2 = (2|0⟩)/√2 = √2 |0⟩. Therefore, |0⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2. Similarly, |+y⟩ - |-y⟩ = (2i|1⟩)/√2, so |1⟩ = (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/(i√2).

But |+z⟩ is |0⟩, so |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2. Therefore, when we time evolve, each term picks up a phase:

|ψ(t)⟩ = (|+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |-y⟩ e^{-i E_- t / ħ}) / √2

Where E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2) (since H = -γ B Sy, Sy |+y⟩ = ħ/2 |+y⟩, so E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2)

Similarly, E_- = γ B (ħ/2)

Therefore,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{i γ B t / 2} + |-y⟩ e^{-i γ B t / 2} ] / √2

Expressing this in terms of |0⟩ and |1⟩:

= [ (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 e^{i γ B t / 2} + (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2 e^{-i γ B t / 2} ] / √2

= [ |0⟩ (e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ})/2 + i |1⟩ (e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ})/2 ] * 2/√2 / √2

Wait, let's compute step by step:

First, expand each term:

First term: (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) e^{i θ} / √2

Second term: (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) e^{-i θ} / √2

Add them and divide by √2:

[ (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) e^{i θ} + (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) e^{-i θ} ] / (√2 * √2 )

= [ |0⟩ (e^{i θ} + e^{-i θ}) + i |1⟩ (e^{i θ} - e^{-i θ}) ] / 2

= |0⟩ cos θ + i |1⟩ (i sin θ) / 1

Because e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

Therefore:

= |0⟩ cosθ + i |1⟩ * (2i sinθ) / 2

Wait, let's compute:

The coefficient of |1⟩ is i*(e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/2 = i*(2i sinθ)/2 = i*(i sinθ) = - sinθ.

Therefore, overall:

|ψ(t)⟩ = |0⟩ cosθ - |1⟩ sinθ

Which is the same as the matrix multiplication result: [cosθ, -sinθ]^T. So θ = γ B t / 2. So that's correct. So the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γ B t / 2)|0⟩ - sin(γ B t / 2)|1⟩. Then the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2)( |cosθ|^2 - |sinθ|^2 ) = (ħ/2)(cos^2θ - sin^2θ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ) = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). So the expectation value oscillates as cos(γ B t), meaning the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is γ B.

But let me check with the energy difference. The energy levels are E_+ = -γ B ħ/2 and E_- = γ B ħ/2. The difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency is ΔE / ħ = γ B, which matches.

Therefore, the frequency of oscillation of ⟨Sz⟩ is γ B. Thus, the answer is γ B. But let me make sure that this is correct. For example, if γ B is the angular frequency, then the frequency in Hz would be γ B / (2π). But the problem just asks for the oscillation frequency, and in physics, when we talk about the frequency of such oscillations, we usually mean the angular frequency. So the answer should be γ B.

Alternatively, in the expression ⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t), the argument of the cosine is γ B t, so the angular frequency ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is ω = γ B.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is the Larmor frequency, which is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma times B.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

The time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y. The energy levels are determined by H. The energy eigenvalues for a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y would be E = ± (γ B ħ/2). The energy difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency when transitioning between states is given by ΔE / ħ = γ B. So the angular frequency is ω = γ B, so frequency f = γ B/(2π).

The problem doesn\'t specify, but in physics, when asked for "frequency" without specifying, it can be ambiguous. However, in the context of oscillations, if they want angular frequency, they might specify "angular frequency" or use ω. Since the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which in standard terms is cycles per second (Hz), the answer is γ B/(2π).\n\nBut let\'s check with the standard Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it precesses with angular frequency ω = γ B. So the precession frequency is ω = γ B, and the ordinary frequency is γ B/(2π). However, in the case here, the particle is in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates, leading to oscillations in the expectation value. The energy difference between the eigenstates of H_final (which is along Y) would be ΔE = γ B ħ.

If it\'s expecting ordinary frequency, it\'s γ B/(2π). But the problem states "oscillation frequency", which is usually the number of oscillations per second, i.e., ordinary frequency. But in quantum mechanics, sometimes people refer to the angular frequency as the frequency. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"\n\nSince the time dependence of <S_z> is cos(γ B t), the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is γ B. If they want the ordinary frequency, it\'s γ B/(2π). But the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency. Let\'s see.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you have an expectation value oscillating as cos(ω t), ω is the angular frequency. So if the question is about the frequency of oscillation, unless specified otherwise, it\'s the angular frequency. However, in other contexts, like engineering, frequency is ordinary. Let\'s check similar problems. For example, in spin precession, the Larmor frequency is the angular frequency γ B. If you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is ω = γ B. However, in this case, the setup is different. The magnetic field is suddenly changed to Y, so the state starts precessing around Y. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate as the spin precesses around Y. The angular frequency of precession is ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is the same as the precession frequency, which is ω = γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B. But again, let\'s check the calculation.\n\nFrom the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). The argument of the cosine is γ B t. Therefore, the angular frequency is γ B. If they ask for the frequency, depending on convention, but in physics, when talking about oscillations in expectation values, they usually mean angular frequency. However, sometimes problems might expect ordinary frequency, but given that the standard Larmor frequency is angular frequency γ B, I think the answer is γ B. But let\'s confirm.\n\nWait, in the Hamiltonian, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-, separated by ΔE = γ B ħ. The Rabi frequency, which is the frequency of oscillation between states, is ΔE / ħ = γ B. So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value would be this Rabi frequency, which is γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B. But Rabi frequency is angular frequency? Wait, no. The Rabi frequency is the frequency of the oscillations in the probability, which is given by ΔE / ħ. Wait, actually, the Rabi frequency is Ω = ΔE / ħ = γ B. So that\'s the angular frequency. Therefore, the ordinary frequency is Ω / (2π). But in the expression for <S_z>, we have cos(γ B t), which is cos(Ω t). Therefore, the angular frequency is Ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency, if they mean angular frequency, is γ B. If they mean ordinary frequency, it\'s γ B / (2π). The problem doesn\'t specify. However, in the context of a physics problem asking for the frequency of oscillation of an expectation value, and given that the answer is a multiple of γ B, I think the answer is γ B. But to check, let\'s see.\n\nSuppose B is in teslas, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio with units of rad/(s·T). Then γ B has units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is γ B. If they wanted Hz, it would be divided by 2π. But given that the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which can be ambiguous, but in the absence of a specified unit, it\'s safer to give angular frequency. However, in some textbooks, when they talk about the frequency of oscillation in expectation values, they refer to the angular frequency. For example, in the book "Quantum Mechanics" by Griffiths, when discussing spin precession, he mentions the angular frequency ω = γ B. Therefore, the answer is ω = γ B, so the oscillation frequency is γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B.\n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose we have a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along Y. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-. The initial state is |+z>, which can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. The time evolution will cause the state to precess around Y, leading to oscillations in S_z. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between |+y> and |-y>. The energy difference is ΔE = E_+ - E_- = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency (angular) is ΔE / ħ = γ B. Therefore, the frequency is γ B. So the answer is γ B.\n\nBut just to confirm with the expectation value. The expression we found was <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). The argument of the cosine is γ B t, so the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is γ B. If they had asked for the period, it would be 2π/(γ B). But since they asked for frequency, which is cycles per second, but here the angular frequency is γ B. However, in the expression, the cosine has period 2π/(γ B), so the frequency is γ B/(2π). But in physics, when you write time evolution like e^{-iω t}, ω is the angular frequency. Therefore, the frequency f is ω/(2π). But in the problem statement, it\'s not clear. However, given that the Hamiltonian leads to energy levels with splitting ΔE = γ B ħ, and transitions between these lead to oscillations with frequency ΔE/h = γ B/(2π). But in the expectation value, the time dependence is cos(γ B t), so the angular frequency is γ B, so the frequency would be γ B/(2π). Hmm. There\'s ambiguity here. Let\'s think again.\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). For H = -γ B S_y, we can write H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, H = - (γ B ħ / 2) σ_y. Therefore, the time evolution is U(t) = exp(i (γ B / 2) σ_y t). The energy eigenvalues are E = ± γ B ħ / 2. Therefore, the difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency between the states is ΔE / ħ = γ B, which is the angular frequency. Hence, the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B. But in terms of ordinary frequency, it\'s γ B / (2π). But since the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average value, which in quantum mechanics is typically given by the angular frequency, as it\'s derived from the energy difference. However, the problem might not be expecting a factor of 2π. Let\'s check the expression again.\n\nThe expectation value we found was <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). The argument of the cosine is γ B t. Therefore, the function cos(γ B t) has a period T = 2π/(γ B), so the frequency is f = 1/T = γ B/(2π). Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz is γ B/(2π). However, if we\'re talking about angular frequency, it\'s γ B. The problem doesn\'t specify, but given that the answer is to be put in a box and it\'s a physics problem, it\'s possible they expect angular frequency. However, in the expression, the time dependence is cos(γ B t), so if you consider standard frequency, it\'s γ B/(2π). But in quantum mechanics literature, when they discuss expectation values oscillating, they often refer to the angular frequency. For example, in the context of Rabi oscillations, the Rabi frequency is the angular frequency.\n\nBut let\'s think about the units. γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of rad·s⁻¹·T⁻¹. Multiplying by B (in Tesla) gives rad/s, which is angular frequency. Therefore, γ B has units of angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is γ B. However, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency. If we take frequency to be cycles per second (Hz), then it\'s γ B/(2π). But given that γ B is already in rad/s, and the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", the answer is probably γ B. But I need to resolve this ambiguity.\n\nLet me check a standard example. Consider a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along X. The energy eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. If you start in |+z>, which is a superposition of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with time. The frequency of oscillation is the energy difference divided by ħ, which is 2γ B / 2 = γ B (since ΔE = γ B ħ for S_x). Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_x. The eigenvalues are E_± = ± (γ B ħ)/2. The energy difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency (angular) is ΔE / ħ = γ B. Therefore, yes, the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with angular frequency γ B, so <S_z> ~ cos(γ B t). Therefore, the answer is γ B.\n\nBut in terms of ordinary frequency, f = γ B / (2π). However, since the problem doesn\'t specify, but given that in quantum mechanics the angular frequency is more commonly used in such contexts (like Larmor frequency), the answer is likely γ B. However, to be thorough, let\'s check both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is γ B, then the boxed answer is \\boxed{\\gamma B}. If it\'s γ B/(2π), then \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\gamma B}{2\\pi}}. To decide, let\'s recall that when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency (angular) is ω = γ B. This is known as the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the spin component perpendicular to the field is the Larmor frequency. In this case, since the field is along Y, the z-component will precess around Y with angular frequency ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is the Larmor frequency, which is ω = γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B.\n\nHence, the oscillation frequency (angular) is γ B, so the answer is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387310, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3812, prompt_tokens=1099, total_tokens=4911, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned along the +Z direction in a magnetic field. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's state evolves under the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in the average z-component of the magnetic moment. 

1. **Initial Setup**: The particle starts in the |+z⟩ eigenstate of \( S_z \) with Hamiltonian \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z \).

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the switch, the Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y \).

3. **Time Evolution**: The state evolves under \( H_{\text{final}} \), leading to a time-dependent state \( | \psi(t) \rangle = e^{-i H_{\text{final}} t / \hbar} | +z \rangle \).

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:
   - The time evolution operator for \( H_{\text{final}} \) results in rotations around the Y-axis.
   - The state \( | \psi(t) \rangle \) becomes a superposition of spin states, leading to an oscillating expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \).

5. **Frequency Determination**:
   - The oscillation arises from the energy difference between eigenstates of \( S_y \), resulting in an angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \).
   - This angular frequency corresponds to the Larmor precession frequency in the Y-direction magnetic field.

**Conclusion**: The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment is the angular frequency \( \gamma B \).

\boxed{\gamma B}

Wait, actually, let's verify. The matrix multiplication would be:

Top component: cos(ω t / 2)*1 + sin(ω t / 2)*0 = cos(ω t / 2)
Bottom component: -sin(ω t / 2)*1 + cos(ω t / 2)*0 = -sin(ω t / 2)

So yes, |ψ(t)> is [cos(ω t / 2), -sin(ω t / 2)]^T.

Now, to compute <S_z>, which is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_z. The operator S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ/2) [cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2)].

Using the double-angle identity, cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ). Therefore, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(ω t).

But ω was defined as γ B, so substituting back, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t).

Thus, the oscillation frequency is γ B divided by 2π (since the argument of the cosine is γ B t, so angular frequency ω = γ B). Therefore, the frequency f = ω/(2π) = γ B / (2π).

The initial state is |+z>, which can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. The time evolution will cause the state to precess around Y, leading to oscillations in S_z.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). For H = -γ B S_y, we can write H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, H = - (γ B ħ / 2) σ_y. Therefore, the time evolution is U(t) = exp(i (γ B / 2) σ_y t). The energy eigenvalues are E = ± γ B ħ / 2. Therefore, the difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency between the states is ΔE / ħ = γ B, which is the angular frequency. Hence, the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B. But in terms of ordinary frequency, it's γ B / (2π). But since the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average value, which in quantum mechanics is typically given by the angular frequency, as it's derived from the energy difference. However, the problem might not be expecting a factor of 2π. Let's check the expression again.

The expectation value we found was <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(γ B t). The argument of the cosine is γ B t. Therefore, the function cos(γ B t) has a period T = 2π/(γ B), so the frequency is f = 1/T = γ B/(2π).

But let's think about the units. γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of rad·s⁻¹·T⁻¹. Multiplying by B (in Tesla) gives rad/s, which is angular frequency. Therefore, γ B has units of angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is γ B. However, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency. If we take frequency to be cycles per second (Hz), then it's γ B/(2π). But given that γ B is already in rad/s, and the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", the answer is probably γ B. But I need to resolve this ambiguity.

Let me check a standard example. Consider a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along X. The energy eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. If you start in |+z>, which is a superposition of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with time. The frequency of oscillation is the energy difference divided by ħ, which is 2γ B / 2 = γ B (since ΔE = γ B ħ for S_x). Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

The Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_x. The eigenvalues are E_± = ± (γ B ħ)/2. The energy difference is ΔE = γ B ħ. The oscillation frequency (angular) is ΔE / ħ = γ B. Therefore, yes, the angular frequency is γ B. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with angular frequency γ B, so <S_z> ~ cos(γ B t). Therefore, the answer is γ B.

But in terms of ordinary frequency, f = γ B / (2π). However, since the problem doesn't specify, but given that in quantum mechanics the angular frequency is more commonly used in such contexts (like Larmor frequency), the answer is likely γ B. However, to be thorough, let's check both possibilities.

If the answer is γ B, then the boxed answer is \boxed{\gamma B}. If it's γ B/(2π), then \boxed{\dfrac{\gamma B}{2\pi}}. To decide, let's recall that when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency (angular) is ω = γ B. This is known as the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the spin component perpendicular to the field is the Larmor frequency. In this case, since the field is along Y, the z-component will precess around Y with angular frequency ω = γ B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is the Larmor frequency, which is ω = γ B. Therefore, the answer is γ B.

Hence, the oscillation frequency (angular) is γ B, so the answer is \boxed{\gamma B}.
