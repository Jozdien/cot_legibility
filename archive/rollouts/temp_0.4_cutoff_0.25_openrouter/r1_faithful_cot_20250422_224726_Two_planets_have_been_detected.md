# Original Question

Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

where \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the orbital distances of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. The orbital distances can be derived from the Doppler shift measurements. The radial velocity semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the Doppler shift \(\Delta \lambda\) by:

\[
\Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda}{c} \cdot K
\]

where \(K\) is proportional to \(\frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{M_{\star} a}}\). Solving for the orbital distance \(a\), we find:

\[
a \propto \left( \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\Delta \lambda} \right)^2
\]

Given that both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \Delta \lambda_2}{M_2 \Delta \lambda_1} \right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values (\(M_1 = 7 \, M_\oplus\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\oplus\), \(\Delta \lambda_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(\Delta \lambda_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left( \frac{M_2 \Delta \lambda_1}{M_1 \Delta \lambda_2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{5 \cdot 0.03}{7 \cdot 0.04} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{15}{28} \right)^2
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{15}{28} \right)^2} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

The final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They both have circular orbits. Also, there's some info about Doppler shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å: Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift and Planet2 a 0.04 Å shift. Hmm, I need to use this Doppler shift info to find their orbital distances, right? Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. 

First, let me recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

But since both planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will be sqrt(R_star / (2a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1). Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since albedo is the same, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. So if a2 is larger than a1, then T1 is higher than T2. 

So I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances a1 and a2. But how do I find their orbital distances? The problem gives Doppler shifts for each planet. The Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines is due to the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Wait, the radial velocity method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. But the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So the observed Doppler shift in the star's spectrum is delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. Here, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å has shifts of 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. So delta_lambda is proportional to the star's velocity. 

But how does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbital velocity? In the radial velocity method, the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity v_star is related to the planet's velocity v_planet by the ratio of their masses: v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (since the star is 1.5 solar masses, and the planets are Earth-sized, so M_planet << M_star), we can approximate v_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

But the planet's orbital velocity v_planet is determined by the star's mass and the orbital distance a. Using Kepler's third law: the orbital velocity v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). So combining these, the star's velocity is v_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a). But actually, wait, the exact formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the star's velocity) is:

K = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e = 0, so the last term is 1. Also, since M_planet << M_star, the denominator (1 + M_planet/M_star) ≈ 1. Also, the sin i term is problematic because we don't know the inclination. However, in the case of transiting planets, the inclination is edge-on, so sin i ≈ 1. Wait, but the problem says both planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. So if they transit, their inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. So we can set sin i = 1. So then K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) ) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P / (2π))^(-1/3) )

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Let me recall that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) )

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet

But v_planet is the orbital speed of the planet, which is v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). So:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) = (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star / a)^0.5

Simplify this:

= M_planet * G^0.5 * M_star^{-1 + 0.5} * a^{-0.5}

= M_planet * G^0.5 * M_star^{-0.5} * a^{-0.5}

But K is related to the Doppler shift: delta_lambda / lambda = K / c

So delta_lambda = lambda * K / c

Therefore, delta_lambda = lambda / c * (M_planet * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_star a) )

So solving for a:

a = (lambda^2 * M_planet^2 * G ) / ( c^2 * delta_lambda^2 * M_star )

Therefore, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (M_planet / delta_lambda)^2, given that lambda, G, c, and M_star are the same for both planets.

Wait, but M_star is the same for both planets, since they orbit the same star. So for each planet, their a is proportional to (M_planet / delta_lambda)^2. So a1/a2 = (M1/d1)^2 / (M2/d2)^2 = ( (M1/M2) * (d2/d1) )^2

Wait, but delta_lambda is given for each planet. Let me denote delta1 = 0.03 Å for Planet1, delta2 = 0.04 Å for Planet2. Then:

a1 = (lambda^2 * M1^2 * G ) / ( c^2 * delta1^2 * M_star )

a2 = (lambda^2 * M2^2 * G ) / ( c^2 * delta2^2 * M_star )

Therefore, the ratio a1/a2 = (M1^2 / delta1^2) / (M2^2 / delta2^2) ) = ( (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2 )

Therefore, a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2) * (delta2/delta1) )^2

Therefore, a2/a1 = ( (M2/M1) * (delta1/delta2) )^2

But we need the ratio a2/a1 for the temperature ratio. Since T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), from earlier.

So let's compute a2/a1:

a2/a1 = ( (M2/M1) * (delta1/delta2) )^2

Given that Planet1 has M1 = 7 Earth masses, Planet2 has M2 = 5 Earth masses. Delta1 = 0.03 Å, delta2 = 0.04 Å.

So plugging in:

(M2/M1) = 5/7

(delta1/delta2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

Therefore, (M2/M1)*(delta1/delta2) = (5/7)*(3/4) = 15/28

Then a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225/784) ≈ 0.287

Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536

But wait, let me check the steps again to make sure.

First, the Doppler shift delta_lambda is proportional to the star's velocity K. And K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) ). So K = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)) * sqrt(G) )

Therefore, delta_lambda = (lambda / c) * K = (lambda / c) * (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)) * sqrt(G) )

Solving for a:

delta_lambda = (lambda / c) * (M_planet sqrt(G) ) / sqrt(M_star a )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(M_star a):

delta_lambda * sqrt(M_star a) = (lambda / c) * M_planet sqrt(G)

Square both sides:

delta_lambda² * M_star a = (lambda² / c²) * M_planet² G

Therefore:

a = (lambda² / c²) * M_planet² G / (delta_lambda² M_star )

Thus, a is proportional to M_planet² / (delta_lambda² )

So a1 ∝ M1² / delta1², a2 ∝ M2² / delta2²

Therefore, a1/a2 = (M1² / delta1²) / (M2² / delta2²) ) = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2

So a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (delta1/delta2)^2

Wait, that contradicts my previous step. Wait, no. If a1/a2 = (M1² delta2²)/(M2² delta1²), then a2/a1 = (M2² delta1²)/(M1² delta2²) )

Which is ( (M2/M1)² * (delta1/delta2)^2 )

So that is ( (M2/M1) * (delta1/delta2) )²

Which is the same as before. So yes, a2/a1 = ( (5/7) * (0.03/0.04) )² = ( (5/7)*(3/4) )² = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287

Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536

But wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4). But since both planets have the same albedo, when taking the ratio, the (1 - A)^(1/4) terms cancel. So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So yes, that is correct.

Therefore, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536. But let's compute it exactly:

(15/28)^2 = 225/784. Then sqrt(225/784) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 15/28 ≈ 0.536. So the ratio is 15:28, but since they ask for the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2, it's 15/28, or simplified as 15:28. Wait, but 15 and 28 have no common factors, so 15:28.

But let me verify once again. The key steps are:

1. Doppler shift delta_lambda is proportional to K, the star's radial velocity.

2. K is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)).

3. Therefore, delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(a)), since M_star is the same for both planets.

4. Therefore, delta_lambda ∝ M_planet / sqrt(a) => a ∝ (M_planet / delta_lambda)^2.

5. Therefore, a1/a2 = (M1 delta2 / M2 delta1)^2.

6. Therefore, a2/a1 = (M2 delta1 / M1 delta2)^2.

7. Then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2).

Wait, hold on. If a2/a1 = (M2 delta1 / M1 delta2)^2, then sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2). Therefore, the temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2). Wait, that's a simpler way. Let's see:

From the above, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt( (M2 delta1 / M1 delta2)^2 ) = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2). So that's a simpler expression. So instead of computing a2/a1 and then taking the square root, we can directly compute (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2).

So plugging in the numbers:

M2 = 5, M1 =7, delta1 =0.03, delta2=0.04.

So (5 * 0.03)/(7 * 0.04) = (0.15)/(0.28) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So that's the same result.

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.536. So the answer is 15/28, or approximately 0.536. Since the question asks for the ratio, we can present it as a fraction.

But let me check units and constants. Wait, in the calculation for a, we had G, c, lambda, etc., but since we took the ratio, all constants cancel out, so the ratio depends only on the masses and the Doppler shifts. Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2). So that's a straightforward result.

Therefore, the answer is 15/28. Let me just confirm once again:

Given that T1/T2 = (M2 delta1)/(M1 delta2) = (5 * 0.03)/(7 * 0.04) = 0.15 / 0.28 = 15/28. Yes.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28, or approximately 0.5357. The question says "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2", so T1/T2 = 15/28.

But let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the star's luminosity come into play? Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4). The star's T_eff is given as 6300 K, R_star is 1.2 solar radii. But when taking the ratio T1/T2, the T_star and R_star terms would cancel out because they are the same for both planets. Therefore, the ratio only depends on sqrt(a2/a1), which we found as 15/28. Therefore, the answer is 15/28.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the actual distances using the Doppler shift and then compute the ratio. Let's try that to confirm.

Compute a1 and a2:

We have the formula:

a = (lambda^2 * M_planet^2 * G ) / ( c^2 * delta_lambda^2 * M_star )

But let's plug in the numbers.

First, constants:

G = 6.6743 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

c = 3 × 10^8 m/s

lambda = 6300 Å = 6300 × 10^-10 m = 6.3 × 10^-7 m

M_star = 1.5 solar masses. Solar mass is 1.9885 × 10^30 kg, so M_star = 1.5 * 1.9885e30 ≈ 2.98275e30 kg

Planet1: M1 = 7 Earth masses. Earth mass is 5.972e24 kg, so M1 = 7 * 5.972e24 ≈ 4.1804e25 kg

delta1 = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m

Similarly for Planet2:

M2 = 5 * 5.972e24 ≈ 2.986e25 kg

delta2 = 0.04e-10 m

Compute a1:

a1 = ( (6.3e-7 m)^2 * (4.1804e25 kg)^2 * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² ) / ( (3e8 m/s)^2 * (0.03e-10 m)^2 * 2.98275e30 kg )

This seems complicated, but since we need the ratio a1/a2, let's compute a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1^2 / delta1^2) / (M2^2 / delta2^2) ) ] = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2 = (7/5)^2 * (0.04/0.03)^2 = (49/25) * (16/9) = (49 * 16) / (25 * 9) = 784 / 225 ≈ 3.484

Therefore, a1/a2 ≈ 3.484, so a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, which matches our previous result. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536, which is 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So this confirms the ratio is 15/28.

Therefore, the answer is 15/28. The problem states to provide the ratio, so boxed as \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They both have circular orbits. Also, there's some info about Doppler shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å: Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift and Planet2 a 0.04 Å shift. Hmm, I need to use this Doppler shift info to find their orbital distances, right? Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. 

First, let me recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

But since both planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will be sqrt(R_star / (2a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1). Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since albedo is the same, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. So if a2 is larger than a1, then T1 is higher than T2. 

So I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances a1 and a2. But how do I find their orbital distances? The problem gives Doppler shifts for each planet. The Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines is due to the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Wait, the radial velocity method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital speed. But the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So the observed Doppler shift in the star's spectrum is delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. Here, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å has shifts of 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. So delta_lambda is proportional to the star's velocity. 

But how does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbital velocity? In the radial velocity method, the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity v_star is related to the planet's velocity v_planet by the ratio of their masses: v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (since the star is 1.5 solar masses, and the planets are Earth-sized, so M_planet << M_star), we can approximate v_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

But the planet's orbital velocity v_planet is determined by the star's mass and the orbital distance a. Using Kepler's third law: the orbital velocity v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). So combining these, the star's velocity is v

I need to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets orbit the same star and have identical albedos. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, its radius is 1.2 solar radii, and it has a Teff of 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses with 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 has 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both planets follow circular orbits. Additionally, there's data on Doppler shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å: Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. I'll need to use these Doppler shift measurements to calculate their orbital distances, since equilibrium temperature depends on distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

Let me recall the equilibrium temperature formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Since both planets have the same albedo, this term cancels when calculating the ratio. Therefore, the temperature ratio will be sqrt(a2/a1). If I check this: T1/T2 = sqrt((R_star/(2a1))/(R_star/(2a2))) = sqrt(a2/a1). So the temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of their orbital distance ratio. If a2 exceeds a1, then T1 will be higher than T2.

I now need to determine the ratio of orbital distances a1 and a2. The Doppler shifts provide this information. For the [OI] line at 6300 Å, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. Thus, the observed shift in the star's spectrum is delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star/c, where delta_lambda equals 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

In the radial velocity method, the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity relates to the planet's velocity by their mass ratio: v_star = (M_planet/M_star) * v_planet. Since the planets are Earth-sized while the star is 1.5 solar masses (making M_planet much smaller than M_star), we can approximate v_star ≈ (M_planet/M_star) * v_planet.

The planet's orbital velocity is determined by the star's mass and orbital distance according to Kepler's third law: v_planet = sqrt(G M_star/a). Combining these relationships, the star's velocity is v

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, which both orbit the same star and share the same albedo. The star itself has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, a radius of 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 has a mass of 5 Earth masses and a radius of 1.3 Earth radii. Both planets follow circular orbits. There's also information on Doppler shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, with Planet1 causing a shift of 0.03 Å and Planet2 causing a 0.04 Å shift. I assume I need to use this Doppler shift data to determine their orbital distances since equilibrium temperature is influenced by the distance to the star and the star's luminosity.

To recall, the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4).

However, since both planets have identical albedo values, this factor cancels out when comparing their temperatures. Thus, the temperature ratio becomes sqrt(R_star / (2a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2a2)) = sqrt(a2 / a1). Is that correct? Let me see again.

Okay, the formula indeed is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4), with A representing albedo. Since albedo is equal, the temperature ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ), simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio depends on the inverse square root of the orbital distance ratio. If a2 is greater than a1, then T1 is higher than T2.

I need to find their orbital distance ratio a1 to a2. How do I determine these distances? The problem provides Doppler shifts for each planet. The Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, relevant to the radial velocity method, informs us of the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational influence. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is defined by:

K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3).

No, wait. The radial velocity method measures the star's velocity, connected to the planet's orbital speed. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. Therefore, the observed Doppler shift relates to the star's motion, delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. For the [OI] line at 6300 Å, shifts are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å due to Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. Consequently, delta_lambda correlates with the star's velocity.

How does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbit? In the radial velocity approach, the star and planet revolve around their common center of mass. The star's velocity v_star is linked to the planet's velocity v_planet through their mass ratio: v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. Given that the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (the star is 1.5 solar masses, with planets being Earth-sized, hence M_planet << M_star), we can estimate v_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

Meanwhile, a planet's orbital velocity v_planet depends on the star's mass and the distance a. According to Kepler's third law, the orbital velocity v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). So, combining these insights, the star's velocity is v.

Therefore, delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)) * sqrt(G) / c. Wait, but let\'s write this more carefully. Let me get the exact formula.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the star\'s velocity) is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * a ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sin i) )\n\nBut since the problem states that the planets have been detected using both transit and RV methods, the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i = 1. Also, since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star a) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 day) ) ) Wait, no. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / (2π) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet / M_star)) )\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e = 0. So the formula simplifies. Let me recall that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_planet) / (M_star^2 a) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The orbital velocity of the planet is v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). The orbital period P is given by Kepler\'s third law: P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) a^3. The star\'s velocity is v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. So v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) = M_planet * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_star a). \n\nBut the Doppler shift delta_lambda / lambda = v_star / c. Therefore, delta_lambda = lambda * (M_planet / c) * sqrt(G / (M_star a)). \n\nSo for each planet, delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)). \n\nBut since M_star is the same for both planets (they orbit the same star), and G, c, lambda are constants, the ratio of the Doppler shifts between Planet1 and Planet2 would be:\n\n(delta1 / delta2) = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) )\n\nSo, delta1 / delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nGiven that delta1 is 0.03 Å and delta2 is 0.04 Å, so delta1/delta2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nSo:\n\n3/4 = (7 Earth masses / 5 Earth masses) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nBecause M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.\n\nSo 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSolving for sqrt(a2 / a1):\n\nsqrt(a2 / a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, so a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784\n\nBut wait, this seems off. Let\'s check the steps again.\n\nWait, the Doppler shift delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(a)), since M_star is the same for both. Therefore, delta1/delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1). So 0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1). So 3/4 = 7/5 * sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287. So a2 = 0.287 a1. Wait, but that would mean a2 is smaller than a1, but the Doppler shift is higher for Planet2? Hmm, but if a planet is closer, it would have a higher orbital velocity, leading to a higher Doppler shift. But Planet2 has a higher delta_lambda (0.04 vs 0.03). But Planet2 is less massive (5 vs 7 Earth masses). So the product M_planet / sqrt(a) is higher for Planet2. So 5 / sqrt(a2) = (0.04 / 0.03) * 7 / sqrt(a1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set up equations for both planets.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Planet1: delta1 = k * M1 / sqrt(a1)\n\nFor Planet2: delta2 = k * M2 / sqrt(a2)\n\nWhere k is a constant that includes G, M_star, c, lambda, etc., which are the same for both planets.\n\nTherefore, delta1 / delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nSo 0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (0.03/0.04) * (5/7) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nTherefore, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287\n\nSo a2 ≈ 0.287 a1. Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nBut how does this relate to the equilibrium temperature? The equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the orbital distance. So T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.5357. Wait, but earlier we had sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, the ratio is 15/28. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4). Since albedo A is the same for both, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So the ratio is 15/28. But 15 and 28 can be simplified? 15 and 28 have no common factors, so 15/28 is the simplified ratio. Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28, so Planet1\'s temperature is 15/28 times Planet2\'s temperature. But the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1/T2 = 15/28. Alternatively, if they want it inverted, but the problem says "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2", which is T1/T2. So 15/28. But let me check if I messed up the steps somewhere.\n\nWait, the formula T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so when taking the ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So yes, that\'s correct. So with a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, then sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So the answer is 15/28. But let me check with actual numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the actual distances a1 and a2. But to do that, I need to know the actual value of K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shift in terms of delta_lambda. So delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. Therefore, v_star = c * delta_lambda / lambda0.\n\nFor Planet1: v_star1 = (3e8 m/s) * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) = (3e8 * 0.03e-10) / 6300e-10 = (9e-3) / 6300e-10 = 9e-3 / 6.3e-7 = approx 9 / 6.3 * 1e4 ≈ 1.4286 * 1e4 ≈ 14286 m/s. Wait, that can\'t be right. 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So delta_lambda / lambda0 = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619. Then v_star = c * (delta_lambda / lambda0) = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. Wait, that\'s about 1.4 km/s. But radial velocity semi-amplitudes are usually on the order of m/s, not km/s. For example, Jupiter induces about 12.7 m/s on the Sun. Earth induces about 0.09 m/s. So 1.4 km/s seems way too high. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check again. 1 Ångström is 1e-10 meters. So the wavelength is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m. The shift for Planet1 is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m. So delta_lambda / lambda0 = 0.03e-10 / 6.3e-7 = (0.03 / 6.3) * 1e-3 = 0.0047619 * 1e-3 = 4.7619e-6. Then velocity v = c * delta_lambda / lambda0 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. That\'s still 1.4 km/s, which is way too high. There\'s a problem here because real radial velocity signals are much smaller. For example, a planet like Jupiter causes a RV signal of about 10 m/s. So getting 1.4 km/s is unrealistic. This suggests that either the problem is using different units, or there\'s a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nWait, the problem says "periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å". So maybe it\'s not the Doppler shift, but some other kind of shift? Wait, [OI] is a forbidden line, which is usually seen in nebulae, not in stellar spectra. But maybe in the star\'s spectrum, but forbidden lines are typically not prominent in stellar spectra because of high density. But regardless, assuming it\'s a real line. The shift is 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So if the Doppler formula gives a velocity of 1.4 km/s for 0.03 Å shift, but that\'s too high. Wait, let\'s compute the velocity properly.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Therefore, v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). For Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å. So v = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = 3e5 * 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 3e5 * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3 * 0.47619 ≈ 1.42857 km/s. So 1.43 km/s. Similarly, Planet2: delta_lambda = 0.04 Å, so v = 3e5 * 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 3e5 * 0.000006349 ≈ 1.90476 km/s. So about 1.9 km/s. These are very high radial velocities. For comparison, the hottest hot Jupiters induce about hundreds of m/s. But perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, the planets are very massive or close-in. Wait, Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, which is about 0.02 Jupiter masses. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, about 0.016 Jupiter masses. These are super-Earths or mini-Neptunes. Their RV signals would be much smaller. So 1.4 km/s is way too high. There\'s a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the given Doppler shifts are not for the star\'s velocity, but for the planet\'s velocity? But the problem states: "the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å". Wait, gravitational impact... Maybe it\'s not the Doppler shift due to the star\'s motion, but due to the planet\'s own motion emitting light? But planets don\'t emit significant light in [OI] lines. Or maybe it\'s the reflex motion of the star? But then again, the velocities are too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect? No, that\'s a different phenomenon. Alternatively, maybe it\'s the orbital velocity of the planet itself? But how would that affect the star\'s spectral lines? I\'m confused.\n\nWait, the problem says "the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift". Maybe it\'s the gravitational redshift caused by the planet\'s gravity? But gravitational redshift is given by v = (G M)/(R c), where M and R are the mass and radius of the planet. For Earth, gravitational redshift is about 0.6 m/s. For a 5 Earth mass planet with 1.3 Earth radius, it\'s (5/1.3) * 0.6 ≈ 2.3 m/s. But 0.04 Å shift at 6300 Å corresponds to 0.04/6300 * 3e5 km/s ≈ 1.9 km/s, which is way larger. So that can\'t be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the Doppler shift due to the star\'s orbital velocity around the barycenter, which is what radial velocity method measures. But then, as we saw earlier, the velocities are too high. Maybe the problem has a typo and the shifts are in mÅ (milliAngstroms) instead of Å? If it were 0.03 mÅ and 0.04 mÅ, then the velocities would be 1.4 m/s and 1.9 m/s, which makes sense. But the problem states 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula I used is incorrect. Let\'s double-check. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda = lambda0 * v / c. So if we have a velocity v, the shift is proportional to v. So if the shift is 0.03 Å at 6300 Å, then v = (delta_lambda / lambda0) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s = (0.03/6300)*3e5 = (0.03 * 300,000) / 6300 = 9,000 / 6300 ≈ 1.42857 km/s. So 1.43 km/s. This seems correct. But as I said, this is way higher than typical radial velocity signals. For instance, a 1 Earth mass planet at 1 AU from a 1 solar mass star induces a RV signal of about 0.09 m/s. So 7 Earth masses would be 0.63 m/s. But here, it\'s 1.43 km/s, which is 1430 m/s, way higher. This suggests that either the planets are extremely close to the star, or there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is different. Let\'s recall that K = (v_star) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut since the orbits are circular and edge-on (sin i =1), and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )\n\nBut we also have from Kepler\'s third law: P^2 = (4π² / G M_star) a^3 => P = (4π² / G M_star)^(-1/2) a^(3/2) = sqrt( (4π²)^(-1) G M_star )^(-1) a^(3/2) )\n\nWait, maybe better to express P in terms of a:\n\nP = 2π sqrt( a^3 / (G M_star) )\n\nTherefore, P^(1/3) = (2π)^(1/3) (a^3 / (G M_star))^(1/6) ) = (2π)^(1/3) (a^(1/2) / (G M_star)^(1/6) )\n\nSubstituting into K:\n\nK ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / ( M_star^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) a^(1/2) / (G M_star)^(1/6) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nK ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet * (G M_star)^(1/6) / ( M_star^(2/3) * 2π^(1/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\n= (2π)^(1/3) G^(1/3) * M_planet * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) a^(1/2) )\n\nCancel (2π)^(1/3):\n\n= G^(1/3 + 1/6) * M_planet * M_star^(1/6 - 2/3) / a^(1/2)\n\n= G^(1/2) * M_planet * M_star^(-1/2) / a^(1/2)\n\n= sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression: K = v_star ≈ M_planet * sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) / ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, K has units of velocity. Let\'s check units:\n\nG has units of m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\n\nM_star in kg\n\na in meters\n\nSo sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) has units sqrt( (m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) / (kg m) ) ) = sqrt( m² kg⁻² s⁻² ) = m kg⁻1 s⁻1\n\nMultiply by M_planet (kg): m s⁻1. So yes, units check out. Therefore, K = sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet\n\nBut K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude, which we also have from the Doppler shift: K = delta_lambda * c / lambda0\n\nTherefore:\n\nsqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet = c * delta_lambda / lambda0\n\nSolving for a:\n\nsqrt( G / (M_star a) ) = c delta_lambda / (lambda0 M_planet )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nG / (M_star a) = c² (delta_lambda)^2 / (lambda0² M_planet² )\n\nTherefore:\n\na = G M_planet² / ( M_star c² (delta_lambda / lambda0 )² )\n\nSo a is proportional to M_planet² / (delta_lambda²)\n\nTherefore, for Planet1 and Planet2:\n\na1 ∝ M1² / (delta1²)\n\na2 ∝ M2² / (delta2²)\n\nTherefore, the ratio a1/a2 = (M1² / delta1²) / (M2² / delta2²) ) = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * (0.04/0.03)^2 = (49/25) * (16/9) = (49 * 16) / (25 * 9) = 784 / 225 ≈ 3.484\n\nTherefore, a1 = (784/225) a2, so a2 = (225/784) a1. Which matches our earlier result. So a2/a1 = 225/784, so sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28. But let\'s confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, since a ∝ M_planet² / delta_lambda², then a1 = k * (7)^2 / (0.03)^2, a2 = k * (5)^2 / (0.04)^2. Therefore, a1/a2 = (49 / 0.0009) / (25 / 0.0016) ) = (49 * 0.0016) / (25 * 0.0009) ) = (0.0784) / (0.0225) ) ≈ 3.484, which is 784/225. So same as before. Thus, a2/a1 = 225/784. Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28.\n\nBut let\'s compute it step by step:\n\nGiven that a1/a2 = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM1 = 7, M2 =5, delta1=0.03, delta2=0.04\n\na1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * (0.04/0.03)^2 = (49/25) * (16/9) = (49*16)/(25*9) = 784/225\n\nTherefore, a2/a1 = 225/784\n\nThus, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nSo the ratio is 15/28. Since the problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, that would be T1 : T2 = 15 : 28, or as a fraction, 15/28.\n\nBut let\'s make sure the equilibrium temperature formula is correctly applied.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nBut since both planets have the same albedo A, the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out in the ratio. Therefore:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Therefore, the answer is 15/28.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the luminosity of the star. Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula can also be written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nBut the star\'s luminosity L = 4π R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. However, the equilibrium temperature of the planet is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )\n\nAlternatively, another form is:\n\nT_eq = ( L / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nBut since L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4, substituting:\n\nT_eq = ( (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\n= ( ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / (4 a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\n= ( R_star^(1/2) T_star / (2^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhich is the same as the previous formula. So either way, the ratio T1/T2 depends only on sqrt(a2/a1), given that albedo is the same. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 15/28.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15/28.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by using the Doppler shift information to find their orbital distances. The equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of their orbital distances.

1. **Doppler Shift and Orbital Distance Relationship**:
   The Doppler shift \(\Delta \lambda\) is proportional to the star's velocity \(v_{\text{star}}\), which is related to the planet's mass \(M_{\text{planet}}\) and orbital distance \(a\) by:
   \[
   \Delta \lambda \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{a}}
   \]
   Given the Doppler shifts \(\Delta \lambda_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(\Delta \lambda_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), and masses \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\oplus\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\oplus\), we set up the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{7 / \sqrt{a_1}}{5 / \sqrt{a_2}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
   \]
   Solving for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}
   \]

2. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**:
   The equilibrium temperature \(T_{\text{eq}}\) is given by:
   \[
   T_{\text{eq}} \propto \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
   \]
   Since the albedo is the same for both planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{15}{28}

_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) = M_planet * sqrt(G / (M_star a)). 

But the Doppler shift delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. Therefore, delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)) * sqrt(G) / c. Wait, but let's write this more carefully. Let me get the exact formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the star's velocity) is given by:

K = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * a ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sin i) )

But since the problem states that the planets have been detected using both transit and RV methods, the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i = 1. Also, since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star a) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 day) ) ) Wait, no. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / (2π) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet / M_star)) )

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e = 0. So the formula simplifies. Let me recall that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G M_planet) / (M_star^2 a) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me think. The orbital velocity of the planet is v_planet = sqrt(G M_star / a). The orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) a^3. The star's velocity is v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. So v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) = M_planet * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_star a). 

But the Doppler shift delta_lambda / lambda = v_star / c. Therefore, delta_lambda = lambda * (M_planet / c) * sqrt(G / (M_star a)). 

So for each planet, delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star a)). 

But since M_star is the same for both planets (they orbit the same star), and G, c, lambda are constants, the ratio of the Doppler shifts between Planet1 and Planet2 would be:

(delta1 / delta2) = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) )

So, delta1 / delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Given that delta1 is 0.03 Å and delta2 is 0.04 Å, so delta1/delta2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So:

3/4 = (7 Earth masses / 5 Earth masses) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Because M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Solving for sqrt(a2 / a1):

sqrt(a2 / a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28

Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, so a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784

But wait, this seems off. Let's check the steps again.

Wait, the Doppler shift delta_lambda is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(a)), since M_star is the same for both. Therefore, delta1/delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1). So 0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1). So 3/4 = 7/5 * sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287. So a2 = 0.287 a1. Wait, but that would mean a2 is smaller than a1, but the Doppler shift is higher for Planet2? Hmm, but if a planet is closer, it would have a higher orbital velocity, leading to a higher Doppler shift. But Planet2 has a higher delta_lambda (0.04 vs 0.03). But Planet2 is less massive (5 vs 7 Earth masses). So the product M_planet / sqrt(a) is higher for Planet2. So 5 / sqrt(a2) = (0.04 / 0.03) * 7 / sqrt(a1) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to set up equations for both planets.

Let me denote:

For Planet1: delta1 = k * M1 / sqrt(a1)

For Planet2: delta2 = k * M2 / sqrt(a2)

Where k is a constant that includes G, M_star, c, lambda, etc., which are the same for both planets.

Therefore, delta1 / delta2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

So 0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (0.03/0.04) * (5/7) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

Therefore, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287

So a2 ≈ 0.287 a1. Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

But how does this relate to the equilibrium temperature? The equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the orbital distance. So T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.5357. Wait, but earlier we had sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, the ratio is 15/28. But let me check again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4). Since albedo A is the same for both, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So the ratio is 15/28. But 15 and 28 can be simplified? 15 and 28 have no common factors, so 15/28 is the simplified ratio. Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28, so Planet1's temperature is 15/28 times Planet2's temperature. But the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1/T2 = 15/28. Alternatively, if they want it inverted, but the problem says "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2", which is T1/T2. So 15/28. But let me check if I messed up the steps somewhere.

Wait, the formula T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so when taking the ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So yes, that's correct. So with a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, then sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. So the answer is 15/28. But let me check with actual numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the actual distances a1 and a2. But to do that, I need to know the actual value of K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shift in terms of delta_lambda. So delta_lambda = lambda0 * v_star / c. Therefore, v_star = c * delta_lambda / lambda0.

For Planet1: v_star1 = (3e8 m/s) * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) = (3e8 * 0.03e-10) / 6300e-10 = (9e-3) / 6300e-10 = 9e-3 / 6.3e-7 = approx 9 / 6.3 * 1e4 ≈ 1.4286 * 1e4 ≈ 14286 m/s. Wait, that can't be right. 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So delta_lambda / lambda0 = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.0000047619. Then v_star = c * (delta_lambda / lambda0) = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. Wait, that's about 1.4 km/s. But radial velocity semi-amplitudes are usually on the order of m/s, not km/s. For example, Jupiter induces about 12.7 m/s on the Sun. Earth induces about 0.09 m/s. So 1.4 km/s seems way too high. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check again. 1 Ångström is 1e-10 meters. So the wavelength is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m. The shift for Planet1 is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m. So delta_lambda / lambda0 = 0.03e-10 / 6.3e-7 = (0.03 / 6.3) * 1e-3 = 0.0047619 * 1e-3 = 4.7619e-6. Then velocity v = c * delta_lambda / lambda0 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. That's still 1.4 km/s, which is way too high. There's a problem here because real radial velocity signals are much smaller. For example, a planet like Jupiter causes a RV signal of about 10 m/s. So getting 1.4 km/s is unrealistic. This suggests that either the problem is using different units, or there's a misunderstanding in the question.

Wait, the problem says "periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å". So maybe it's not the Doppler shift, but some other kind of shift? Wait, [OI] is a forbidden line, which is usually seen in nebulae, not in stellar spectra. But maybe in the star's spectrum, but forbidden lines are typically not prominent in stellar spectra because of high density. But regardless, assuming it's a real line. The shift is 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So if the Doppler formula gives a velocity of 1.4 km/s for 0.03 Å shift, but that's too high. Wait, let's compute the velocity properly.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Therefore, v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). For Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å. So v = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = 3e5 * 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 3e5 * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3 * 0.47619 ≈ 1.42857 km/s. So 1.43 km/s. Similarly, Planet2: delta_lambda = 0.04 Å, so v = 3e5 * 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 3e5 * 0.000006349 ≈ 1.90476 km/s. So about 1.9 km/s. These are very high radial velocities. For comparison, the hottest hot Jupiters induce about hundreds of m/s. But perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, the planets are very massive or close-in. Wait, Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, which is about 0.02 Jupiter masses. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, about 0.016 Jupiter masses. These are super-Earths or mini-Neptunes. Their RV signals would be much smaller. So 1.4 km/s is way too high. There's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the given Doppler shifts are not for the star's velocity, but for the planet's velocity? But the problem states: "the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å". Wait, gravitational impact... Maybe it's not the Doppler shift due to the star's motion, but due to the planet's own motion emitting light? But planets don't emit significant light in [OI] lines. Or maybe it's the reflex motion of the star? But then again, the velocities are too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect? No, that's a different phenomenon. Alternatively, maybe it's the orbital velocity of the planet itself? But how would that affect the star's spectral lines? I'm confused.

Wait, the problem says "the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift". Maybe it's the gravitational redshift caused by the planet's gravity? But gravitational redshift is given by v = (G M)/(R c), where M and R are the mass and radius of the planet. For Earth, gravitational redshift is about 0.6 m/s. For a 5 Earth mass planet with 1.3 Earth radius, it's (5/1.3) * 0.6 ≈ 2.3 m/s. But 0.04 Å shift at 6300 Å corresponds to 0.04/6300 * 3e5 km/s ≈ 1.9 km/s, which is way larger. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the Doppler shift due to the star's orbital velocity around the barycenter, which is what radial velocity method measures. But then, as we saw earlier, the velocities are too high. Maybe the problem has a typo and the shifts are in mÅ (milliAngstroms) instead of Å? If it were 0.03 mÅ and 0.04 mÅ, then the velocities would be 1.4 m/s and 1.9 m/s, which makes sense. But the problem states 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å.

Alternatively, maybe the formula I used is incorrect. Let's double-check. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda = lambda0 * v / c. So if we have a velocity v, the shift is proportional to v. So if the shift is 0.03 Å at 6300 Å, then v = (delta_lambda / lambda0) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s = (0.03/6300)*3e5 = (0.03 * 300,000) / 6300 = 9,000 / 6300 ≈ 1.42857 km/s. So 1.43 km/s. This seems correct. But as I said, this is way higher than typical radial velocity signals. For instance, a 1 Earth mass planet at 1 AU from a 1 solar mass star induces a RV signal of about 0.09 m/s. So 7 Earth masses would be 0.63 m/s. But here, it's 1.43 km/s, which is 1430 m/s, way higher. This suggests that either the planets are extremely close to the star, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is different. Let's recall that K = (v_star) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since the orbits are circular and edge-on (sin i =1), and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But we also have from Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π² / G M_star) a^3 => P = (4π² / G M_star)^(-1/2) a^(3/2) = sqrt( (4π²)^(-1) G M_star )^(-1) a^(3/2) )

Wait, maybe better to express P in terms of a:

P = 2π sqrt( a^3 / (G M_star) )

Therefore, P^(1/3) = (2π)^(1/3) (a^3 / (G M_star))^(1/6) ) = (2π)^(1/3) (a^(1/2) / (G M_star)^(1/6) )

Substituting into K:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / ( M_star^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) a^(1/2) / (G M_star)^(1/6) ) )

Simplify:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet * (G M_star)^(1/6) / ( M_star^(2/3) * 2π^(1/3) a^(1/2) )

Simplify exponents:

= (2π)^(1/3) G^(1/3) * M_planet * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) a^(1/2) )

Cancel (2π)^(1/3):

= G^(1/3 + 1/6) * M_planet * M_star^(1/6 - 2/3) / a^(1/2)

= G^(1/2) * M_planet * M_star^(-1/2) / a^(1/2)

= sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet

Which matches the earlier expression: K = v_star ≈ M_planet * sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) / ?

Wait, no. Wait, K has units of velocity. Let's check units:

G has units of m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

M_star in kg

a in meters

So sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) has units sqrt( (m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) / (kg m) ) ) = sqrt( m² kg⁻² s⁻² ) = m kg⁻1 s⁻1

Multiply by M_planet (kg): m s⁻1. So yes, units check out. Therefore, K = sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet

But K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude, which we also have from the Doppler shift: K = delta_lambda * c / lambda0

Therefore:

sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) * M_planet = c * delta_lambda / lambda0

Solving for a:

sqrt( G / (M_star a) ) = c delta_lambda / (lambda0 M_planet )

Square both sides:

G / (M_star a) = c² (delta_lambda)^2 / (lambda0² M_planet² )

Therefore:

a = G M_planet² / ( M_star c² (delta_lambda / lambda0 )² )

So a is proportional to M_planet² / (delta_lambda²)

Therefore, for Planet1 and Planet2:

a1 ∝ M1² / (delta1²)

a2 ∝ M2² / (delta2²)

Therefore, the ratio a1/a2 = (M1² / delta1²) / (M2² / delta2²) ) = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2

Therefore, a1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * (0.04/0.03)^2 = (49/25) * (16/9) = (49 * 16) / (25 * 9) = 784 / 225 ≈ 3.484

Therefore, a1 = (784/225) a2, so a2 = (225/784) a1. Which matches our earlier result. So a2/a1 = 225/784, so sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28.

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28. But let's confirm once more.

Alternatively, since a ∝ M_planet² / delta_lambda², then a1 = k * (7)^2 / (0.03)^2, a2 = k * (5)^2 / (0.04)^2. Therefore, a1/a2 = (49 / 0.0009) / (25 / 0.0016) ) = (49 * 0.0016) / (25 * 0.0009) ) = (0.0784) / (0.0225) ) ≈ 3.484, which is 784/225. So same as before. Thus, a2/a1 = 225/784. Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28.

But let's compute it step by step:

Given that a1/a2 = (M1/M2)^2 * (delta2/delta1)^2

Plugging in the numbers:

M1 = 7, M2 =5, delta1=0.03, delta2=0.04

a1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * (0.04/0.03)^2 = (49/25) * (16/9) = (49*16)/(25*9) = 784/225

Therefore, a2/a1 = 225/784

Thus, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28

Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

So the ratio is 15/28. Since the problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, that would be T1 : T2 = 15 : 28, or as a fraction, 15/28.

But let's make sure the equilibrium temperature formula is correctly applied.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

But since both planets have the same albedo A, the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out in the ratio. Therefore:

T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 15/28.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the luminosity of the star. Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula can also be written as:

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

But the star's luminosity L = 4π R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. However, the equilibrium temperature of the planet is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Alternatively, another form is:

T_eq = ( L / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

But since L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4, substituting:

T_eq = ( (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

= ( ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / (4 a^2 ) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

= ( R_star^(1/2) T_star / (2^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

Which is the same as the previous formula. So either way, the ratio T1/T2 depends only on sqrt(a2/a1), given that albedo is the same. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 15/28.

Therefore, the answer is 15/28. So boxed, it's \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

Let's denote delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å and delta_lambda2 = 0.04 Å.\n\nFrom delta_lambda = (v_star/c) * lambda0, so delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = v_star1 / v_star2.\n\nBut the RV semi-amplitude K (which is v_star) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), assuming sin i is the same for both (which is reasonable if we don't have information on inclination). However, actually, the RV method only measures K = v_star sin i, so unless we know the inclinations, we can't directly get the true velocities. However, since both planets are detected via the transit method, this implies that their orbital planes are edge-on (i ≈ 90 degrees), so sin i ≈ 1. Therefore, we can take K ≈ v_star.\n\nSo with that, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) / (1 + M_planet/M_star). But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a )\n\nWait, let's re-examine the RV formula. The RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * sin i ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * (2π / P)^(1/3) )\n\nBut since e = 0 and sin i ≈ 1 (transiting planets), and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)\n\nBut Kepler's third law says P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star), so P = (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2). Therefore, 1/P = (G M_star / (4π² a³))^(1/2). Therefore, (2π / P ) = 2π * (G M_star / (4π² a³))^(1/2) ) = (G M_star / a³ )^(1/2) )\n\nThus, (2π / P )^(1/3) = (G M_star / a³ )^(1/6) )\n\nSo substituting back into K:\n\nK ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (G M_star / a³ )^(1/6) )\n\nCombine the exponents:\n\nG^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)\n\nM_planet^(1/3)\n\nM_star^(-1/3 + 1/6) = M_star^(-1/6)\n\na^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nK ≈ G^(1/2) * M_planet^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/6) * a^(-1/2)\n\nBut this still seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps using the proportionality.\n\nGiven that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), assuming sin i ≈ 1. Let me check this.\n\nWait, from the simplified formula:\n\nIf we have K ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)\n\nBut since P is related to a, substituting P from Kepler's law:\n\nK ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π / ( (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) )\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n2π / ( (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2) ) = 2π / ( (2π a^(3/2) ) / ( (G M_star)^(1/2) ) ) ) = (2π * (G M_star)^(1/2) ) / (2π a^(3/2) ) ) = (G M_star)^(1/2) / a^(3/2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nK ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (G M_star)^(1/2) / a^(3/2) )^(1/3) )\n\n= (G^(1/3) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )\n\n= G^(1/3 + 1/6) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3 + 1/6) a^(-1/2)\n\n= G^(1/2) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-1/2)\n\nThis gives K proportional to M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-1/2). Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nLet me consider K1/K2 = (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2) = (0.03 / 0.04) = 3/4.\n\nBut K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)) if we use the simplified version where K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a ) / (something else?)\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the RV semi-amplitude. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * a ) )^(1/2) * (1 / sin i )\n\nBut since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) ) / sin i\n\nBut since the planets transit, sin i ≈ 1, so:\n\nK ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) )\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to sqrt( M_planet / ( M_star a ) )\n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = sqrt( (M_planet1 / (M_star a1 )) / (M_planet2 / (M_star a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( (M_planet1 / M_planet2 ) * (a2 / a1 ) )\n\nBut we know K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore,\n\n3/4 = sqrt( (7 M_earth / 5 M_earth ) * (a2 / a1 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2 / a1 ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n9/16 = (7/5) * (a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore,\n\na2/a1 = (9/16) * (5/7) = 45/112 ≈ 0.4018\n\nSo the ratio of a2 to a1 is approximately 0.4018. Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes is a2/a1 ≈ 0.4018.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts the expectation that the planet causing a larger Doppler shift (Planet2 with 0.04 Å) would be closer. Since a2 is smaller than a1? Wait, according to this result, a2 is less than a1, meaning Planet2 is closer. But according to the RV method, the more massive planet would induce a larger Doppler shift, but here Planet1 is more massive (7 vs 5 Earth masses), yet Planet2 causes a larger Doppler shift. So perhaps the closer planet (smaller a) would have a higher velocity, leading to a larger Doppler shift. So even though Planet2 is less massive, it's closer, leading to a higher K.\n\nSo according to the calculation, a2/a1 ≈ 45/112 ≈ 0.4018, so a2 = 0.4018 a1. Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nNow, moving to equilibrium temperature. The formula, as I wrote earlier, is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)\n\nSince albedo is the same for both, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(45/112) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634\n\nBut wait, that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2. But if Planet1 is farther away (a1 > a2), then yes, that makes sense. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.634, so the inverse ratio T2/T1 ≈ 1.577.\n\nBut the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, so T1/T2. The answer would be sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) ) = 3*sqrt(35)/(4*7) ) Wait, let's compute 45/112.\n\nWait, 45 and 112 share a common factor? 45 is 9*5, 112 is 16*7. So sqrt(45/112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7)\n\nBut perhaps we can rationalize it:\n\nsqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):\n\n= (3/4)*sqrt(35)/7 = 3 sqrt(35)/(28). But not sure if needed. Alternatively, compute decimal:\n\nsqrt(45/112) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.\n\nBut maybe we can keep it as a fraction. Let's see:\n\nFrom earlier steps:\n\na2/a1 = 45/112\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(45/112) = (3*sqrt(5))/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). This is the exact ratio. Alternatively, rationalizing:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):\n\n(3 sqrt(35))/ (4*7) ) = (3 sqrt(35))/28 ≈ (3*5.916)/28 ≈ 17.747/28 ≈ 0.634, which matches the decimal.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an exact expression. Let's check the steps again.\n\nWait, the question states that both planets have been detected using both transit and RV methods. So the inclination is known (edge-on), so sin i = 1, which we already considered. The calculation of a2/a1 = 45/112 is correct given the steps. Then, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3*sqrt(5/7)/4. But perhaps simplifying further:\n\nsqrt(45/112) = sqrt(9*5 / 16*7) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). So the ratio is 3/4 times sqrt(5/7). Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 is 3√(5/7)/4.\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing the denominator:\n\n3√5 / (4√7) = 3√35 / 28. So both forms are acceptable. However, the problem might want the answer in terms of integers under the square root. Let me check the exact calculation again.\n\nFrom K1/K2 = 3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2/a1) )\n\nSquaring both sides: 9/16 = (7/5)(a2/a1)\n\nTherefore, a2/a1 = (9/16)(5/7) = 45/112\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3√5)/(4√7) = (3√35)/28. Multiply numerator and denominator by √7 to rationalize.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 3√35 / 28 ≈ 3*5.916 / 28 ≈ 17.747 / 28 ≈ 0.634.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the ratio, we can present it as 3√35/28. However, let me check if there's a simpler way. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let's verify the steps again.\n\nStarting from the RV semi-amplitude K:\n\nK ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) )\n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = sqrt( (M1 / (M_star a1 )) / (M2 / (M_star a2 )) )\n\n= sqrt( (M1 / M2) * (a2 / a1) )\n\nGiven that K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\nTherefore:\n\n3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2/a1) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n9/16 = (7/5)(a2/a1)\n\n=> a2/a1 = (9/16)(5/7) = 45/112. Correct.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3*sqrt(5/7)/4. Therefore, the exact ratio is 3√(5/7)/4.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to write it as a single square root, sqrt(45/112) can be reduced:\n\n45/112 = 9*5 / 16*7 = (9/16)*(5/7). So sqrt(9/16) = 3/4, then sqrt(5/7). Hence, 3/4 * sqrt(5/7).\n\nSo the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(5/7). However, perhaps we can rationalize this expression:\n\nsqrt(5/7) = sqrt(35)/7, so:\n\nT1/T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(35)/7 = 3 sqrt(35) / 28.\n\nEither form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the ratio under a single square root. Let's check if 45/112 can be simplified further. 45 and 112 have no common factors besides 1, so sqrt(45/112) is the simplest radical form. Alternatively, sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3√5)/(4√7). Multiply numerator and denominator by √7 to get 3√35 / 28. Either way, both forms are correct.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 3√35/28. If computed as a decimal, approximately 0.634, which is about 63.4% of Planet2's temperature. However, the problem asks for the ratio, and unless a decimal is required, the exact radical form is preferable.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible mistakes. The key steps were:\n\n1. Use the Doppler shift ratio to find the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes, which is 3/4.\n\n2. Relate RV semi-amplitude to planetary mass and orbital distance, leading to the equation K1/K2 = sqrt( (M1/M2) * (a2/a1) )\n\n3. Solve for a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2)^2 * M2/M1 ) = ( (9/16) * 5/7 ) = 45/112\n\n4. Then, equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3√35/28.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 3√35 divided by 28, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{35}}{28}}.\n\nAlternatively, if they prefer combining the constants, but I think this is the correct and simplest form.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387720, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4850, prompt_tokens=744, total_tokens=5594, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by using the radial velocity (RV) method data to find their orbital distances. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star} a}} \). Given the Doppler shifts, we relate the RV semi-amplitudes for both planets:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting the given values (\( K_1/K_2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 \), \( M_1 = 7 \, M_\oplus \), \( M_2 = 5 \, M_\oplus \)):

\[
\frac{3}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{a_2}{a_1} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{45}{112}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{45}{112} \):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{45}{112}} = \frac{3\sqrt{35}}{28}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3\sqrt{35}}{28}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

_star = (M_planet/M_star) * sqrt(G M_star/a). Simplifying, v_star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a).

But the Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v_star/c) * lambda0. So delta_lambda proportional to v_star. Therefore, delta_lambda ∝ (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * (1/sqrt(a)). Let me check the exact relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

But since the orbits are circular, e = 0, so that term is 1. Also, since M_planet << M_star, (1 + M_planet/M_star) ≈ 1, so we can approximate:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (M_planet sin i) / P^(1/3)

But the period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star). So P^(1/3) = (4π² a³ / G M_star)^(1/6) ) = (4π²)^(1/6) * a^(0.5) / (G M_star)^(1/6)

Substituting back into K:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) * M_planet sin i / ( (4π²)^(1/6) * a^(0.5) / (G M_star)^(1/6) ) )

Simplify exponents:

First, (2π G)^(1/3) divided by (4π²)^(1/6) = (2π G)^(1/3) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/6) ) ) Hmm, perhaps better to express in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, note that 4π² = (2π)^2, so (4π²)^(1/6) = (2π)^(1/3). Similarly, (2π G)^(1/3) divided by (2π)^(1/3) is (G)^(1/3). Then, the denominator also has (G M_star)^(1/6). So:

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) ) * M_planet sin i / ( M_star^(2/3) * a^(0.5) * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) )

Combining G exponents: G^(1/3 - 1/6) = G^(1/6)

M_star exponents: M_star^(-2/3 -1/6) = M_star^(-5/6)

So:

K ≈ ( G^(1/6) * M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(5/6) * a^(0.5) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward relation between the Doppler shift and the semi-major axis.

Alternatively, since we have two planets around the same star, so M_star is the same for both. Let's consider the ratio of their Doppler shifts. Let's denote delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å and delta_lambda2 = 0.04 Å.

From delta_lambda = (v_star/c) * lambda0, so delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = v_star1 / v_star2.

But the RV semi-amplitude K (which is v_star) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), assuming sin i is the same for both (which is reasonable if we don't have information on inclination). However, actually, the RV method only measures K = v_star sin i, so unless we know the inclinations, we can't directly get the true velocities. However, since both planets are detected via the transit method, this implies that their orbital planes are edge-on (i ≈ 90 degrees), so sin i ≈ 1. Therefore, we can take K ≈ v_star.

So with that, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a) / (1 + M_planet/M_star). But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a )

Wait, let's re-examine the RV formula. The RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:

K = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * sin i ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) * (2π / P)^(1/3) )

But since e = 0 and sin i ≈ 1 (transiting planets), and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

But Kepler's third law says P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star), so P = (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2). Therefore, 1/P = (G M_star / (4π² a³))^(1/2). Therefore, (2π / P ) = 2π * (G M_star / (4π² a³))^(1/2) ) = (G M_star / a³ )^(1/2) )

Thus, (2π / P )^(1/3) = (G M_star / a³ )^(1/6) )

So substituting back into K:

K ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (G M_star / a³ )^(1/6) )

Combine the exponents:

G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)

M_planet^(1/3)

M_star^(-1/3 + 1/6) = M_star^(-1/6)

a^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2)

Therefore,

K ≈ G^(1/2) * M_planet^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/6) * a^(-1/2)

But this still seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps using the proportionality.

Given that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), assuming sin i ≈ 1. Let me check this.

Wait, from the simplified formula:

If we have K ≈ ( (G M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

But since P is related to a, substituting P from Kepler's law:

K ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π / ( (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) )

Simplify the second term:

2π / ( (4π² a³ / (G M_star))^(1/2) ) = 2π / ( (2π a^(3/2) ) / ( (G M_star)^(1/2) ) ) ) = (2π * (G M_star)^(1/2) ) / (2π a^(3/2) ) ) = (G M_star)^(1/2) / a^(3/2)

Therefore,

K ≈ ( (G M_planet / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (G M_star)^(1/2) / a^(3/2) )^(1/3) )

= (G^(1/3) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )

= G^(1/3 + 1/6) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3 + 1/6) a^(-1/2)

= G^(1/2) M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-1/2)

This gives K proportional to M_planet^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-1/2). Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the ratio of K1 and K2.

Let me consider K1/K2 = (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2) = (0.03 / 0.04) = 3/4.

But K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)) if we use the simplified version where K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a ) / (something else?)

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the RV semi-amplitude. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * a ) )^(1/2) * (1 / sin i )

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) ) / sin i

But since the planets transit, sin i ≈ 1, so:

K ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) )

Therefore, K is proportional to sqrt( M_planet / ( M_star a ) )

Therefore, K1/K2 = sqrt( (M_planet1 / (M_star a1 )) / (M_planet2 / (M_star a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( (M_planet1 / M_planet2 ) * (a2 / a1 ) )

But we know K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

Therefore,

3/4 = sqrt( (7 M_earth / 5 M_earth ) * (a2 / a1 ) )

Simplify:

3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2 / a1 ) )

Square both sides:

9/16 = (7/5) * (a2 / a1 )

Therefore,

a2/a1 = (9/16) * (5/7) = 45/112 ≈ 0.4018

So the ratio of a2 to a1 is approximately 0.4018. Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes is a2/a1 ≈ 0.4018.

But wait, this contradicts the expectation that the planet causing a larger Doppler shift (Planet2 with 0.04 Å) would be closer. Since a2 is smaller than a1? Wait, according to this result, a2 is less than a1, meaning Planet2 is closer. But according to the RV method, the more massive planet would induce a larger Doppler shift, but here Planet1 is more massive (7 vs 5 Earth masses), yet Planet2 causes a larger Doppler shift. So perhaps the closer planet (smaller a) would have a higher velocity, leading to a larger Doppler shift. So even though Planet2 is less massive, it's closer, leading to a higher K.

So according to the calculation, a2/a1 ≈ 45/112 ≈ 0.4018, so a2 = 0.4018 a1. Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Now, moving to equilibrium temperature. The formula, as I wrote earlier, is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Since albedo is the same for both, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(45/112) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634

But wait, that would mean Planet1 is cooler than Planet2. But if Planet1 is farther away (a1 > a2), then yes, that makes sense. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.634, so the inverse ratio T2/T1 ≈ 1.577.

But the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, so T1/T2. The answer would be sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) ) = 3*sqrt(35)/(4*7) ) Wait, let's compute 45/112.

Wait, 45 and 112 share a common factor? 45 is 9*5, 112 is 16*7. So sqrt(45/112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7)

But perhaps we can rationalize it:

sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):

= (3/4)*sqrt(35)/7 = 3 sqrt(35)/(28). But not sure if needed. Alternatively, compute decimal:

sqrt(45/112) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

But maybe we can keep it as a fraction. Let's see:

From earlier steps:

a2/a1 = 45/112

Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(45/112) = (3*sqrt(5))/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(7)) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). This is the exact ratio. Alternatively, rationalizing:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):

(3 sqrt(35))/ (4*7) ) = (3 sqrt(35))/28 ≈ (3*5.916)/28 ≈ 17.747/28 ≈ 0.634, which matches the decimal.

But perhaps the problem expects an exact expression. Let's check the steps again.

Wait, the question states that both planets have been detected using both transit and RV methods. So the inclination is known (edge-on), so sin i = 1, which we already considered. The calculation of a2/a1 = 45/112 is correct given the steps. Then, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3*sqrt(5/7)/4. But perhaps simplifying further:

sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(9*5 / 16*7) = (3/4)*sqrt(5/7). So the ratio is 3/4 times sqrt(5/7). Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 is 3√(5/7)/4.

Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator:

3√5 / (4√7) = 3√35 / 28. So both forms are acceptable. However, the problem might want the answer in terms of integers under the square root. Let me check the exact calculation again.

From K1/K2 = 3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2/a1) )

Squaring both sides: 9/16 = (7/5)(a2/a1)

Therefore, a2/a1 = (9/16)(5/7) = 45/112

So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3√5)/(4√7) = (3√35)/28. Multiply numerator and denominator by √7 to rationalize.

Therefore, the ratio is 3√35 / 28 ≈ 3*5.916 / 28 ≈ 17.747 / 28 ≈ 0.634.

But since the problem asks for the ratio, we can present it as 3√35/28. However, let me check if there's a simpler way. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's verify the steps again.

Starting from the RV semi-amplitude K:

K ≈ sqrt( G M_planet / ( M_star a ) )

Therefore, K1/K2 = sqrt( (M1 / (M_star a1 )) / (M2 / (M_star a2 )) )

= sqrt( (M1 / M2) * (a2 / a1) )

Given that K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

Therefore:

3/4 = sqrt( (7/5) * (a2/a1) )

Square both sides:

9/16 = (7/5)(a2/a1)

=> a2/a1 = (9/16)(5/7) = 45/112. Correct.

Thus, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3*sqrt(5/7)/4. Therefore, the exact ratio is 3√(5/7)/4.

Alternatively, if we need to write it as a single square root, sqrt(45/112) can be reduced:

45/112 = 9*5 / 16*7 = (9/16)*(5/7). So sqrt(9/16) = 3/4, then sqrt(5/7). Hence, 3/4 * sqrt(5/7).

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(5/7). However, perhaps we can rationalize this expression:

sqrt(5/7) = sqrt(35)/7, so:

T1/T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(35)/7 = 3 sqrt(35) / 28.

Either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the ratio under a single square root. Let's check if 45/112 can be simplified further. 45 and 112 have no common factors besides 1, so sqrt(45/112) is the simplest radical form. Alternatively, sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3√5)/(4√7). Multiply numerator and denominator by √7 to get 3√35 / 28. Either way, both forms are correct.

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 3√35/28. If computed as a decimal, approximately 0.634, which is about 63.4% of Planet2's temperature. However, the problem asks for the ratio, and unless a decimal is required, the exact radical form is preferable.

But let me check once more for any possible mistakes. The key steps were:

1. Use the Doppler shift ratio to find the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes, which is 3/4.

2. Relate RV semi-amplitude to planetary mass and orbital distance, leading to the equation K1/K2 = sqrt( (M1/M2) * (a2/a1) )

3. Solve for a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2)^2 * M2/M1 ) = ( (9/16) * 5/7 ) = 45/112

4. Then, equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(45/112) = 3√35/28.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 3√35 divided by 28, which can be written as \boxed{\dfrac{3\sqrt{35}}{28}}.

Alternatively, if they prefer combining the constants, but I think this is the correct and simplest form.

But since the orbits are circular (e = 0) and assuming sin i = 1 (edge-on orbit, which is necessary for transits), it simplifies to K = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a).\n\nWait, but I need to check the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G / (2π))^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ) ] * (P / (1 - e²))^(1/3) )^(-1)\n\nBut since e = 0 and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) * (P / (1 day))^(−1/3) )\n\nBut perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Since the Doppler shift is given, and delta_lambda / lambda = K / c, where K is the star's velocity. Therefore, delta_lambda = (K / c) * lambda. Therefore, K = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda.\n\nGiven that the Doppler shifts are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively, and the wavelength lambda is 6300 Å, then:\n\nK1 = (0.03 Å * c) / 6300 Å\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 Å * c) / 6300 Å\n\nBut since c is in units of Å/s (but actually, c is speed, so we need to use consistent units). Wait, delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, so v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Therefore, K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but we can keep it in terms of c for ratio purposes.\n\nBut how does K relate to the planet's orbital parameters? The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * P^(-1/3)\n\nAgain, with e = 0 and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / (M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3) / (2π)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps better to recall the formula:\n\nK = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / (a (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / sqrt(1 - e²)\n\nBut since sin i is 1 (transit implies edge-on) and e = 0, then:\n\nK = ( (G M_planet) / (a (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * 2π / P^(1/3)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me check a standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) sqrt(1 - e²)) )\n\nBut with e = 0 and sin i = 1 (due to transit), this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut we don't know the orbital period P. But we can relate P to the orbital distance a via Kepler's third law:\n\nP² = (4π² / (G M_star)) a³\n\nTherefore, P = sqrt( (4π² / (G M_star)) a³ )\n\nSo, substituting P into the K equation:\n\nK = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (4π² / (G M_star))^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nFirst, note that (G / (2π))^(1/3) divided by (4π² / (G M_star))^(1/6) is equal to:\n\nG^(1/3) / (2π)^(1/3) / ( (4π²)^(1/6) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nG^(1/3 - 1/6) = G^(1/6)\n\n(2π)^(1/3) and (4π²)^(1/6) = (2² π²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)\n\nSo,\n\nG^(1/6) / (2π)^(1/3) / (2^(1/3) π^(1/3)) ) = G^(1/6) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3))\n\nThus, the entire expression for K becomes:\n\nK = ( G^(1/6) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3)) ) * ( M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6)) )\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (P / (2π a)) )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, perhaps using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star)\n\nSo, P = 2π sqrt(a³/(G M_star))\n\nThen, the orbital velocity of the planet is v_planet = 2π a / P = sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nBut the star's velocity is v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )\n\nTherefore, v_star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt( G / a )\n\nSo, K = v_star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt( G / a )\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to M_planet / ( sqrt(M_star a ) )\n\nTherefore, for each planet, K1 = M1 / ( sqrt(M_star a1) ) * sqrt(G)\n\nand K2 = M2 / ( sqrt(M_star a2) ) * sqrt(G)\n\nTherefore, the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nBut we can compute K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.\n\nGiven that delta_lambda / lambda = v/c, so v = c * delta_lambda / lambda\n\nTherefore, K1 = c * 0.03 / 6300\n\nK2 = c * 0.04 / 6300\n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\nBut according to the previous ratio:\n\nK1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1) = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4\n\nTherefore, (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4\n\nSolving for sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28\n\nThus, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, so a2/a1 = (15/28)² ≈ (225/784)\n\nBut we need the ratio of T1/T2, which is sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nWait, but earlier we thought that T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Let's confirm.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, A is the same, so (1 - A)^(1/4) cancels in the ratio. T_star is the same for both, so T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star / (2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star / (2a2) ) ) = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nTherefore, the ratio T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, so the inverse would be T2/T1 ≈ 28/15 ≈ 1.8667\n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So, if T1 is for Planet1 and T2 for Planet2, then T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 15:28.\n\nBut let's check the calculation again.\n\nWe had:\n\nK1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1) = 3/4\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (M2 / M1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28\n\nThus, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225/784)\n\nBut T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 15/28. However, 15 and 28 can both be divided by... 15 is 3*5, 28 is 4*7. No common factors. So, 15:28 is the ratio.\n\nBut let me confirm the steps once more.\n\n1. Doppler shift gives us K1 and K2 (radial velocity semi-amplitudes for each planet).\n\n2. K is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star * a)) )\n\n3. Therefore, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\n4. Given K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4\n\n5. Therefore, (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 => sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28\n\n6. T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28\n\nSo, the ratio is 15/28. Therefore, Planet1's equilibrium temperature is 15/28 times that of Planet2. Since 15/28 is approximately 0.5357, Planet1 is cooler than Planet2? Wait, but if a2 is larger than a1, then Planet2 is farther away, so should be cooler. But according to T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), so if a2 > a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) > 1, so T1 > T2. But that contradicts.\n\nWait, no. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, if a increases, T_eq decreases. Therefore, if a2 > a1, then T2 < T1. Wait, but according to our ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if a2 is larger, sqrt(a2/a1) >1, so T1 > T2. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. However, in our calculation, we found sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, which is less than 1. Therefore, a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287, so a2 < a1. Wait, but that would mean Planet2 is closer in than Planet1, which would mean Planet2 is hotter. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ 0.5357, so T1 is cooler than T2. But according to the answer ratio, it's 15/28, so Planet1 is cooler. But why does the Doppler shift of Planet2 being larger (0.04 Å vs. 0.03 Å) lead to Planet2 being closer?\n\nWait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity K, which is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star * a)). So for a larger K (larger Doppler shift), given same M_star, either larger M_planet or smaller a. Since Planet2 has a smaller mass (5 Earth masses vs. 7) but a larger Doppler shift (0.04 vs. 0.03), that suggests Planet2 must be closer (smaller a) to produce a larger K despite its smaller mass. So, indeed, Planet2 is closer (a2 < a1), hence hotter, which aligns with T1/T2 = 0.5357.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = 15/28.\n\nBut let's check if we need to consider the star's luminosity. Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is also dependent on the star's luminosity. The standard formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a ))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nBut another version is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 a D)),\n\nWait, no. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between incoming stellar radiation and outgoing blackbody radiation. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 a ) ) )^(1/2 ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nBut actually, the exact formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 a ) ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nBut this assumes that the star is a point source. The derivation comes from the stellar flux at the planet's location (which is L / (4π a²)), and the planet's absorbed power is (L / (4π a²)) * π R_planet² * (1 - A). Then, setting that equal to the planet's emitted power 4π R_planet² σ T_eq^4. Solving for T_eq gives:\n\nT_eq^4 = (L / (16 π σ a²)) * (1 - A)\n\nBut L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4, so substituting:\n\nT_eq^4 = (4π R_star² σ T_star^4) / (16 π σ a²) * (1 - A)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nT_eq^4 = (R_star² T_star^4) / (4 a²) * (1 - A)\n\nTaking the fourth root:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a ))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct as initially stated. Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 a1)) / (R_star / (2 a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nBut in our case, we found that a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, so sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28. So Planet1 is cooler than Planet2. That seems counterintuitive if Planet2 is closer, but according to the calculation, yes. Since Planet2 is closer (a2 < a1), it receives more flux, hence higher temperature. Therefore, T2 > T1, so the ratio T1/T2 is 15/28.\n\nBut the problem states that both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. The transit method requires that the orbital plane is edge-on, which is consistent with sin i = 1, which we assumed in our calculation for the radial velocity.\n\nTherefore, the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28, so the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}}.\n\nBut let me check once more. Let's compute numerical values step by step.\n\nFirst, compute K for each planet.\n\nGiven delta_lambda = 0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 Å for Planet2, lambda = 6300 Å.\n\nSo, K = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.\n\nBut c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by using the given Doppler shifts to find their orbital distances. The Doppler shift formula relates the star's velocity \( v \) to the observed wavelength shift:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For Planet1, the Doppler shift is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it is 0.04 Å. The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) for each planet is proportional to the star's velocity. Using the ratio of the Doppler shifts:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is also related to the planet's mass and orbital distance by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{M_{\text{star}} \cdot a}}
\]

Given the masses of the planets (7 Earth masses for Planet1 and 5 Earth masses for Planet2), we set up the ratio:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for the ratio of orbital distances:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \) is given by the inverse square root of the orbital distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

Star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a). Therefore, v.Star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a). Therefore, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K = v.Star = (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / (a (1 - e²))) ). But since the orbits are circular (e = 0) and assuming sin i = 1 (edge-on orbit, which is necessary for transits), it simplifies to K = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt(G M_star / a).

Wait, but I need to check the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G / (2π))^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ) ] * (P / (1 - e²))^(1/3) )^(-1)

But since e = 0 and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) * (P / (1 day))^(−1/3) )

But perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Since the Doppler shift is given, and delta_lambda / lambda = K / c, where K is the star's velocity. Therefore, delta_lambda = (K / c) * lambda. Therefore, K = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda.

Given that the Doppler shifts are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively, and the wavelength lambda is 6300 Å, then:

K1 = (0.03 Å * c) / 6300 Å

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 Å * c) / 6300 Å

But since c is in units of Å/s (but actually, c is speed, so we need to use consistent units). Wait, delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, so v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Therefore, K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but we can keep it in terms of c for ratio purposes.

But how does K relate to the planet's orbital parameters? The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * P^(-1/3)

Again, with e = 0 and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet / (M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3) / (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps better to recall the formula:

K = (v_star) = ( (G M_planet) / (a (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / sqrt(1 - e²)

But since sin i is 1 (transit implies edge-on) and e = 0, then:

K = ( (G M_planet) / (a (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * 2π / P^(1/3)

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me check a standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

The standard formula is:

K = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But with e = 0 and sin i = 1 (due to transit), this simplifies to:

K = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But we don't know the orbital period P. But we can relate P to the orbital distance a via Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π² / (G M_star)) a³

Therefore, P = sqrt( (4π² / (G M_star)) a³ )

So, substituting P into the K equation:

K = ( (G / (2π))^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (4π² / (G M_star))^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )

Simplify exponents:

First, note that (G / (2π))^(1/3) divided by (4π² / (G M_star))^(1/6) is equal to:

G^(1/3) / (2π)^(1/3) / ( (4π²)^(1/6) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) )

Simplify:

G^(1/3 - 1/6) = G^(1/6)

(2π)^(1/3) and (4π²)^(1/6) = (2² π²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

So,

G^(1/6) / (2π)^(1/3) / (2^(1/3) π^(1/3)) ) = G^(1/6) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3))

Thus, the entire expression for K becomes:

K = ( G^(1/6) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3)) ) * ( M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6)) )

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, since K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (P / (2π a)) )^{-1} ?

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star)

So, P = 2π sqrt(a³/(G M_star))

Then, the orbital velocity of the planet is v_planet = 2π a / P = sqrt( G M_star / a )

But the star's velocity is v_star = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet = (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Therefore, v_star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt( G / a )

So, K = v_star = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt( G / a )

Therefore, K is proportional to M_planet / ( sqrt(M_star a ) )

Therefore, for each planet, K1 = M1 / ( sqrt(M_star a1) ) * sqrt(G)

and K2 = M2 / ( sqrt(M_star a2) ) * sqrt(G)

Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

But we can compute K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.

Given that delta_lambda / lambda = v/c, so v = c * delta_lambda / lambda

Therefore, K1 = c * 0.03 / 6300

K2 = c * 0.04 / 6300

Therefore, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

But according to the previous ratio:

K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1) = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4

Therefore, (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4

Solving for sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28

Thus, sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28, so a2/a1 = (15/28)² ≈ (225/784)

But we need the ratio of T1/T2, which is sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

Wait, but earlier we thought that T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Let's confirm.

The equilibrium temperature formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

Since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same, so (1 - A)^(1/4) cancels in the ratio. T_star is the same for both, so T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star / (2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star / (2a2) ) ) = sqrt( (R_star / (2a1)) / (R_star / (2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, so the inverse would be T2/T1 ≈ 28/15 ≈ 1.8667

But the problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So, if T1 is for Planet1 and T2 for Planet2, then T1/T2 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 15:28.

But let's check the calculation again.

We had:

K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1) = 3/4

Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (M2 / M1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28

Thus, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225/784)

But T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28

Therefore, the ratio is 15/28. However, 15 and 28 can both be divided by... 15 is 3*5, 28 is 4*7. No common factors. So, 15:28 is the ratio.

But let me confirm the steps once more.

1. Doppler shift gives us K1 and K2 (radial velocity semi-amplitudes for each planet).

2. K is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star * a)) )

3. Therefore, K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1)

4. Given K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4

5. Therefore, (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1) = 3/4 => sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4)*(5/7) = 15/28

6. T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28

So, the ratio is 15/28. Therefore, Planet1's equilibrium temperature is 15/28 times that of Planet2. Since 15/28 is approximately 0.5357, Planet1 is cooler than Planet2? Wait, but if a2 is larger than a1, then Planet2 is farther away, so should be cooler. But according to T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), so if a2 > a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) > 1, so T1 > T2. But that contradicts.

Wait, no. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, if a increases, T_eq decreases. Therefore, if a2 > a1, then T2 < T1. Wait, but according to our ratio, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if a2 is larger, sqrt(a2/a1) >1, so T1 > T2. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. However, in our calculation, we found sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357, which is less than 1. Therefore, a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287, so a2 < a1. Wait, but that would mean Planet2 is closer in than Planet1, which would mean Planet2 is hotter. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ 0.5357, so T1 is cooler than T2. But according to the answer ratio, it's 15/28, so Planet1 is cooler. But why does the Doppler shift of Planet2 being larger (0.04 Å vs. 0.03 Å) lead to Planet2 being closer?

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity K, which is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(M_star * a)). So for a larger K (larger Doppler shift), given same M_star, either larger M_planet or smaller a. Since Planet2 has a smaller mass (5 Earth masses vs. 7) but a larger Doppler shift (0.04 vs. 0.03), that suggests Planet2 must be closer (smaller a) to produce a larger K despite its smaller mass. So, indeed, Planet2 is closer (a2 < a1), hence hotter, which aligns with T1/T2 = 0.5357.

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = 15/28.

But let's check if we need to consider the star's luminosity. Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is also dependent on the star's luminosity. The standard formula is:

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a ))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

But another version is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 a D)),

Wait, no. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between incoming stellar radiation and outgoing blackbody radiation. The formula is:

T_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 a ) ) )^(1/2 ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

But actually, the exact formula is:

T_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 a ) ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

But this assumes that the star is a point source. The derivation comes from the stellar flux at the planet's location (which is L / (4π a²)), and the planet's absorbed power is (L / (4π a²)) * π R_planet² * (1 - A). Then, setting that equal to the planet's emitted power 4π R_planet² σ T_eq^4. Solving for T_eq gives:

T_eq^4 = (L / (16 π σ a²)) * (1 - A)

But L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4, so substituting:

T_eq^4 = (4π R_star² σ T_star^4) / (16 π σ a²) * (1 - A)

Simplifying:

T_eq^4 = (R_star² T_star^4) / (4 a²) * (1 - A)

Taking the fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 a ))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

Therefore, the formula is correct as initially stated. Therefore, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 a1)) / (R_star / (2 a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1)

But in our case, we found that a2/a1 = (15/28)^2, so sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28. Therefore, T1/T2 = 15/28. So Planet1 is cooler than Planet2. That seems counterintuitive if Planet2 is closer, but according to the calculation, yes. Since Planet2 is closer (a2 < a1), it receives more flux, hence higher temperature. Therefore, T2 > T1, so the ratio T1/T2 is 15/28.

But the problem states that both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. The transit method requires that the orbital plane is edge-on, which is consistent with sin i = 1, which we assumed in our calculation for the radial velocity.

Therefore, the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28, so the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

But let me check once more. Let's compute numerical values step by step.

First, compute K for each planet.

Given delta_lambda = 0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 Å for Planet2, lambda = 6300 Å.

So, K = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. However, since we are dealing with ratios, the actual value of c cancels out.

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c

K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c

Thus, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

From the radial velocity formula, K = (M_planet / sqrt(M_star * a)) * sqrt(G)

But since G and M_star are the same for both planets,

K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Thus,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2 / a1)

Solving for sqrt(a2/a1):

sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28

Thus, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 0.287

Therefore, a2 = 0.287 a1, meaning Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Then, equilibrium temperature ratio:

T1/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

Therefore, Planet1's equilibrium temperature is approximately 53.57% of Planet2's, so the ratio is 15:28.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 15/28.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.
