To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):** \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \)
   - **HCl (strong acid):** \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺} \)
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \), which provides \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \)

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - **HCl and Ba(OH)₂:** \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \)
     - \( 0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

   - **Remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:** \( \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \)
     - \( 0.05 \, \text{mol CH₃COOH} \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Calculate final concentration of OH⁻:**
   - **Total volume:** \( 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \)
   - \([ \text{OH⁻} ] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

4. **Determine pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \)
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \)

**Final Answer:**  
The pH of the solution is \(\boxed{12.62}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, let me think step by step. 

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they will react first. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so maybe it won't react as much unless there's excess base. Let me break it down.

Let me calculate the moles of each component first. For CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. 

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each formula unit releases 2 OH- ions. So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles. 

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles (since HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely). The H+ from CH3COOH might not contribute much because it's a weak acid, but maybe after the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, there could be some leftover acid or base. Let's see.

The reaction between HCl (H+) and Ba(OH)2 (OH-): H+ + OH- → H2O. So, we have 0.08 moles H+ from HCl and 0.18 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. Wait, but the stoichiometry for Ba(OH)2 and HCl is 2:1? Because each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, and each HCl gives 1 H+. So maybe the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. Let me check.

Actually, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So the mole ratio is 2 HCl to 1 Ba(OH)2. But in terms of H+ and OH-, each mole of HCl gives 1 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-. So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. 

So comparing H+ and OH-: 0.08 vs 0.18. The OH- is in excess. So the H+ from HCl will neutralize an equal amount of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. Then, we have to consider the acetic acid. 

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. If there's excess OH- after neutralizing the HCl, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid. The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. 

So the OH- will first neutralize the strong acid (HCl), then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Let me confirm the order of neutralization. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will react first with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2). Then, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid. 

So let's go through the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 moles.
3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 moles H+ reacts with 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.
4. Now, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles.
5. The reaction is 1:1, so 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO-.
6. Remaining OH- after this reaction: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.
7. Now, the solution has excess OH- of 0.05 moles. So the solution is basic, and the pH is determined by the concentration of OH-.

Wait, but I need to check the total volume. The total volume after mixing is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. 

But let me verify again. Let's go step by step:

1. Moles of HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.
2. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.
3. Reaction between H+ and OH-: H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.
4. Now, moles of CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles.
5. OH- will react with CH3COOH: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH reacts with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.
6. Total OH- concentration: 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.
7. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

But wait, is there any other source of H+ or OH-? The acetic acid after reaction becomes acetate ion. But if there's excess OH-, then the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH-. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the neutralization steps. Let me check again. 

HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, contributing 0.18 moles OH-. When they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is H+ (0.08 moles), so 0.08 moles of OH- reacts with H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid is a weak acid, but OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate CH3COOH completely. So moles of CH3COOH is 0.05, and OH- is 0.10. So OH- is in excess here. Wait, 0.10 moles OH- minus 0.05 moles CH3COOH would leave 0.05 moles OH-.

So yes, after neutralizing all the HCl and then neutralizing part of the CH3COOH, we have 0.05 moles OH- left. Then, the pH is determined by the excess OH-. 

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. So the pH should be approximately 12.62. 

But wait, could there be any contribution from the acetate ion? If there's excess OH-, the solution is basic, and the acetate ion is a weak base. However, in the presence of excess OH-, the contribution from acetate hydrolysis would be negligible because the OH- concentration is already high (Le Chatelier's principle). So the pH is dominated by the excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62. Let me check if my calculations are correct.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the moles. Let's verify:

- HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 80 mmol = 0.08 mol. Correct.

- Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 90 mmol of Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 180 mmol OH- = 0.18 mol. Correct.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol. OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol. Neutralization: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH- → 0.08 mol H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. Correct.

CH3COOH: 500 mL * 0.1 M = 50 mmol = 0.05 mol. OH- reacts with CH3COOH 1:1, so 0.05 mol OH- used, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-. Correct.

Total volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417). Let's calculate that more accurately.

log(0.0417) = log(4.17 * 10^-2) = log(4.17) + (-2). log(4.17) ≈ 0.620. So log(0.0417) ≈ 0.620 - 2 = -1.38. Therefore, pOH = 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the pH is approximately 12.6. But let me check if perhaps the acetate ion contributes. The acetate ion concentration is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka for acetic acid is 1.8 * 10^-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.56e-10. 

The concentration of OH- from acetate hydrolysis would be sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.0417) ≈ sqrt(2.32e-11) ≈ 4.82e-6 M. pOH from this would be -log(4.82e-6) ≈ 5.32, pH ≈ 8.68. But this is much less than the excess OH- concentration we already have (0.0417 M, which is 4.17e-2 M). Therefore, the contribution from acetate hydrolysis is negligible compared to the excess OH-. So the pH is indeed determined by the excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 12.62, but sometimes pH is given to two decimal places. Let me confirm the exact value.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. The exact pOH is -log(0.041666...). Let's compute that.

0.041666... is 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667. So log(1/24) = -log(24). log(24) = log(2.4 * 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1 ≈ 0.3802 + 1 = 1.3802. Therefore, log(1/24) ≈ -1.3802, so pOH ≈ 1.3802, pH ≈ 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. 

Yes, so the pH is approximately 12.62. Depending on significant figures, the given concentrations are mostly to two decimal places, but the answer might need two decimal places. Alternatively, maybe round to two decimal places. So 12.62. 

Alternatively, if the question expects a different approach, but I think this is correct. Let me recap:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.
3. Neutralize H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol each, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.
4. Neutralize CH3COOH (0.05 mol) with remaining OH-: 0.05 mol OH- used, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.
5. Calculate [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.
6. Calculate pH as 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log(0.0417)) ≈ 12.62.

Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here. So the pH should be approximately 12.62.

Okay, so I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, let me think step by step. 

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they will react first. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so maybe it won't react as much unless there's excess base. Let me break it down.

Let me calculate the moles of each component first. For CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. 

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each formula unit releases 2 OH- ions. So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles. 

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles (since HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely). The H+ from CH3COOH might not contribute much because it's a weak acid, but maybe after the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, there could be some leftover acid or base. Let's see.

The reaction between HCl (H+) and Ba(OH)2 (OH-): H+ + OH- → H2O. So, we have 0.08 moles H+ from HCl and 0.18 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. Wait, but the stoichiometry for Ba(OH)2 and HCl is 2:1? Because each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, and each HCl gives 1 H+. So maybe the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. Let me check.

Actually, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So the mole ratio is 2 HCl to 1 Ba(OH)2. But in terms of H+ and OH-, each mole of HCl gives 1 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-. So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. 

So comparing H+ and OH-: 0.08 vs 0.18. The OH- is in excess. So the H+ from HCl will neutralize an equal amount of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. Then, we have to consider the acetic acid. 

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. If there's excess OH- after neutralizing the HCl, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid. The reac

I need to determine the pH of a solution created by combining 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I'll approach this systematically.

Initially, I'll calculate the moles of each substance. For CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles.

I need to consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases 2 OH- ions per formula unit. Therefore, the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 equals 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Since HCl is a strong acid that completely dissociates, it contributes 0.08 moles of H+. The acetic acid is weak and may not contribute significantly until after the reaction between the strong acid and base.

When examining the neutralization reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2, it follows this equation: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. While the mole ratio is 2:1 for HCl:Ba(OH)2, in terms of ions, we have 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl and 0.18 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Comparing these values (0.08 vs 0.18), I can see that OH- ions are in excess. After neutralization with HCl, there will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. These excess OH- ions will then react with the acetic acid, which is a weak acid.

Since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acetic acid. The reaction would be...

I need to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Let me approach this step by step.

First, acids and bases neutralize each other when mixed. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they react first. Acetic acid is weak and may not react significantly unless there’s leftover base. Let's analyze it further.

Now, I'll calculate the moles of each component. For CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles.

But, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each unit releases 2 OH- ions, so the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

The H+ from HCl totals 0.08 moles, as HCl fully dissociates. The H+ from CH3COOH may not contribute much since it’s weak, but excess base from neutralization might react with it. Let’s evaluate further.

The reaction between HCl (H+) and Ba(OH)2 (OH-): H+ + OH- → H2O. We have 0.08 moles H+ from HCl and 0.18 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. But the stoichiometry of Ba(OH)2 to HCl is 1:2, since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, and each HCl gives 1 H+. Let me verify this.

Actually, the reaction is: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. Thus, 2 HCl moles are needed for 1 Ba(OH)2 mole. In terms of H+ and OH-, each mole of HCl gives 1 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-. Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

Comparing H+ and OH-: 0.08 vs 0.18, leaving excess OH-. The 0.08 moles of H+ neutralizes the same amount of OH-, leaving 0.10 moles of OH- left over. Now, consider the acetic acid.

Since acetic acid is weak, any leftover OH- will react with it. The strong base (OH-) will deprotonate the weak acid, and we continue from there.

Let me confirm this. Yes, strong bases will neutralize strong acids first, then weak acids. So the excess OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- will react with the acetic acid. \n\nMoles of CH3COOH initially are 0.05 moles. The OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, OH- is in excess here. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. \n\nSo after all these reactions, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles. Now, we need to calculate the concentration of OH- in the total solution volume. \n\nThe total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. \n\nSo concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

However, since we have excess OH-, the solution will be strongly basic, so the contribution from CH3COO- hydrolysis would be negligible compared to the excess OH-. So pH is determined by the excess OH-. \n\nTherefore, the pH should be around 12.62. \n\nBut let me double-check the calculations. \n\n0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L is 0.041666... M. pOH = -log(0.041666).

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - Moles of CH3COOH: \(0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{moles}\)
   - Moles of HCl: \(0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{moles}\)
   - Moles of Ba(OH)2: \(0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles}\)
   - Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2: \(2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{moles}\)

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - HCl (strong acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (strong base):
     - H⁺ from HCl: 0.08 moles
     - OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles
     - Neutralization: \(0.08 \, \text{moles H⁺} + 0.08 \, \text{moles OH⁻} \rightarrow 0.08 \, \text{moles H₂O}\)
     - Remaining OH⁻: \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles}\)

3. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH3COOH:**
   - OH⁻ reacts with CH3COOH (weak acid):
     - Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles
     - Neutralization: \(0.05 \, \text{moles CH3COOH} + 0.05 \, \text{moles OH⁻} \rightarrow 0.05 \, \text{moles CH3COO⁻} + 0.05 \, \text{moles H₂O}\)
     - Remaining OH⁻: \(0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}\)

4. **Calculate the concentration of remaining OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of solution: \(500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}\)
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \(\frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH: \(-\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38\)
   - pH: \(14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62\)

The pH of the solution is \(\boxed{12.62}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

iton is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. 

So the OH- will first neutralize the strong acid (HCl) and then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Let me confirm this. Yes, strong bases will neutralize strong acids first, then weak acids. So the excess OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- will react with the acetic acid. 

Moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.05 moles. The OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, OH- is in excess here. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. 

So after all these reactions, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles. Now, we need to calculate the concentration of OH- in the total solution volume. 

The total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. 

So concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. 

Wait, but let me check my steps again. 

1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. Correct. 

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 moles. Correct. 

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 moles H2O. So remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Correct. 

4. Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Moles of CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. OH- (0.10) is more than CH3COOH (0.05), so all CH3COOH is neutralized, remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. Correct. 

5. Total volume 1.2 L. [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62. 

But wait, is there any other source of OH- or H+? The acetic acid after neutralization becomes CH3COO-, which is a conjugate base. However, since we have excess OH-, the solution will be strongly basic, so the contribution from CH3COO- hydrolysis would be negligible compared to the excess OH-. So pH is determined by the excess OH-. 

Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62. 

But let me double-check the calculations. 

0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L is 0.041666... M. pOH = -log(0.041666). Let me compute that. 

log(0.041666) is log(4.1666 × 10^-2) = log(4.1666) + (-2). Log(4.1666) is approximately 0.6198. So log(0.041666) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH ≈ 1.3802, so pH ≈ 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. 

Yes, that seems right. 

But wait, let me make sure that when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, the stoichiometry is 1:1. Yes, because each OH- takes one H+ from CH3COOH to form CH3COO- and water. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will consume 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. 

Therefore, the final concentration of OH- is indeed 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. 

So, the pH is approximately 12.62. 

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap all steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base. 

2. Neutralize strong acid (HCl) with strong base (Ba(OH)2). 

3. Then, remaining OH- neutralizes weak acid (CH3COOH). 

4. Calculate remaining OH- concentration. 

5. Convert to pH. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the pH should be around 12.62. 

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

So OH- will neutralize all the acetic acid and still have some left. Let's check:\n\n0.10 moles OH- - 0.05 moles CH3COOH = 0.05 moles OH- remaining. Then, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- would be 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nWait, the steps:\n\n1. Calculate moles H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.\n\n2. Calculate moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.\n\n3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.18 mol OH- → excess OH- of 0.10 mol.\n\n4. Then, the excess OH- (0.10 mol) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). The reaction is 1:1, so 0.05 mol CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH- remaining.\n\nTotal volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nBut wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. When OH- is added to it, it will deprotonate the acid, converting CH3COOH to CH3COO- and H2O. Since OH- is a strong base, this reaction goes to completion. Therefore, the moles of OH- will consume the moles of CH3COOH. Since there are 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles OH- initially, after reaction, there's 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- left.

The reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nSo moles of OH- consumed: 0.05 moles (since CH3COOH is 0.05). Therefore, remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nTotal solution volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nConcentration of OH-: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.\n\npOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.\n\npH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAnother way: total H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.\n\nTotal OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol.\n\nNet OH- after neutralizing H+ from HCl: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.1 mol.\n\nThen, this OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Since acetic acid is 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, adding 0.1 mol OH- to 0.05 mol CH3COOH: the OH- will deprotonate all the CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.\n\nTherefore, the remaining OH- concentration is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the dilution is accounted correctly. Let's see:\n\nTotal volume after mixing: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when we mix a strong base and a weak acid, the base will deprotonate the weak acid. But since the base is in excess, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH-.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that after adding the strong base and strong acid, and then the weak acid, but in reality, all components are mixed together, so the strong acid and strong base react first, then the excess base reacts with the weak acid.\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, leading to pH ≈ 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me double-check:\n\n500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 = 0.05 mol. Correct.\n\n400 mL of 0.2 M HCl: 0.4 × 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+.

Then, OH- reacting with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. Net OH- left: 0.05. Correct.\n\nYes, so the calculation seems accurate. Therefore, the pH should be approximately 12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, maybe three significant figures, but the given data has 1 or 2 significant figures? Let's check:\n\n500 mL (1 sig fig?), 0.1 M (1), 400 mL (1), 0.2 M (1), 300 mL (1), 0.3 M (1). So all initial data has one significant figure. But in reality, volumes like 500 mL might be considered as 3 sig figs (if written as 500. mL), but without a decimal, it's ambiguous. But given the problem statement, maybe it's exact volumes. However, in most cases, 500 mL is considered 3 sig figs. Wait, 500 mL could be 2 or 3. Similarly, 0.1 M is 1, 0.2 is 1, 0.3 is 1. So perhaps the answer should have 1 significant figure? But in pH, the decimal places are considered significant. Hmm. But the given data has 0.1, 0.2, 0.3: one decimal place but with one significant figure each. The volumes: 500, 400, 300 mL. If written without decimal, they could be considered one sig fig (if trailing zeros are not significant). But sometimes, 500 might be considered 3 sig figs. This is ambiguous. However, in textbook problems, often trailing zeros in numbers like 500 are considered significant if specified. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that 500 mL is 3 sig figs, 0.1 M is 1 sig fig. Then, when combining, the least number of sig figs would be 1. But pH is typically reported with two decimal places, but maybe here, given the data, we can write two decimal places. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be 12.6, but in the calculation, we get approximately 1.38 for pOH, which is 12.62. Let me check the exact calculation:\n\n[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.\n\npOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.3802.\n\npH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62.\n\nSo, 12.62 is accurate. Since the problem gives concentrations to one decimal place and volumes as whole numbers, maybe we can report two decimal places for pH. In any case, the answer is approximately 12.62.\n\nBut I need to confirm if there's any other factor I missed. For instance, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, does the acetate ion affect the pH? But since there's excess OH-, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration. The acetate ion is a weak base, but in the presence of excess strong base, its contribution to pH is negligible. Therefore, the pH is indeed governed by the remaining OH-.\n\nTherefore, the final pH is approximately 12.62.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386671, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2901, prompt_tokens=475, total_tokens=3376, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Let me write that: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of acetic acid are 0.05, and the moles of OH- excess are 0.10. However, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles, which is less than the OH- excess. So OH- will neutralize all the acetic acid and still have some left. Let's check:

0.10 moles OH- - 0.05 moles CH3COOH = 0.05 moles OH- remaining. Then, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- would be 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

Wait, the steps:

1. Calculate moles H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

2. Calculate moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.18 mol OH- → excess OH- of 0.10 mol.

4. Then, the excess OH- (0.10 mol) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). The reaction is 1:1, so 0.05 mol CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. When OH- is added to it, it will deprotonate the acid, converting CH3COOH to CH3COO- and H2O. Since OH- is a strong base, this reaction goes to completion. Therefore, the moles of OH- will consume the moles of CH3COOH. Since there are 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles OH- initially, after reaction, there's 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- left. Then, the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. So pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.

But wait, another way: after neutralizing HCl with Ba(OH)2, the remaining OH- is 0.10 mol. Then reacting with acetic acid: since acetic acid is a weak acid, but OH- is a strong base, so the reaction is quantitative. So yes, it's correct. However, perhaps I should check the stoichiometry again.

Wait, the reaction between H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2. Let's do that first.

HCl is a strong acid: 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

When H+ and OH- react: H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 moles H+ will react with 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So moles of OH- consumed: 0.05 moles (since CH3COOH is 0.05). Therefore, remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Total solution volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Concentration of OH-: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62.

But wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Another way: total H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Net OH- after neutralizing H+ from HCl: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.1 mol.

Then, this OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. Since acetic acid is 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.

So, adding 0.1 mol OH- to 0.05 mol CH3COOH: the OH- will deprotonate all the CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

Therefore, the remaining OH- concentration is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the dilution is accounted correctly. Let's see:

Total volume after mixing: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when we mix a strong base and a weak acid, the base will deprotonate the weak acid. But since the base is in excess, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH-.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, some might think that after adding the strong base and strong acid, and then the weak acid, but in reality, all components are mixed together, so the strong acid and strong base react first, then the excess base reacts with the weak acid.

Therefore, the final concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, leading to pH ≈ 12.62.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me double-check:

500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 = 0.05 mol. Correct.

400 mL of 0.2 M HCl: 0.4 × 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+. Correct.

300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol OH-. Correct.

H+ from HCl: 0.08. OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18. Net OH-: 0.10. Then, OH- reacting with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. Net OH- left: 0.05. Correct.

Yes, so the calculation seems accurate. Therefore, the pH should be approximately 12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, maybe three significant figures, but the given data has 1 or 2 significant figures? Let's check:

500 mL (1 sig fig?), 0.1 M (1), 400 mL (1), 0.2 M (1), 300 mL (1), 0.3 M (1). So all initial data has one significant figure. But in reality, volumes like 500 mL might be considered as 3 sig figs (if written as 500. mL), but without a decimal, it's ambiguous. But given the problem statement, maybe it's exact volumes. However, in most cases, 500 mL is considered 3 sig figs. Wait, 500 mL could be 2 or 3. Similarly, 0.1 M is 1, 0.2 is 1, 0.3 is 1. So perhaps the answer should have 1 significant figure? But in pH, the decimal places are considered significant. Hmm. But the given data has 0.1, 0.2, 0.3: one decimal place but with one significant figure each. The volumes: 500, 400, 300 mL. If written without decimal, they could be considered one sig fig (if trailing zeros are not significant). But sometimes, 500 might be considered 3 sig figs. This is ambiguous. However, in textbook problems, often trailing zeros in numbers like 500 are considered significant if specified. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that 500 mL is 3 sig figs, 0.1 M is 1 sig fig. Then, when combining, the least number of sig figs would be 1. But pH is typically reported with two decimal places, but maybe here, given the data, we can write two decimal places. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be 12.6, but in the calculation, we get approximately 1.38 for pOH, which is 12.62. Let me check the exact calculation:

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ 1.3802.

pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62.

So, 12.62 is accurate. Since the problem gives concentrations to one decimal place and volumes as whole numbers, maybe we can report two decimal places for pH. In any case, the answer is approximately 12.62.

But I need to confirm if there's any other factor I missed. For instance, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, does the acetate ion affect the pH? But since there's excess OH-, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration. The acetate ion is a weak base, but in the presence of excess strong base, its contribution to pH is negligible. Therefore, the pH is indeed governed by the remaining OH-.

Therefore, the final pH is approximately 12.62.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The excess OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10. So, OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is in excess, it will neutralize all CH3COOH and have remaining OH-.\n\nSo, moles of OH- after reacting with CH3COOH: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. Then, the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. But wait, let me verify each step again to ensure there's no mistake.\n\nWait, when mixing strong acid and strong base, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. Let me compute the stoichiometric amounts.\n\nHCl: 0.08 moles. Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles. The reaction requires 2 moles HCl per 1 mole Ba(OH)2. So, for 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, required HCl is 0.18 moles. But only 0.08 moles HCl are available. Therefore, HCl is the limiting reagent. So, all HCl (0.08) will react with Ba(OH)2. Let me compute how much Ba(OH)2 is consumed.\n\nSince the ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2, 0.08 moles HCl will react with 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2. Therefore, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-, so remaining OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- will react with CH3COOH.\n\nCH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base (OH-), it will be neutralized. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05, and OH- is 0.10. So, OH- is in excess here. All 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.\n\nNow, total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log10(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

So pOH is 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me confirm the steps again. First, HCl (0.08 moles H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 moles, providing 0.18 OH-). The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So, 0.08 H+ will neutralize 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, that OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). The OH- is in excess here, so all CH3COOH is neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 OH-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of considering the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2 as a 2:1 reaction is more accurate. Let me see. The balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So, for every 2 moles of HCl, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is consumed. So, if I have 0.08 moles HCl, that would require 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2. Therefore, after reaction, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles. Then, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So, same result as before.\n\nHence, the remaining OH- after neutralizing CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. Then, the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, when you write the balanced equation, you get that 2 moles of HCl (which provides 2 H+) react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 (which provides 2 OH-). Wait, but in reality, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, perhaps the stoichiometry is 1:1 between H+ and OH-.\n\nWait, but the confusion arises because Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole. So, when reacting with HCl (which provides 1 H+ per mole), the balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So, 2 moles of HCl (each with 1 H+) react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 (with 2 OH-). So, the ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2, which is equivalent to 2 H+ : 2 OH-, so 1:1 ratio. Therefore, in terms of H+ and OH-, the moles of H+ and OH- should react in 1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify. Let's think in terms of H+ and OH-.\n\nHCl is a strong acid, so 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nBa(OH)2 is a strong base, so 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, each providing 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nSo total H+ = 0.08, total OH- = 0.18. When H+ and OH- react, they do so 1:1. So, 0.08 moles H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n\nThen, this excess OH- will react with the acetic acid. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, the strong base will deprotonate it: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 (from 0.5 L * 0.1 M). The OH- available is 0.10, so it will neutralize all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nNow, total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. That seems correct.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check the steps again. HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong acid and base. Their reaction produces H2O and the respective salts. The H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize each other. The excess OH- then neutralizes the acetic acid. Since OH- is a stronger base than CH3COO-, it will deprotonate CH3COOH completely. Then, the remaining OH- determines the pH. So, the calculation seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the solution after mixing is basic enough. Since there's excess OH-, the pH is definitely above 7. The calculation gives pH ≈ 12.62, which is reasonable for a 0.04 M OH- concentration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check again:\n\nHCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nH+ + OH- → H2O. So, H+ and OH- react 1:1. So, 0.08 H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.\n\nThen, CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. This reacts with OH- (0.10 moles) in 1:1 ratio, so 0.05 moles of CH3COOH reacts, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nTotal volume 1.2 L. [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.\n\nYes, this seems correct. So, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62. Therefore, the answer would be \\boxed{12.62}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculation for the logarithm. Let's compute [OH-] exactly: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **CH₃COOH:** \(0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{moles}\)
   - **HCl:** \(0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{moles H⁺}\)
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** \(0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles Ba(OH)₂}\), which provides \(2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{moles OH⁻}\)

2. **Neutralization reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)₂:**
   - The reaction is \(2 \, \text{HCl} + \text{Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow \text{BaCl₂} + 2 \, \text{H₂O}\).
   - Moles of H⁺ from HCl: \(0.08\)
   - Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: \(0.18\)
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ react in a 1:1 ratio, neutralizing \(0.08 \, \text{moles}\) of each, leaving \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles OH⁻}\).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**

   - Moles of CH₃COOH: \(0.05\)
   - Excess OH⁻: \(0.10\)
   - OH⁻ neutralizes all \(0.05 \, \text{moles}\) of CH₃COOH, leaving \(0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles OH⁻}\).

   - Total volume: \(500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}\)
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \(\frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Determine pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \)

Let me check.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The excess OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10. So, OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is in excess, it will neutralize all CH3COOH and have remaining OH-.

So, moles of OH- after reacting with CH3COOH: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. Then, the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. But wait, let me verify each step again to ensure there's no mistake.

Wait, when mixing strong acid and strong base, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. Let me compute the stoichiometric amounts.

HCl: 0.08 moles. Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles. The reaction requires 2 moles HCl per 1 mole Ba(OH)2. So, for 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, required HCl is 0.18 moles. But only 0.08 moles HCl are available. Therefore, HCl is the limiting reagent. So, all HCl (0.08) will react with Ba(OH)2. Let me compute how much Ba(OH)2 is consumed.

Since the ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2, 0.08 moles HCl will react with 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2. Therefore, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-, so remaining OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base (OH-), it will be neutralized. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05, and OH- is 0.10. So, OH- is in excess here. All 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Now, total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log10(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when you have 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L, that's 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. Taking the negative log: log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38. So pOH is 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That seems correct.

But let me confirm the steps again. First, HCl (0.08 moles H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 moles, providing 0.18 OH-). The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So, 0.08 H+ will neutralize 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, that OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). The OH- is in excess here, so all CH3COOH is neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of considering the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2 as a 2:1 reaction is more accurate. Let me see. The balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So, for every 2 moles of HCl, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is consumed. So, if I have 0.08 moles HCl, that would require 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2. Therefore, after reaction, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles. Then, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 moles. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So, same result as before.

Hence, the remaining OH- after neutralizing CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. Then, the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. That seems correct.

Wait, but in the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, when you write the balanced equation, you get that 2 moles of HCl (which provides 2 H+) react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 (which provides 2 OH-). Wait, but in reality, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, perhaps the stoichiometry is 1:1 between H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the confusion arises because Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole. So, when reacting with HCl (which provides 1 H+ per mole), the balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. So, 2 moles of HCl (each with 1 H+) react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 (with 2 OH-). So, the ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2, which is equivalent to 2 H+ : 2 OH-, so 1:1 ratio. Therefore, in terms of H+ and OH-, the moles of H+ and OH- should react in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify. Let's think in terms of H+ and OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, each providing 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

So total H+ = 0.08, total OH- = 0.18. When H+ and OH- react, they do so 1:1. So, 0.08 moles H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, this excess OH- will react with the acetic acid. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, the strong base will deprotonate it: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 (from 0.5 L * 0.1 M). The OH- available is 0.10, so it will neutralize all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.

Now, total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. That seems correct.

But to confirm, let's check the steps again. HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong acid and base. Their reaction produces H2O and the respective salts. The H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize each other. The excess OH- then neutralizes the acetic acid. Since OH- is a stronger base than CH3COO-, it will deprotonate CH3COOH completely. Then, the remaining OH- determines the pH. So, the calculation seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the solution after mixing is basic enough. Since there's excess OH-, the pH is definitely above 7. The calculation gives pH ≈ 12.62, which is reasonable for a 0.04 M OH- concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check again:

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

H+ + OH- → H2O. So, H+ and OH- react 1:1. So, 0.08 H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. This reacts with OH- (0.10 moles) in 1:1 ratio, so 0.05 moles of CH3COOH reacts, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.

Total volume 1.2 L. [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62.

Yes, this seems correct. So, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62. Therefore, the answer would be \boxed{12.62}.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculation for the logarithm. Let's compute [OH-] exactly: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. Taking log(0.041666...) = log(1/24) ≈ log(0.0416667). Let's compute this more accurately.

log(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log(4.16667) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. Therefore, pOH = 1.3802, so pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. So, yes, pH is approximately 12.62.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{12.62}.
