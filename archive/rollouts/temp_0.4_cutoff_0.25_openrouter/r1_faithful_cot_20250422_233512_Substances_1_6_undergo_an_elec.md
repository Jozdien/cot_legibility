To determine the order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:

1. **Meta-directing groups** (deactivating): These substituents direct bromine to the meta position, resulting in **0% para-isomer** yield. This includes:
   - **C₆H₅-NO₂ (4)**: Strongly deactivating meta-director.
   - **C₆H₅-COOH (6)**: Deactivating meta-director (carboxylic acid).
   - **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (2)**: Deactivating meta-director (ester).

2. **Ortho/para-directing groups**: These substituents direct bromine to the ortho and para positions. However, the problem assumes **only one monobromo product is formed**, implying **100% para-isomer** yield due to steric or electronic factors favoring para substitution. This includes:
   - **C₆H₅-Cl (3)**: Deactivating but ortho/para-directing (chlorine).
   - **C₆H₅-CH₃ (1)**: Activating ortho/para-directing (methyl).
   - **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (5)**: Activating ortho/para-directing (ethyl, bulkier than methyl).

**Ordering**:
- **Meta-directing groups** are ordered by increasing deactivating strength (weakest to strongest): **COOC₂H₅ (2) < COOH (6) < NO₂ (4)**. However, since all yield 0% para, their order is based on substituent strength.
- **Ortho/para-directing groups** are ordered by increasing activating strength (weakest to strongest): **Cl (3) < CH₃ (1) < C₂H₅ (5)**.

**Final Order** (increasing para-isomer yield):  
**4 (C₆H₅-NO₂) < 6 (C₆H₅-COOH) < 2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) < 3 (C₆H₅-Cl) < 1 (C₆H₅-CH₃) < 5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)**.

\boxed{4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, let's start by recalling what determines the para versus ortho/ meta orientation in electrophilic aromatic substitution. 

First, the substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups like -CH3 (methyl) or -C2H5 (ethyl) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups like -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -COOC2H5 (ester), and -Cl (chloro) can be meta-directing or para-directing. Wait, but some deactivating groups are actually ortho/para directors. For example, -Cl is deactivating but still ortho/para directing because of its electronegativity. Whereas groups like -NO2 and -COOH are meta-directing because they are strong deactivators. 

So, the substituent's directing effect will influence where the bromine adds. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, then the bromine can add in either ortho or para positions. But if it's meta-directing, the bromine will add in the meta position. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case. That must mean that for some substituents, even if they are ortho/para directors, perhaps steric hindrance or other factors make only the para isomer possible. Wait, but how?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So maybe in each case, regardless of directing effects, only one product is possible. But that seems contradictory unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, in para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's meta-directing, but if the substituent is in a position where the meta is already occupied? No, no. Wait, maybe the substituent is such that the ring is symmetrical, so that ortho and para positions are equivalent. For example, if the substituent is in the para position, then the ortho positions would be equivalent. Wait, but in the given compounds, all substituents are attached to the benzene ring as a single substituent. For example, C6H5-CH3 is toluene. So, the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. When bromination occurs, the directing effect of the methyl group (which is ortho/para) would lead to bromine adding in ortho or para positions. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that perhaps the substituent is in such a position that the ortho and para positions are equivalent, leading to only one product. But toluene is monosubstituted, so when you add bromine, you can have ortho, meta, or para. Wait, but methyl is ortho/para directing, so meta isn't possible. So, bromine would add ortho or para to the methyl group. But if both ortho and para positions are possible, how can only one product form? That doesn't make sense unless there's some kind of steric hindrance making the ortho positions less accessible. But methyl isn't that bulky. Wait, maybe in some cases, the substituent is so bulky that the ortho positions are not favored, so only para is formed. For example, in toluene, maybe when brominating, you get a mixture of ortho and para, but the problem says only one product is formed. Hmm, maybe the question is simplifying things, assuming that even if there are ortho and para possibilities, only the para is formed? Or perhaps the reaction conditions favor para. Wait, but the question states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So maybe each substituent directs in such a way that either ortho and para are equivalent (like if the substituent is in a position that makes ortho and para the same due to symmetry), but in a monosubstituted benzene, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the bromine can only add in the meta position, leading to one product. But for ortho/para directors, if the substituent is such that the ortho positions are blocked, then only para is possible. But how?

Wait, maybe the key here is that when there's a substituent that is a strong para director, even if it's ortho/para directing, perhaps the para product is the major one. But the problem says only one product is formed. Maybe the question is hypothetical, assuming that regardless of actual directing effects, each substituent leads to only one product. So, for example, if the substituent is meta-directing, then bromine adds meta, but since the substituent is at a certain position, the meta position is unique. Wait, but in a monosubstituted benzene, the meta position relative to the substituent would lead to three possible positions? No, no. Let me think again. For a monosubstituted benzene, if the substituent is a meta director, then the incoming electrophile will add in the meta position relative to the substituent. However, in a monosubstituted benzene, there are two equivalent meta positions. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a benzene ring with one substituent X, then the positions are labeled as follows: positions 2, 4, and 6 are ortho, meta, and para relative to X. Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a monosubstituted benzene, the positions adjacent to the substituent (positions 2 and 6) are ortho, the next ones (positions 3 and 5) are meta, and the opposite position (4) is para. So, if the substituent is in position 1, then:

1 (substituent)

Positions:

2: ortho

3: meta

4: para

5: meta

6: ortho

So, if the substituent is a meta director, the bromine would add in positions 3 or 5. But those are equivalent, so the product would be a single isomer (since positions 3 and 5 are equivalent through rotation). Wait, but actually, no. If the substituent is in position 1, and bromine adds in position 3, then rotating the ring 120 degrees would make the substituent in position 3 and bromine in position 5. But in reality, the molecule is planar, so the positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. Therefore, when a meta director is present, the bromine adds to the meta position, and due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, there's only one possible product. Similarly, if the substituent is ortho/para directing, then bromine can add to ortho or para. But in that case, adding to ortho (positions 2 or 6) would lead to two equivalent positions, and para (position 4) is unique. So, if both ortho and para are possible, there would be two products. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, maybe in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible, or only ortho. But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that for certain substituents, the para product is the only one formed, even if ortho is possible. But that's not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that blocks the ortho positions. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, then the ortho positions are hindered, and only para is formed. But in the given compounds, the substituents are -CH3 (1), -COOC2H5 (2), -Cl (3), -NO2 (4), -C2H5 (5), -COOH (6). Among these, which are bulky? The ester group (COOC2H5) and ethyl group (C2H5) might be more bulky than methyl. So maybe in those cases, the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para substitution. Whereas for methyl and chlorine, which are less bulky, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one product is formed. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the actual number of products but about the assumption. The problem states "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So regardless of the directing effects, we are to assume that each reaction gives only one product. Therefore, the actual directing effect might influence whether that product is para or meta. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the product is meta-bromo, but due to the problem's assumption, only one product is formed. But wait, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would add meta, but as I thought earlier, in a monosubstituted benzene, adding meta would lead to two equivalent positions (3 and 5), but they are equivalent, so it's considered one product. Similarly, if the substituent is ortho/para directing, then adding para would be one product, and adding ortho would be two equivalent positions. But the problem says only one product is formed. So maybe for ortho/para directors, the para product is the only one formed. But why? Because maybe the reaction conditions favor para, or the problem is simplifying. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that the para position is the only one possible. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group that is para-directing, but also bulky, leading to para being the major product. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that when you have a substituent that is a meta director, the para position is not activated, so the bromine adds meta. But in that case, the product would be meta-substituted, and since there are two equivalent meta positions, it's considered one product. For ortho/para directors, if the substituent is such that para is the major product (like in the case of very bulky groups), then para is formed. So perhaps the key here is to determine for each substituent whether it's meta or ortho/para directing, and then whether the product is para or meta. Then, the yield of the para isomer would depend on that.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine adds meta, so the para-isomer's yield would be zero. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, then the para-isomer would be a fraction of the total product (along with ortho). But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So maybe in each case, the substituent is either meta-directing (leading to meta product, which is one isomer) or para-directing (leading to para product only). But how? Because typically, ortho/para directors lead to a mixture. Unless steric hindrance prevents ortho substitution, making para the only product. So, for example, in toluene (substituent -CH3), which is ortho/para directing, but if the methyl group is bulky enough, the para product is favored. But methyl is not that bulky. However, maybe in the case of ethyl (C2H5), which is larger, the para product is the major one. Similarly, the ester group (COOC2H5) is bulky, so para is favored. The nitro group (NO2) is meta-directing, so the product is meta. The chlorine is ortho/para directing but deactivating. The carboxylic acid (COOH) is meta-directing. So, let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): ortho/para directing (activating). If bulky, para is major. But methyl is not very bulky, so maybe ortho and para are possible. But the problem says only one product is formed. So perhaps for methyl, the para product is the only one? Or maybe the problem is assuming that all ortho/para directors give para products, which is not accurate, but maybe for the sake of the problem.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): the ester group is meta-directing (since it's a deactivating group). Wait, no. Wait, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it's deactivating and meta-directing. Therefore, bromine would add meta. So the product is meta-bromo ethyl benzoate. But as I thought earlier, in a monosubstituted benzene, the meta positions are equivalent, so only one product is formed. So the para-isomer yield is zero.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): chlorine is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So bromine would add ortho or para. But the problem says only one product is formed. So perhaps in this case, the para product is the only one? But why? Chlorine is not that bulky. Unless the problem assumes that for deactivating ortho/para directors, para is favored. But in reality, chlorobenzene bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para, with para being major because of less steric hindrance. So maybe in the problem's assumption, para is the only product.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): nitro is a strong meta-directing group. So bromine adds meta, leading to one product (meta-bromo-nitrobenzene). Therefore, para-isomer yield is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): ethyl is an activating group, ortho/para directing. Since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, the para product is favored. So maybe in this case, the para product is the only one formed. So para-bromoethylbenzene.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxylic acid is a strong meta-directing group (deactivating). So bromine adds meta, leading to meta-bromo-benzoic acid. Para-isomer yield is zero.

Now, the question is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, we need to determine for each substance whether the para-isomer is formed or not. From the above:

Substances with meta-directing groups (2,4,6) will have para-isomer yield 0%.

Substances with ortho/para directing groups (1,3,5) will have para-isomer yield, but since the problem states only one product is formed, perhaps for these, the para-isomer is 100%? Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is ortho/para directing, but only one product is formed, which could be either para only or ortho only. But in reality, if only one product is formed, it's more likely para because para is less hindered. So maybe in the problem's assumption, all ortho/para directors give para products, leading to 100% para. Whereas meta directors give 0% para. So then the order would be based on whether they are meta or ortho/para directors.

But wait, that would mean that substances 2,4,6 have 0% para, and 1,3,5 have 100% para. Therefore, the order of increasing para yield would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So from lowest to highest. So the order would be 2,4,6 come first (0%), then 1,3,5 (100%). But we need to arrange all six in order. However, maybe among the ortho/para directors, there are differences. For example, some might have higher para yields than others. But according to the problem's assumption, only one product is formed, so maybe all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But that's not realistic, but perhaps the problem wants that.

Alternatively, maybe the para yield depends on the activating strength. For example, stronger activating groups might have higher para yields. But I'm not sure. Wait, but in reality, the para/ortho ratio depends on the substituent. For example, in toluene, the ratio might be around 60% para and 40% ortho. But the problem says only one product is formed. So perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that for some substituents, the para is the only product, and for others, meta is the only product. Therefore, the para yield is either 0% (for meta directors) or 100% (for ortho/para directors). But then how to order them? All meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%, and ortho/para (1,3,5) have 100%. So the order from lowest to highest would be 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But how to order within the groups? Since they all have the same value. Maybe the problem considers other factors. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that even among the ortho/para directors, steric hindrance affects the yield. For example, ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1) and Cl (3), so maybe the para yield is higher for ethyl than for methyl and Cl. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then maybe all three have 100% para. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some substituents are more deactivating, leading to lower reactivity, but since the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in the product, not the overall yield. So even if the reaction is slower, if the product is 100% para, then the weight fraction is 100%.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's yield is influenced by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to more para product. But again, if the problem assumes only one product, then it's either 0 or 100%.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the problem statement:

"Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer."

It says "weight fraction of the yield", so it's about how much para is formed relative to other isomers. But the problem also states "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So in each case, the reaction produces only one product. Therefore, the para-isomer is either 0% (if the product is meta) or 100% (if the product is para). Therefore, the substances can be divided into two groups:

- Those where para is formed (100%): ortho/para directors where only para is formed.

- Those where meta is formed (0% para): meta directors.

But wait, no. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, and only one product is formed, that must be para (since ortho would give two isomers, but the problem says only one). Wait, no. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, and the product is ortho, then since there are two ortho positions (positions 2 and 6), but they are equivalent, so only one product. Similarly, para is a single position. So if the problem says only one product is formed, it could be either ortho or para. But how to determine which?

Ah, perhaps the key is that when the substituent is strongly activating and not bulky, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one is formed. Therefore, maybe for certain substituents, the para is the only product. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group and para-directing, but I think all activating groups are ortho/para directors. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept that when there is a substituent that is a meta director, the para position is not activated, so bromine doesn't add there. For ortho/para directors, the para position is activated, so bromine adds there. But if the substituent is deactivating but ortho/para directing (like Cl), then maybe the para is still possible. But in that case, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para directing, so bromine adds ortho or para. But the problem says only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is formed exclusively, and for meta directors, the meta is formed. Therefore, the para yield would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors.

But then the order would be:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para.

Substances with ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para.

So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves and 1,3,5 among themselves? Since they all have the same para yield within their groups. But maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let's check each substituent's directing effect again:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl is activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester group is deactivating (due to carbonyl), meta director.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is deactivating (due to electronegativity), but ortho/para director (due to lone pairs).

4) C6H5-NO2: nitro is deactivating, meta director.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl is activating (alkyl group), ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid is deactivating (due to -COOH), meta director.

So, substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors (activating or deactivating), so their para yield is 100% (assuming the problem's condition of only one product, which would be para). Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so para yield is 0%.

Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:

2 (0%), 4 (0%), 6 (0%), 1 (100%), 3 (100%), 5 (100%).

But the problem asks to arrange all six in order. So the order would be 2 < 4 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5? But why would 2,4,6 be ordered among themselves? Since they all have 0% para. Maybe there's another factor. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that even among meta directors, there's a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and there's another factor. Maybe the substituent's position affects the para yield even among meta directors. But no, if it's a meta director, the para position is not activated, so no product there. Therefore, their para yield is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some substituents are more deactivating than others, leading to lower reactivity, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in the product, not the overall yield. So even if the reaction is slower, if the product is 100% para, the weight fraction is 100%. Therefore, the order would be:

First the meta directors (2,4,6) in any order, then the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) in any order. But the problem likely expects a specific order. Maybe based on the strength of the directing effect. For example, among the meta directors, nitro is a stronger meta director than COOH or COOC2H5, but how does that affect para yield? It doesn't, since para is not formed. Similarly, among ortho/para directors, maybe the activating groups (1 and 5) have higher para yields than the deactivating ortho/para director (Cl, 3). But in reality, Cl being deactivating might lead to lower para yield compared to activating groups. But the problem says only one product is formed, so maybe all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But in reality, for example, chlorobenzene bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para, with para being major. If the problem assumes only para is formed, then Cl would have 100% para. Similarly, toluene and ethylbenzene would also have 100% para. Therefore, the order remains 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the answer needs to have all six in order. So maybe the order is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

But why this order within the groups? Maybe within the meta directors, the para yield is zero for all, but perhaps the problem wants them ordered based on their deactivating strength or something else. But that doesn't affect the para yield. Similarly, within the ortho/para directors, maybe ethyl is more bulky than methyl and Cl, leading to higher para yield, but the problem says only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the order within ortho/para directors is based on the substituent's ability to direct para. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the problem might consider that the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. For example, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), so maybe higher para yield. But again, the problem states only one product is formed. So perhaps the order is based on the assumption that all ortho/para directors give 100% para, so they are equivalent. But the answer likely expects a specific order, so perhaps the order is:

Increasing para yield: 6 (COOH, 0%) < 4 (NO2, 0%) < 2 (COOC2H5, 0%) < 3 (Cl, 100%) < 1 (CH3, 100%) < 5 (C2H5, 100%)

But why this order? Maybe based on the strength of the deactivating effect. Wait, but how does that relate to para yield? It doesn't. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that among the meta directors, some might have a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in classifying the ester group. Wait, the ester group is -COOC2H5. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, so the ester is meta-directing. Correct. So 2 is meta director. Nitro is meta, carboxylic acid is meta. So those three have 0% para. The others are ortho/para. So their para is 100%. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But how to order 2,4,6? Maybe based on the substituent's priority or alphabetical order, but that's not relevant. Alternatively, the problem might order them based on the strength of the deactivating effect: nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid, which is stronger than ester. But I'm not sure. The same with the activating groups: ethyl is more activating than methyl, which is more activating than Cl (which is deactivating but ortho/para). Wait, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. So among the ortho/para directors, Cl is deactivating, while methyl and ethyl are activating. So maybe the para yield is higher for activating groups than for deactivating ones. But the problem says only one product is formed, so para is 100% for all. Therefore, within the ortho/para directors, the order might be based on the activating strength: Cl (weakest activator) < methyl < ethyl. So the order of increasing para yield would be:

meta directors (0%): 2,4,6

then ortho/para directors ordered by activating strength (Cl < CH3 < C2H5), but since all have 100%, the order would be based on the assumption that the activating strength affects the para yield. But since they are all 100%, it's not clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the order based on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state leading to para substitution. For example, stronger activating groups lead to higher para yield. But again, the problem states only one product, so it's 100%. 

I think the intended answer is that the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

But I'm not entirely sure why 2,4,6 are ordered that way. Maybe based on the substituent's deactivating strength: nitro is the strongest deactivator, then carboxylic acid, then ester. So the order would be 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5). But then among the meta directors, nitro is strongest, so it's first. Then COOH, then ester. So the order would be 4 < 6 < 2. Then the ortho/para directors: Cl is deactivating, so maybe lower para yield than activating groups. But the problem says only one product is formed. Wait, but Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. In reality, chlorobenzene bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para, with para being major. But the problem says only one product, so maybe para. Therefore, Cl would have 100% para. So the order among ortho/para directors might be based on activating strength: Cl (deactivating) < CH3 (activating) < C2H5 (more activating). Therefore, the order would be 3 < 1 < 5. So overall:

4 (NO2, 0%) < 6 (COOH, 0%) < 2 (COOC2H5, 0%) < 3 (Cl, 100%) < 1 (CH3, 100%) < 5 (C2H5, 100%)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the order of meta directors could be based on alphabetical order or the order given in the problem. The substances are listed as 2) COOC2H5, 4) NO2, 6) COOH. If we follow the order given in the problem for meta directors, it's 2,4,6. But why would that matter? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that among the meta directors, the para position's yield isn't exactly zero. For example, maybe some small amount of para is formed even with meta directors. But the problem states only one product is formed, so that's not possible. 

Given the confusion, I think the safest answer is to group the meta directors first (2,4,6) in any order, followed by the ortho/para directors (1,3,5). But since the problem likely expects a specific order, I'll proceed with the assumption that within the meta directors, the order is based on the substituent's deactivating strength (strongest first), leading to 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5). Then among the ortho/para directors, the order is based on activating strength: Cl (weakest, being deactivating) < CH3 < C2H5. Therefore, the final order is:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to recall that para substitution is favored by bulky groups because ortho is sterically hindered. So among the ortho/para directors, the more bulky the group, the higher the para yield. So:

For ortho/para directors:

- Cl is not bulky, so maybe lower para yield.

- CH3 is less bulky than C2H5.

So the order would be Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield would be meta directors (2,4,6) followed by ortho/para directors ordered by increasing bulk (and thus increasing para yield): 3 < 1 < 5.

But since the problem states that only one product is formed, maybe all ortho/para directors give 100% para, so their order doesn't matter. Therefore, the answer is:

2 < 4 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5

But this is conflicting. I think I need to check a reference. For example, in the case of ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5), bromination would occur meta, so para yield 0%. Nitrobenzene brominates meta, 0% para. Benzoic acid brominates meta, 0% para. Chlorobenzene brominates mainly para (assuming only para is formed), toluene brominates mainly para (if only para is formed), ethylbenzene brominates mainly para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

Nitro (4), COOH (6), COOC2H5 (2) [all 0%], then Cl (3), CH3 (1), C2H5 (5) [all 100%]. But why would COOC2H5 be after COOH? Maybe because the ester is less deactivating than COOH, but still meta director. 

Alternatively, the order of meta directors could be based on their deactivating strength: nitro (strongest) > COOH > COOC2H5. Therefore, their para yields are all 0%, but their order in the list might be based on that. So 4 < 6 < 2. Then the ortho/para directors: Cl (deactivating), CH3 (activating), C2H5 (more activating). If we consider that activating groups have higher para yields, then among ortho/para directors, the order is Cl (100%) < CH3 (100%) < C2H5 (100%), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the problem considers that more activating groups lead to higher para yield, but since all are 100%, it's the same. 

I think the intended answer is:

The meta directors (2,4,6) come first in the order of their strength as deactivators (strongest first: NO2, COOH, COOC2H5), then the ortho/para directors in the order of their activating strength (weakest first: Cl, CH3, C2H5). Therefore:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

This seems plausible. So the final answer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5. Wait, but why COOC2H5 after COOH? Because COOH is a stronger deactivator than COOC2H5. Yes, carboxylic acid is more deactivating than ester. Therefore, in terms of deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. So their order is 4, 6, 2. Then the ortho/para directors: Cl is deactivating, so maybe lower para yield than activating groups. But the problem says only one product, so all ortho/para directors have 100% para. But if we consider that Cl being deactivating might lead to lower reactivity but same para fraction, then the order among them doesn't matter. However, the problem might expect the order based on the substituent's own properties. For example, alkyl groups are stronger activators than Cl (which is deactivating). So maybe the activating groups (CH3, C2H5) have higher priority than deactivating ortho/para director (Cl). But since all have 100% para, it's unclear. 

Given all this, I think the correct order is:

4 (C6H5-NO2) < 6 (C6H5-COOH) < 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5) < 3 (C6H5-Cl) < 1 (C6H5-CH3) < 5 (C6H5-C2H5)

So the answer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, let's start by recalling what determines the para versus ortho/ meta orientation in electrophilic aromatic substitution. 

First, the substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups like -CH3 (methyl) or -C2H5 (ethyl) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups like -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -COOC2H5 (ester), and -Cl (chloro) can be meta-directing or para-directing. Wait, but some deactivating groups are actually ortho/para directors. For example, -Cl is deactivating but still ortho/para directing because of its electronegativity. Whereas groups like -NO2 and -COOH are meta-directing because they are strong deactivators. 

So, the substituent's directing effect will influence where the bromine adds. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, then the bromine can add in either ortho or para positions. But if it's meta-directing, the bromine will add in the meta position. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case. That must mean that for some substituents, even if they are ortho/para directors, perhaps steric hindrance or other factors make only the para isomer possible. Wait, but how?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So maybe in each case, regardless of directing effects, only one product is possible. But that seems contradictory unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, in para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's meta-directing, but if the substituent is in a position where the meta is already occupied? No, no. Wait, maybe the substituent is such that the ring is symmetrical, so that ortho and para positions are equivalent. For example, if the substituent is in the para position, then the ortho positions would be equivalent. Wait, but in the given compounds, all substituents are attached to the benzene ring as a single substituent. For example, C6H5-CH3 is toluene. So, the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. When bromination occurs, the directing effect of the methyl group (which is ortho/para) would lead to bromine adding in ortho or para positions. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that perhaps the substituent is in such a position that the ortho and para positions are equivalent, leading to only one product. But toluene is monosubstituted, so when you add bromine, you can have ortho, meta, or para. Wait, but methyl is ortho/para directing, so meta isn't possible. So, bromine would add ortho or para to the methyl group. But if both ortho and para positions are possible, how can only one product form? That doesn't make sense unless there's some kind of steric hindrance making the ortho positions less accessible. But methyl isn't that bulky. Wait, maybe in some cases, the substituent is so bulky that the ortho positions are not favored, so only para is formed. For example, in toluene, maybe when brominating, you get a mixture of ortho and para, but the problem says only one product is formed. Hmm, maybe the question is simplifying things, assuming that even if there are ortho and para possibilities, only the para is formed? Or perhaps the reaction conditions favor para. Wait, but the question states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So maybe each substituent directs in such a way that either ortho and para are equivalent (like if the substituent is in a position that makes ortho and para the same due to symmetry), but in a monosubstituted benzene, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the bromine can only add in the meta position, leading to one product. But for ortho/para directors, if the substituent is such that the ortho positions are blocked, then only para is possible. But how?

Wait, maybe the key here is that when there's a substituent that is a strong para director, even if it's ortho/para directing, perhaps the para product is the major one. But the problem says only one product is formed. Maybe the question is hypothetical, assuming that regardless of actual directing effects, each substituent leads to only one product. So, for example, if the substituent is meta-directing, then bromine adds meta, but since the substituent is at a certain position, the meta position is unique. Wait, but in a monosubstituted benzene, the meta position relative to the substituent would lead to three possible positions? No, no. Let me think again. For a monosubstituted benzene, if the substituent is a meta director, then the incoming electrophile will add in the meta position relative to the substituent. However, in a monosubstituted benzene, there are two equivalent meta positions. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a benzene ring with one substituent X, then the positions are labeled as follows: positions 2, 4, and 6 are ortho, meta, and para relative to X. Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a monosubstituted benzene, the positions adjacent to the substituent (positions 2 and 6) are ortho, the next ones (positions 3 and 5) are meta, and the opposite position (4) is para. So, if the substituent is in position 1, then:

1 (substituent)

Positions:

2: ortho

3: meta

4: para

5: meta

6: ortho

So, if the substituent is a meta director, the bromine would add in positions 3 or 5. But those are equivalent, so the product would be a single isomer (since positions 3 and 5 are equivalent through rotation). Wait, but actually, no. If the substituent is in position 1, and bromine adds in position 3, then rotating the ring 120 degrees would make the substituent in position 3 and bromine in position 5. But in reality, the molecule is planar, so the positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. Therefore, when a meta director is present, the bromine adds to the meta position, and due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, there's only one possible product. Similarly, if the substituent is ortho/para directing, then bromine can add to ortho or para. But in that case, adding to ortho (positions 2 or 6) would lead to two equivalent positions, and para (position 4) is unique. So, if both ortho and para are possible, there would be two products. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, maybe in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible, or only ortho. But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that for certain substituents, the para product is the only one formed, even if ortho is possible. But that's not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that blocks the ortho positions. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, then the ortho positions are hindered, and only para is formed. But in the given compounds, the substituents are -CH3 (1), -COOC2H5 (2), -Cl (3), -NO2 (4), -C2H5 (5), -COOH (6). Among these, which are bulky? The ester group (COOC2H5) and ethyl group (C2H5) might be more bulky than methyl. So maybe in those cases, the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para substitution. Whereas for methyl and chlorine, which are less bulky, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one product is formed. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the actual number of products but about the assumption. The problem states "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So regardless of the directing effects, we are to assume that each reaction gives only one product. Therefore, the actual directing effect might influence whether that product is

# Anthropic completion

I'll now analyze these six substances to determine their order based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer during electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Let me consider what influences ortho/para versus meta orientation in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.

The key factor is whether substituents on the benzene ring are activating or deactivating. Activating groups such as -CH3 (methyl) and -C2H5 (ethyl) direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups like -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -COOC2H5 (ester), and -Cl (chloro) can direct differently. While many deactivating groups direct to meta positions, some like -Cl still direct to ortho/para positions despite being deactivating, due to their electronegativity. Strong deactivators like -NO2 and -COOH typically direct to meta positions.

The problem indicates that only one monobromo derivative forms in each case. This is puzzling since for mono-substituted benzenes, even with clear directing effects, multiple positions are usually available for substitution. For example, with toluene (C6H5-CH3), the methyl group directs to ortho and para positions, which should result in two different products.

Let me clarify the position numbering on a mono-substituted benzene. If the original substituent occupies position 1, then:
- Positions 2 and 6 are ortho
- Positions 3 and 5 are meta
- Position 4 is para

For meta-directing substituents, bromination would occur at positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent due to symmetry, effectively creating one product. For ortho/para directing substituents, bromination could occur at positions 2, 4, or 6, with positions 2 and 6 being equivalent. This would typically result in two distinct products (ortho and para).

The assumption that "only one monobromo derivative is formed" might be simplifying reality, perhaps implying that for certain substituents, steric hindrance makes ortho positions less accessible, leading to predominantly para substitution. Bulkier groups like -COOC2H5 and -C2H5 might hinder ortho substitution more than smaller groups like -CH3 and -Cl.

Sure, I need to determine the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer during electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Let me start by reviewing what decides para versus ortho/meta orientation in electrophilic aromatic substitution.

The substituents on the benzene ring can either be activating or deactivating. Activating groups, like -CH3 (methyl) or -C2H5 (ethyl), direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups, such as -NO2 (nitro), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -COOC2H5 (ester), and -Cl (chloro), can either be meta-directing or para-directing. However, some deactivating groups are ortho/para directors despite being deactivating, such as -Cl due to its electronegativity. In contrast, groups like -NO2 and -COOH are meta-directing because they are strong deactivators.

Thus, the substituent's directing effect influences where bromine adds. If it's ortho/para directing, bromine can add in either ortho or para positions. Conversely, if it's meta-directing, bromine will add in the meta position. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case. This implies that for some substituents, even if they are ortho/para directors, maybe steric hindrance or other factors allow only the para isomer. But how does this occur?

The problem says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed." So, regardless of directing effects, only one product appears possible, which seems contradictory unless the substituent forces only one position to be viable. For example, if a para-substituted benzene has a meta-directing substituent but the meta is already occupied—no, that's not it. Maybe the substituent allows ortho and para positions to be equivalent due to symmetry, for instance, if attached at para-position. But in the given compounds, all have just one substituent on the benzene ring, like in toluene (C6H5-CH3). Here, the methyl group directs bromine to ortho or para places, but the problem indicates only one product. This suggests the substituent's position makes ortho and para positions equivalent, leading to a single product. Toluene is monosubstituted, so when brominated, ortho, meta, or para positions could be possible. But methyl directs ortho/para, excluding meta. So bromine should add ortho or para, yet how can only one product form? That doesn't add up unless steric hindrance inhibits ortho accessibility. Methyl isn't bulky, though. Perhaps for some bulky substituents, ortho positions are difficult, allowing only para. In toluene, a mix of ortho and para may occur, but the problem implies only one formation. Maybe it's simplifying matters, assuming only para results form despite ortho possibilities or perhaps reaction conditions favor para. But the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed", so each substituent might cause equivalent ortho/para (due to symmetry), but not in monosubstituted benzene. If the substituent is a meta director, bromine only adds meta, allowing one product. Whereas for ortho/para directors, if ortho are blocked, only para is viable. 

Maybe the key is a strong para director, favoring the para product eventually, but the issue says a single product forms. Maybe hypothetically, each substituent forms one despite actual directing effects. For instance, if meta-directing, bromine adds meta in a unique position due to the substituent's placement. But in a monosubstituted benzene, meta positions would be multiple—no, hold on. One substituent at position 1 puts ortho at 2 and 6, meta at 3 and 5, and para at 4. If it's meta-directing, bromine adds to positions 3 or 5. They're equivalent, hence a single isomer forms (since rotation makes 3 and 5 equivalent). Due to symmetry, bromine adds to meta and there's one product. If ortho/para directing, bromine can add to ortho or para; ortho at equivalent positions 2 or 6, para uniquely at 4. If accessible, two products form, but the problem states one derivative. Therefore, some substituents allow only para or only ortho. 

Perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming for certain substituents, only para forms, though ortho could exist, which isn't realistic. Alternatively, bulky substituents could hinder ortho, forming only para, like tert-butyl. But given substituents, -CH3 (1), -COOC2H5 (2), -Cl (3), -NO2 (4), -C2H5 (5), -COOH (6)—which are bulky? Ester (COOC2H5) and ethyl (C2H5) seem bulkier than methyl. Thus, ortho hindrance leads to para substitution. For lightweight methyl and chlorine, both ortho and para are possible but just one product forms, per the problem's context.

At last, perhaps it isn't about the actual product count but the assumption: "only one monobromo derivative is formed" implies that every reaction forms a sole product despite directing effect.

Then, the question is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para. Wait, but if each reaction gives only one product, then the yield of para would be 100% if the product is para, or 0% if it\'s meta. But that can\'t be. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Maybe even though multiple products are possible, under the reaction conditions (excess bromine), only the major product is considered, and it\'s assumed that only one is formed. So, the question is about the tendency of each substituent to direct bromine to the para position, and we need to order them from lowest to highest para yield.\n\nBut the original question says "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, even if there are ortho and para products, but in each case, the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That must mean that for each substituent, the directing is such that only para is formed. Wait, but that doesn\'t make sense. For example, toluene (1) is ortho/para directing. So bromination would give ortho and para products. But the problem says only one is formed. Maybe the question is simplifying and assuming that in each case, the para product is the only one formed. Then, the question is to arrange them in order of increasing para yield, which would depend on the directing strength. But I think I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that when there are multiple substituents, but in these cases, all are monosubstituted. Wait, the answer might relate to the activating or deactivating nature of the substituents. Activating groups increase the reactivity of the ring, making the reaction faster, but also influence the directing. Deactivating groups slow down the reaction but direct to certain positions. However, the question is about the yield of the para isomer. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that strongly activating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors, but the ratio of para to ortho depends on the substituent. For example, bulky groups favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for example, toluene (methyl) has less steric hindrance, so ortho and para are both possible, but maybe para is favored. However, if the substituent is more bulky, like ethyl (C2H5), then para would be more favored. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe in the case of ethyl, the para is the only product due to steric hindrance. Similarly, the ester group (COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, no, esters are meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, the ester group is -COO-. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring deactivating and meta-directing. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would add meta, leading to a meta product, but the problem says only one product is formed, so maybe in that case, it\'s meta. But the question is about the para-isomer yield. So, for meta-directing groups, the para-isomer would not form; the product would be meta, so the para yield would be zero. Whereas for ortho/para directors, if only para is formed, then the para yield is 100%.\n\nBut the problem says "arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, if a substituent is meta-directing, then the para yield is zero. If it\'s ortho/para directing, then the para yield depends on whether the product is only para or a mix. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so maybe for ortho/para directors, the para is the only product. But that\'s not true in reality. For example, toluene bromination gives a mix of ortho and para. But in the problem\'s assumption, maybe it\'s considered that only para forms. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is strongly activating and not bulky, both ortho and para form, but the problem says only one product. This is confusing.\n\nWait, let\'s list the substituents again:\n\n1) С6H5-CH3 (toluene) – activating, ortho/para\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (phenyl ester) – deactivating, meta\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) – deactivating, ortho/para\n\n4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) – deactivating, meta\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) – activating, ortho/para\n\n6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) – deactivating, meta\n\nNow, for each of these:\n\nSubstituents 2,4,6 are meta directors; 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors.\n\nBut the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case. So for meta directors (2,4,6), the bromine would add in the meta position, leading to one product (since meta positions are equivalent). For ortho/para directors (1,3,5), if both ortho and para positions are possible, but the problem says only one product, then maybe in these cases, only para is formed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent\'s position is such that the product is only para. For example, in the case of para-substituted benzene, but all the given compounds are monosubstituted. Wait, no, they are all monosubstituted. So, the substituent is in one position, and bromine adds in another. For ortho/para directors, bromine can add in ortho or para. But if the substituent is bulky, steric hindrance may favor para. So, for example, ethylbenzene (5) has a bulkier group than toluene (1), so ethylbenzene would have more para product. Chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, but chlorine is electronegative, so it\'s deactivating but still ortho/para director because it can donate electrons through resonance in certain positions. However, in practice, chlorobenzene undergoes bromination mainly in the para position because the ortho positions are hindered by the chlorine\'s size. So maybe for chlorobenzene, the para product is major. Similarly, toluene might have more ortho product compared to ethylbenzene. But the problem states that only one product is formed. So perhaps the assumption is that for ortho/para directors, the para product is the only one formed. But in reality, that\'s not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when there is a substituent that is a strong activating group, the para product is formed in higher yield. Wait, but how does that affect the weight fraction? Let\'s think about each substituent\'s effect:\n\n1) Toluene (methyl group): activating, ortho/para director. In reality, bromination gives a mix of ortho (30%) and para (70%) approximately. But the problem says only one product is formed. Assuming only para, then 100% para.\n\nBut ethylbenzene (5) is also activating, ortho/para. But since ethyl is bulkier, maybe para is favored more. So if toluene\'s para is 70% and ethyl\'s is 90%, but the problem says only one product, so maybe all activating groups have 100% para. But then why the question is about increasing order?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not assuming that only one product is formed, but that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative, which would be either para or meta. Then, the yield of para would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. But that can\'t be, because chlorobenzene is ortho/para but deactivating. Wait, but the problem says "excess bromine", maybe under forcing conditions, but I don\'t think that affects the position.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering the stability of the carbocation intermediate in the electrophilic substitution. For example, more activated rings would have more stable transition states, but that might not directly relate to para vs ortho.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that some substituents increase the probability of para substitution more than others. For example, strong activating groups (like -NH2) strongly activate the ring and direct para. But in our case, we have methyl and ethyl as activating groups. Between them, ethyl is more bulky, so it would favor para more than methyl. So, para yield would be higher for ethylbenzene than toluene. Chlorine, being ortho/para director but deactivating, might have lower para yield because the ring is less activated, but still directs to para. Wait, but if the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. So, chlorobenzene would have para product, but lower yield compared to toluene? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para yield depends on the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, electron-donating groups stabilize the transition state leading to para substitution more than ortho. But I\'m not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: in the case of meta directors (substituents 2,4,6), the bromine adds in the meta position, so the para-isomer yield is zero. For ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para-isomer yield is higher. So, the order would have the meta directors (2,4,6) at the lower end (0% para) and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) at the higher end (100% para). But the question says "increasing order of weight fraction of para", so from lowest to highest. So, the meta directors would come first (0%), then the ortho/para directors (100%). But that would make the order: 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But within the ortho/para directors, maybe there\'s a difference. For example, between toluene (1), chlorobenzene (3), and ethylbenzene (5), the para yield might vary. If ethyl is bulkier, more para; chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para, so perhaps less para than toluene? Or more?\n\nWait, in reality, for toluene, the para product is about 60-70%, and ortho is 30-40%. For chlorobenzene, due to the deactivating effect, the reaction is slower, but the para product is major (like 50-60% para, 40% ortho). For ethylbenzene, because ethyl is bulkier, the para product is favored more, maybe 80-90%. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so perhaps we have to assume that the para is the only product for ortho/para directors. But then all 1,3,5 would have 100% para, and 2,4,6 have 0%. So the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem asks to arrange all six in order, so that can\'t be. There must be a gradation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para yield is influenced by the substituent\'s ability to activate the ring. Stronger activating groups lead to higher para yield. Wait, but how? Methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? No, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl, but steric effects might play a role. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is a strong deactivator, so meta director, so para yield 0%. Similarly for COOC2H5 and COOH. Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para, so para yield is some value. Toluene and ethylbenzene are activating, ortho/para, with ethyl being bulkier, so higher para yield. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:\n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para.\n\nThen, chlorobenzene (3) has lower para yield than toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5). But wait, chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, it directs to ortho/para. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. If we assume that for chlorobenzene, the para is the only product (maybe due to steric hindrance of ortho positions by Cl), then para yield is 100%. But then chlorobenzene would be same as toluene and ethylbenzene. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the para yield is determined by the substituent\'s directing effect. So:\n\nSubstituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) → para yield 0%.\n\nSubstituents that are ortho/para directors (1,3,5) → para yield depends on steric factors. Among these:\n\n- Chlorine (3) is ortho/para but deactivating. Maybe steric hindrance makes para more favorable. But Cl is not that bulky.\n\n- Toluene (1): methyl is small, so ortho and para both possible, but para is major.\n\n- Ethylbenzene (5): ethyl is bulkier, so para is major.\n\nBut the problem states only one product is formed. If we assume that for ethylbenzene, only para forms, for toluene, both ortho and para form but the problem says only one, perhaps para. For chlorobenzene, same as toluene. Then, all ortho/para directors have 100% para, meta directors 0%. So the order would be 2,4,6 < 1=3=5. But the question asks to arrange all six in order. Therefore, maybe the para yield is not 100% but varies based on the substituent\'s ability to direct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. So, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield. But how does activation strength relate to para yield? Maybe stronger activating groups increase the reaction rate but don\'t necessarily affect the para/ortho ratio. However, steric effects do. So ethyl being bulkier than methyl would lead to more para. Chlorine, being ortho/para director but deactivating, might have lower para yield because the ring is less activated, but once it reacts, it\'s directed to ortho/para. But if the problem assumes only para is formed, then para yield is 100% for 1,3,5. But that can\'t be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that meta directors have 0% para, and among ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for those with stronger +I effect. Ethyl has a stronger +I effect than methyl, so more para. Chlorine has -I effect but +M (resonance) effect. Wait, chlorine is electronegative, so -I effect dominates, making it deactivating. But it can donate electrons through resonance in ortho/para positions. So, chlorobenzene is ortho/para director. In terms of para yield, maybe chlorobenzene has lower para yield compared to toluene and ethylbenzene because the ring is deactivated, but once it reacts, the para is favored. \n\nIn reality, the para/ortho ratio for toluene is about 60:40, ethylbenzene might be higher para, say 70:30, and chlorobenzene might be 50:50. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe these ratios are not considered. \n\nAlternatively, the question is about the theoretical yield based on directing effects, not actual experimental ratios. So:\n\n- Meta directors (2,4,6) → 0% para.\n\n- Ortho/para directors (1,3,5) → 100% para.\n\nBut then the order would be 2,4,6 < 1=3=5. But the question lists six substances, so there must be a way to differentiate between 1,3,5. \n\nWait, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. Since ethyl is more donating than methyl, which is more donating than chlorine (which is deactivating). So, para yield would be highest for ethylbenzene (5), then toluene (1), then chlorobenzene (3). But since chlorine is deactivating, maybe its para yield is lower. However, if the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then they are equal. But the question must expect a specific order, so perhaps the correct order is based on the activating/deactivating nature and steric effects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para isomer\'s stability is considered. For example, in the case of nitro groups (meta director), the para isomer isn\'t formed. For ortho/para directors, the para isomer is more stable due to less steric hindrance. So, the more bulky the substituent, the more para is favored. So, the order of para yield would be: \n\nLowest para: chlorobenzene (3) < toluene (1) < ethylbenzene (5) (since ethyl is most bulky, favoring para more). Then, the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para. So overall order from lowest to highest para yield: 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. But I\'m not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that chlorobenzene is deactivating, so even though it\'s ortho/para director, the para product might be less favored compared to activating groups. But how? If the ring is deactivated, the reaction is slower, but once it occurs, the directing is still ortho/para. The yield of para would depend on the ratio of ortho to para, not the overall reaction rate. So, if chlorobenzene gives more ortho than para, but the problem states only one product, perhaps assuming para is formed. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let me try to find another approach. \n\nIn electrophilic substitution, the para/ortho ratio depends on the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, bulky groups hinder ortho attack, favoring para. So, ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1), so more para. Chlorine (3) is smaller than ethyl but larger than methyl. Chlorine\'s size might lead to some steric hindrance, favoring para over ortho. So the order of para yield due to steric effects: 5 >3 >1. \n\nMeanwhile, the meta directors (2,4,6) cannot form para, so their para yield is 0%. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:\n\n2 (0%), 4 (0%), 6 (0%), 1 (lower para), 3 (medium para), 5 (highest para).\n\nBut wait, if chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para director but deactivating, does that affect the para yield? Or is the para yield purely a function of steric effects? If steric effects are the main factor, then ethyl (5) has highest para, then Cl (3), then methyl (1). So the order would be 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5. \n\nAlternatively, if the activating effect also plays a role in the para/ortho ratio. For example, stronger activating groups might favor para more. Methyl is more activating than ethyl (actually, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl), but ethyl is bulkier. So maybe ethyl\'s steric effect outweighs its activating effect, leading to more para. Chlorine is deactivating, so even though it\'s ortho/para, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. So perhaps the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5. \n\nBut I think the key factors are:\n\n1. Meta directors (2,4,6) → 0% para.\n\n2. Ortho/para directors: the more bulky the group, the higher the para yield. So among 1,3,5:\n\n- Ethyl (5) is most bulky → highest para.\n\n- Chlorine (3) is more bulky than methyl (1) → middle para.\n\n- Methyl (1) → least bulky → lowest para.\n\nThus, the order from lowest to highest para yield: 2,4,6 (0%) <1 <3 <5.\n\nBut wait, chlorine\'s size is actually larger than methyl. Chlorine has a larger atomic radius than carbon, so the Cl substituent is bulkier than methyl. Therefore, chlorobenzene would have more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para more than toluene. So para yield order: 5 >3 >1. Therefore, the overall order would be 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5.\n\nBut I need to confirm the relative sizes. Methyl is -CH3, chlorine is -Cl. The van der Waals radius of Cl is about 0.18 nm, while that of a methyl group is roughly 0.2 nm (since carbon is 0.17, and hydrogen 0.11). Wait, maybe the methyl group is actually bulkier than Cl. Because a methyl group is three hydrogens around a carbon, making it more spatially demanding than a single Cl atom. So maybe methyl is more bulky than Cl. Wait, but Cl has a larger atomic size. This is conflicting. Let me check:\n\nVan der Waals radii (in Ångströms):\n\n- Hydrogen: 1.2\n\n- Carbon: 1.7\n\n- Chlorine: 1.8\n\nSo, a methyl group (-CH3) has a carbon (1.7 Å) bonded to three hydrogens (1.2 Å each). The effective size might be similar to chlorine (1.8 Å). But in terms of steric hindrance, perhaps the methyl group is bulkier because it\'s a three-dimensional group, whereas Cl is a single atom. So in practice, substituents like -CF3 are very bulky, but methyl is less so. Chlorine is somewhat bulky. For example, in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions are somewhat hindered, leading to more para product compared to toluene. Wait, but in reality, toluene bromination gives about 60% para, while chlorobenzene gives about 45% para. So maybe methyl is less bulky, allowing more ortho, hence lower para yield compared to chlorine. Wait, that contradicts the previous thought. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the directing effect is more electronic than steric. Since chlorine is deactivating, the transition state for ortho attack is less stabilized compared to para. Wait, but chlorine is ortho/para director because it donates electrons through resonance in those positions. Even though it\'s deactivating overall, the resonance donation directs to ortho/para. The steric hindrance might be minimal, so the para product is favored. \n\nThis is getting too detailed. Given the time I\'ve spent, I think the intended answer is that the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para yield increases with the substituent\'s bulkiness. So ethyl (5) is most bulky → highest para, then chlorine (3), then methyl (1). Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. Wait, but all meta directors should be together. So 2,4,6 have 0%, then 1,3,5. But the exact order among 1,3,5 depends on steric hindrance. If methyl is less bulky than Cl, which is less bulky than ethyl, then 1 <3 <5. So overall: 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5.\n\nBut I need to check the substituents again:\n\nSubstituents:\n\n1) -CH3 (methyl)\n\n3) -Cl (chloro)\n\n5) -C2H5 (ethyl)\n\nIn terms of bulkiness: ethyl > methyl > chloro? Or chloro > ethyl? Wait, ethyl is -CH2CH3, which is larger than methyl (-CH3). Chlorine is a single atom but with a larger atomic radius. The van der Waals volume of ethyl is larger than methyl, and larger than Cl. So ethyl is the bulkiest, then methyl, then Cl. Wait, no. Wait, the van der Waals volume of a methyl group is about 23 Å³, ethyl is larger, and Cl is about 27 Å³. Wait, maybe Cl is bulkier than methyl but less than ethyl. So the order of bulkiness: ethyl > Cl > methyl. Therefore, the para yield due to steric hindrance would be highest for ethyl (5), then Cl (3), then methyl (1). Thus, the order of para yield: 5 >3 >1. \n\nTherefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield:\n\nSubstituents with 0% para (2,4,6) → 2 <4 <6 (though they all have 0%, maybe ordered by some other criteria?), followed by 1 <3 <5.\n\nBut why would 2,4,6 be ordered between themselves? The problem might order them based on the strength of the deactivating effect, but since they all have 0% para, it might not matter. Alternatively, the question might consider the substituents\' effects in another way. For example, nitro groups are stronger deactivators than esters or carboxylic acids. But since they\'re all meta directors, their para yield is zero. So the order among them might be irrelevant. The main point is that the ortho/para directors come after the meta directors, ordered by their para yield. \n\nThus, the final order is: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) [all meta, 0% para], then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) in order of increasing para yield. But wait, if the para yield increases from 1 to 3 to 5, then the order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. \n\nBut wait, methyl\'s para yield is lower than Cl\'s, which is lower than ethyl\'s. So from lowest to highest: 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5. Therefore, the answer is 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. \n\nBut I need to confirm with actual data. For example, in nitration reactions, the para/ortho ratio for toluene is about 60/40, chlorobenzene is about 50/50 (since Cl is deactivating but ortho/para), and ethylbenzene is higher para due to steric hindrance. So ethylbenzene might have 80% para, chlorobenzene 50%, toluene 60%. Therefore, the order of para yield would be: chlorobenzene (50%) < toluene (60%) < ethylbenzene (80%). But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe it\'s theoretical. \n\nGiven that, the intended answer is probably:\n\nFrom lowest to highest para yield: the meta directors (2,4,6) first, then the ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield, which is based on steric hindrance: methyl (1) has less para than Cl (3), which has less than ethyl (5). But wait, earlier I thought ethyl is most bulky, then Cl, then methyl. So para yield: 5 >3 >1. Therefore, increasing order would be 1 <3 <5. \n\nSo the full order is: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. \n\nBut wait, nitro (4), ester (2), and COOH (6) are all meta directors. The order among them might be based on their deactivating strength. Nitro is more deactivating than COOH, which is more deactivating than ester. But since they all have 0% para, their order might not matter. However, sometimes in such questions, the order is based on the substituent\'s priority in IUPAC nomenclature or alphabetical order, but that\'s unlikely. \n\nThe likely correct order, based on the reasoning that meta directors have 0% para and ortho/para directors have increasing para yield with substituent bulkiness, is:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)\n\nSo from lowest to highest para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. \n\nBut I need to check if the ester group (COOC2H5) is indeed a stronger deactivator than nitro. No, nitro is one of the strongest deactivators. So the order of deactivating strength among meta directors: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. But since they all have 0% para, their order in the list might not affect the answer. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer should be arranged as follows, from lowest to highest para yield:\n\nSubstances with meta directors (2,4,6) first, ordered as 2 <4 <6 (though this part might be flexible), followed by ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield: 1 <3 <5. Therefore, the final order is 2,4,6,1,3,5.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390520, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6765, prompt_tokens=1955, total_tokens=8720, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the electrophilic bromination of the given compounds, we analyze the directing effects and steric influences of the substituents:

1. **Meta-Directing Groups (0% para yield):**
   - **C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**: The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - **C6H5-NO2 (4)**: The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - **C6H5-COOH (6)**: The carboxylic acid group is deactivating and meta-directing.  
   These substituents prevent para substitution entirely, resulting in 0% para yield.

2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Increasing para yield based on steric hindrance):**
   - **C6H5-CH3 (1)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Its small size allows some ortho substitution, but para is still favored.
   - **C6H5-Cl (3)**: Chlorine is a deactivating but ortho/para-directing group. Its larger size compared to methyl increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para substitution more than in toluene.
   - **C6H5-C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing. Its greater bulkiness strongly disfavors ortho substitution, leading to the highest para yield among the ortho/para directors.

**Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:**  
2 (COOC2H5) < 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 1 (CH3) < 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5)

**Answer:**  
\boxed{2 < 4 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

100% para or 100% meta, but under the problem's assumption, each substituent leads to a single product, which is either para or meta. Then, the question is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para. Wait, but if each reaction gives only one product, then the yield of para would be 100% if the product is para, or 0% if it's meta. But that can't be. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Maybe even though multiple products are possible, under the reaction conditions (excess bromine), only the major product is considered, and it's assumed that only one is formed. So, the question is about the tendency of each substituent to direct bromine to the para position, and we need to order them from lowest to highest para yield.

But the original question says "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, even if there are ortho and para products, but in each case, the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That must mean that for each substituent, the directing is such that only para is formed. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. For example, toluene (1) is ortho/para directing. So bromination would give ortho and para products. But the problem says only one is formed. Maybe the question is simplifying and assuming that in each case, the para product is the only one formed. Then, the question is to arrange them in order of increasing para yield, which would depend on the directing strength. But I think I need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that when there are multiple substituents, but in these cases, all are monosubstituted. Wait, the answer might relate to the activating or deactivating nature of the substituents. Activating groups increase the reactivity of the ring, making the reaction faster, but also influence the directing. Deactivating groups slow down the reaction but direct to certain positions. However, the question is about the yield of the para isomer. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that strongly activating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors, but the ratio of para to ortho depends on the substituent. For example, bulky groups favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for example, toluene (methyl) has less steric hindrance, so ortho and para are both possible, but maybe para is favored. However, if the substituent is more bulky, like ethyl (C2H5), then para would be more favored. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe in the case of ethyl, the para is the only product due to steric hindrance. Similarly, the ester group (COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, no, esters are meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, the ester group is -COO-. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring deactivating and meta-directing. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would add meta, leading to a meta product, but the problem says only one product is formed, so maybe in that case, it's meta. But the question is about the para-isomer yield. So, for meta-directing groups, the para-isomer would not form; the product would be meta, so the para yield would be zero. Whereas for ortho/para directors, if only para is formed, then the para yield is 100%.

But the problem says "arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, if a substituent is meta-directing, then the para yield is zero. If it's ortho/para directing, then the para yield depends on whether the product is only para or a mix. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so maybe for ortho/para directors, the para is the only product. But that's not true in reality. For example, toluene bromination gives a mix of ortho and para. But in the problem's assumption, maybe it's considered that only para forms. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is strongly activating and not bulky, both ortho and para form, but the problem says only one product. This is confusing.

Wait, let's list the substituents again:

1) С6H5-CH3 (toluene) – activating, ortho/para

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (phenyl ester) – deactivating, meta

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) – deactivating, ortho/para

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) – deactivating, meta

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) – activating, ortho/para

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) – deactivating, meta

Now, for each of these:

Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors; 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors.

But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case. So for meta directors (2,4,6), the bromine would add in the meta position, leading to one product (since meta positions are equivalent). For ortho/para directors (1,3,5), if both ortho and para positions are possible, but the problem says only one product, then maybe in these cases, only para is formed. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position is such that the product is only para. For example, in the case of para-substituted benzene, but all the given compounds are monosubstituted. Wait, no, they are all monosubstituted. So, the substituent is in one position, and bromine adds in another. For ortho/para directors, bromine can add in ortho or para. But if the substituent is bulky, steric hindrance may favor para. So, for example, ethylbenzene (5) has a bulkier group than toluene (1), so ethylbenzene would have more para product. Chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, but chlorine is electronegative, so it's deactivating but still ortho/para director because it can donate electrons through resonance in certain positions. However, in practice, chlorobenzene undergoes bromination mainly in the para position because the ortho positions are hindered by the chlorine's size. So maybe for chlorobenzene, the para product is major. Similarly, toluene might have more ortho product compared to ethylbenzene. But the problem states that only one product is formed. So perhaps the assumption is that for ortho/para directors, the para product is the only one formed. But in reality, that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when there is a substituent that is a strong activating group, the para product is formed in higher yield. Wait, but how does that affect the weight fraction? Let's think about each substituent's effect:

1) Toluene (methyl group): activating, ortho/para director. In reality, bromination gives a mix of ortho (30%) and para (70%) approximately. But the problem says only one product is formed. Assuming only para, then 100% para.

But ethylbenzene (5) is also activating, ortho/para. But since ethyl is bulkier, maybe para is favored more. So if toluene's para is 70% and ethyl's is 90%, but the problem says only one product, so maybe all activating groups have 100% para. But then why the question is about increasing order?

Wait, perhaps the question is not assuming that only one product is formed, but that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative, which would be either para or meta. Then, the yield of para would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. But that can't be, because chlorobenzene is ortho/para but deactivating. Wait, but the problem says "excess bromine", maybe under forcing conditions, but I don't think that affects the position.

Alternatively, the problem might be considering the stability of the carbocation intermediate in the electrophilic substitution. For example, more activated rings would have more stable transition states, but that might not directly relate to para vs ortho.

Wait, perhaps the key is that some substituents increase the probability of para substitution more than others. For example, strong activating groups (like -NH2) strongly activate the ring and direct para. But in our case, we have methyl and ethyl as activating groups. Between them, ethyl is more bulky, so it would favor para more than methyl. So, para yield would be higher for ethylbenzene than toluene. Chlorine, being ortho/para director but deactivating, might have lower para yield because the ring is less activated, but still directs to para. Wait, but if the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. So, chlorobenzene would have para product, but lower yield compared to toluene? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the para yield depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, electron-donating groups stabilize the transition state leading to para substitution more than ortho. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the case of meta directors (substituents 2,4,6), the bromine adds in the meta position, so the para-isomer yield is zero. For ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para-isomer yield is higher. So, the order would have the meta directors (2,4,6) at the lower end (0% para) and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) at the higher end (100% para). But the question says "increasing order of weight fraction of para", so from lowest to highest. So, the meta directors would come first (0%), then the ortho/para directors (100%). But that would make the order: 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But within the ortho/para directors, maybe there's a difference. For example, between toluene (1), chlorobenzene (3), and ethylbenzene (5), the para yield might vary. If ethyl is bulkier, more para; chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para, so perhaps less para than toluene? Or more?

Wait, in reality, for toluene, the para product is about 60-70%, and ortho is 30-40%. For chlorobenzene, due to the deactivating effect, the reaction is slower, but the para product is major (like 50-60% para, 40% ortho). For ethylbenzene, because ethyl is bulkier, the para product is favored more, maybe 80-90%. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so perhaps we have to assume that the para is the only product for ortho/para directors. But then all 1,3,5 would have 100% para, and 2,4,6 have 0%. So the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem asks to arrange all six in order, so that can't be. There must be a gradation.

Alternatively, maybe the para yield is influenced by the substituent's ability to activate the ring. Stronger activating groups lead to higher para yield. Wait, but how? Methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? No, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl, but steric effects might play a role. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is a strong deactivator, so meta director, so para yield 0%. Similarly for COOC2H5 and COOH. Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para, so para yield is some value. Toluene and ethylbenzene are activating, ortho/para, with ethyl being bulkier, so higher para yield. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para.

Then, chlorobenzene (3) has lower para yield than toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5). But wait, chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, it directs to ortho/para. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. If we assume that for chlorobenzene, the para is the only product (maybe due to steric hindrance of ortho positions by Cl), then para yield is 100%. But then chlorobenzene would be same as toluene and ethylbenzene. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the para yield is determined by the substituent's directing effect. So:

Substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) → para yield 0%.

Substituents that are ortho/para directors (1,3,5) → para yield depends on steric factors. Among these:

- Chlorine (3) is ortho/para but deactivating. Maybe steric hindrance makes para more favorable. But Cl is not that bulky.

- Toluene (1): methyl is small, so ortho and para both possible, but para is major.

- Ethylbenzene (5): ethyl is bulkier, so para is major.

But the problem states only one product is formed. If we assume that for ethylbenzene, only para forms, for toluene, both ortho and para form but the problem says only one, perhaps para. For chlorobenzene, same as toluene. Then, all ortho/para directors have 100% para, meta directors 0%. So the order would be 2,4,6 < 1=3=5. But the question asks to arrange all six in order. Therefore, maybe the para yield is not 100% but varies based on the substituent's ability to direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. So, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield. But how does activation strength relate to para yield? Maybe stronger activating groups increase the reaction rate but don't necessarily affect the para/ortho ratio. However, steric effects do. So ethyl being bulkier than methyl would lead to more para. Chlorine, being ortho/para director but deactivating, might have lower para yield because the ring is less activated, but once it reacts, it's directed to ortho/para. But if the problem assumes only para is formed, then para yield is 100% for 1,3,5. But that can't be. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that meta directors have 0% para, and among ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for those with stronger +I effect. Ethyl has a stronger +I effect than methyl, so more para. Chlorine has -I effect but +M (resonance) effect. Wait, chlorine is electronegative, so -I effect dominates, making it deactivating. But it can donate electrons through resonance in ortho/para positions. So, chlorobenzene is ortho/para director. In terms of para yield, maybe chlorobenzene has lower para yield compared to toluene and ethylbenzene because the ring is deactivated, but once it reacts, the para is favored. 

In reality, the para/ortho ratio for toluene is about 60:40, ethylbenzene might be higher para, say 70:30, and chlorobenzene might be 50:50. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe these ratios are not considered. 

Alternatively, the question is about the theoretical yield based on directing effects, not actual experimental ratios. So:

- Meta directors (2,4,6) → 0% para.

- Ortho/para directors (1,3,5) → 100% para.

But then the order would be 2,4,6 < 1=3=5. But the question lists six substances, so there must be a way to differentiate between 1,3,5. 

Wait, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. Since ethyl is more donating than methyl, which is more donating than chlorine (which is deactivating). So, para yield would be highest for ethylbenzene (5), then toluene (1), then chlorobenzene (3). But since chlorine is deactivating, maybe its para yield is lower. However, if the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then they are equal. But the question must expect a specific order, so perhaps the correct order is based on the activating/deactivating nature and steric effects.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's stability is considered. For example, in the case of nitro groups (meta director), the para isomer isn't formed. For ortho/para directors, the para isomer is more stable due to less steric hindrance. So, the more bulky the substituent, the more para is favored. So, the order of para yield would be: 

Lowest para: chlorobenzene (3) < toluene (1) < ethylbenzene (5) (since ethyl is most bulky, favoring para more). Then, the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para. So overall order from lowest to highest para yield: 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, considering that chlorobenzene is deactivating, so even though it's ortho/para director, the para product might be less favored compared to activating groups. But how? If the ring is deactivated, the reaction is slower, but once it occurs, the directing is still ortho/para. The yield of para would depend on the ratio of ortho to para, not the overall reaction rate. So, if chlorobenzene gives more ortho than para, but the problem states only one product, perhaps assuming para is formed. 

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to find another approach. 

In electrophilic substitution, the para/ortho ratio depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, bulky groups hinder ortho attack, favoring para. So, ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1), so more para. Chlorine (3) is smaller than ethyl but larger than methyl. Chlorine's size might lead to some steric hindrance, favoring para over ortho. So the order of para yield due to steric effects: 5 >3 >1. 

Meanwhile, the meta directors (2,4,6) cannot form para, so their para yield is 0%. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:

2 (0%), 4 (0%), 6 (0%), 1 (lower para), 3 (medium para), 5 (highest para).

But wait, if chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para director but deactivating, does that affect the para yield? Or is the para yield purely a function of steric effects? If steric effects are the main factor, then ethyl (5) has highest para, then Cl (3), then methyl (1). So the order would be 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5. 

Alternatively, if the activating effect also plays a role in the para/ortho ratio. For example, stronger activating groups might favor para more. Methyl is more activating than ethyl (actually, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl), but ethyl is bulkier. So maybe ethyl's steric effect outweighs its activating effect, leading to more para. Chlorine is deactivating, so even though it's ortho/para, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. So perhaps the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5. 

But I think the key factors are:

1. Meta directors (2,4,6) → 0% para.

2. Ortho/para directors: the more bulky the group, the higher the para yield. So among 1,3,5:

- Ethyl (5) is most bulky → highest para.

- Chlorine (3) is more bulky than methyl (1) → middle para.

- Methyl (1) → least bulky → lowest para.

Thus, the order from lowest to highest para yield: 2,4,6 (0%) <1 <3 <5.

But wait, chlorine's size is actually larger than methyl. Chlorine has a larger atomic radius than carbon, so the Cl substituent is bulkier than methyl. Therefore, chlorobenzene would have more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para more than toluene. So para yield order: 5 >3 >1. Therefore, the overall order would be 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5.

But I need to confirm the relative sizes. Methyl is -CH3, chlorine is -Cl. The van der Waals radius of Cl is about 0.18 nm, while that of a methyl group is roughly 0.2 nm (since carbon is 0.17, and hydrogen 0.11). Wait, maybe the methyl group is actually bulkier than Cl. Because a methyl group is three hydrogens around a carbon, making it more spatially demanding than a single Cl atom. So maybe methyl is more bulky than Cl. Wait, but Cl has a larger atomic size. This is conflicting. Let me check:

Van der Waals radii (in Ångströms):

- Hydrogen: 1.2

- Carbon: 1.7

- Chlorine: 1.8

So, a methyl group (-CH3) has a carbon (1.7 Å) bonded to three hydrogens (1.2 Å each). The effective size might be similar to chlorine (1.8 Å). But in terms of steric hindrance, perhaps the methyl group is bulkier because it's a three-dimensional group, whereas Cl is a single atom. So in practice, substituents like -CF3 are very bulky, but methyl is less so. Chlorine is somewhat bulky. For example, in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions are somewhat hindered, leading to more para product compared to toluene. Wait, but in reality, toluene bromination gives about 60% para, while chlorobenzene gives about 45% para. So maybe methyl is less bulky, allowing more ortho, hence lower para yield compared to chlorine. Wait, that contradicts the previous thought. 

Alternatively, perhaps the directing effect is more electronic than steric. Since chlorine is deactivating, the transition state for ortho attack is less stabilized compared to para. Wait, but chlorine is ortho/para director because it donates electrons through resonance in those positions. Even though it's deactivating overall, the resonance donation directs to ortho/para. The steric hindrance might be minimal, so the para product is favored. 

This is getting too detailed. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is that the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para yield increases with the substituent's bulkiness. So ethyl (5) is most bulky → highest para, then chlorine (3), then methyl (1). Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. Wait, but all meta directors should be together. So 2,4,6 have 0%, then 1,3,5. But the exact order among 1,3,5 depends on steric hindrance. If methyl is less bulky than Cl, which is less bulky than ethyl, then 1 <3 <5. So overall: 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5.

But I need to check the substituents again:

Substituents:

1) -CH3 (methyl)

3) -Cl (chloro)

5) -C2H5 (ethyl)

In terms of bulkiness: ethyl > methyl > chloro? Or chloro > ethyl? Wait, ethyl is -CH2CH3, which is larger than methyl (-CH3). Chlorine is a single atom but with a larger atomic radius. The van der Waals volume of ethyl is larger than methyl, and larger than Cl. So ethyl is the bulkiest, then methyl, then Cl. Wait, no. Wait, the van der Waals volume of a methyl group is about 23 Å³, ethyl is larger, and Cl is about 27 Å³. Wait, maybe Cl is bulkier than methyl but less than ethyl. So the order of bulkiness: ethyl > Cl > methyl. Therefore, the para yield due to steric hindrance would be highest for ethyl (5), then Cl (3), then methyl (1). Thus, the order of para yield: 5 >3 >1. 

Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield:

Substituents with 0% para (2,4,6) → 2 <4 <6 (though they all have 0%, maybe ordered by some other criteria?), followed by 1 <3 <5.

But why would 2,4,6 be ordered between themselves? The problem might order them based on the strength of the deactivating effect, but since they all have 0% para, it might not matter. Alternatively, the question might consider the substituents' effects in another way. For example, nitro groups are stronger deactivators than esters or carboxylic acids. But since they're all meta directors, their para yield is zero. So the order among them might be irrelevant. The main point is that the ortho/para directors come after the meta directors, ordered by their para yield. 

Thus, the final order is: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) [all meta, 0% para], then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) in order of increasing para yield. But wait, if the para yield increases from 1 to 3 to 5, then the order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. 

But wait, methyl's para yield is lower than Cl's, which is lower than ethyl's. So from lowest to highest: 2,4,6 <1 <3 <5. Therefore, the answer is 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. 

But I need to confirm with actual data. For example, in nitration reactions, the para/ortho ratio for toluene is about 60/40, chlorobenzene is about 50/50 (since Cl is deactivating but ortho/para), and ethylbenzene is higher para due to steric hindrance. So ethylbenzene might have 80% para, chlorobenzene 50%, toluene 60%. Therefore, the order of para yield would be: chlorobenzene (50%) < toluene (60%) < ethylbenzene (80%). But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe it's theoretical. 

Given that, the intended answer is probably:

From lowest to highest para yield: the meta directors (2,4,6) first, then the ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield, which is based on steric hindrance: methyl (1) has less para than Cl (3), which has less than ethyl (5). But wait, earlier I thought ethyl is most bulky, then Cl, then methyl. So para yield: 5 >3 >1. Therefore, increasing order would be 1 <3 <5. 

So the full order is: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. 

But wait, nitro (4), ester (2), and COOH (6) are all meta directors. The order among them might be based on their deactivating strength. Nitro is more deactivating than COOH, which is more deactivating than ester. But since they all have 0% para, their order might not matter. However, sometimes in such questions, the order is based on the substituent's priority in IUPAC nomenclature or alphabetical order, but that's unlikely. 

The likely correct order, based on the reasoning that meta directors have 0% para and ortho/para directors have increasing para yield with substituent bulkiness, is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

So from lowest to highest para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. 

But I need to check if the ester group (COOC2H5) is indeed a stronger deactivator than nitro. No, nitro is one of the strongest deactivators. So the order of deactivating strength among meta directors: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. But since they all have 0% para, their order in the list might not affect the answer. 

In conclusion, the answer should be arranged as follows, from lowest to highest para yield:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) first, ordered as 2 <4 <6 (though this part might be flexible), followed by ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield: 1 <3 <5. Therefore, the final order is 2,4,6,1,3,5.

Let me check each substituent.\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Without steric hindrance, ortho and para products would form. But if only one product is formed, perhaps para is major? However, in reality, para is major but ortho is also possible. But the problem states only one product, so maybe in this case, the para is the only one considered? Or maybe the substituent is such that ortho positions are blocked. Wait, methyl is not that bulky. Maybe the problem is assuming that for some groups, para is the only product. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that for some substituents, even if ortho and para are possible, steric factors lead to para being the only product. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is not too bulky, so ortho and para products would form. But the problem states only one product. Hmm. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that when there\'s a strong deactivating group, the para position is more favored. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps each substituent is such that the bromination leads to only one product. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds to the meta position (but in mono-substituted benzene, meta would be positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent, so only one product). If the substituent is ortho/para director but the ortho positions are hindered, then only para is possible. Let\'s check each substituent:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para-directing. If ortho positions are possible, there would be two products (ortho and para), but the problem says only one. So perhaps in this case, the substituent is such that the para is the only product? That doesn\'t align with reality. Wait, maybe the problem is taking into account that for certain substituents, the para product is the major one, and the ortho is minor, but here we\'re told only the para is formed. So maybe for some substituents, like when the group is bulky, para is favored. Let me consider each case:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para-directing. The methyl group is not very bulky, so both ortho and para positions are possible, but in reality, para is major (around 60%) and ortho is minor (around 30-40%). But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, the question is assuming that when substituents are ortho/para directors, the para product is the only one formed, which isn\'t accurate. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is meta-directing, only para isn\'t possible. Wait, no. Let\'s think again.\n\nIf the substituent is a meta director (like -NO2), then bromine would enter meta positions. But in a mono-substituted benzene, the meta positions are 3 and 5, which are equivalent, so only one product is formed. So substituents that are meta directors would give only one product (para to the substituent?), but wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is in position 1, then meta would be positions 3 and 5. But in a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. So bromination at either would result in the same product. So for meta directors, bromination would lead to a single product. For ortho/para directors, bromination would lead to two products (ortho and para). But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, substituents that are meta directors will have only one product (bromine at meta), and substituents that are ortho/para directors will have only para product. But why would that be the case? Because maybe the problem is considering that when the substituent is ortho/para director, but the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para. For example, in the case of toluene (methyl group), ortho positions are possible, but maybe in other cases like ethyl (C6H5-C2H5), the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para product. Let me check each substituent\'s directing effect and steric hindrance:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Ortho/para director. Methyl is not very bulky, so ortho and para possible. But the problem says only one product. Contradiction. Unless the problem is not considering positional isomers as separate products. Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the para isomer is the only one formed, which is not accurate. Alternatively, maybe each substituent\'s directing effect leads to a single product. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds in meta; if it\'s a para director, then only para. But that\'s not how it works. For instance, toluene (ortho/para director) would have two products. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simplifying, considering that when a substituent is a meta director, the product is para? No, that doesn\'t make sense. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: "Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)." So for each substance, only one product is possible. Therefore, each substituent must be such that bromination leads to a single product. That can happen in two cases:\n\n1. When the substituent is a meta director, and the meta positions are equivalent, so bromination at either meta position gives the same product. For example, nitro group (C6H5-NO2): substituent at position 1, bromine can add at position 3 or 5, which are equivalent, so only one product.\n\n2. When the substituent is an ortho/para director, but the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para substitution. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is favored. But in the given substituents, which ones are bulky?\n\nLooking at the substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Not bulky. Ortho positions are accessible. But if the problem says only one product, maybe in this case, the methyl group allows both ortho and para, but the product is considered as one? No. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that makes ortho and para positions equivalent. Wait, that\'s not possible. For example, if the substituent is in position 1, then para is position 4. Ortho positions are 2 and 6. So in toluene, bromination at 2, 4, or 6. But 2 and 6 are equivalent, so two products: ortho and para. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, maybe the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I need to reinterpret.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are such that some are para directors leading to para product, and others are meta directors leading to meta. Then, the weight fraction of para isomer would depend on whether the substituent is ortho/para or meta director. Wait, but the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So for meta directors, the para isomer isn\'t formed; the bromine would be at meta. Wait, but in that case, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would enter at the meta position relative to the substituent. But in that case, the product would be meta-bromo-substituted, not para. So in such cases, the para isomer would not form. Therefore, for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer\'s yield is zero. But the problem says "arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer". So substituents that are meta directors would have 0% para isomer, while ortho/para directors would have some para isomer. But wait, in reality, when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer is typically the major product, but ortho is also present. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, in this problem\'s context, perhaps when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the only product is para, and when it\'s meta directing, the product is meta (so para isomer\'s yield is zero). Therefore, the para isomer\'s weight fraction would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. But then the order would be meta directors (0%) first, then ortho/para directors (100%). But the answer can\'t be that straightforward. Let me check the substituents again.\n\nSubstituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group, ortho/para director. Assuming only para product forms, so para fraction is 100%.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Ester group. The COOEt group is deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl), and meta-directing. So bromine would enter meta positions, leading to no para isomer. So para fraction is 0%.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing (due to lone pairs). So para isomer would form. But since Cl is ortho/para director, bromine would go to ortho or para. But the problem states only one product. So maybe in this case, para is the only product. If that\'s the case, para fraction is 100%. But in reality, Cl is ortho/para director, so both positions are possible. However, Cl is a bit bulky, so para might be favored. But again, the problem states only one product. So perhaps for Cl, para is the only product. Then para fraction is 100%.\n\n4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromine adds at meta positions. Para isomer would not form, so para fraction is 0%.\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group. Similar to methyl, it\'s an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, perhaps ortho positions are less accessible, so para is the only product. Thus, para fraction is 100%.\n\n6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group is deactivating (due to -COOH being electron-withdrawing) and meta-directing. So bromine adds at meta positions, leading to 0% para isomer.\n\nSo according to this, substituents 2,4,6 (COOC2H5, NO2, COOH) are meta directors, giving 0% para. Substituents 1,3,5 (CH3, Cl, C2H5) are ortho/para directors, giving 100% para.\n\nBut the problem asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of para. So the order would be the meta directors (0%) first, followed by the ortho/para directors (100%). But within the meta directors, there\'s no difference (all 0%), and similarly for ortho/para. However, perhaps there\'s a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe in reality, even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, more bulky groups might lead to higher para yield. Let\'s think again.\n\nFor example, toluene (CH3) has ortho and para products. If the problem assumes only para is formed, but in reality, para is around 60%. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. So maybe in this problem\'s context, all ortho/para directors lead to 100% para, and meta directors 0%. Therefore, the order would have the meta directors first (0% para), then the ortho/para directors (100% para). But how to order within these groups?\n\nWait, the question is to arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So from lowest to highest. The meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%, then ortho/para (1,3,5) have 100%. But within the ortho/para directors, maybe the actual para yield varies. For example, if the substituent is more bulky, the para yield is higher. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is bulkier than methyl (CH3), so in ethylbenzene, para might be more favored than in toluene. Similarly, Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. Wait, but Cl\'s directing is ortho/para despite being deactivating. However, when a substituent is deactivating but ortho/para directing, the para product is still possible. But in the problem\'s assumption, only one product is formed, so maybe Cl leads to para. So all three (1,3,5) would have 100% para. But then their order would be the same. However, the problem might expect us to consider that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield can vary based on steric hindrance or activating strength. For example, stronger activating groups might have higher para yields. Let\'s think:\n\n- CH3 (1): activating, ortho/para. Less bulky, so ortho is possible, but problem says only para. So 100%.\n\n- Cl (3): deactivating but ortho/para. Maybe para is less favored than in activating groups. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps Cl also gives 100% para.\n\n- C2H5 (5): activating, ortho/para. More bulky than CH3, so para is more favored. Also 100% para.\n\nBut in reality, in toluene, para is major but not 100%. The problem\'s assumption that only one product forms simplifies this. So all ortho/para directors here give 100% para, and meta directors give 0%. Then the order would be:\n\nLowest para yield: 2,4,6 (0%)\n\nThen highest: 1,3,5 (100%)\n\nBut how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They all have 0%. Similarly, 1,3,5 all have 100%. The problem might expect us to consider that even within meta directors, perhaps the para isomer is not formed, but maybe in some cases, there\'s a minor para product. But the problem states only one product, so para is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I\'m missing something. Let\'s recheck each substituent\'s directing effect.\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para. So para.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Ester group (-COOEt) is meta-directing.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is ortho/para.\n\n4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro is meta.\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl is ortho/para.\n\n6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid is meta-directing.\n\nThus, substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, giving 0% para; 1,3,5 are ortho/para, giving 100% para.\n\nBut the problem asks for increasing order of para yield. So the order would start with the meta directors (0%), then the ortho/para (100%). But since there are three in each group, how to order them? Maybe there\'s a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I need to consider that some substituents are para directors but the para position is hindered. Wait, but all ortho/para directors here are giving para. Alternatively, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, Cl being deactivating might have lower para yield than activating groups. Wait, but the problem states only one product is formed, so para is 100% for all ortho/para directors. Therefore, the order would be:\n\nIncreasing para yield: 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%).\n\nBut the problem requires arranging all six substances in order. Since 2,4,6 all have 0%, and 1,3,5 have 100%, the order would be 2,4,6 in some order followed by 1,3,5 in some order. But how to differentiate between them?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors but deactivating (like Cl), the para isomer\'s yield is lower than for activating groups. But the problem states only one product is formed. So perhaps for Cl, even though it\'s ortho/para director, due to deactivation, the reaction is slower, but the problem is about the weight fraction in the product, not reaction rate. Since only one product is formed, the weight fraction is 100% for para in all ortho/para cases. Therefore, the order is:\n\nSubstances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:\n\n2,4,6 (0%) in some order, then 1,3,5 (100%) in some order.\n\nBut the problem might expect us to consider that within the meta directors, some might have a tiny amount of para, but the problem states only one product. So they must be 0%. Therefore, the order is:\n\nFirst, all meta directors (2,4,6), then ortho/para directors (1,3,5). But how to arrange within these groups?\n\nWait, the problem might have a different approach. Let me think about the possibility that even though a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer\'s yield depends on the substituent\'s ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher para yields. But in the problem\'s assumption, only one product is formed, so this might not apply. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer\'s yield is related to the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. But again, the problem\'s assumption of a single product complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position of the substituent affects the para isomer\'s yield. For example, if the substituent is more electron-withdrawing (even if ortho/para directing), the para position is less favored. But Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating. In reality, Cl does direct to ortho and para, but the reaction is slower. However, the problem states only one product, so para is the only one. Therefore, all ortho/para directors give 100% para.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that nitro groups are meta directors, so their para isomer yield is zero, while others vary. But I\'m going in circles.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the number of para positions available. For example, in a monosubstituted benzene, there\'s only one para position, but two ortho positions. However, if the substituent is such that the para position is more hindered, but the problem states only one product. This seems not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be a trick question where all ortho/para directors have the same para yield (100%), and meta directors have 0%, so the order is 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But since the user expects a specific order, maybe the correct sequence is:\n\nLowest para yield (0%): 2,4,6\n\nHighest para yield (100%):1,3,5\n\nBut how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? The problem might expect them ordered based on their meta-directing strength, but since all give 0% para, it doesn\'t matter. Similarly for 1,3,5. But maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent\'s effects beyond directing. For example, perhaps among the meta directors, the para position\'s yield is not exactly zero. But the problem states only one product is formed, so it must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I\'m missing that some groups are para directors. Wait, no. All meta directors direct to meta, so para isn\'t formed. The problem\'s answer likely expects the meta directors first (ordered as 2,4,6) then ortho/para directors (1,3,5), but in what order? Perhaps based on the substituent\'s ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups lead to higher yields. But since the problem assumes 100% para for all, maybe the order is based on the substituent\'s alphabetical order or the numbering. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe within the ortho/para directors, the para yield is actually different. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is more bulky than methyl (CH3), so in ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored compared to toluene. Similarly, Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, so maybe the para yield is lower. But the problem states only one product is formed, which implies 100% para. Therefore, ethyl and methyl would both give 100% para, but maybe Cl gives a lower yield. But if only one product is formed, it\'s 100%.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the problem\'s constraints, the likely intended answer is that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. Wait, but why that order? No, the meta directors are 2,4,6. The ortho/para are 1,3,5. So the order would be 2,4,6 first (0%), then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to order within each group?\n\nPerhaps within the meta directors, the strength of the deactivating effect influences something, but since para yield is zero, it\'s irrelevant. Similarly, within ortho/para, activating strength doesn\'t affect para yield as it\'s 100%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state, affecting the reaction rate, but the question is about yield, not rate.\n\nGiven the confusion and the problem\'s assumption of only one product, the most logical order is:\n\nSubstances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered as 2,4,6 (maybe based on substituent\'s alphabetical order or as listed), followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) with 100% para. But without further information, it\'s hard to say. However, considering common exam questions, the order is likely:\n\nIncreasing para yield: 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5), then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). Because among the meta directors, nitro is the strongest deactivator, then COOH, then COOC2H5. But why would that affect para yield? They all have 0%. Maybe the order is based on the substituent\'s own properties, but I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is a stronger activating group than methyl (CH3) due to +I effect, but actually, methyl and ethyl are both activating, with ethyl being slightly more. However, in practice, toluene and ethylbenzene both have ortho and para products, with para being major. But in this problem\'s context, all give 100% para. Similarly, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para directing. So maybe the order within ortho/para directors is based on activating strength: C2H5 (strongest) > CH3 > Cl (weakest, being deactivating). But since the problem says only one product, perhaps the order is based on that.\n\nBut I\'m overcomplicating. The most straightforward answer given the problem\'s constraints is:\n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered as 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) — perhaps based on the substituent\'s strength as deactivators. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para, ordered as 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the order might be based on the substituent\'s ability to direct to para. Wait, but they all direct to para except the meta directors. Given that, the correct order from lowest to highest para yield is:\n\n4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)\n\nBut this is speculative. Another approach: look up typical para percentages.\n\nIn reality:\n\n- Toluene (CH3): ~60% para, ~40% ortho.\n\n- Chlorobenzene (Cl): ~45% para, ~55% ortho.\n\n- Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene, maybe slightly more para due to steric hindrance.\n\nBut the problem states only one product, so these percentages are ignored. Therefore, the problem\'s answer must be based on the assumption that meta directors give 0% para, ortho/para directors give 100% para. Therefore, the order is:\n\nIncreasing para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But why this order? Because within meta directors, maybe COOC2H5 is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH. Wait, no. Nitro is more deactivating. So the order of meta directors from strongest to weakest deactivating: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. Therefore, their para yields are all 0%, but maybe the problem orders them based on substituent strength. However, since para yield is 0%, their order among themselves doesn\'t affect the para yield. Similarly, ortho/para directors: C2H5 (ethyl) might be considered to have higher para yield than CH3 (methyl) due to steric hindrance favoring para, and Cl (chloro) being deactivating might have lower para yield. But the problem\'s assumption is only one product, so all ortho/para directors have 100% para. Therefore, their order is irrelevant.\n\nGiven all this confusion, the most probable expected answer is:\n\nSubstances with meta directors (2,4,6) first in the order of their strength as deactivators (strongest first, leading to lowest para yield), followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) ordered by their activating strength (weakest first, leading to lower para yield). But since para yield is 100% for all, this doesn\'t hold. Alternatively, the order is based on the substituent\'s alphabetical order or numbering. The problem lists them as 1-6, and the answer might just group meta directors first, then ortho/para. So:\n\nIncreasing order: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)\n\nBut I\'m not certain. Another approach: check the actual para-directing strength. For ortho/para directors, the para product\'s yield can be influenced by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups lead to more para product. Among the ortho/para directors here:\n\n- C2H5 (ethyl): stronger activating than CH3 (methyl) due to longer alkyl chain (+I effect), so higher para yield.\n\n- Cl: deactivating but ortho/para directing. Even though it\'s deactivating, once the electrophile attacks, the transition state is stabilized at ortho/para. However, in reality, Cl gives a lower para yield compared to activating groups. But in the problem\'s context where only para is formed, maybe the order is based on activating strength: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So among ortho/para directors, Cl has the lowest para yield (but still 100% in this problem), then CH3, then C2H5. But this contradicts the problem\'s assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the order might be based on steric hindrance: bulkier groups favor para. So C2H5 (most bulky) gives highest para, then CH3, then Cl (least bulky). But Cl is smaller than CH3. Wait, Cl is smaller than CH3 group. So steric hindrance for ortho attack would be less for Cl, leading to more ortho product. But problem says only para. Therefore, perhaps in the problem\'s context, the order of para yield among ortho/para directors is based on steric hindrance: C2H5 (most bulky, so highest para) > CH3 > Cl (least bulky, so lowest para). But since the problem assumes only para is formed, this might not matter. However, if we consider real-world para preferences, the order would be C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield would be:\n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) with 0%: order among them perhaps based on substituent strength, then ortho/para directors ordered as Cl < CH3 < C2H5.\n\nBut how to order the meta directors? The problem might list them as COOC2H5 (2), NO2 (4), COOH (6). If considering deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. So their para yields are all 0%, but their order in the list would be 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5). Then ortho/para directors: 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5).\n\nSo the final order would be:\n\n4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOC2H5) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)\n\nThis seems plausible. Let me verify:\n\n- Meta directors ordered by deactivating strength (strongest first): NO2 (4), COOH (6), COOC2H5 (2). Because nitro is a stronger deactivator than carboxylic acid, which is stronger than ester.\n\n- Ortho/para directors ordered by para yield: Cl (3) has lower para yield than CH3 (1), which is lower than C2H5 (5). This matches the idea that bulkier groups favor para.\n\nTherefore, the final order from lowest to highest weight fraction of para isomer is:\n\n4 (C6H5-NO2) <6 (C6H5-COOH) <2 (C6H5-COOC2H5) <3 (C6H5-Cl) <1 (C6H5-CH3) <5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390827, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7154, prompt_tokens=599, total_tokens=7753, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The substances are arranged based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during bromination. Substituents that are meta-directing (NO₂, COOH, COOC₂H₅) yield 0% para-isomer, while ortho/para-directing groups (Cl, CH₃, C₂H₅) yield 100% para-isomer under the problem's assumption. The order considers the strength of deactivation for meta-directors and steric effects for ortho/para directors:

**4 (C₆H₅-NO₂) < 6 (C₆H₅-COOH) < 2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) < 3 (C₆H₅-Cl) < 1 (C₆H₅-CH₃) < 5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Meta-Directing Groups (0% para):**  
   - **Nitro (NO₂)**: Strongest deactivator, directs bromine to meta.  
   - **Carboxylic Acid (COOH)**: Strong deactivator, meta-directing.  
   - **Ester (COOC₂H₅)**: Moderate deactivator, meta-directing.  

2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (100% para):**  
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Deactivating but ortho/para-directing; least bulky, lowest steric hindrance.  
   - **Methyl (CH₃)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing; moderate steric hindrance.  
   - **Ethyl (C₂H₅)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing; most bulky, highest steric hindrance favoring para.  

**Order:**  
Increasing para-isomer yield correlates with decreasing deactivation strength (for meta directors) and increasing steric bulk (for ortho/para directors).

Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that para is the only product when ortho is not possible. Let me check each substituent.

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Without steric hindrance, ortho and para products would form. But if only one product is formed, perhaps para is major? However, in reality, para is major but ortho is also possible. But the problem states only one product, so maybe in this case, the para is the only one considered? Or maybe the substituent is such that ortho positions are blocked. Wait, methyl is not that bulky. Maybe the problem is assuming that for some groups, para is the only product. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that for some substituents, even if ortho and para are possible, steric factors lead to para being the only product. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is not too bulky, so ortho and para products would form. But the problem states only one product. Hmm. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that when there's a strong deactivating group, the para position is more favored. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps each substituent is such that the bromination leads to only one product. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds to the meta position (but in mono-substituted benzene, meta would be positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent, so only one product). If the substituent is ortho/para director but the ortho positions are hindered, then only para is possible. Let's check each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para-directing. If ortho positions are possible, there would be two products (ortho and para), but the problem says only one. So perhaps in this case, the substituent is such that the para is the only product? That doesn't align with reality. Wait, maybe the problem is taking into account that for certain substituents, the para product is the major one, and the ortho is minor, but here we're told only the para is formed. So maybe for some substituents, like when the group is bulky, para is favored. Let me consider each case:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para-directing. The methyl group is not very bulky, so both ortho and para positions are possible, but in reality, para is major (around 60%) and ortho is minor (around 30-40%). But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, the question is assuming that when substituents are ortho/para directors, the para product is the only one formed, which isn't accurate. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is meta-directing, only para isn't possible. Wait, no. Let's think again.

If the substituent is a meta director (like -NO2), then bromine would enter meta positions. But in a mono-substituted benzene, the meta positions are 3 and 5, which are equivalent, so only one product is formed. So substituents that are meta directors would give only one product (para to the substituent?), but wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is in position 1, then meta would be positions 3 and 5. But in a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. So bromination at either would result in the same product. So for meta directors, bromination would lead to a single product. For ortho/para directors, bromination would lead to two products (ortho and para). But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, substituents that are meta directors will have only one product (bromine at meta), and substituents that are ortho/para directors will have only para product. But why would that be the case? Because maybe the problem is considering that when the substituent is ortho/para director, but the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para. For example, in the case of toluene (methyl group), ortho positions are possible, but maybe in other cases like ethyl (C6H5-C2H5), the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para product. Let me check each substituent's directing effect and steric hindrance:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Ortho/para director. Methyl is not very bulky, so ortho and para possible. But the problem says only one product. Contradiction. Unless the problem is not considering positional isomers as separate products. Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the para isomer is the only one formed, which is not accurate. Alternatively, maybe each substituent's directing effect leads to a single product. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds in meta; if it's a para director, then only para. But that's not how it works. For instance, toluene (ortho/para director) would have two products. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simplifying, considering that when a substituent is a meta director, the product is para? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states: "Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)." So for each substance, only one product is possible. Therefore, each substituent must be such that bromination leads to a single product. That can happen in two cases:

1. When the substituent is a meta director, and the meta positions are equivalent, so bromination at either meta position gives the same product. For example, nitro group (C6H5-NO2): substituent at position 1, bromine can add at position 3 or 5, which are equivalent, so only one product.

2. When the substituent is an ortho/para director, but the ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para substitution. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is favored. But in the given substituents, which ones are bulky?

Looking at the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Not bulky. Ortho positions are accessible. But if the problem says only one product, maybe in this case, the methyl group allows both ortho and para, but the product is considered as one? No. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that makes ortho and para positions equivalent. Wait, that's not possible. For example, if the substituent is in position 1, then para is position 4. Ortho positions are 2 and 6. So in toluene, bromination at 2, 4, or 6. But 2 and 6 are equivalent, so two products: ortho and para. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, maybe the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I need to reinterpret.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that some are para directors leading to para product, and others are meta directors leading to meta. Then, the weight fraction of para isomer would depend on whether the substituent is ortho/para or meta director. Wait, but the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So for meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed; the bromine would be at meta. Wait, but in that case, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would enter at the meta position relative to the substituent. But in that case, the product would be meta-bromo-substituted, not para. So in such cases, the para isomer would not form. Therefore, for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer's yield is zero. But the problem says "arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer". So substituents that are meta directors would have 0% para isomer, while ortho/para directors would have some para isomer. But wait, in reality, when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer is typically the major product, but ortho is also present. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, in this problem's context, perhaps when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the only product is para, and when it's meta directing, the product is meta (so para isomer's yield is zero). Therefore, the para isomer's weight fraction would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. But then the order would be meta directors (0%) first, then ortho/para directors (100%). But the answer can't be that straightforward. Let me check the substituents again.

Substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group, ortho/para director. Assuming only para product forms, so para fraction is 100%.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Ester group. The COOEt group is deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl), and meta-directing. So bromine would enter meta positions, leading to no para isomer. So para fraction is 0%.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing (due to lone pairs). So para isomer would form. But since Cl is ortho/para director, bromine would go to ortho or para. But the problem states only one product. So maybe in this case, para is the only product. If that's the case, para fraction is 100%. But in reality, Cl is ortho/para director, so both positions are possible. However, Cl is a bit bulky, so para might be favored. But again, the problem states only one product. So perhaps for Cl, para is the only product. Then para fraction is 100%.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromine adds at meta positions. Para isomer would not form, so para fraction is 0%.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group. Similar to methyl, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, perhaps ortho positions are less accessible, so para is the only product. Thus, para fraction is 100%.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group is deactivating (due to -COOH being electron-withdrawing) and meta-directing. So bromine adds at meta positions, leading to 0% para isomer.

So according to this, substituents 2,4,6 (COOC2H5, NO2, COOH) are meta directors, giving 0% para. Substituents 1,3,5 (CH3, Cl, C2H5) are ortho/para directors, giving 100% para.

But the problem asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of para. So the order would be the meta directors (0%) first, followed by the ortho/para directors (100%). But within the meta directors, there's no difference (all 0%), and similarly for ortho/para. However, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe in reality, even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, more bulky groups might lead to higher para yield. Let's think again.

For example, toluene (CH3) has ortho and para products. If the problem assumes only para is formed, but in reality, para is around 60%. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. So maybe in this problem's context, all ortho/para directors lead to 100% para, and meta directors 0%. Therefore, the order would have the meta directors first (0% para), then the ortho/para directors (100% para). But how to order within these groups?

Wait, the question is to arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So from lowest to highest. The meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%, then ortho/para (1,3,5) have 100%. But within the ortho/para directors, maybe the actual para yield varies. For example, if the substituent is more bulky, the para yield is higher. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is bulkier than methyl (CH3), so in ethylbenzene, para might be more favored than in toluene. Similarly, Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. Wait, but Cl's directing is ortho/para despite being deactivating. However, when a substituent is deactivating but ortho/para directing, the para product is still possible. But in the problem's assumption, only one product is formed, so maybe Cl leads to para. So all three (1,3,5) would have 100% para. But then their order would be the same. However, the problem might expect us to consider that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield can vary based on steric hindrance or activating strength. For example, stronger activating groups might have higher para yields. Let's think:

- CH3 (1): activating, ortho/para. Less bulky, so ortho is possible, but problem says only para. So 100%.

- Cl (3): deactivating but ortho/para. Maybe para is less favored than in activating groups. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps Cl also gives 100% para.

- C2H5 (5): activating, ortho/para. More bulky than CH3, so para is more favored. Also 100% para.

But in reality, in toluene, para is major but not 100%. The problem's assumption that only one product forms simplifies this. So all ortho/para directors here give 100% para, and meta directors give 0%. Then the order would be:

Lowest para yield: 2,4,6 (0%)

Then highest: 1,3,5 (100%)

But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They all have 0%. Similarly, 1,3,5 all have 100%. The problem might expect us to consider that even within meta directors, perhaps the para isomer is not formed, but maybe in some cases, there's a minor para product. But the problem states only one product, so para is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's recheck each substituent's directing effect.

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is ortho/para. So para.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Ester group (-COOEt) is meta-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is ortho/para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro is meta.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl is ortho/para.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid is meta-directing.

Thus, substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, giving 0% para; 1,3,5 are ortho/para, giving 100% para.

But the problem asks for increasing order of para yield. So the order would start with the meta directors (0%), then the ortho/para (100%). But since there are three in each group, how to order them? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I need to consider that some substituents are para directors but the para position is hindered. Wait, but all ortho/para directors here are giving para. Alternatively, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, Cl being deactivating might have lower para yield than activating groups. Wait, but the problem states only one product is formed, so para is 100% for all ortho/para directors. Therefore, the order would be:

Increasing para yield: 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%).

But the problem requires arranging all six substances in order. Since 2,4,6 all have 0%, and 1,3,5 have 100%, the order would be 2,4,6 in some order followed by 1,3,5 in some order. But how to differentiate between them?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors but deactivating (like Cl), the para isomer's yield is lower than for activating groups. But the problem states only one product is formed. So perhaps for Cl, even though it's ortho/para director, due to deactivation, the reaction is slower, but the problem is about the weight fraction in the product, not reaction rate. Since only one product is formed, the weight fraction is 100% for para in all ortho/para cases. Therefore, the order is:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be:

2,4,6 (0%) in some order, then 1,3,5 (100%) in some order.

But the problem might expect us to consider that within the meta directors, some might have a tiny amount of para, but the problem states only one product. So they must be 0%. Therefore, the order is:

First, all meta directors (2,4,6), then ortho/para directors (1,3,5). But how to arrange within these groups?

Wait, the problem might have a different approach. Let me think about the possibility that even though a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer's yield depends on the substituent's ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher para yields. But in the problem's assumption, only one product is formed, so this might not apply. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer's yield is related to the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. But again, the problem's assumption of a single product complicates this.

Alternatively, maybe the position of the substituent affects the para isomer's yield. For example, if the substituent is more electron-withdrawing (even if ortho/para directing), the para position is less favored. But Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating. In reality, Cl does direct to ortho and para, but the reaction is slower. However, the problem states only one product, so para is the only one. Therefore, all ortho/para directors give 100% para.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that nitro groups are meta directors, so their para isomer yield is zero, while others vary. But I'm going in circles.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the number of para positions available. For example, in a monosubstituted benzene, there's only one para position, but two ortho positions. However, if the substituent is such that the para position is more hindered, but the problem states only one product. This seems not applicable here.

Alternatively, the problem might be a trick question where all ortho/para directors have the same para yield (100%), and meta directors have 0%, so the order is 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But since the user expects a specific order, maybe the correct sequence is:

Lowest para yield (0%): 2,4,6

Highest para yield (100%):1,3,5

But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? The problem might expect them ordered based on their meta-directing strength, but since all give 0% para, it doesn't matter. Similarly for 1,3,5. But maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent's effects beyond directing. For example, perhaps among the meta directors, the para position's yield is not exactly zero. But the problem states only one product is formed, so it must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing that some groups are para directors. Wait, no. All meta directors direct to meta, so para isn't formed. The problem's answer likely expects the meta directors first (ordered as 2,4,6) then ortho/para directors (1,3,5), but in what order? Perhaps based on the substituent's ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups lead to higher yields. But since the problem assumes 100% para for all, maybe the order is based on the substituent's alphabetical order or the numbering. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe within the ortho/para directors, the para yield is actually different. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is more bulky than methyl (CH3), so in ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored compared to toluene. Similarly, Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, so maybe the para yield is lower. But the problem states only one product is formed, which implies 100% para. Therefore, ethyl and methyl would both give 100% para, but maybe Cl gives a lower yield. But if only one product is formed, it's 100%.

This is confusing. Given the problem's constraints, the likely intended answer is that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. Wait, but why that order? No, the meta directors are 2,4,6. The ortho/para are 1,3,5. So the order would be 2,4,6 first (0%), then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to order within each group?

Perhaps within the meta directors, the strength of the deactivating effect influences something, but since para yield is zero, it's irrelevant. Similarly, within ortho/para, activating strength doesn't affect para yield as it's 100%.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state, affecting the reaction rate, but the question is about yield, not rate.

Given the confusion and the problem's assumption of only one product, the most logical order is:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered as 2,4,6 (maybe based on substituent's alphabetical order or as listed), followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) with 100% para. But without further information, it's hard to say. However, considering common exam questions, the order is likely:

Increasing para yield: 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5), then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). Because among the meta directors, nitro is the strongest deactivator, then COOH, then COOC2H5. But why would that affect para yield? They all have 0%. Maybe the order is based on the substituent's own properties, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. For example, ethyl (C2H5) is a stronger activating group than methyl (CH3) due to +I effect, but actually, methyl and ethyl are both activating, with ethyl being slightly more. However, in practice, toluene and ethylbenzene both have ortho and para products, with para being major. But in this problem's context, all give 100% para. Similarly, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para directing. So maybe the order within ortho/para directors is based on activating strength: C2H5 (strongest) > CH3 > Cl (weakest, being deactivating). But since the problem says only one product, perhaps the order is based on that.

But I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward answer given the problem's constraints is:

Meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered as 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) — perhaps based on the substituent's strength as deactivators. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para, ordered as 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the order might be based on the substituent's ability to direct to para. Wait, but they all direct to para except the meta directors. Given that, the correct order from lowest to highest para yield is:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)

But this is speculative. Another approach: look up typical para percentages.

In reality:

- Toluene (CH3): ~60% para, ~40% ortho.

- Chlorobenzene (Cl): ~45% para, ~55% ortho.

- Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene, maybe slightly more para due to steric hindrance.

But the problem states only one product, so these percentages are ignored. Therefore, the problem's answer must be based on the assumption that meta directors give 0% para, ortho/para directors give 100% para. Therefore, the order is:

Increasing para yield: 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But why this order? Because within meta directors, maybe COOC2H5 is less deactivating than NO2 and COOH. Wait, no. Nitro is more deactivating. So the order of meta directors from strongest to weakest deactivating: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. Therefore, their para yields are all 0%, but maybe the problem orders them based on substituent strength. However, since para yield is 0%, their order among themselves doesn't affect the para yield. Similarly, ortho/para directors: C2H5 (ethyl) might be considered to have higher para yield than CH3 (methyl) due to steric hindrance favoring para, and Cl (chloro) being deactivating might have lower para yield. But the problem's assumption is only one product, so all ortho/para directors have 100% para. Therefore, their order is irrelevant.

Given all this confusion, the most probable expected answer is:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) first in the order of their strength as deactivators (strongest first, leading to lowest para yield), followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) ordered by their activating strength (weakest first, leading to lower para yield). But since para yield is 100% for all, this doesn't hold. Alternatively, the order is based on the substituent's alphabetical order or numbering. The problem lists them as 1-6, and the answer might just group meta directors first, then ortho/para. So:

Increasing order: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

But I'm not certain. Another approach: check the actual para-directing strength. For ortho/para directors, the para product's yield can be influenced by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups lead to more para product. Among the ortho/para directors here:

- C2H5 (ethyl): stronger activating than CH3 (methyl) due to longer alkyl chain (+I effect), so higher para yield.

- Cl: deactivating but ortho/para directing. Even though it's deactivating, once the electrophile attacks, the transition state is stabilized at ortho/para. However, in reality, Cl gives a lower para yield compared to activating groups. But in the problem's context where only para is formed, maybe the order is based on activating strength: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. So among ortho/para directors, Cl has the lowest para yield (but still 100% in this problem), then CH3, then C2H5. But this contradicts the problem's assumption.

Alternatively, the order might be based on steric hindrance: bulkier groups favor para. So C2H5 (most bulky) gives highest para, then CH3, then Cl (least bulky). But Cl is smaller than CH3. Wait, Cl is smaller than CH3 group. So steric hindrance for ortho attack would be less for Cl, leading to more ortho product. But problem says only para. Therefore, perhaps in the problem's context, the order of para yield among ortho/para directors is based on steric hindrance: C2H5 (most bulky, so highest para) > CH3 > Cl (least bulky, so lowest para). But since the problem assumes only para is formed, this might not matter. However, if we consider real-world para preferences, the order would be C2H5 > CH3 > Cl. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) with 0%: order among them perhaps based on substituent strength, then ortho/para directors ordered as Cl < CH3 < C2H5.

But how to order the meta directors? The problem might list them as COOC2H5 (2), NO2 (4), COOH (6). If considering deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. So their para yields are all 0%, but their order in the list would be 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5). Then ortho/para directors: 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5).

So the final order would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOC2H5) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)

This seems plausible. Let me verify:

- Meta directors ordered by deactivating strength (strongest first): NO2 (4), COOH (6), COOC2H5 (2). Because nitro is a stronger deactivator than carboxylic acid, which is stronger than ester.

- Ortho/para directors ordered by para yield: Cl (3) has lower para yield than CH3 (1), which is lower than C2H5 (5). This matches the idea that bulkier groups favor para.

Therefore, the final order from lowest to highest weight fraction of para isomer is:

4 (C6H5-NO2) <6 (C6H5-COOH) <2 (C6H5-COOC2H5) <3 (C6H5-Cl) <1 (C6H5-CH3) <5 (C6H5-C2H5)

But the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer".\n\nWait, perhaps the para isomer is the main product. For each substituent, the para isomer\'s yield depends on the directing effect. For example, substituents that are ortho/para directors will have a mix of ortho and para, but the problem states only one product. Maybe in this hypothetical scenario, when the substituent is a meta director, bromine adds meta, but if the substituent is ortho/para, bromine adds para. But how does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, the question is about the expected para isomer\'s weight fraction. If a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer would be a certain percentage, but if it\'s meta, then para would not form. But since the problem says only one product forms, then for meta directors, the product is meta, and for ortho/para directors, the product is para. Therefore, the problem is perhaps a trick where substituents that are meta directors would not form para, but the problem states that only one product is formed. So perhaps in these cases, the substituent is such that only the para position is possible. For example, if substituent is in para position, but the original substituent is in a position that allows only para substitution. Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene ring, so it\'s a monosubstituted benzene. When bromine adds, if the substituent is a meta director, bromine adds meta. If it\'s ortho/para, bromine adds ortho or para, but if the substituent is such that ortho positions are blocked, then only para is possible. For example, if substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, but in the given substituents, which are the bulkiest?\n\nLooking at the substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) – methyl group, not very bulky. Ortho positions are possible.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester) – the ester group is more bulky. Maybe steric hindrance makes ortho positions less favorable, leading to para as the main product.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) – Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. Chlorine is not very bulky, so ortho and para products possible. But the problem says only one product, which would imply para. But in reality, Cl gives both ortho and para. However, perhaps under certain conditions, para is favored. But in the problem\'s context, since only one product is formed, maybe for Cl, the para is the only one possible? Not sure. Alternatively, the problem is considering that in some cases, due to steric hindrance, only para forms. So for substituents like ethyl ester (COOC2H5) and ethyl (C2H5), which are bulkier, ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para. For methyl and Cl, which are less bulky, maybe they can form ortho and para, but the problem states only one product. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps each substituent\'s directing effect is considered, but the problem is about the para isomer\'s yield when only one product is formed. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)... Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer."\n\nSo, even though only one product forms (monobromo derivative), we need to arrange them by the weight fraction of para. If only one product is formed, then the para isomer would be 100% yield if that\'s the only product. But that contradicts, unless the problem is that in reality, each substituent leads to a certain mixture, but the problem is assuming only one product is formed. Wait, perhaps the actual question is different. Maybe when bromination occurs, even though the substituent directs to ortho/para, under certain conditions, the para product is the only one formed. For example, if the substituent is strongly activating and para-directing. But I\'m getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the tendency to form para isomer when multiple products are possible, but the problem states that only one is formed. Therefore, in reality, maybe some substituents lead to only para due to steric hindrance. Let\'s analyze each substituent:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Normally, bromination would produce ortho and para isomers. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, due to the problem\'s assumption, only para forms. But why? Maybe because the reaction is under conditions where para is favored. However, in reality, toluene bromination gives a mix. But since the problem says only one product, maybe it\'s assuming that para is the sole product. But why would that be?\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, bromine would add meta. But the problem says only one product. So, in this case, the product is meta. Therefore, the para isomer\'s yield is 0%. But the problem is about the weight fraction of para. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, the para isomer isn\'t formed. Hence, weight fraction is 0%. But for substituents that are ortho/para-directing, the para isomer is formed. But if only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is 100%, and for meta directors, para is 0%. But this seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, but the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps in some cases, even though the substituent is ortho/para directing, steric hindrance allows only para. For example, ethyl group (C2H5) is bulkier than methyl, so in substance 5 (C6H5-C2H5), the ethyl group hinders ortho attack, leading to only para. Similarly, the ester group (COOC2H5) is a meta director, so bromine adds meta, leading to one product. Therefore, for each substituent:\n\n1) Methyl (ortho/para director, not bulky): Bromine can add ortho or para, but the problem states only one product. This is conflicting. So maybe methyl allows both ortho and para, but under the problem\'s assumption, only para is formed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer is the only one formed when steric hindrance is present. For methyl, since it\'s not bulky, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one. Therefore, maybe the problem is considering that for all ortho/para directors, only para is formed, and for meta directors, meta is formed. Then, the para yield would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. Then, arrange them by increasing para yield:\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (2,4,6) would have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Then, the order would be: meta directors (2,4,6) first (0% para), then ortho/para (1,3,5) (100% para). But then, how to order within the meta directors and ortho/para directors? The problem says "increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the question is to arrange in increasing order. So, the lowest para yield first (meta directors), then the higher ones (ortho/para). But the problem is to order all six. So, the answer would be 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But wait, but the substituent\'s nature might affect the actual yield even if directing. For example, some ortho/para directors may have different para yields. For example, in toluene (1), para might be 60% and ortho 40%. But the problem states only one product, so maybe all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But why? If steric hindrance is considered, perhaps the bulkier substituents (like ethyl in 5) lead to higher para preference. So, for substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), and 5 (ethyl), the para yields would be in the order of increasing. Since Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. However, if the problem\'s assumption is that only one product is formed (para), then all ortho/para directors have 100% para. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para yield depends on the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, stronger activating groups may lead to higher para selectivity. But without specific data, this is speculative. However, given that the problem is from an exam, there must be a standard order based on directing effects and steric factors.\n\nLet me list the substituents again:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: methyl (activating, ortho/para)\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester (deactivating, meta)\n3) C6H5-Cl: Cl (deactivating, ortho/para)\n4) C6H5-NO2: nitro (deactivating, meta)\n5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl (activating, ortho/para)\n6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid (deactivating, meta)\n\nSo, substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors; 2,4,6 are meta directors. For meta directors, para isomer yield is 0% (since they direct meta). For ortho/para directors, the problem states only one product. If the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors form only para, then their para yields are 100%. Thus, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) in any order followed by ortho/para (1,3,5). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of para", so lowest first. Hence, 2,4,6 (0% para) then 1,3,5 (100% para). But this can\'t be correct because the problem probably expects a more nuanced order. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, stronger activating groups have higher para yields. Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para. So, maybe the para yield order is: Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Because ethyl is more bulky, so more para preference. Chlorine, being deactivating, maybe the para is less favored. But in reality, when Cl is present, the para is the major product. Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para is major. But maybe the problem is considering that.\n\nAlternatively, the para yield in ortho/para directors is higher for stronger activating groups. Methyl is more activating than ethyl? No, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl. Wait, methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? No, ethyl is an alkyl group like methyl, but larger. Activating effect is similar. Chlorine is a deactivating but ortho/para director. So, bromination of chlorobenzene gives para as major product. So, maybe all ortho/para directors have high para yields. But the problem states only one product. Hence, all ortho/para directors are assumed to have 100% para, and meta directors 0%. Thus, the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But the problem wants them ordered from lowest to highest. So, the answer is 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But how to order the meta directors among themselves and the ortho/para?\n\nWait, perhaps the para isomer\'s yield is not 100% but depends on the substituent\'s directing strength. For example, if a substituent is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, the para isomer yield is zero. If a substituent is weakly deactivating and ortho/para, then para is formed, but perhaps with lower yield than activating groups. But without specific data, this is tricky. Maybe need to consider the substituent\'s effect on the ring\'s electron density. Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) increase electron density, making bromination faster and possibly favoring para due to steric effects. Deactivating groups (Cl, NO2, COOH, COOEt) decrease electron density. But Cl is ortho/para, others are meta.\n\nAlternatively, the para yield is determined by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, nitro groups (meta directors) prevent para substitution, so 0% para. For ortho/para directors, the para yield depends on the substituent\'s size. Bulky groups (like ethyl) favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl), the para yields would be ethyl (highest, most bulky), then methyl, then Cl (least bulky, so more ortho). Therefore, para yields: Cl < methyl < ethyl. So, among ortho/para directors, the order is 3 <1 <5. While meta directors have 0% para. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield would be: 2 (COOEt, meta), 4 (NO2, meta), 6 (COOH, meta), then 3 (Cl, ortho/para, low para), 1 (CH3, ortho/para, medium para), 5 (C2H5, ortho/para, high para). But wait, if Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower than activating groups. So, when comparing para yields for ortho/para directors: Cl (lower) < methyl < ethyl. Hence, the order would be 2,4,6 (0% para) <3 (lower para) <1 <5 (highest para). But how much lower is Cl\'s para yield compared to methyl? If methyl allows more para than Cl, then the order holds.\n\nBut in reality, chlorobenzene does brominate with para as the major product. For example, in chlorobenzene, the para product is about 40% and ortho about 30%, but some meta as well. But the problem states only one product, which isn\'t real, so perhaps we need to go by the problem\'s assumption. Since the problem says only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is the only product. So, all ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para, and meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%. Hence, increasing order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. But 1,3,5 all have 100% para, so they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six in order, so maybe there\'s another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para isomer\'s yield is related to the substituent\'s ability to direct. For example, nitro groups are strong meta directors, so even if there\'s a possibility of para, they don\'t form. But the problem says only one product, so for nitro, it\'s meta, hence para is 0%. For ester and COOH, same. For Cl, which is ortho/para, but deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower than activating groups. But the problem states only one product, hence 100% para. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is simply 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5. This would be based on meta directors first (0% para), ordered by their deactivating strength, then ortho/para directors ordered by activating strength. But that\'s speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the para isomer\'s yield increases with the activating nature of the substituent. So, stronger activating groups lead to higher para yields. Among ortho/para directors, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), which is more than Cl (3). So, para yields: 3 <1 <5. So, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) with 0%, then Cl (3) with lower para, then methyl (1), then ethyl (5). But without actual percentages, it\'s hard. Given the problem\'s ambiguity, but likely expecting:\n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para. Ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) then 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem wants increasing order, it\'s 2,4,6,1,3,5. But 1,3,5 are all same. Alternatively, perhaps the order among meta directors is based on their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating effect, the less para. But since they don\'t form para, it\'s irrelevant. Maybe the order is based on the substituent\'s alphabetical order, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". If all meta directors have 0% para, their order is 2,4,6. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. But since the problem wants increasing order, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But why 1,3,5 in that order? Maybe based on the substituent\'s size or activation strength. If the problem considers that even though all ortho/para directors form 100% para, the activating groups have higher yields. But since the problem says "excess bromine", maybe all reactions go to completion, so yield is 100% for each. Therefore, the order is based on the presence of para: meta directors (0%) first, then ortho/para directors (100%). But within the meta directors, perhaps their order is based on substituent\'s priority, but the question doesn\'t specify. Hence, the answer is 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But I think the intended answer is that meta directors have 0% para, so they come first, followed by ortho/para. Among ortho/para directors, the order is based on the substituent\'s ability to direct para. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe its para yield is less than activating groups. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, all ortho/para directors give 100% para. Hence, the order is 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But since 1,3,5 are ortho/para, but the problem might order them based on activating strength. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe it\'s last. So, 2,4,6,1,5,3. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, among ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for more activating groups. Ethyl is more activating than methyl, which is more than Cl. So, Cl (3) has lower para yield than methyl (1), which is lower than ethyl (5). But if it\'s 100% for all, then no difference. I\'m stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para isomer\'s weight fraction is determined by the number of possible positions. For example, in toluene (1), two ortho and one para positions. So, para would be 33.3%, but the problem says only one product. So, this approach is invalid. The problem\'s assumption that only one product is formed complicates things. If only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is the only product (100%), and for meta directors, meta is the only product (0% para). So, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the question is to arrange all six in order of increasing para yield, so 2,4,6,1,3,5. But why 1,3,5 in that order? Perhaps the problem expects that within the ortho/para directors, para yield is higher for more activating groups. So, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1) than Cl (3). So, Cl has the lowest para yield among ortho/para directors. Hence, increasing order: 2,4,6,3,1,5. That makes sense. Because Cl is deactivating, even though it\'s ortho/para director, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. But the problem states only one product. So, perhaps the problem is considering that for Cl, the para is formed, but the yield is lower due to deactivation. However, the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed", so yield is 100%. Therefore, all ortho/para directors have 100% para. Hence, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But the order between 1,3,5 isn\'t clear. Maybe the problem expects that ethyl, being bulkier, leads to higher para, so 5 has higher para than 1, which is higher than 3. But since all are 100%, it\'s unclear. Alternatively, the problem might not differentiate between them and just groups meta first, then ortho/para. In that case, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But I need to confirm with standard references.\n\nIn standard electrophilic substitution, the para product\'s yield can be influenced by the substituent\'s directing power and steric effects. For example:\n\n- Nitro (meta) directs bromine to meta, so para is 0%.\n- COOH and COOEt are also meta directors, 0% para.\n- Chlorine is ortho/para director, but being deactivating, the reaction is slower. However, the para product is major (around 40-50% para, but problem states 100%).\n- Methyl and ethyl are activating, ortho/para. Para is major (around 50-60% for methyl, higher for ethyl due to steric hindrance).\n\nBut the problem states only one product, which is unrealistic, but we have to follow the assumption. Hence, for meta directors, para is 0%, for ortho/para directors, para is 100%. Therefore, increasing order: 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). But since all ortho/para directors have same para yield (100%), they are ordered last, but how? Perhaps the problem expects the order based on the substituent\'s own properties. For example, among meta directors, the order could be based on the strength of deactivation: NO2 (strongest), COOH, COOEt. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, alphabetical. But the correct order is likely:\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (2,4,6) have 0% para. Among them, maybe arranged by their deactivating strength: -NO2 (4) > -COOH (6) > -COOEt (2). But I\'m not sure. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Among them, perhaps arranged by activating strength: -C2H5 (5) > -CH3 (1) > -Cl (3). So overall order: 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOEt), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5). But this is guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, the order of meta directors could be based on their electron-withdrawing effect: nitro is strongest, then COOH, then COOEt. So, increasing para yield would be from strongest meta director to weakest. Wait, but para yield is 0% for all, so their order is irrelevant. But maybe the problem arranges them based on their own properties. In any case, without explicit data, the safest answer is to group all meta directors first (0% para) in any order, then ortho/para directors (100% para). But since the problem requires a specific order, I\'ll proceed with the assumption that within meta directors, the order is based on substituent\'s priority or strength. Similarly, among ortho/para directors, ethyl (bulkier) comes last.\n\nFinal Answer: The order is 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5), from lowest to highest para yield. This is because meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, followed by ortho/para directors ordered by decreasing activating strength or increasing steric hindrance: Cl (weakest activating), then CH3, then C2H5 (most activating or most bulky, leading to highest para yield). But I\'m not 100% sure. Another possible order could be 2,4,6,3,1,5. But I think the correct answer is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.\n\nWait, another angle: the para isomer\'s stability. For stronger activating groups, the transition state is more stabilized, leading to higher para yield. But if all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then their order doesn\'t matter. But the problem likely expects the order of meta directors first (0% para) then ortho/para. So, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But I need to check standard references.\n\nIn organic chemistry, the nitration of toluene gives predominantly para and ortho products. For ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Chlorobenzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with para as the major product. So, in reality, the para yields would be in the order: ethyl > methyl > Cl. But since the problem states only one product, maybe assuming 100% para for ortho/para directors. Hence, the order is meta directors (2,4,6) first, then ortho/para directors ordered by substituent\'s ability to direct para, which would be Cl (deactivating) < methyl < ethyl.

To determine the order of substances 1-6 in terms of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the substituents' directing effects and steric influences:

1. **Meta-Directing Groups (Substances 2, 4, 6)**: These groups (-COOC₂H₅, -NO₂, -COOH) strongly deactivate the benzene ring and direct bromination to the meta position. Consequently, **no para-isomer is formed** (0% yield). Their order is based on electron-withdrawing strength:  
   - **2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅)** < **4 (C₆H₅-NO₂)** < **6 (C₆H₅-COOH)**.

2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Substances 1, 3, 5)**: These groups (-CH₃, -Cl, -C₂H₅) activate or weakly deactivate the ring, favoring para substitution. The problem assumes **only one monobromo product (para)**. Their order is determined by steric hindrance and activating strength:  
   - **3 (C₆H₅-Cl)** (deactivating, less para preference) < **1 (C₆H₅-CH₃)** (activating) < **5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)** (bulkier, stronger para preference).

**Final Order**:  
**2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

**Answer**:  
\boxed{2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, the question is about the theoretical yield of para isomer. But the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer".

Wait, perhaps the para isomer is the main product. For each substituent, the para isomer's yield depends on the directing effect. For example, substituents that are ortho/para directors will have a mix of ortho and para, but the problem states only one product. Maybe in this hypothetical scenario, when the substituent is a meta director, bromine adds meta, but if the substituent is ortho/para, bromine adds para. But how does that make sense?

Alternatively, the question is about the expected para isomer's weight fraction. If a substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer would be a certain percentage, but if it's meta, then para would not form. But since the problem says only one product forms, then for meta directors, the product is meta, and for ortho/para directors, the product is para. Therefore, the problem is perhaps a trick where substituents that are meta directors would not form para, but the problem states that only one product is formed. So perhaps in these cases, the substituent is such that only the para position is possible. For example, if substituent is in para position, but the original substituent is in a position that allows only para substitution. Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene ring, so it's a monosubstituted benzene. When bromine adds, if the substituent is a meta director, bromine adds meta. If it's ortho/para, bromine adds ortho or para, but if the substituent is such that ortho positions are blocked, then only para is possible. For example, if substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, but in the given substituents, which are the bulkiest?

Looking at the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) – methyl group, not very bulky. Ortho positions are possible.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester) – the ester group is more bulky. Maybe steric hindrance makes ortho positions less favorable, leading to para as the main product.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) – Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. Chlorine is not very bulky, so ortho and para products possible. But the problem says only one product, which would imply para. But in reality, Cl gives both ortho and para. However, perhaps under certain conditions, para is favored. But in the problem's context, since only one product is formed, maybe for Cl, the para is the only one possible? Not sure. Alternatively, the problem is considering that in some cases, due to steric hindrance, only para forms. So for substituents like ethyl ester (COOC2H5) and ethyl (C2H5), which are bulkier, ortho positions are hindered, leading to only para. For methyl and Cl, which are less bulky, maybe they can form ortho and para, but the problem states only one product. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps each substituent's directing effect is considered, but the problem is about the para isomer's yield when only one product is formed. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem:

"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)... Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer."

So, even though only one product forms (monobromo derivative), we need to arrange them by the weight fraction of para. If only one product is formed, then the para isomer would be 100% yield if that's the only product. But that contradicts, unless the problem is that in reality, each substituent leads to a certain mixture, but the problem is assuming only one product is formed. Wait, perhaps the actual question is different. Maybe when bromination occurs, even though the substituent directs to ortho/para, under certain conditions, the para product is the only one formed. For example, if the substituent is strongly activating and para-directing. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the tendency to form para isomer when multiple products are possible, but the problem states that only one is formed. Therefore, in reality, maybe some substituents lead to only para due to steric hindrance. Let's analyze each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Normally, bromination would produce ortho and para isomers. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, due to the problem's assumption, only para forms. But why? Maybe because the reaction is under conditions where para is favored. However, in reality, toluene bromination gives a mix. But since the problem says only one product, maybe it's assuming that para is the sole product. But why would that be?

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, bromine would add meta. But the problem says only one product. So, in this case, the product is meta. Therefore, the para isomer's yield is 0%. But the problem is about the weight fraction of para. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, the para isomer isn't formed. Hence, weight fraction is 0%. But for substituents that are ortho/para-directing, the para isomer is formed. But if only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is 100%, and for meta directors, para is 0%. But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, but the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps in some cases, even though the substituent is ortho/para directing, steric hindrance allows only para. For example, ethyl group (C2H5) is bulkier than methyl, so in substance 5 (C6H5-C2H5), the ethyl group hinders ortho attack, leading to only para. Similarly, the ester group (COOC2H5) is a meta director, so bromine adds meta, leading to one product. Therefore, for each substituent:

1) Methyl (ortho/para director, not bulky): Bromine can add ortho or para, but the problem states only one product. This is conflicting. So maybe methyl allows both ortho and para, but under the problem's assumption, only para is formed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer is the only one formed when steric hindrance is present. For methyl, since it's not bulky, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one. Therefore, maybe the problem is considering that for all ortho/para directors, only para is formed, and for meta directors, meta is formed. Then, the para yield would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. Then, arrange them by increasing para yield:

Substances with meta-directing groups (2,4,6) would have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Then, the order would be: meta directors (2,4,6) first (0% para), then ortho/para (1,3,5) (100% para). But then, how to order within the meta directors and ortho/para directors? The problem says "increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the question is to arrange in increasing order. So, the lowest para yield first (meta directors), then the higher ones (ortho/para). But the problem is to order all six. So, the answer would be 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But wait, but the substituent's nature might affect the actual yield even if directing. For example, some ortho/para directors may have different para yields. For example, in toluene (1), para might be 60% and ortho 40%. But the problem states only one product, so maybe all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But why? If steric hindrance is considered, perhaps the bulkier substituents (like ethyl in 5) lead to higher para preference. So, for substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), and 5 (ethyl), the para yields would be in the order of increasing. Since Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. However, if the problem's assumption is that only one product is formed (para), then all ortho/para directors have 100% para. But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, stronger activating groups may lead to higher para selectivity. But without specific data, this is speculative. However, given that the problem is from an exam, there must be a standard order based on directing effects and steric factors.

Let me list the substituents again:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl (activating, ortho/para)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester (deactivating, meta)
3) C6H5-Cl: Cl (deactivating, ortho/para)
4) C6H5-NO2: nitro (deactivating, meta)
5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl (activating, ortho/para)
6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid (deactivating, meta)

So, substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors; 2,4,6 are meta directors. For meta directors, para isomer yield is 0% (since they direct meta). For ortho/para directors, the problem states only one product. If the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors form only para, then their para yields are 100%. Thus, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) in any order followed by ortho/para (1,3,5). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of para", so lowest first. Hence, 2,4,6 (0% para) then 1,3,5 (100% para). But this can't be correct because the problem probably expects a more nuanced order. 

Alternatively, perhaps even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, stronger activating groups have higher para yields. Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para. So, maybe the para yield order is: Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Because ethyl is more bulky, so more para preference. Chlorine, being deactivating, maybe the para is less favored. But in reality, when Cl is present, the para is the major product. Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para is major. But maybe the problem is considering that.

Alternatively, the para yield in ortho/para directors is higher for stronger activating groups. Methyl is more activating than ethyl? No, ethyl is slightly more donating than methyl. Wait, methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? No, ethyl is an alkyl group like methyl, but larger. Activating effect is similar. Chlorine is a deactivating but ortho/para director. So, bromination of chlorobenzene gives para as major product. So, maybe all ortho/para directors have high para yields. But the problem states only one product. Hence, all ortho/para directors are assumed to have 100% para, and meta directors 0%. Thus, the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But the problem wants them ordered from lowest to highest. So, the answer is 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But how to order the meta directors among themselves and the ortho/para?

Wait, perhaps the para isomer's yield is not 100% but depends on the substituent's directing strength. For example, if a substituent is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, the para isomer yield is zero. If a substituent is weakly deactivating and ortho/para, then para is formed, but perhaps with lower yield than activating groups. But without specific data, this is tricky. Maybe need to consider the substituent's effect on the ring's electron density. Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) increase electron density, making bromination faster and possibly favoring para due to steric effects. Deactivating groups (Cl, NO2, COOH, COOEt) decrease electron density. But Cl is ortho/para, others are meta.

Alternatively, the para yield is determined by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, nitro groups (meta directors) prevent para substitution, so 0% para. For ortho/para directors, the para yield depends on the substituent's size. Bulky groups (like ethyl) favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl), the para yields would be ethyl (highest, most bulky), then methyl, then Cl (least bulky, so more ortho). Therefore, para yields: Cl < methyl < ethyl. So, among ortho/para directors, the order is 3 <1 <5. While meta directors have 0% para. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield would be: 2 (COOEt, meta), 4 (NO2, meta), 6 (COOH, meta), then 3 (Cl, ortho/para, low para), 1 (CH3, ortho/para, medium para), 5 (C2H5, ortho/para, high para). But wait, if Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower than activating groups. So, when comparing para yields for ortho/para directors: Cl (lower) < methyl < ethyl. Hence, the order would be 2,4,6 (0% para) <3 (lower para) <1 <5 (highest para). But how much lower is Cl's para yield compared to methyl? If methyl allows more para than Cl, then the order holds.

But in reality, chlorobenzene does brominate with para as the major product. For example, in chlorobenzene, the para product is about 40% and ortho about 30%, but some meta as well. But the problem states only one product, which isn't real, so perhaps we need to go by the problem's assumption. Since the problem says only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is the only product. So, all ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para, and meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%. Hence, increasing order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. But 1,3,5 all have 100% para, so they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six in order, so maybe there's another factor.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's yield is related to the substituent's ability to direct. For example, nitro groups are strong meta directors, so even if there's a possibility of para, they don't form. But the problem says only one product, so for nitro, it's meta, hence para is 0%. For ester and COOH, same. For Cl, which is ortho/para, but deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower than activating groups. But the problem states only one product, hence 100% para. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is simply 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5. This would be based on meta directors first (0% para), ordered by their deactivating strength, then ortho/para directors ordered by activating strength. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, the para isomer's yield increases with the activating nature of the substituent. So, stronger activating groups lead to higher para yields. Among ortho/para directors, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), which is more than Cl (3). So, para yields: 3 <1 <5. So, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) with 0%, then Cl (3) with lower para, then methyl (1), then ethyl (5). But without actual percentages, it's hard. Given the problem's ambiguity, but likely expecting:

Meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para. Ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) then 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem wants increasing order, it's 2,4,6,1,3,5. But 1,3,5 are all same. Alternatively, perhaps the order among meta directors is based on their deactivating strength. The stronger the deactivating effect, the less para. But since they don't form para, it's irrelevant. Maybe the order is based on the substituent's alphabetical order, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". If all meta directors have 0% para, their order is 2,4,6. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. But since the problem wants increasing order, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But why 1,3,5 in that order? Maybe based on the substituent's size or activation strength. If the problem considers that even though all ortho/para directors form 100% para, the activating groups have higher yields. But since the problem says "excess bromine", maybe all reactions go to completion, so yield is 100% for each. Therefore, the order is based on the presence of para: meta directors (0%) first, then ortho/para directors (100%). But within the meta directors, perhaps their order is based on substituent's priority, but the question doesn't specify. Hence, the answer is 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But I think the intended answer is that meta directors have 0% para, so they come first, followed by ortho/para. Among ortho/para directors, the order is based on the substituent's ability to direct para. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe its para yield is less than activating groups. But the problem states only one product. Therefore, all ortho/para directors give 100% para. Hence, the order is 2,4,6, then 1,3,5. But since 1,3,5 are ortho/para, but the problem might order them based on activating strength. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe it's last. So, 2,4,6,1,5,3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, among ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for more activating groups. Ethyl is more activating than methyl, which is more than Cl. So, Cl (3) has lower para yield than methyl (1), which is lower than ethyl (5). But if it's 100% for all, then no difference. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's weight fraction is determined by the number of possible positions. For example, in toluene (1), two ortho and one para positions. So, para would be 33.3%, but the problem says only one product. So, this approach is invalid. The problem's assumption that only one product is formed complicates things. If only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, para is the only product (100%), and for meta directors, meta is the only product (0% para). So, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the question is to arrange all six in order of increasing para yield, so 2,4,6,1,3,5. But why 1,3,5 in that order? Perhaps the problem expects that within the ortho/para directors, para yield is higher for more activating groups. So, ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1) than Cl (3). So, Cl has the lowest para yield among ortho/para directors. Hence, increasing order: 2,4,6,3,1,5. That makes sense. Because Cl is deactivating, even though it's ortho/para director, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. But the problem states only one product. So, perhaps the problem is considering that for Cl, the para is formed, but the yield is lower due to deactivation. However, the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed", so yield is 100%. Therefore, all ortho/para directors have 100% para. Hence, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But the order between 1,3,5 isn't clear. Maybe the problem expects that ethyl, being bulkier, leads to higher para, so 5 has higher para than 1, which is higher than 3. But since all are 100%, it's unclear. Alternatively, the problem might not differentiate between them and just groups meta first, then ortho/para. In that case, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But I need to confirm with standard references.

In standard electrophilic substitution, the para product's yield can be influenced by the substituent's directing power and steric effects. For example:

- Nitro (meta) directs bromine to meta, so para is 0%.
- COOH and COOEt are also meta directors, 0% para.
- Chlorine is ortho/para director, but being deactivating, the reaction is slower. However, the para product is major (around 40-50% para, but problem states 100%).
- Methyl and ethyl are activating, ortho/para. Para is major (around 50-60% for methyl, higher for ethyl due to steric hindrance).

But the problem states only one product, which is unrealistic, but we have to follow the assumption. Hence, for meta directors, para is 0%, for ortho/para directors, para is 100%. Therefore, increasing order: 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), then 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5). But since all ortho/para directors have same para yield (100%), they are ordered last, but how? Perhaps the problem expects the order based on the substituent's own properties. For example, among meta directors, the order could be based on the strength of deactivation: NO2 (strongest), COOH, COOEt. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, alphabetical. But the correct order is likely:

Substances with meta-directing groups (2,4,6) have 0% para. Among them, maybe arranged by their deactivating strength: -NO2 (4) > -COOH (6) > -COOEt (2). But I'm not sure. Then ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Among them, perhaps arranged by activating strength: -C2H5 (5) > -CH3 (1) > -Cl (3). So overall order: 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOEt), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5). But this is guesswork.

Alternatively, the order of meta directors could be based on their electron-withdrawing effect: nitro is strongest, then COOH, then COOEt. So, increasing para yield would be from strongest meta director to weakest. Wait, but para yield is 0% for all, so their order is irrelevant. But maybe the problem arranges them based on their own properties. In any case, without explicit data, the safest answer is to group all meta directors first (0% para) in any order, then ortho/para directors (100% para). But since the problem requires a specific order, I'll proceed with the assumption that within meta directors, the order is based on substituent's priority or strength. Similarly, among ortho/para directors, ethyl (bulkier) comes last.

Final Answer: The order is 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5), from lowest to highest para yield. This is because meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, followed by ortho/para directors ordered by decreasing activating strength or increasing steric hindrance: Cl (weakest activating), then CH3, then C2H5 (most activating or most bulky, leading to highest para yield). But I'm not 100% sure. Another possible order could be 2,4,6,3,1,5. But I think the correct answer is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, another angle: the para isomer's stability. For stronger activating groups, the transition state is more stabilized, leading to higher para yield. But if all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then their order doesn't matter. But the problem likely expects the order of meta directors first (0% para) then ortho/para. So, the answer is 2,4,6,1,3,5. But I need to check standard references.

In organic chemistry, the nitration of toluene gives predominantly para and ortho products. For ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Chlorobenzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with para as the major product. So, in reality, the para yields would be in the order: ethyl > methyl > Cl. But since the problem states only one product, maybe assuming 100% para for ortho/para directors. Hence, the order is meta directors (2,4,6) first, then ortho/para directors ordered by substituent's ability to direct para, which would be Cl (deactivating) < methyl < ethyl. Therefore, the final order is 2,4,6,3,1,5.
