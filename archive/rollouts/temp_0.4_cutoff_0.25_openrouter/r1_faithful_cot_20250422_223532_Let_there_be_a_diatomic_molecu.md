To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule XY to transition from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we analyze both vibrational and rotational energy transitions. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Vibrational Transition**: The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar\omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\).
   - **Rotational Transition**: The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B\), where \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\). 

2. **Moment of Inertia (I)**:
   - Reduced mass \(\mu = \frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \frac{(20)(2)}{20+2} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\).
   - \(I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\).

3. **Rotational Constant (B)**:
   - \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2(1.208 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The photon momentum is \(p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}\).

### Conclusion:
The next lowest energy state is the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). The required photon momentum is:

\(\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}}\)

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule XY needs to absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given parameters are the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length R (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration w (4e14 rad/s). 

First, let me recall the models involved here. The problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. This model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels, right? So, the total energy would be the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. 

In the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state, the vibrational quantum number v is 0. The rotational quantum number J would also be 0 in the lowest state. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. The question asks for the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to determine whether the lowest energy transition is a rotational excitation, a vibrational excitation, or a combination.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels for a non-rigid rotor are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1) - D [J (J + 1)]^2, where B is the rotational constant and D is the centrifugal distortion constant. However, since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, maybe we need to consider the rotational energy with some correction? But maybe for the lowest states, the centrifugal distortion term D is negligible, so we can approximate it as a rigid rotor? Wait, but the problem says non-rigid rotor model, so perhaps we need to include the correction. Hmm, but maybe the answer expects just the rigid rotor plus vibrational energy? Let me check.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next lowest energy state could be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational excitation). Since vibrational transitions typically require much more energy than rotational transitions, the next lowest energy state might be the first rotational excited state. However, the energy spacing between rotational levels is much smaller than vibrational. So if the photon has to cause a transition to the next lowest energy state, it might be a rotational transition. But wait, maybe in the combined rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both?

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator model for vibrations, the energy levels are equally spaced. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. For rotation, the energy levels are spaced by 2B, 4B, 6B, etc., since E_rot = B J(J+1). So the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) would require energy 2B. So we need to compare ħω and 2B to see which is smaller. If 2B < ħω, then the next state would be rotational; otherwise, vibrational.

So let's compute both energy differences.

First, calculate ħω. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Next, calculate the rotational constant B. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μR², where μ is the reduced mass. 

First, compute the reduced mass μ. The masses are given in amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg. My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = Let's compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg. Then numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg². So μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Now, compute I = μR². R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R² = 4e-20 m². Therefore, I = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Then the energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, since E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B. So 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Comparing this to the vibrational energy difference ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J. So 2B is much smaller than ħω (9.2e-23 vs 4.2e-20). Therefore, the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental (v=0, J=0) is v=0, J=1. Therefore, the photon needs to provide energy 2B. But wait, but in reality, transitions between rotational states have selection rules ΔJ = ±1. So if the molecule is in J=0, it can absorb a photon to go to J=1. So the energy required is 2B.

But wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Does that affect the rotational energy levels? The non-rigid rotor model includes the centrifugal distortion, which makes the energy levels not exactly spaced by 2B, 4B, etc., but slightly less. However, since the problem doesn't give the centrifugal distortion constant D, maybe we can ignore it and use the rigid rotor approximation. The question says "non-rigid rotor model" but perhaps expects us to use the rigid rotor for simplicity, given the data. Since D is not provided, we can't calculate it. So proceed with rigid rotor.

Therefore, the energy difference is 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the photon needs to have this energy. The momentum of the photon is E/c, since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/c.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, wait. Wait, but maybe the transition is not purely rotational. Because in the rotation-vibration model, the vibrational and rotational transitions can happen simultaneously. However, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest energy state would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since we found that 2B < ħω, the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). Therefore, the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring energy 2B. Therefore, the photon momentum is E/c = 2B/c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check the calculation steps again to make sure.

First, reduced mass:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Then convert to kg:

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68)/(2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Correct.

Then 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. 

But wait, another thought: in the vibration-rotation coupling, the rotational constant B actually depends on the vibrational state. However, in the rigid rotor approximation, we usually consider B as constant. But in reality, as the molecule vibrates, the bond length changes slightly, which affects the moment of inertia and hence B. However, since we are considering the transition from v=0 to v=0 (rotational only), maybe B is the same. So the calculation is okay.

Alternatively, if the transition were vibrational, the energy required would be ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J, which is much larger. Therefore, the lowest energy transition is rotational.

Therefore, the photon momentum is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me verify once more.

Wait, another point: the selection rules for rotational transitions in diatomic molecules. For pure rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. Similarly, for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when you have a vibrational transition, it is often accompanied by rotational transitions as well. But in the problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). To go to the next lowest energy state, which would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy, that's the next state. So the photon must have energy 2B. Then the momentum is E/c.

But let's compute the numerical value again:

E_photon = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.

p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.066...e-31 kg·m/s.

So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem might expect the answer in terms of units that are more standard. Let me check if I made any unit conversion errors.

Wait, the rotational constant B is often expressed in cm⁻¹ in spectroscopy. But here, we need to compute it in Joules for energy. Let's confirm:

ħ is in J·s, I is in kg·m², so B = ħ²/(2I) has units of (J²·s²)/(kg·m²) )? Wait, no. Let's check:

ħ has units of J·s. So ħ² has units J²·s². Divided by (2I) which has units kg·m². So J²·s²/(kg·m²). But 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². Therefore, J²·s² = kg²·m⁴/s². Then dividing by kg·m² gives kg·m²/s², which is J. So yes, B has units of J. Correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct. Hence, the momentum is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. 

But let me check with the given numbers again. Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct. The masses are 20 and 2 amu. Converted to kg correctly. The reduced mass is 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu, converted to kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I think the steps are correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But let me write it more precisely.

Calculating 9.2e-23 / 3e8:

9.2 / 3 = 3.066..., so 3.066e-31. So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem might want the answer in terms of ħ, ω, and other constants? But no, it just asks for the momentum. So the numerical value is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check if the exponent is correct.

Yes: 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-23-8 = 3.066...e-31. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of a formula, but it says "what momentum should an absorbed photon have", so likely a numerical value. The given data is in amu, angstroms, and angular frequency. Let me confirm all unit conversions.

Mass X: 20 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20 *1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg. Correct.

Mass Y: 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg. Correct.

Reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Divide by 2I = 2 *1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg·m²

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Correct.

2B = 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Correct.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. Depending on rounding, maybe 3.07e-31 or 3.1e-31. Let me check if there was a miscalculation in B.

Wait, let's compute B more accurately.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34

ħ² = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approximately 1.112 (since 1.0545718^2 ≈ 1.112), so 1.112e-68 J²s².

2I = 2 *1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = (1.112 / 2.416) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J. Correct.

Yes, so 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Therefore, the momentum is indeed 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.066...e-31 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, another thought: when a photon is absorbed by a molecule, the transition can involve both vibration and rotation. However, the selection rules for vibrational transitions usually require that Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. But in the case of a vibrational transition (Δv=+1), the rotational state can also change by ±1. So the combined vibration-rotation transition would have energy ħω + 2B (if ΔJ=+1) or ħω - 2B (if ΔJ=-1). But since the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the possible transitions are (v=1, J=1) or (v=1, J=-1), but J can't be negative. So (v=1, J=1). However, the energy of that state would be ħω + 2B. Since ħω is much larger than 2B, this energy is higher than the pure rotational transition (v=0, J=1). But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So between (v=0, J=1) with energy 2B and (v=1, J=0) with energy ħω, since 2B < ħω, the next lowest is (v=0, J=1). 

But wait, actually, the vibrational energy is (v + 1/2)ħω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. But the rotational energy for J=1 is 2B. So the total energy when going to (v=0, J=1) is (0 + 1/2)ħω + 2B. Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational energy. So the ground state is E_total = (1/2)ħω + 0 (since J=0). The next state would be either (v=0, J=1) with E_total = (1/2)ħω + 2B, or (v=1, J=0) with E_total = (3/2)ħω + 0. Comparing these two, the energy difference from the ground state would be 2B vs ħω. Since 2B < ħω, the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). Therefore, the transition to (v=0, J=1) requires energy 2B, and the transition to (v=1, J=0) requires energy ħω. Therefore, the next lowest energy state is (v=0, J=1), so the photon must have energy 2B.

Therefore, the momentum is as calculated. Therefore, the answer is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. 

But let me check if there's a possibility that the centrifugal distortion affects this. The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which includes centrifugal distortion. However, without the value of the centrifugal distortion constant D, we cannot compute its effect. Therefore, the problem likely expects us to use the rigid rotor model for this calculation, ignoring centrifugal distortion. Hence, the answer remains 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Another check: the vibrational energy quantum is ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J, rotational energy difference is 9.2e-23 J. So rotational is much smaller. Therefore, the next state is rotational. Hence, the momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Yes, I think this is solid.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule XY needs to absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given parameters are the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length R (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration w (4e14 rad/s). 

First, let me recall the models involved here. The problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. This model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels, right? So, the total energy would be the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. 

In the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state, the vibrational quantum number v is 0. The rotational quantum number J would also be 0 in the lowest state. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. The question asks for the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to determine whether the lowest energy transition is a rotational excitation, a vibrational excitation, or a combination.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels for a non-rigid rotor are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1) - D [J (J + 1)]^2, where B is the rotational constant and D is the centrifugal distortion constant. However, since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, maybe we need to consider the rotational energy with some correction? But maybe for the lowest states, the centrifugal distortion term D is negligible, so we can approximate it as a rigid rotor? Wait, but the problem says non-rigid rotor model, so perhaps we need to include the correction. Hmm, but maybe the answer expects just the rigid rotor plus vibrational energy? Let me check.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next lowest energy state could be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational excitation). Since vibrational transitions typically require much more energy than rotational transitions, the next lowest energy state might be the first rotational excited state. However, the energy spacing between rotational levels is much smaller than vibrational. So if the photon has to cause a transition to the next lowest energy state, it might be a rotational transition. But wait, maybe in the combined rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both?

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator model for vibrations, the energy levels are equally spaced. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. For rotation, the energy levels are spaced by 2B, 4B, 6B, etc., since E_rot = B J(J+1). So the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) would require energy 2B. So we need to compare ħω and 2B to see which is smaller. If 2B < ħω, then the next state would be rotational; otherwise, vibrational.

So let's compute both energy differences.

First, calculate ħω. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Next, calculate the rotational constant B. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μR², where μ is the reduced mass. 

First, compute the reduced mass μ. The masses

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I'm analyzing the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule XY must absorb to transition from its ground state to the next lowest energy state. The given parameters include: masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu respectively), bond length R (2 angstroms), and angular frequency of vibration w (4e14 rad/s).

I need to consider the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. This model incorporates both rotational and vibrational energy levels, with the total energy being the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

In the ground state, both the vibrational quantum number v and rotational quantum number J equal 0. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher vibrational state, rotational state, or both. I need to determine which transition requires the least energy.

For vibrations, energy levels follow E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. Rotational energy levels in a non-rigid rotor are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1) - D [J (J + 1)]^2, with B as the rotational constant and D as the centrifugal distortion constant. For lower states, the centrifugal distortion term might be negligible, allowing approximation as a rigid rotor. However, since the problem specifically mentions the non-rigid rotor model, I may need to include this correction term, although the simpler rigid rotor plus vibrational energy approach might be expected.

The next lowest energy state could be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational). Typically, vibrational transitions require more energy than rotational ones, suggesting the next lowest energy state might be a rotational excitation. However, I need to verify this by comparing energy differences.

In the harmonic oscillator model, vibrational energy levels are equally spaced, with the difference between v=0 and v=1 being ħω. For rotation, energy levels increase by 2B, 4B, 6B, etc., since E_rot = B J(J+1). The first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) requires energy 2B. To determine which transition has lower energy, I need to compare ħω and 2B.

Let me calculate both energy differences:

For ħω: The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and ω is 4e14 rad/s. Therefore, ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

For the rotational constant B: B equals ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μR², with μ being the reduced mass.

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule XY to transition from its ground state to the next lowest energy state. The provided parameters are the masses of atoms X and Y, which are 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively, the bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration ω is 4e14 rad/s.

Let's review the relevant models. We are dealing with the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model, which considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Thus, the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

In the fundamental (or ground) state, the vibrational quantum number v is 0. The rotational quantum number J is also 0 in this lowest state. When the molecule absorbs a photon, either the vibrational state, the rotational state, or both can change. The challenge is to ascertain whether the next lowest energy transition is primarily rotational, vibrational, or a combination of both.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and can be described by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels for a non-rigid rotor are E_rot = B J(J + 1) - D [J(J + 1)]², with B being the rotational constant and D the centrifugal distortion constant. Given that the problem specifies a non-rigid rotor model, we might need to account for rotational energy corrections. However, for lower states, the term involving D might be negligible, approximating it to a rigid rotor. Despite this, because the model specified is non-rigid, some correction should be included, but maybe the problem's answer expects the rigid rotor plus vibrational energy without the correction term.

Initially, at v=0, J=0, the succeeding lowest energy state could be v=1, J=0 (pure vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (pure rotational excitation). Generally, vibrational transitions need more energy compared to rotational transitions, making the first rotational excited state a likely candidate for the next lowest energy state. However, as rotational energy level spacings are considerably smaller than vibrational ones, a transition might indeed be rotational. But, perhaps in this combined rotational-vibrational model, levels are influenced by both aspects?

In the harmonic oscillator model, vibrational energy levels are evenly spaced, with a difference of ħω between v=0 and v=1. For rotation, the energy levels differ by 2B, 4B, 6B, as E_rot = B J(J + 1). Thus, the energy for the first rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. We should compare ħω with 2B to determine which gap is smaller. If 2B is less than ħω, the transition is likely rotational; otherwise, vibrational.

Let's calculate these energy differences.

First, find ħω, with ħ being the reduced Planck constant, about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Given ω is 4e14 rad/s, we get ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So convert the masses to kg:\n\nMx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg\n\nMy = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg\n\nReduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27)\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg\n\nNumerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg²\n\nSo μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again:\n\nWait, (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Then convert to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818*1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Yes, that\'s correct. So μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.\n\nThen, the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.\n\nMoment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nThen, rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46)\n\nCompute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²\n\nDenominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg·m²\n\nSo B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J\n\nThen, the energy difference for the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is E_rot = B*1*(1+1) - B*0*(0+1) = 2B = 9.20e-23 J\n\nCompare this to the vibrational energy difference ħω = 4.218e-20 J. So 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than ħω ≈ 4.22e-20 J. Therefore, the rotational energy spacing is much smaller than the vibrational. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental (v=0, J=0) would be the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon needs to provide energy equal to 2B.\n\nBut wait, the problem states "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the energy required is 2B. Then, the photon\'s energy must be equal to that. The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nBut wait, photons have momentum p = E/c. So if the energy required is 2B, then p = 2B / c.\n\nBut let me check if the transition is allowed. For a rotational transition, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So going from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. For vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. So if the molecule is in v=0, the next vibrational state is v=1. But since the energy difference is much larger, the lowest possible energy transition would be rotational.\n\nTherefore, the photon\'s momentum should be p = 2B / c.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let\'s compute 2B.\n\nWe found B ≈ 4.60e-23 J, so 2B ≈ 9.20e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again:\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) \n\nCalculating numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 J²s²? Wait, no, the units for ħ is J·s, so ħ² is J²·s². Then, divided by kg·m² (since I is in kg·m²), so B has units of (J²·s²)/(kg·m²) )? Wait, but J = kg·m²/s². So J·s² is kg·m². So ħ²/(2I) has units (kg²·m^4/s²)/(kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s², which is J. So B is in Joules. Correct.\n\nSo 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Then, p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe the energy of the photon is not just the rotational energy difference. Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot. So when the molecule is in the fundamental state, that\'s v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=0, J=1 (energy E_rot = 2B) or v=1, J=0 (energy E_vib = ħω). Since 2B << ħω, the next lowest energy state is v=0, J=1. Therefore, the energy required is 2B, so the photon must have energy 2B. Therefore, the momentum is p = 2B / c.\n\nBut let me confirm the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transitions (infrared) have Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions (microwave) have ΔJ = ±1. However, in reality, vibrational transitions are often accompanied by rotational transitions, but in the rigid rotor or non-rigid rotor model, can you have pure rotational transitions? Or are rotational transitions only allowed with vibrational transitions?\n\nWait, actually, in pure rotational spectroscopy (microwave), you have ΔJ = ±1, Δv = 0. So yes, pure rotational transitions are allowed. Similarly, in vibrational transitions (infrared), you have Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Wait, no, in vibrational transitions, you can have ΔJ = ±1 because the vibration can change the dipole moment which allows for the rotational transitions as well. But in pure rotational transitions, where Δv = 0, you can still have ΔJ = ±1. So depending on the type of spectroscopy.\n\nBut in this problem, since the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy is (v=0, J=1). So the photon must cause a pure rotational transition. Therefore, the energy required is 2B, so the photon\'s energy is 2B, and momentum is p = 2B / c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. But since the energy required for vibrational transition is much higher, and the question says "lowest possible energy", then it must be the rotational transition.\n\nSo proceeding with that, let\'s compute the value.\n\nFirst, let\'s recheck the reduced mass:\n\nMasses: 20 amu and 2 amu.\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg:\n\n1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nBond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.\n\nMoment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².\n\nRotational constant B = ħ²/(2I):\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nB = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J.\n\nTherefore, 2B = 9.20e-23 J.\n\nPhoton momentum p = E/c = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a mistake here. Wait, rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J(J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1*2) - B*(0) = 2B. Correct.\n\nBut wait, sometimes rotational constants are given in cm^-1, but here we need energy in Joules. So our calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me confirm the value of B. Let\'s compute it step by step:\n\nFirst, calculate ħ²:\n\n(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²·s²\n\nDivide by 2I = 2 * 1.208e-46 kg·m² = 2.416e-46 kg·m²\n\nSo B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.\n\nSo 2B = 9.20e-23 J. Then, photon momentum p = E/c = 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let\'s compute it exactly:\n\n9.20e-23 / 3e8 = (9.20 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s. So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in terms of ħ, or in some other units? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: "what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?" So the answer is the momentum p = E_photon / c, where E_photon is the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next lowest state.\n\nWait, but there\'s a catch here. The energy of the photon is related to its frequency via E = hν, and momentum p = hν/c = E/c. So yes, p = E/c.\n\nAlternatively, since photons have momentum p = ħk, where k is the wave number. But k = 2π/λ, and λ = c/ν, so p = ħ * 2π/(c/ν) ) = ħ * 2πν / c = hν/c, same as before.\n\nSo both approaches agree. So the momentum is indeed E/c.\n\nBut let me check if the energy difference is indeed 2B. Since the molecule is going from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is purely rotational, 2B. So the energy of the photon is 2B, so momentum is 2B / c.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if the question is in different units. The given data is in amu, angstroms, and rad/s. The answer is expected in kg·m/s, which is SI units. So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is the correct unit.\n\nBut let me check if the non-rigid rotor model affects this. The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which includes a centrifugal distortion term. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]². However, for the first rotational state (J=1), the centrifugal distortion term is D [1*2]^2 = 4D. But D is usually much smaller than B. Since the problem doesn\'t give a value for D, we can assume it\'s negligible. Therefore, the rigid rotor approximation holds for the lowest states, and the energy difference is approximately 2B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p = 2B / c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if there is any other consideration. For example, does the vibrational energy contribute? If the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), and the next state is v=1, but since the energy required is much higher, the lowest energy transition is rotational. So the momentum is as calculated.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me compute the exact value step by step to verify.\n\nGiven:\n\nMx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg\n\nMy = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg\n\nμ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = (1.103e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = 3.02e-27 kg\n\nR = 2e-10 m\n\nI = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J\n\n2B = 9.20e-23 J\n\np = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s\n\nSo rounding to two decimal places, 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut the problem may expect the answer in terms of ħ, ω, or other given parameters. Wait, but the given parameters include the angular frequency of vibration ω = 4e14 rad/s. However, since we\'re dealing with a rotational transition, ω is not directly used here. But maybe there\'s a connection?\n\nWait, no. The vibrational frequency is given, but if the transition is rotational, we don\'t need ω. Unless the question is actually about a vibrational transition. Wait, but the energy difference for vibrational is much larger. Let\'s check:\n\nThe vibrational energy difference is ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J. Which is much larger than 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires a photon with about 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires 4.218e-20 J. So the next lowest energy state is rotational.\n\nTherefore, the correct momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a possibility that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, where both v and J change. For example, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). The energy difference would be ħω + (B*1*(1+1) - B*0*(0+1)) = ħω + 2B. But this energy is much larger than the pure rotational transition, so it\'s not the lowest possible. Hence, the lowest energy transition is pure rotational.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the momentum of the photon required for the rotational transition, which is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check once more if all steps are correct. Starting from reduced mass, moment of inertia, rotational constant, energy difference, photon momentum. All steps seem consistent. Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe momentum of the absorbed photon should be \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg·m/s}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386785, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4450, prompt_tokens=944, total_tokens=5394, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule XY to transition from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

1. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Vibrational Energy**: The energy difference between vibrational levels (v=0 to v=1) is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \).
   - **Rotational Energy**: The energy difference between rotational levels (J=0 to J=1) is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant.

2. **Calculations**:
   - **Reduced Mass (\(\mu\))**:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
     \]
     Converting to kg:
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Moment of Inertia (I)**:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2
     \]
   - **Rotational Constant (B)**:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2}{2 \times 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2} \approx 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
     \]
   - **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of the photon is given by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.20 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}
     \]

Thus, the momentum of the absorbed photon should be \(\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

20 amu and 2 amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So convert the masses to kg:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27)

First, compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg²

So μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg

Wait, let me check that calculation again:

Wait, (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Then convert to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818*1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Yes, that's correct. So μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Then, the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

Then, rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46)

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg·m²

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J

Then, the energy difference for the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is E_rot = B*1*(1+1) - B*0*(0+1) = 2B = 9.20e-23 J

Compare this to the vibrational energy difference ħω = 4.218e-20 J. So 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than ħω ≈ 4.22e-20 J. Therefore, the rotational energy spacing is much smaller than the vibrational. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental (v=0, J=0) would be the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon needs to provide energy equal to 2B.

But wait, the problem states "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the energy required is 2B. Then, the photon's energy must be equal to that. The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

But wait, photons have momentum p = E/c. So if the energy required is 2B, then p = 2B / c.

But let me check if the transition is allowed. For a rotational transition, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So going from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. For vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. So if the molecule is in v=0, the next vibrational state is v=1. But since the energy difference is much larger, the lowest possible energy transition would be rotational.

Therefore, the photon's momentum should be p = 2B / c.

But wait, let me make sure. Let's compute 2B.

We found B ≈ 4.60e-23 J, so 2B ≈ 9.20e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check the calculation again:

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) 

Calculating numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 J²s²? Wait, no, the units for ħ is J·s, so ħ² is J²·s². Then, divided by kg·m² (since I is in kg·m²), so B has units of (J²·s²)/(kg·m²) )? Wait, but J = kg·m²/s². So J·s² is kg·m². So ħ²/(2I) has units (kg²·m^4/s²)/(kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s², which is J. So B is in Joules. Correct.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Then, p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe the energy of the photon is not just the rotational energy difference. Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot. So when the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=0, J=1 (energy E_rot = 2B) or v=1, J=0 (energy E_vib = ħω). Since 2B << ħω, the next lowest energy state is v=0, J=1. Therefore, the energy required is 2B, so the photon must have energy 2B. Therefore, the momentum is p = 2B / c.

But let me confirm the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transitions (infrared) have Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions (microwave) have ΔJ = ±1. However, in reality, vibrational transitions are often accompanied by rotational transitions, but in the rigid rotor or non-rigid rotor model, can you have pure rotational transitions? Or are rotational transitions only allowed with vibrational transitions?

Wait, actually, in pure rotational spectroscopy (microwave), you have ΔJ = ±1, Δv = 0. So yes, pure rotational transitions are allowed. Similarly, in vibrational transitions (infrared), you have Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Wait, no, in vibrational transitions, you can have ΔJ = ±1 because the vibration can change the dipole moment which allows for the rotational transitions as well. But in pure rotational transitions, where Δv = 0, you can still have ΔJ = ±1. So depending on the type of spectroscopy.

But in this problem, since the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy is (v=0, J=1). So the photon must cause a pure rotational transition. Therefore, the energy required is 2B, so the photon's energy is 2B, and momentum is p = 2B / c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. But since the energy required for vibrational transition is much higher, and the question says "lowest possible energy", then it must be the rotational transition.

So proceeding with that, let's compute the value.

First, let's recheck the reduced mass:

Masses: 20 amu and 2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg:

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J.

Therefore, 2B = 9.20e-23 J.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if there's a mistake here. Wait, rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J(J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1*2) - B*(0) = 2B. Correct.

But wait, sometimes rotational constants are given in cm^-1, but here we need energy in Joules. So our calculation seems correct.

But let me confirm the value of B. Let's compute it step by step:

First, calculate ħ²:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Divide by 2I = 2 * 1.208e-46 kg·m² = 2.416e-46 kg·m²

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.

So 2B = 9.20e-23 J. Then, photon momentum p = E/c = 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's compute it exactly:

9.20e-23 / 3e8 = (9.20 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s. So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem might expect the answer in terms of ħ, or in some other units? Let me check the question again.

The question says: "what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?" So the answer is the momentum p = E_photon / c, where E_photon is the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next lowest state.

Wait, but there's a catch here. The energy of the photon is related to its frequency via E = hν, and momentum p = hν/c = E/c. So yes, p = E/c.

Alternatively, since photons have momentum p = ħk, where k is the wave number. But k = 2π/λ, and λ = c/ν, so p = ħ * 2π/(c/ν) ) = ħ * 2πν / c = hν/c, same as before.

So both approaches agree. So the momentum is indeed E/c.

But let me check if the energy difference is indeed 2B. Since the molecule is going from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is purely rotational, 2B. So the energy of the photon is 2B, so momentum is 2B / c.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if the question is in different units. The given data is in amu, angstroms, and rad/s. The answer is expected in kg·m/s, which is SI units. So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is the correct unit.

But let me check if the non-rigid rotor model affects this. The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which includes a centrifugal distortion term. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]². However, for the first rotational state (J=1), the centrifugal distortion term is D [1*2]^2 = 4D. But D is usually much smaller than B. Since the problem doesn't give a value for D, we can assume it's negligible. Therefore, the rigid rotor approximation holds for the lowest states, and the energy difference is approximately 2B.

Therefore, the answer is p = 2B / c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if there is any other consideration. For example, does the vibrational energy contribute? If the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), and the next state is v=1, but since the energy required is much higher, the lowest energy transition is rotational. So the momentum is as calculated.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me compute the exact value step by step to verify.

Given:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = (1.103e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = 3.02e-27 kg

R = 2e-10 m

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J

2B = 9.20e-23 J

p = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s

So rounding to two decimal places, 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem may expect the answer in terms of ħ, ω, or other given parameters. Wait, but the given parameters include the angular frequency of vibration ω = 4e14 rad/s. However, since we're dealing with a rotational transition, ω is not directly used here. But maybe there's a connection?

Wait, no. The vibrational frequency is given, but if the transition is rotational, we don't need ω. Unless the question is actually about a vibrational transition. Wait, but the energy difference for vibrational is much larger. Let's check:

The vibrational energy difference is ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J. Which is much larger than 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires a photon with about 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires 4.218e-20 J. So the next lowest energy state is rotational.

Therefore, the correct momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if there's a possibility that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, where both v and J change. For example, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). The energy difference would be ħω + (B*1*(1+1) - B*0*(0+1)) = ħω + 2B. But this energy is much larger than the pure rotational transition, so it's not the lowest possible. Hence, the lowest energy transition is pure rotational.

Therefore, the answer is the momentum of the photon required for the rotational transition, which is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check once more if all steps are correct. Starting from reduced mass, moment of inertia, rotational constant, energy difference, photon momentum. All steps seem consistent. Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the absorbed photon should be \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}.

Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is likely the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon energy of 9.20e-23 J.\n\nBut wait, the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the smallest possible energy increase would be the rotational transition. Therefore, the photon\'s energy should correspond to 2B.\n\nBut the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Photon momentum p is related to its energy E by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. So, p = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the problem is actually about a transition to the next vibrational state or rotational. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the combined rotation-vibration transitions. But in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest energy state could be either vibrational (v=1, J=0) or rotational (v=0, J=1). Since rotational is lower energy, the answer would be the rotational transition.\n\nHowever, sometimes in molecular spectroscopy, transitions are subject to selection rules. For rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), then when it absorbs a photon, it can go to (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), depending on the photon\'s energy. However, in reality, vibrational transitions are often accompanied by rotational transitions, but if the problem is considering pure vibrational or pure rotational transitions, then the next lowest energy state would be (v=0, J=1), so the energy required is 2B. Hence, the photon\'s momentum is 2B / c.\n\nBut let me confirm. Let me calculate both possibilities:\n\n1. Rotational transition: ΔE = 2B ≈ 9.20e-23 J, momentum p = ΔE / c ≈ 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\n2. Vibrational transition: ΔE = ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J, momentum p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.\n\nThe rotational transition requires lower energy, so the photon momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut wait, the question says "to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the answer is the rotational transition. Therefore, the momentum is around 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if the non-rigid rotor model affects this. The non-rigid rotor model includes centrifugal distortion, which slightly lowers the energy compared to the rigid rotor. However, for the first rotational state (J=1), this correction is likely negligible. The rotational energy becomes E_rot = B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]^2. D is typically much smaller than B, so for J=1, E_rot ≈ B*2 - D*4. But since D is small, the difference from rigid rotor is minimal. Therefore, even with the non-rigid model, the energy required is approximately 2B. So the previous calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the photon\'s momentum should be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, reduced mass:\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nMoment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.\n\nRotational constant B = ħ²/(2I):\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nB = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.\n\nEnergy difference for J=0 to J=1: 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.\n\nPhoton momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps they expect considering both vibration and rotation? Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both v and J. However, in the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor approximations, these are independent. But in reality, there\'s a coupling called rovibrational coupling. However, in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would still be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that\'s the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the vibrational state as the fundamental state, but I think in the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. So, the next lowest energy state is J=1. So, the answer is the photon momentum corresponding to 2B.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2B/c, which is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. I need to present this in the boxed notation.\n\nConverting to scientific notation with two significant figures (since the given data has one or two significant figures?), the given data: Mx=20 amu (2 sig figs?), My=2 amu (1 sig fig?), R=2 angstroms (1 sig fig?), ω=4e14 rad/s (1 sig fig). So, maybe the answer should be given with one significant figure. But 3.07e-31 is approximately 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, let\'s check the exact calculation again.\n\nLet me compute B more precisely:\n\nħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²\n\nI = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nB = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.603e-23 J\n\nThen 2B = 9.206e-23 J\n\nPhoton momentum p = 9.206e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.069e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nGiven that the input values are:\n\nMx=20 amu (maybe 2 sig figs: 2.0e1 amu)\n\nMy=2 amu (1 sig fig)\n\nR=2 angstroms (1 sig fig)\n\nω=4e14 rad/s (1 sig fig)\n\nSo, the answer should have 1 significant figure, so 3e-31 kg·m/s. But maybe the problem expects two sig figs if Mx is 20 (two sig figs). Then, 3.1e-31. However, the original data is a mix. Let me check:\n\nMx=20 amu: if written as 20, it could be one or two sig figs. In scientific notation, 2e1 is one sig fig, 2.0e1 is two. Since it\'s written as 20, probably two sig figs.\n\nMy=2 amu: likely one sig fig.\n\nR=2 angstroms: one sig fig.\n\nω=4e14: one sig fig.\n\nSo, the least number of sig figs is one, so the answer should be rounded to one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, in the calculation, it\'s 3.07e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. But with one sig fig, it\'s 3e-31.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects more precision, maybe two sig figs. But given the input data, probably safest to go with one sig fig. However, let\'s check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nMx: 20 amu\n\nMy: 2 amu\n\nR: 2 angstroms\n\nw: 4*10^14 rad/s\n\nSo, Mx is 20 (two sig figs?), My is 2 (one sig fig), R is 2 (one sig fig), w is 4e14 (one sig fig). So, the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if in the calculation steps, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So:\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu. Converted to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nI = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.\n\nB = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.\n\n2B = 9.20e-23 J.\n\np = 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nYes, so with one sig fig, it\'s 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, if the problem expects two sig figs due to Mx=20, which could be considered two, then 3.1e-31. But given the other parameters, perhaps stick with one sig fig.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of the given variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference is not just rotational but also includes vibrational. Wait, no. If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), then the next state with the lowest possible energy is either vibrational or rotational. Since rotational is lower, the answer is rotational. Therefore, the energy is 2B, so momentum is 2B/c.\n\nBut in terms of the given variables, let\'s write expressions.\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(2μR²)\n\nThen, energy difference ΔE = 2B = ħ²/(μR²)\n\nPhoton momentum p = ΔE / c = ħ²/(μR² c)\n\nBut let\'s compute this expression with the given data.\n\nGiven:\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu\n\nBut to keep in terms of amu, perhaps convert everything into SI units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a way to express the momentum in terms of the given variables without plugging numbers. However, the problem asks for the numerical value, given Mx, My, R, and w.\n\nWait, but angular frequency w is given, but in the rotational energy calculation, we didn\'t use w. That seems odd. The problem includes the angular frequency of vibration, which is related to the vibrational energy levels. But the rotational energy doesn\'t depend on w. However, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, there is a connection between rotational and vibrational energies due to the centrifugal distortion. But in the previous calculation, we neglected D, the centrifugal distortion constant. If D is considered, then the rotational energy would be slightly less. But the problem states "non-rigid rotor model," so maybe we are supposed to consider the vibration-rotation coupling?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the next lowest state is a combination of vibrational and rotational, but that would require more energy than pure rotational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nIn the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]²\n\nAssuming small D, for the lowest transitions, the energy difference from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) would be:\n\nΔE = [0 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) - D(1)(2)^2] - [0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0) - D(0)] = 2B - 4D\n\nBut D is usually much smaller than B, so ΔE ≈ 2B.\n\nAlternatively, if transitioning to (v=1, J=0):\n\nΔE = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω\n\nSo, comparing 2B and ħω. From the given data, ω = 4e14 rad/s.\n\nCalculating ħω:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nω = 4e14 rad/s\n\nħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.2182872e-20 J\n\nEarlier calculation of 2B was 9.20e-23 J, which is much smaller than 4.218e-20 J. Therefore, rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon\'s energy is 2B, so momentum is 2B/c ≈ 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. But given the problem\'s data, which has ω given, but we didn\'t use ω in calculating the rotational transition. So, is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, no. The rotational energy levels are independent of the vibrational frequency in the rigid rotor approximation. However, in reality, the rotational constant B does depend on the bond length, which might be affected by vibration, but in the model, we consider the equilibrium bond length R. The given R is the equilibrium bond length, so B is calculated using that. The vibrational frequency ω is related to the stiffness of the bond, which is a separate parameter. Therefore, the two energy contributions are separate.\n\nTherefore, even though ω is given, for the rotational transition, we don\'t need it. The key parameters for rotation are μ and R, and for vibration, ω and μ. Therefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nHence, the momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. Rounding to one significant figure, 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, if the problem expects two sig figs (because Mx is 20), then 3.1e-31. But given that other quantities have one sig fig, maybe stick with one. However, looking back:\n\nMx=20 amu: ambiguous, but "20" can be considered two sig figs.\n\nMy=2 amu: one sig fig.\n\nR=2 angstroms: one sig fig.\n\nω=4e14 rad/s: one sig fig.\n\nSo, the answer should have one sig fig.

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule XY to transition from its ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant (B)**:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} \cdot \text{s})^2}{2 \times 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2} \approx 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
   \]

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (J=0 to J=1)**:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 2 \times 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.20 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
   \]

Given the problem's data and considering significant figures, the momentum of the absorbed photon is:

\[
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The masses are 20 amu and 2 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J.

Therefore, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B ≈ 9.20e-23 J.

Comparing to the vibrational energy difference of 4.218e-20 J, the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is likely the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon energy of 9.20e-23 J.

But wait, the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the smallest possible energy increase would be the rotational transition. Therefore, the photon's energy should correspond to 2B.

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Photon momentum p is related to its energy E by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. So, p = 9.20e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, I need to check if the problem is actually about a transition to the next vibrational state or rotational. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the combined rotation-vibration transitions. But in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest energy state could be either vibrational (v=1, J=0) or rotational (v=0, J=1). Since rotational is lower energy, the answer would be the rotational transition.

However, sometimes in molecular spectroscopy, transitions are subject to selection rules. For rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), then when it absorbs a photon, it can go to (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), depending on the photon's energy. However, in reality, vibrational transitions are often accompanied by rotational transitions, but if the problem is considering pure vibrational or pure rotational transitions, then the next lowest energy state would be (v=0, J=1), so the energy required is 2B. Hence, the photon's momentum is 2B / c.

But let me confirm. Let me calculate both possibilities:

1. Rotational transition: ΔE = 2B ≈ 9.20e-23 J, momentum p = ΔE / c ≈ 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

2. Vibrational transition: ΔE = ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J, momentum p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

The rotational transition requires lower energy, so the photon momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, the question says "to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the answer is the rotational transition. Therefore, the momentum is around 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if the non-rigid rotor model affects this. The non-rigid rotor model includes centrifugal distortion, which slightly lowers the energy compared to the rigid rotor. However, for the first rotational state (J=1), this correction is likely negligible. The rotational energy becomes E_rot = B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]^2. D is typically much smaller than B, so for J=1, E_rot ≈ B*2 - D*4. But since D is small, the difference from rigid rotor is minimal. Therefore, even with the non-rigid model, the energy required is approximately 2B. So the previous calculation holds.

Therefore, the photon's momentum should be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me verify the calculations step by step.

First, reduced mass:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.

Energy difference for J=0 to J=1: 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps they expect considering both vibration and rotation? Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both v and J. However, in the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor approximations, these are independent. But in reality, there's a coupling called rovibrational coupling. However, in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would still be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the vibrational state as the fundamental state, but I think in the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. So, the next lowest energy state is J=1. So, the answer is the photon momentum corresponding to 2B.

Therefore, the answer should be 2B/c, which is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. I need to present this in the boxed notation.

Converting to scientific notation with two significant figures (since the given data has one or two significant figures?), the given data: Mx=20 amu (2 sig figs?), My=2 amu (1 sig fig?), R=2 angstroms (1 sig fig?), ω=4e14 rad/s (1 sig fig). So, maybe the answer should be given with one significant figure. But 3.07e-31 is approximately 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, let's check the exact calculation again.

Let me compute B more precisely:

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

B = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.603e-23 J

Then 2B = 9.206e-23 J

Photon momentum p = 9.206e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.069e-31 kg·m/s.

Given that the input values are:

Mx=20 amu (maybe 2 sig figs: 2.0e1 amu)

My=2 amu (1 sig fig)

R=2 angstroms (1 sig fig)

ω=4e14 rad/s (1 sig fig)

So, the answer should have 1 significant figure, so 3e-31 kg·m/s. But maybe the problem expects two sig figs if Mx is 20 (two sig figs). Then, 3.1e-31. However, the original data is a mix. Let me check:

Mx=20 amu: if written as 20, it could be one or two sig figs. In scientific notation, 2e1 is one sig fig, 2.0e1 is two. Since it's written as 20, probably two sig figs.

My=2 amu: likely one sig fig.

R=2 angstroms: one sig fig.

ω=4e14: one sig fig.

So, the least number of sig figs is one, so the answer should be rounded to one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, in the calculation, it's 3.07e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. But with one sig fig, it's 3e-31.

Alternatively, if the problem expects more precision, maybe two sig figs. But given the input data, probably safest to go with one sig fig. However, let's check the original problem statement again.

The problem states:

Mx: 20 amu

My: 2 amu

R: 2 angstroms

w: 4*10^14 rad/s

So, Mx is 20 (two sig figs?), My is 2 (one sig fig), R is 2 (one sig fig), w is 4e14 (one sig fig). So, the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if in the calculation steps, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu. Converted to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.60e-23 J. Correct.

2B = 9.20e-23 J.

p = 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Yes, so with one sig fig, it's 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, if the problem expects two sig figs due to Mx=20, which could be considered two, then 3.1e-31. But given the other parameters, perhaps stick with one sig fig.

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of the given variables. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference is not just rotational but also includes vibrational. Wait, no. If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), then the next state with the lowest possible energy is either vibrational or rotational. Since rotational is lower, the answer is rotational. Therefore, the energy is 2B, so momentum is 2B/c.

But in terms of the given variables, let's write expressions.

B = ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(2μR²)

Then, energy difference ΔE = 2B = ħ²/(μR²)

Photon momentum p = ΔE / c = ħ²/(μR² c)

But let's compute this expression with the given data.

Given:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu

But to keep in terms of amu, perhaps convert everything into SI units.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the momentum in terms of the given variables without plugging numbers. However, the problem asks for the numerical value, given Mx, My, R, and w.

Wait, but angular frequency w is given, but in the rotational energy calculation, we didn't use w. That seems odd. The problem includes the angular frequency of vibration, which is related to the vibrational energy levels. But the rotational energy doesn't depend on w. However, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, there is a connection between rotational and vibrational energies due to the centrifugal distortion. But in the previous calculation, we neglected D, the centrifugal distortion constant. If D is considered, then the rotational energy would be slightly less. But the problem states "non-rigid rotor model," so maybe we are supposed to consider the vibration-rotation coupling?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the next lowest state is a combination of vibrational and rotational, but that would require more energy than pure rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach. Let me think again.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1) - D [J(J+1)]²

Assuming small D, for the lowest transitions, the energy difference from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) would be:

ΔE = [0 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) - D(1)(2)^2] - [0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0) - D(0)] = 2B - 4D

But D is usually much smaller than B, so ΔE ≈ 2B.

Alternatively, if transitioning to (v=1, J=0):

ΔE = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω

So, comparing 2B and ħω. From the given data, ω = 4e14 rad/s.

Calculating ħω:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ω = 4e14 rad/s

ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.2182872e-20 J

Earlier calculation of 2B was 9.20e-23 J, which is much smaller than 4.218e-20 J. Therefore, rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon's energy is 2B, so momentum is 2B/c ≈ 9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. But given the problem's data, which has ω given, but we didn't use ω in calculating the rotational transition. So, is there a mistake here?

Wait, no. The rotational energy levels are independent of the vibrational frequency in the rigid rotor approximation. However, in reality, the rotational constant B does depend on the bond length, which might be affected by vibration, but in the model, we consider the equilibrium bond length R. The given R is the equilibrium bond length, so B is calculated using that. The vibrational frequency ω is related to the stiffness of the bond, which is a separate parameter. Therefore, the two energy contributions are separate.

Therefore, even though ω is given, for the rotational transition, we don't need it. The key parameters for rotation are μ and R, and for vibration, ω and μ. Therefore, the calculation seems correct.

Hence, the momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. Rounding to one significant figure, 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, if the problem expects two sig figs (because Mx is 20), then 3.1e-31. But given that other quantities have one sig fig, maybe stick with one. However, looking back:

Mx=20 amu: ambiguous, but "20" can be considered two sig figs.

My=2 amu: one sig fig.

R=2 angstroms: one sig fig.

ω=4e14 rad/s: one sig fig.

So, the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s. But in the calculation, it's 3.07e-31, which is closer to 3.1e-31. Hmm. Maybe the problem allows two sig figs. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected in terms of ħω/c or another expression. Let me check.

Wait, if the energy is 2B, and B = ħ²/(2I), then 2B = ħ²/I. So, the energy is ħ²/(I), and momentum p = ħ²/(I c). But I = μ R². So, p = ħ²/(μ R² c). Let's compute this expression.

Given:

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg

R = 2e-10 m

So, μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

Then, ħ²/(μ R² c) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46 * 3e8) ≈ 1.112e-68 / 3.624e-38 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So, this matches the earlier result.

Therefore, the momentum is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Given the problem's data, this is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. If allowed two sig figs, write 3.1e-31. If one, 3e-31. Given the input data's ambiguity, but since Mx=20 amu could be two sig figs, and the answer is 3.1, which is two sig figs, maybe present it as 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, check if units need to be converted. Wait, the problem asks for the momentum in what units? It doesn't specify, so kg·m/s is standard.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected in terms of ħk, where k is the wave number. But photon momentum is p = ħk, and k = 2π/λ. But energy E = ħω = pc, so p = ħω/c. Wait, but that's for vibrational transition. For rotational transition, E = 2B = ħ²/(I), so p = E/c = ħ²/(I c). Which is different from the vibrational case.

Therefore, since the rotational transition is lower energy, the correct momentum is ħ²/(I c) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the momentum is approximately 3.1 x 10^-31 kg·m/s. Given the problem's data, I think this is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the absorbed photon should be \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}.

Thus, I = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².\n\nThen, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.\n\nTherefore, 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Compare with ħω = 4.218e-20 J. So, 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J is much less than ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J. Therefore, the energy difference for a rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is much smaller than the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1). Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is the rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the absorbed photon should have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. However, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Photon momentum p is related to its energy by E = pc, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, p = E / c.\n\nSo, p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Because in reality, rotational transitions typically involve microwave photons, while vibrational transitions involve infrared. But since the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), and we need to transition to the next lowest energy state, which would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the energy needed is 2B, and the photon momentum would be 2B / c. However, let\'s check if that\'s the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. Wait, but the energy difference for vibrational is larger. So the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational state. Therefore, the photon momentum is 2B / c. However, let me check if my calculation of B is correct.\n\nWait, B is ħ²/(2I). Let\'s recompute B.\n\nGiven:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nI = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nSo, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) = 4.6e-23 J. Correct.\n\nThus, 2B = 9.2e-23 J.\n\nBut, converting this to photon momentum:\n\np = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the angular frequency or other parameters. Wait, but let\'s check if there\'s a possibility that the transition is a combination of rotational and vibrational. For example, if the molecule can transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). But the energy difference for that would be ħω + 2B(1)(1+1) - 2B(0)(0+1) = ħω + 2B*2 - 0 = ħω + 4B. Since ħω is much larger than 4B (4.2e-20 vs 1.84e-22 J), this is a much larger energy. So the next lowest is indeed rotational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). So that requires the energy 2B. So the photon\'s energy is 2B, and momentum p = 2B / c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. But since vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which is much larger, but if the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy", the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.\n\nBut let\'s confirm. The energy levels for vibration and rotation are given by E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1). The ground state is (0, 0): E = (0 + 1/2)ħω + 0 = 0.5 ħω. The next possible states would be:\n\n1. (v=0, J=1): E = 0.5 ħω + B(1)(2) = 0.5 ħω + 2B\n2. (v=1, J=0): E = 1.5 ħω + 0 = 1.5 ħω\n3. (v=1, J=1): E = 1.5 ħω + 2B\n\nSo, the difference between (0,0) and (0,1) is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.\n\nThe difference between (0,0) and (1,0) is ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J. Since 9.2e-23 << 4.2e-20, the next lowest energy state is (0,1). Therefore, the photon must have energy 2B. Therefore, the momentum is p = E/c = 2B / c.\n\nBut let\'s check the calculation again. The reduced mass:\n\nMx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.\n\nμ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) * amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Then converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg, which matches previous calculation. Then I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.\n\nConvert that to photon momentum:\n\np = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of wavenumbers or another unit? But the question specifically asks for momentum in kg·m/s. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the angular frequency given (4e14 rad/s) but that\'s for vibration. However, the rotational transition\'s energy is 2B, which is different from the vibrational frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in my calculation. Let\'s check the value of B in terms of energy. Let\'s compute B in cm^-1, a common unit for rotational constants. The conversion from Joules to cm^-1 is 1 J = 5.034e22 cm^-1. Therefore, B = 4.6e-23 J * 5.034e22 cm^-1/J ≈ 2.316 cm^-1. Then 2B ≈ 4.63 cm^-1. The corresponding energy for a rotational transition is small, which is in the microwave region, as expected. The vibrational energy is ħω = 4.218e-20 J, which converted to cm^-1 is 4.218e-20 J * 5.034e22 cm^-1/J ≈ 2124 cm^-1, which is infrared. So, the rotational transition is indeed lower energy.\n\nTherefore, the photon\'s momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if there\'s another approach. The photon\'s momentum can also be related to its wavelength. Since p = h / λ, and E = hc / λ. Therefore, p = E / c. So that\'s consistent. Hence, the answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let\'s check the exact calculation:\n\nE = 2B = 9.2e-23 J\n\np = E / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066...e-31 kg·m/s. So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut maybe we need to use more precise values. For example, c is exactly 299792458 m/s, but 3e8 is a sufficient approximation here. Similarly, the exact value of ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, but the difference is negligible here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the vibrational angular frequency. But since the transition is rotational, it\'s unrelated to ω. Therefore, the correct answer should be p = 2B / c. So, let\'s compute it precisely.\n\nB = ħ² / (2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) = 4.602e-23 J.\n\n2B = 9.204e-23 J.\n\np = 9.204e-23 / 2.99792458e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nTherefore, the momentum is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So, the answer should be this value. Let me check the units again: 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so E in J divided by c in m/s gives kg·m/s, which is correct for momentum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.07 x 10^-31 kg·m/s. However, the problem may expect an exact expression in terms of the given variables. Let me check if the answer can be expressed symbolically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a combination of rotational and vibrational transitions. Wait, but the next lowest energy state would be (v=0, J=1), as previously determined. Therefore, the required energy is 2B. Therefore, the photon\'s momentum is p = 2B / c. So, unless there\'s a mistake in the understanding of the question.\n\nAnother possible interpretation: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy" might refer to the next vibrational state. But given that rotational states are lower in energy, the next state would be rotational. However, if the question is considering the combined rotation-vibration states, perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=0). But that would require more energy. So, the answer is definitely rotational.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculation once more:\n\nE_photon = 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I. Wait, no, 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I. So, E_photon = ħ²/I. Then p = ħ²/(I c). Let\'s compute that:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nI = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\np = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46 * 3e8) = (1.112e-68) / (3.624e-38) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the angular frequency ω in some way. But since the transition is rotational, ω here is the vibrational frequency, which is separate. Therefore, the answer is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. However, given the problem provides ω, maybe there\'s a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B is actually dependent on the vibrational state. However, in the rigid rotor approximation, B is considered constant. But in the non-rigid model, B might decrease with higher vibrational states because the bond length increases. However, the problem states the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next lowest energy state is (v=0, J=1). Since we are not changing the vibrational state, the dependence of B on v might not be significant here. Therefore, even in the non-rigid rotor model, the first rotational excited state would still be the next lowest energy state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition that includes both a rotational and vibrational change, but since the energy required for vibrational is much higher, the next state would be rotational. Therefore, I think the answer is indeed p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let\'s check if the problem is perhaps in different units. The given parameters are in amu and angstroms. Let\'s confirm the unit conversions.\n\nMasses:\n\n20 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.321e-26 kg\n\n2 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.321e-27 kg\n\nReduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nBond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.\n\nMoment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.\n\nRotational constant B = ħ²/(2I) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Correct.\n\nPhoton momentum p = 2B/c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, rounded to two significant figures. However, the given data has:\n\nMx = 20 amu (two significant figures)\n\nMy = 2 amu (one significant figure)\n\nR = 2 angstroms (one significant figure)\n\nω = 4e14 rad/s (one significant figure)\n\nWait, the angular frequency is given as 4*10^14 rad/s, which is one significant figure. But in the calculation of B and p, we used two significant figures for Mx (20) and one for My (2). So, the least number of significant figures in the given data is one (My, R, ω). Therefore, the answer should be given to one significant figure. However, in the calculation of μ, Mx is 20 (two sig figs), My is 2 (one sig fig). When multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement. So, for μ, (20 * 2)/(22): 20 is two sig figs, 2 is one sig fig. The multiplication would result in one sig fig. However, in reality, when adding Mx + My (20 + 2 = 22), the sum would have two sig figs (since 20 is two, 2 is one; the sum is 22, which is two). Then, μ = (20*2)/(22) amu. 20*2 is 40 (one sig fig because 2 has one), divided by 22 (two sig figs). So, 40 (1 sig fig) / 22 (2 sig figs) = 1.8 (two sig figs). But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, since the given data has My as 2 amu (one sig fig), R as 2 angstroms (one sig fig), and ω as 4e14 (one sig fig), the answer should be given to one significant figure. Therefore, the momentum p ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut in the calculation, we obtained 3.07e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we follow strict sig figs, it would be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But given that the problem gives Mx as 20 amu (two sig figs), maybe they expect two sig figs. However, since some data are one sig fig, it\'s safer to go with one. But the problem might be designed to accept two sig figs.\n\nAlternatively, check if the answer is supposed to be in terms of the given variables. For example, the answer could be expressed as p = ħ/(cR²μ). Wait, let\'s see:\n\nE_photon = 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I = ħ²/(μR²). So, p = E/c = ħ²/(μ R² c).\n\nBut is this a standard expression? Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a way to relate momentum directly.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation for rotational energy. But given the time I\'ve spent, I think the numerical answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, and with the given data\'s precision, likely 3e-31 kg·m/s. But since the original calculation gives 3.07e-31, and if the problem allows two sig figs, then 3.1e-31. Let\'s check the steps where sig figs were lost:\n\n- Mx = 20 amu (two sig figs)\n- My = 2 amu (one sig fig)\n- R = 2 angstroms (one sig fig)\n- ω = 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)\n\nCalculating μ:\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Here, 20*2 is 40 (one sig fig), divided by 22 (two sig figs). So, 40 / 22 = 1.8 (two sig figs). Then converting to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. This is two sig figs (from 1.8 amu). Then R is 2e-10 m (one sig fig). Then I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Here, μ has two sig figs, R has one: so I has one sig fig. Then B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is a known constant, precise. So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46). The numerator is 1.112e-68 (exact value), denominator is 2.416e-46 (one sig fig due to I). So, B ≈ 4.6e-23 J (two sig figs here, but denominator is one sig fig, so B is one sig fig: 5e-23 J). Then 2B = 1e-22 J. Then p = E/c = 1e-22 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s (one sig fig). So, if following significant figures strictly, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation, ignoring sig figs. Given that in academic settings sometimes the sig figs are not strictly enforced if the problem provides data with varying sig figs but expects an exact calculation. Alternatively, the answer is 3.1e-31, but given the options, perhaps the exact answer is \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg·m/s}}.\n\nBut let me check once again:\n\nIf we use exact values:\n\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.8181818... amu = 1.8181818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 3.020876e-27 kg.\n\nR = 2.0 angstroms = 2.0e-10 m.\n\nI = μR² = 3.020876e-27 kg * (2.0e-10 m)^2 = 3.020876e-27 * 4.0e-20 = 1.20835e-46 kg·m².\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.20835e-46) ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.4167e-46 ≈ 4.602e-23 J.\n\n2B = 9.204e-23 J.\n\np = 9.204e-23 J / 2.99792458e8 m/s ≈ 3.070e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nTherefore, the precise answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1e-31 with two significant figures, considering that some given values (Mx=20) have two sig figs. However, since other values like My, R, and ω have one sig fig, the answer should strictly have one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s. But in many textbooks and problem sets, sometimes leading zeros in decimal places aren\'t counted, so maybe two sig figs are acceptable here. Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in terms of the variables provided without considering sig figs.\n\nGiven that, and the calculation leading to approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, I will present the answer as \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg·m/s}} with two significant figures, acknowledging that depending on the problem\'s requirements, it might be rounded to one sig fig. However, since Mx is given as 20 (two sig figs), and the calculation of μ retains two sig figs (from Mx), I think two sig figs are appropriate here.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg·m/s}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387205, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5985, prompt_tokens=870, total_tokens=6855, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule XY to transition from its ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

1. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:
   - The energy difference between vibrational levels (v=0 to v=1) is given by \( \hbar \omega \).
   - \( \hbar \omega = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \).

2. **Rotational Energy Difference**:
   - The energy difference between rotational levels (J=0 to J=1) is given by \( 2B \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant.
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kg:
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     2B = 2 \times 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The energy of the photon required is \( 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - The momentum \( p \) of the photon is given by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

Considering significant figures, the final answer is rounded to two significant figures:

\[
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}
\]

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. Convert amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.660539e-27 kg. So, Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg, My = 2 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg. Then, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = Let's compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg. Then μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / 3.6531e-26. Let's compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx. 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg². Divide by 3.6531e-26 kg: μ ≈ 1.103e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Now, compute I = μR². R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So, R² = 4e-20 m². Thus, I = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Therefore, 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Compare with ħω = 4.218e-20 J. So, 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J is much less than ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J. Therefore, the energy difference for a rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is much smaller than the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1). Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is the rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the absorbed photon should have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. However, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Photon momentum p is related to its energy by E = pc, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, p = E / c.

So, p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, is this correct? Because in reality, rotational transitions typically involve microwave photons, while vibrational transitions involve infrared. But since the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), and we need to transition to the next lowest energy state, which would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the energy needed is 2B, and the photon momentum would be 2B / c. However, let's check if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. Wait, but the energy difference for vibrational is larger. So the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational state. Therefore, the photon momentum is 2B / c. However, let me check if my calculation of B is correct.

Wait, B is ħ²/(2I). Let's recompute B.

Given:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

So, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) = 4.6e-23 J. Correct.

Thus, 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But, converting this to photon momentum:

p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the angular frequency or other parameters. Wait, but let's check if there's a possibility that the transition is a combination of rotational and vibrational. For example, if the molecule can transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). But the energy difference for that would be ħω + 2B(1)(1+1) - 2B(0)(0+1) = ħω + 2B*2 - 0 = ħω + 4B. Since ħω is much larger than 4B (4.2e-20 vs 1.84e-22 J), this is a much larger energy. So the next lowest is indeed rotational.

Alternatively, maybe the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). So that requires the energy 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B, and momentum p = 2B / c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a vibrational transition. But since vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which is much larger, but if the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy", the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.

But let's confirm. The energy levels for vibration and rotation are given by E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1). The ground state is (0, 0): E = (0 + 1/2)ħω + 0 = 0.5 ħω. The next possible states would be:

1. (v=0, J=1): E = 0.5 ħω + B(1)(2) = 0.5 ħω + 2B
2. (v=1, J=0): E = 1.5 ħω + 0 = 1.5 ħω
3. (v=1, J=1): E = 1.5 ħω + 2B

So, the difference between (0,0) and (0,1) is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

The difference between (0,0) and (1,0) is ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J. Since 9.2e-23 << 4.2e-20, the next lowest energy state is (0,1). Therefore, the photon must have energy 2B. Therefore, the momentum is p = E/c = 2B / c.

But let's check the calculation again. The reduced mass:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) * amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Then converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg, which matches previous calculation. Then I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Convert that to photon momentum:

p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of wavenumbers or another unit? But the question specifically asks for momentum in kg·m/s. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the angular frequency given (4e14 rad/s) but that's for vibration. However, the rotational transition's energy is 2B, which is different from the vibrational frequency.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let's check the value of B in terms of energy. Let's compute B in cm^-1, a common unit for rotational constants. The conversion from Joules to cm^-1 is 1 J = 5.034e22 cm^-1. Therefore, B = 4.6e-23 J * 5.034e22 cm^-1/J ≈ 2.316 cm^-1. Then 2B ≈ 4.63 cm^-1. The corresponding energy for a rotational transition is small, which is in the microwave region, as expected. The vibrational energy is ħω = 4.218e-20 J, which converted to cm^-1 is 4.218e-20 J * 5.034e22 cm^-1/J ≈ 2124 cm^-1, which is infrared. So, the rotational transition is indeed lower energy.

Therefore, the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if there's another approach. The photon's momentum can also be related to its wavelength. Since p = h / λ, and E = hc / λ. Therefore, p = E / c. So that's consistent. Hence, the answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's check the exact calculation:

E = 2B = 9.2e-23 J

p = E / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066...e-31 kg·m/s. So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But maybe we need to use more precise values. For example, c is exactly 299792458 m/s, but 3e8 is a sufficient approximation here. Similarly, the exact value of ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, but the difference is negligible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the vibrational angular frequency. But since the transition is rotational, it's unrelated to ω. Therefore, the correct answer should be p = 2B / c. So, let's compute it precisely.

B = ħ² / (2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) = 4.602e-23 J.

2B = 9.204e-23 J.

p = 9.204e-23 / 2.99792458e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, the momentum is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So, the answer should be this value. Let me check the units again: 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so E in J divided by c in m/s gives kg·m/s, which is correct for momentum.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.07 x 10^-31 kg·m/s. However, the problem may expect an exact expression in terms of the given variables. Let me check if the answer can be expressed symbolically.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a combination of rotational and vibrational transitions. Wait, but the next lowest energy state would be (v=0, J=1), as previously determined. Therefore, the required energy is 2B. Therefore, the photon's momentum is p = 2B / c. So, unless there's a mistake in the understanding of the question.

Another possible interpretation: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy" might refer to the next vibrational state. But given that rotational states are lower in energy, the next state would be rotational. However, if the question is considering the combined rotation-vibration states, perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=0). But that would require more energy. So, the answer is definitely rotational.

Therefore, the answer is p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculation once more:

E_photon = 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I. Wait, no, 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I. So, E_photon = ħ²/I. Then p = ħ²/(I c). Let's compute that:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

c = 3e8 m/s

p = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46 * 3e8) = (1.112e-68) / (3.624e-38) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Yes, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the angular frequency ω in some way. But since the transition is rotational, ω here is the vibrational frequency, which is separate. Therefore, the answer is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. However, given the problem provides ω, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B is actually dependent on the vibrational state. However, in the rigid rotor approximation, B is considered constant. But in the non-rigid model, B might decrease with higher vibrational states because the bond length increases. However, the problem states the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next lowest energy state is (v=0, J=1). Since we are not changing the vibrational state, the dependence of B on v might not be significant here. Therefore, even in the non-rigid rotor model, the first rotational excited state would still be the next lowest energy state.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition that includes both a rotational and vibrational change, but since the energy required for vibrational is much higher, the next state would be rotational. Therefore, I think the answer is indeed p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's check if the problem is perhaps in different units. The given parameters are in amu and angstroms. Let's confirm the unit conversions.

Masses:

20 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.321e-26 kg

2 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.321e-27 kg

Reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Moment of inertia I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Correct.

Photon momentum p = 2B/c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, rounded to two significant figures. However, the given data has:

Mx = 20 amu (two significant figures)

My = 2 amu (one significant figure)

R = 2 angstroms (one significant figure)

ω = 4e14 rad/s (one significant figure)

Wait, the angular frequency is given as 4*10^14 rad/s, which is one significant figure. But in the calculation of B and p, we used two significant figures for Mx (20) and one for My (2). So, the least number of significant figures in the given data is one (My, R, ω). Therefore, the answer should be given to one significant figure. However, in the calculation of μ, Mx is 20 (two sig figs), My is 2 (one sig fig). When multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement. So, for μ, (20 * 2)/(22): 20 is two sig figs, 2 is one sig fig. The multiplication would result in one sig fig. However, in reality, when adding Mx + My (20 + 2 = 22), the sum would have two sig figs (since 20 is two, 2 is one; the sum is 22, which is two). Then, μ = (20*2)/(22) amu. 20*2 is 40 (one sig fig because 2 has one), divided by 22 (two sig figs). So, 40 (1 sig fig) / 22 (2 sig figs) = 1.8 (two sig figs). But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, since the given data has My as 2 amu (one sig fig), R as 2 angstroms (one sig fig), and ω as 4e14 (one sig fig), the answer should be given to one significant figure. Therefore, the momentum p ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But in the calculation, we obtained 3.07e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we follow strict sig figs, it would be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But given that the problem gives Mx as 20 amu (two sig figs), maybe they expect two sig figs. However, since some data are one sig fig, it's safer to go with one. But the problem might be designed to accept two sig figs.

Alternatively, check if the answer is supposed to be in terms of the given variables. For example, the answer could be expressed as p = ħ/(cR²μ). Wait, let's see:

E_photon = 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I = ħ²/(μR²). So, p = E/c = ħ²/(μ R² c).

But is this a standard expression? Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate momentum directly.

Alternatively, use the relation for rotational energy. But given the time I've spent, I think the numerical answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, and with the given data's precision, likely 3e-31 kg·m/s. But since the original calculation gives 3.07e-31, and if the problem allows two sig figs, then 3.1e-31. Let's check the steps where sig figs were lost:

- Mx = 20 amu (two sig figs)
- My = 2 amu (one sig fig)
- R = 2 angstroms (one sig fig)
- ω = 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)

Calculating μ:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Here, 20*2 is 40 (one sig fig), divided by 22 (two sig figs). So, 40 / 22 = 1.8 (two sig figs). Then converting to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. This is two sig figs (from 1.8 amu). Then R is 2e-10 m (one sig fig). Then I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Here, μ has two sig figs, R has one: so I has one sig fig. Then B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is a known constant, precise. So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46). The numerator is 1.112e-68 (exact value), denominator is 2.416e-46 (one sig fig due to I). So, B ≈ 4.6e-23 J (two sig figs here, but denominator is one sig fig, so B is one sig fig: 5e-23 J). Then 2B = 1e-22 J. Then p = E/c = 1e-22 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s (one sig fig). So, if following significant figures strictly, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation, ignoring sig figs. Given that in academic settings sometimes the sig figs are not strictly enforced if the problem provides data with varying sig figs but expects an exact calculation. Alternatively, the answer is 3.1e-31, but given the options, perhaps the exact answer is \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}.

But let me check once again:

If we use exact values:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.8181818... amu = 1.8181818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 3.020876e-27 kg.

R = 2.0 angstroms = 2.0e-10 m.

I = μR² = 3.020876e-27 kg * (2.0e-10 m)^2 = 3.020876e-27 * 4.0e-20 = 1.20835e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.20835e-46) ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.4167e-46 ≈ 4.602e-23 J.

2B = 9.204e-23 J.

p = 9.204e-23 J / 2.99792458e8 m/s ≈ 3.070e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, the precise answer is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1e-31 with two significant figures, considering that some given values (Mx=20) have two sig figs. However, since other values like My, R, and ω have one sig fig, the answer should strictly have one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s. But in many textbooks and problem sets, sometimes leading zeros in decimal places aren't counted, so maybe two sig figs are acceptable here. Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in terms of the variables provided without considering sig figs.

Given that, and the calculation leading to approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, I will present the answer as \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}} with two significant figures, acknowledging that depending on the problem's requirements, it might be rounded to one sig fig. However, since Mx is given as 20 (two sig figs), and the calculation of μ retains two sig figs (from Mx), I think two sig figs are appropriate here.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}
