# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric transmission cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs light below approximately 3000 Angstroms (UV range), so the observed wavelength must be redshifted into the optical range (3000 Angstroms or longer).

The observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is related to the rest wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{rest}}\) by the redshift \(z\):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \times (1 + z)
\]

Setting \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) to the minimum detectable wavelength (3000 Angstroms):

\[
3000 \, \text{Angstroms} = 1216 \, \text{Angstroms} \times (1 + z)
\]

Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 + z = \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467
\]

\[
z \approx 2.467 - 1 = 1.467
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(\boxed{1.47}\).

Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, such that we can detect them with ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about redshifts and the Lyman alpha line.

First, the Lyman alpha line is a specific spectral line of hydrogen, right? It's when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. The rest wavelength for this transition is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV light because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of it. So, for us to detect this absorption with optical telescopes, the light must be redshifted into the visible spectrum.

So, the key here is that the observed wavelength after redshift needs to be in the optical range. Let me remember that optical wavelengths are roughly from about 3000 Angstroms (UV edge) to 7000 Angstroms (near-infrared). Wait, actually, the human eye can see from about 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red), but optical telescopes can sometimes detect a bit beyond that. However, the atmosphere also plays a role. I think the atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations is around 3000 Angstroms (UV) to maybe 11000 Angstroms (near-infrared), but the exact limits can vary. But since the original wavelength is in the UV (1216 Angstroms), we need to redshift it into the optical window.

But wait, the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes." So maybe we should consider the typical optical range as about 3000-7000 Angstroms. However, the atmosphere doesn't transmit UV light below ~3000 Angstroms, so the Lyman alpha line needs to be redshifted into the range that the atmosphere allows through. So, the observed wavelength needs to be at least 3000 Angstroms? Wait, but actually, the atmospheric cutoff is more like ~3100 Angstroms (the ozone layer absorbs below that), so maybe the lower limit of the optical window is around 3000-3100 Angstroms. Therefore, the Lyman alpha line needs to be redshifted to at least 3100 Angstroms to be observed from the ground.

But let me confirm. Let's recall that the Lyman alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars caused by intervening hydrogen clouds. These are observed in the optical when the quasar is at high enough redshift. So, the idea is that the quasar's light is redshifted so much that the Lyman alpha absorption, which is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's rest frame, is shifted into the optical when it reaches us. Wait, but actually, the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, and the intervening clouds have lower redshifts. Wait, maybe I need to think carefully.

Wait, no. The quasar is the background source. The neutral hydrogen clouds are between us and the quasar. So the absorption occurs at the redshift of the cloud. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is 1216 Angstroms multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the cloud. So to observe this in the optical, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So, we need 1216 * (1 + z) ≥ λ_min_optical.

Assuming the optical range starts at, say, 3600 Angstroms (since 3000 might still be UV and not transmitted). Wait, I think the commonly accepted optical range is approximately 3800-7500 Angstroms (violet to red). But different sources might have different definitions. Let me check in my mind. The atmosphere transmits from about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to 1 micron (10,000 Angstroms), but the optical window is usually considered as 300-700 nm (3000-7000 Angstroms). However, the human eye sees 400-700 nm, but telescopes with CCDs can detect a bit wider. But the key point is that to observe from the ground, the light must not be absorbed by the atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque below ~300 nm (3000 Angstroms) due to ozone. So, the shortest wavelength we can observe from the ground is about 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must be at least 3000 Angstroms.

Therefore, solving 1216 * (1 + z) ≥ 3000. Then, (1 + z) ≥ 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467. Therefore, z ≥ 1.467. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47. But let me check the math. 3000 divided by 1216: 1216*2=2432, 3000-2432=568. 568/1216≈0.467. So yes, 2.467, so z≈1.467. So the lower limit is about z=1.47. Therefore, any cloud with redshift higher than this would have their Lyman alpha absorption shifted into the optical range. But wait, is the upper limit of the optical range important here? For the lower limit on redshift, we just need the wavelength to be shifted into the optical, so the minimum redshift is when it's at the lower edge of the optical window. So yes, 3000 Angstroms.

But wait, some sources define the optical range starting at 3200 Angstroms or 3600 Angstroms. For example, if we take 4000 Angstroms as the start of the optical (violet), then 1216*(1 + z) ≥ 4000, so (1 + z) ≈ 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29, so z≈2.29. But that would be if we consider the human-visible range. However, CCDs in telescopes can detect light down to about 3000 Angstroms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the atmospheric transmission cutoff. Since the atmosphere doesn't transmit below ~3000 Angstroms, the minimum observed wavelength we can detect is ~3000 Angstroms. Therefore, using 3000 Angstroms as the lower limit.

But let me confirm. The atmospheric cutoff is often cited as ~300 nm (3000 Angstroms) due to ozone. So, light with wavelengths shorter than 300 nm is absorbed. Therefore, to observe the Lyman alpha line from the ground, it must be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms. Hence, the redshift z must satisfy 1216 * (1 + z) ≥ 3000. Therefore, solving for z: z ≥ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467. So z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈ 1.47.

But maybe the problem expects a more approximate answer or uses a slightly different cutoff. For example, if someone uses 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit (near the U-band filter, which is around 3600 Angstroms), then the calculation would be 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. But that would be a higher lower limit. However, I think the standard approach is to use the atmospheric cutoff at ~3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z ≈ 1.47.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. The Lyman alpha line at rest is 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). To observe it in the optical, say at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), the redshift would be (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. But if we can observe down to 300 nm, then z ≈ 1.47. So depending on the telescope's capabilities. But ground-based telescopes can observe in the near-UV if the atmosphere allows. Wait, but the atmosphere doesn't allow below ~300 nm. So, for example, the U-band in astronomy is about 300-400 nm (3000-4000 Angstroms). So, if the observed wavelength is in the U-band, which starts at 300 nm, then the lower limit would be z ≈ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.467. However, some telescopes might have instruments that can observe down to 320 nm, but the exact cutoff can vary. But since the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes," perhaps the standard U-band is considered part of the optical, even though it's near UV. So, the U-band is considered part of the optical range in astronomy.

Therefore, the lower limit would be when the Lyman alpha is shifted into the U-band, i.e., 3000 Angstroms. Hence, z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47, so the answer is z ≈ 1.5. But since the question says "estimate the lower limit," maybe we can round it to z ≈ 1.5. However, let's see if I can find a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using 912 Angstroms as the Lyman limit, but no, the question specifically mentions Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. So that's not it.

Wait, another way: The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). We need lambda_obs >= lambda_optical_min. If lambda_optical_min is 3000 Angstroms, then 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000 => z >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.467. So approximately 1.47. If we use 3600 Angstroms (the U-band upper limit?), then z ≈ 2. But since the question says "lower limit," we should use the smallest possible lambda_optical_min, which is 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z ≈ 1.47.

But let me check an astronomy reference. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) covers wavelengths from about 3000 to 10,000 Angstroms. So, 3000 Angstroms is included. Therefore, if a cloud has a redshift such that Lyman alpha is at 3000 Angstroms, then z = 3000/1216 -1 ≈ 1.467. So, z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. But maybe the standard answer is z ≈ 0.47? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, if the quasar is at a higher redshift, then the Lyman alpha absorption from the cloud would be at a lower redshift. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

The quasar is at some redshift z_qso. The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, where z_cloud < z_qso. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs in the cloud's rest frame at 1216 Angstroms. When we observe it, the wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). However, this absorption line is seen in the quasar's spectrum, which is itself redshifted by z_qso. Wait, no. Wait, this might be a confusion.

Wait, actually, the absorption happens when the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength is redshifted to match a shorter wavelength in the quasar's emitted spectrum. Wait, perhaps I need to think about the relation between the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift.

Let me recall that for intervening absorption lines, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z_cloud). Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). The quasar is at a higher redshift z_qso > z_cloud. So, the quasar's light is emitted at various wavelengths, but when it passes through the cloud, the cloud absorbs at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. Therefore, in the quasar's spectrum, we see an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Therefore, to observe this absorption line from the ground, that observed wavelength must be in the optical range. Therefore, the calculation is as before: 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 3000 Angstroms, so z_cloud >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.467. So, the cloud must be at z >= ~1.47.

Therefore, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is approximately 1.47. So the answer is z ≈ 1.5. But to be precise, it's approximately 1.47, which is 1.5 when rounded. However, sometimes in exams, they might expect an integer, but since it's an estimate, 1.5 is okay. Alternatively, maybe using 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit, which would give z ≈ 2. But I think 1.47 is more accurate if we take 3000 Angstroms as the cutoff.

Wait, but let me verify with another perspective. The Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm. The atmosphere is opaque below 300 nm. So, to shift 121.6 nm to 300 nm, the redshift factor is 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.467, so z = 1.467. Yes, that's the same as before. So, yes, z ≈ 1.47.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47. So, when writing the answer, I should box this as \boxed{1.47} or \boxed{1.5} depending on the required precision. Since the question says "estimate," maybe 1.5 is acceptable, but 1.47 is more precise. However, let's see if there's a standard value.

In astronomy, the Lyman-alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with redshifts greater than about 2, because at z=2, the Lyman alpha line is at 1216*(1+2)=3648 Angstroms, which is in the U-band (300-400 nm). However, the lower limit would be when it just enters the observable window. So, if the minimum observable wavelength is 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), then z=1.47. But quasars at z>2 are more common for Lyman-alpha forest studies because at lower redshifts, the line would be in the UV and unobservable. Therefore, the lower limit is around z≈1.47, but in practice, most observations are at higher redshifts. However, the question is about the lower limit, so 1.47 is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately \boxed{1.47}.


**Final Answer**
The lower limit on the redshift is \boxed{1.47}.

I need to determine the minimum redshift necessary for neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength to be detectable using ground-based optical telescopes. Let me consider what I know about redshifts and the Lyman alpha line.

The Lyman alpha line represents a hydrogen electron transitioning from the second energy level to the first. Its rest wavelength is approximately 1216 Angstroms, which falls in the ultraviolet spectrum. Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet light, preventing ground-based optical telescopes from observing UV wavelengths. Therefore, for us to detect this absorption using optical telescopes, the light must be redshifted into the visible range.

The observed wavelength after redshift needs to fall within the optical spectrum. Optical wavelengths generally range from about 3000 Angstroms (UV boundary) to 7000 Angstroms (near-infrared boundary). Although human vision spans from approximately 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red), optical telescopes can sometimes detect slightly beyond these limits. The atmosphere further constrains observations, with the atmospheric cutoff for ground-based telescopes occurring around 3000 Angstroms on the UV end and extending to roughly 11000 Angstroms in the near-infrared, though these boundaries can vary.

Given that we're discussing "optical ground-based telescopes," we should consider the typical optical range of about 3000-7000 Angstroms. More precisely, the atmosphere doesn't transmit UV light below approximately 3000-3100 Angstroms due to ozone layer absorption. Therefore, the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted to at least 3100 Angstroms to be observable from the ground.

To clarify, the Lyman alpha forest consists of absorption lines in quasar spectra caused by intervening hydrogen clouds. These become visible in the optical spectrum when sufficiently redshifted. The quasar serves as the background light source, while the neutral hydrogen clouds lie between us and the quasar. The absorption occurs at the redshift of each cloud. Thus, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption equals 1216 Angstroms multiplied by (1 + z), where z represents the redshift.

Alright, so I need to determine the minimum redshift for neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength in a way that can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes. Let's start by reviewing what redshift and the Lyman alpha line involve.

The Lyman alpha line is a particular spectral line of hydrogen, occurring when an electron jumps from the second to the first energy level. The rest wavelength for this transition is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. However, ground-based optical telescopes can’t observe UV light, as the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of it. Therefore, for detection with optical telescopes, the light must be redshifted into the visible spectrum.

This means the observed wavelength, after redshift, needs to fall within the optical range. Optical wavelengths range roughly from about 3000 Angstroms (UV edge) to 7000 Angstroms (near-infrared). Actually, the human eye detects from around 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red), but optical telescopes sometimes extend slightly beyond that. Still, the atmosphere influences these observations, with a cutoff around 3000 Angstroms to perhaps 11000 Angstroms. However, the exact limits can differ. Since the original Lyman alpha wavelength is in the UV (1216 Angstroms), it needs redshifting into the optical range.

Now, considering "optical ground-based telescopes," we should consider the typical optical range of about 3000-7000 Angstroms. But the Earth's atmosphere doesn’t transmit UV light below ~3000 Angstroms, so the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into a range that the atmosphere can transmit. As a result, the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 Angstroms. However, the atmospheric cutoff more accurately starts around ~3100 Angstroms due to absorption by the ozone layer, meaning the lower limit is around 3000-3100 Angstroms. Thus, the Lyman alpha line needs redshifting to at least 3100 Angstroms for ground-based observation.

Let's verify this. The Lyman alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars caused by hydrogen clouds along the line of sight. These are observed in the optical spectrum when the quasar has a sufficiently high redshift. This means the quasar's light is so redshifted that the Lyman alpha absorption, initially at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar’s rest frame, shifts into the optical range by the time it reaches us. However, the quasar is at a higher redshift compared to the intervening clouds. Remember, the quasar is the background source, and the absorption occurs at the redshift of the intervening clouds, with the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption being 1216 Angstroms multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

Let's compute that:\n\n(1 + z) ≥ 3100 / 1216 ≈ 2.55\n\nThus, z ≥ 2.55 - 1 = 1.55. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.55. However, I should verify if the optical range's upper limit might affect this. For example, if the Lyman alpha line were redshifted into the infrared, would that still be detectable? But the question specifies optical telescopes, which are limited to visible wavelengths. So even if the Lyman alpha line were redshifted beyond, say, 7000 Angstroms (which would be z ≈ (7000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 4.75), but the lower limit is determined by the shortest observable wavelength in the optical range. Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimum z required for the observed wavelength to enter the optical range. So, if the quasar's light is absorbed by a cloud at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To be detected by an optical telescope, this must be at least 3100 Angstroms (the lower bound of the optical range). Therefore, z must be at least (3100 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.55. So, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.55.\n\nBut maybe we need to check if the upper limit of the optical range affects the lower limit. For example, if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the infrared (above 7000 Angstroms), but that would be a higher redshift. However, the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum redshift needed to shift the Lyman alpha line into the optical range. Therefore, the lower limit is when 1216*(1+z) is equal to the minimum observable optical wavelength. But wait, the minimum wavelength for optical telescopes is around 3000-3100 Angstroms. So, if the observed wavelength is 3100 Angstroms, then z = (3100 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.55. Hence, the lower limit on z is approximately 1.55.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use 4000 Angstroms as the start of the visible range (violet), but since some telescopes can observe into the near-UV (down to about 3000 Angstroms), perhaps the cutoff is lower. Therefore, the lower limit on z would be lower if the telescope can observe down to 3000 Angstroms. Let me recalculate with 3000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467, so approximately 1.47. But maybe different sources use different definitions. For example, if the atmospheric cutoff is around 3200 Angstroms, then z would be (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.63 -1 = 1.63. This variability suggests that the answer might depend on the exact cutoff.\n\nHowever, in astronomy, the commonly accepted lower limit for the optical window is about 3000 Angstroms (0.3 microns). So the Lyman alpha line at rest 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 microns) needs to be redshifted to 0.3 microns. So, 0.3 / 0.1216 ≈ 2.467, so z ≈ 1.467. However, sometimes the atmospheric transmission drops significantly below 3200 Angstroms (0.32 microns), so some sources might use 3200 Angstroms as the lower limit, leading to z ≈ (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.63.\n\nBut perhaps the standard answer is z ≈ 1.5. Let me check some references. For example, in standard textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is observable in optical for quasars with z > 2, but that might be for the quasar's own emission. Wait, no. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. So, if a cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption is observed at 1216*(1+z). To observe that in the optical, say, above 3600 Angstroms (which is in the blue part of the optical), then z ≈ (3600/1216)-1 ≈ 2.96 -1 ≈ 1.96. Hmm, but that's higher. Wait, maybe my initial approach is oversimplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum redshift such that the Lyman alpha absorption is not in the UV anymore. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because of the atmosphere. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. The atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimum z is (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.467, which is approximately 1.47. But in practice, the atmospheric transmission is poor below 3200 Angstroms, so maybe 3200 is a safer limit. So (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.63. So maybe z ≈ 1.6. However, different sources might give slightly different answers. For example, some sources state that the Lyman alpha forest is observable in optical for redshifts z > 2. However, that might refer to the quasar's own redshift. Wait, let's think again.\n\nIf the quasar is at a higher redshift than the absorbing cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). For us to observe that in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range. So the cloud must have a redshift such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≥ 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z_cloud ≥ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. But the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so the quasar's redshift z_qso must be greater than z_cloud. Therefore, to detect such absorption, the quasar must be at z_qso > z_cloud, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected. So the cloud's redshift must be at least z ≈ 1.47. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasars with emission redshifts higher than the absorption redshifts. So if a quasar is at z_qso, then the Lyman alpha forest exists for clouds with z_cloud < z_qso. Therefore, to have clouds that are at z_cloud, you need quasars at higher z. But the question is just about the lower limit on the cloud's redshift for detectability. So regardless of the quasar's redshift, the cloud must have z_cloud such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical range. Therefore, the answer should be z_cloud ≈ 1.47. But maybe the standard answer is z ≈ 1.5. Alternatively, if using 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit (to get into the visible range), then z ≈ 2. However, 3600 Angstroms is still in the near-UV, but perhaps visible to CCDs. Wait, human eye sensitivity starts around 4000 Angstroms, but telescopes with CCDs can detect lower wavelengths, down to about 3000 Angstroms. So the key is the atmospheric transmission. Ozone absorbs UV below 3000 Angstroms, so ground-based telescopes can observe from around 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) up to about 11000 Angstroms (1.1 microns). Therefore, the minimum redshift would be when 1216*(1+z) = 3000. So z = (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 ≈ 1.467. So approximately z ≈ 1.47. Rounding up, z ≈ 1.5. However, in some contexts, people might use 912 Angstroms (Lyman limit) for the same calculation, but the question specifically mentions Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.5. But let me check with precise numbers. 3000 / 1216 = 2.467, so z = 1.467. If we take 3100 Angstroms, it's 3100 / 1216 ≈ 2.55, z ≈ 1.55. If the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms, then z ≈ (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 ≈ 2.29. But that would be higher. However, most telescopes can observe below 4000 Angstroms. For example, the atmospheric cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So the correct approach is to use the atmospheric cutoff. Therefore, the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is equal to the atmospheric cutoff. Assuming the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. But perhaps in practice, the Lyman alpha absorption becomes observable around z ≈ 1.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately z = 1.5. However, to be precise, perhaps the answer expects z ≈ 1.5 or z ≈ 1.47. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 Angstroms as the lower limit of the optical, which would give z ≈ 2.29. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check some sources. For example, according to standard textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in the optical for quasars with redshifts greater than approximately 2. But that refers to the quasar's own redshift. The clouds themselves can be at lower redshifts. For example, a quasar at z=3 would have Lyman alpha absorption from clouds at z=2.5, z=2, etc., each producing absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud). If the quasar is at z=3, then the observed wavelength of its own Lyman alpha emission would be 1216*(1+3)=4864 Angstroms, which is in the optical. But the absorption lines from clouds at lower redshifts would be at shorter wavelengths. Wait, no. The quasar's emission comes from its own rest frame. The absorption lines from intervening clouds will have their own redshifts. For example, a cloud at z_cloud will cause absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud) in the observed frame. Therefore, if the quasar is at z_qso, then the observed quasar emission goes up to its rest frame wavelengths multiplied by (1+z_qso). So the Lyman alpha emission line of the quasar is at 1216*(1+z_qso). However, intervening clouds at z_cloud < z_qso will produce absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud). Therefore, to observe the absorption in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range, regardless of the quasar's redshift, as long as the quasar is bright enough and at a higher redshift. Therefore, the minimum z_cloud for the absorption to be in the optical is when 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≥ 3000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≥ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z=1.47. But if the atmospheric cutoff is higher, say 3200 Angstroms, then z=1.63. However, since the problem asks for an estimate, the answer is likely around z≈1.5. But to be precise, using 3000 Angstroms gives z≈1.47, which could be approximated as 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.5. Alternatively, if using 3600 Angstroms (the start of the visible spectrum), z≈2. But that seems too high. I think the key is the atmospheric cutoff. Since ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms, the calculation using 3000 Angstroms is appropriate, leading to z≈1.5.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389208, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2881, prompt_tokens=488, total_tokens=3369, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) for detecting Lyman alpha absorption (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) with ground-based optical telescopes, we need the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) to fall within the optical range. Ground-based telescopes are limited by atmospheric absorption of UV light below ~3000–3100 Å. Using the redshift relation:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z),
\]

we solve for \( z \) when \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467 \implies z \approx 1.47.
\]

If using a slightly higher atmospheric cutoff (e.g., 3100 Å), \( z \approx 1.55 \). However, the standard approximation rounds this to **\( z \geq 1.5 \)**.

**Answer:**  
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(\boxed{1.5}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

We need to solve for z such that 1216 * (1 + z) ≥ 3100. Let's compute that:

(1 + z) ≥ 3100 / 1216 ≈ 2.55

Thus, z ≥ 2.55 - 1 = 1.55. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.55. However, I should verify if the optical range's upper limit might affect this. For example, if the Lyman alpha line were redshifted into the infrared, would that still be detectable? But the question specifies optical telescopes, which are limited to visible wavelengths. So even if the Lyman alpha line were redshifted beyond, say, 7000 Angstroms (which would be z ≈ (7000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 4.75), but the lower limit is determined by the shortest observable wavelength in the optical range. Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimum z required for the observed wavelength to enter the optical range. So, if the quasar's light is absorbed by a cloud at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To be detected by an optical telescope, this must be at least 3100 Angstroms (the lower bound of the optical range). Therefore, z must be at least (3100 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.55. So, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.55.

But maybe we need to check if the upper limit of the optical range affects the lower limit. For example, if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the infrared (above 7000 Angstroms), but that would be a higher redshift. However, the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum redshift needed to shift the Lyman alpha line into the optical range. Therefore, the lower limit is when 1216*(1+z) is equal to the minimum observable optical wavelength. But wait, the minimum wavelength for optical telescopes is around 3000-3100 Angstroms. So, if the observed wavelength is 3100 Angstroms, then z = (3100 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.55. Hence, the lower limit on z is approximately 1.55.

Alternatively, sometimes people use 4000 Angstroms as the start of the visible range (violet), but since some telescopes can observe into the near-UV (down to about 3000 Angstroms), perhaps the cutoff is lower. Therefore, the lower limit on z would be lower if the telescope can observe down to 3000 Angstroms. Let me recalculate with 3000 Angstroms:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467, so approximately 1.47. But maybe different sources use different definitions. For example, if the atmospheric cutoff is around 3200 Angstroms, then z would be (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.63 -1 = 1.63. This variability suggests that the answer might depend on the exact cutoff.

However, in astronomy, the commonly accepted lower limit for the optical window is about 3000 Angstroms (0.3 microns). So the Lyman alpha line at rest 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 microns) needs to be redshifted to 0.3 microns. So, 0.3 / 0.1216 ≈ 2.467, so z ≈ 1.467. However, sometimes the atmospheric transmission drops significantly below 3200 Angstroms (0.32 microns), so some sources might use 3200 Angstroms as the lower limit, leading to z ≈ (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.63.

But perhaps the standard answer is z ≈ 1.5. Let me check some references. For example, in standard textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is observable in optical for quasars with z > 2, but that might be for the quasar's own emission. Wait, no. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. So, if a cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption is observed at 1216*(1+z). To observe that in the optical, say, above 3600 Angstroms (which is in the blue part of the optical), then z ≈ (3600/1216)-1 ≈ 2.96 -1 ≈ 1.96. Hmm, but that's higher. Wait, maybe my initial approach is oversimplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum redshift such that the Lyman alpha absorption is not in the UV anymore. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because of the atmosphere. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. The atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimum z is (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.467, which is approximately 1.47. But in practice, the atmospheric transmission is poor below 3200 Angstroms, so maybe 3200 is a safer limit. So (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.63. So maybe z ≈ 1.6. However, different sources might give slightly different answers. For example, some sources state that the Lyman alpha forest is observable in optical for redshifts z > 2. However, that might refer to the quasar's own redshift. Wait, let's think again.

If the quasar is at a higher redshift than the absorbing cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). For us to observe that in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range. So the cloud must have a redshift such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≥ 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z_cloud ≥ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. But the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so the quasar's redshift z_qso must be greater than z_cloud. Therefore, to detect such absorption, the quasar must be at z_qso > z_cloud, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected. So the cloud's redshift must be at least z ≈ 1.47. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasars with emission redshifts higher than the absorption redshifts. So if a quasar is at z_qso, then the Lyman alpha forest exists for clouds with z_cloud < z_qso. Therefore, to have clouds that are at z_cloud, you need quasars at higher z. But the question is just about the lower limit on the cloud's redshift for detectability. So regardless of the quasar's redshift, the cloud must have z_cloud such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical range. Therefore, the answer should be z_cloud ≈ 1.47. But maybe the standard answer is z ≈ 1.5. Alternatively, if using 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit (to get into the visible range), then z ≈ 2. However, 3600 Angstroms is still in the near-UV, but perhaps visible to CCDs. Wait, human eye sensitivity starts around 4000 Angstroms, but telescopes with CCDs can detect lower wavelengths, down to about 3000 Angstroms. So the key is the atmospheric transmission. Ozone absorbs UV below 3000 Angstroms, so ground-based telescopes can observe from around 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) up to about 11000 Angstroms (1.1 microns). Therefore, the minimum redshift would be when 1216*(1+z) = 3000. So z = (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 ≈ 1.467. So approximately z ≈ 1.47. Rounding up, z ≈ 1.5. However, in some contexts, people might use 912 Angstroms (Lyman limit) for the same calculation, but the question specifically mentions Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.5. But let me check with precise numbers. 3000 / 1216 = 2.467, so z = 1.467. If we take 3100 Angstroms, it's 3100 / 1216 ≈ 2.55, z ≈ 1.55. If the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms, then z ≈ (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 ≈ 2.29. But that would be higher. However, most telescopes can observe below 4000 Angstroms. For example, the atmospheric cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So the correct approach is to use the atmospheric cutoff. Therefore, the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is equal to the atmospheric cutoff. Assuming the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. But perhaps in practice, the Lyman alpha absorption becomes observable around z ≈ 1.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately z = 1.5. However, to be precise, perhaps the answer expects z ≈ 1.5 or z ≈ 1.47. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 Angstroms as the lower limit of the optical, which would give z ≈ 2.29. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check some sources. For example, according to standard textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in the optical for quasars with redshifts greater than approximately 2. But that refers to the quasar's own redshift. The clouds themselves can be at lower redshifts. For example, a quasar at z=3 would have Lyman alpha absorption from clouds at z=2.5, z=2, etc., each producing absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud). If the quasar is at z=3, then the observed wavelength of its own Lyman alpha emission would be 1216*(1+3)=4864 Angstroms, which is in the optical. But the absorption lines from clouds at lower redshifts would be at shorter wavelengths. Wait, no. The quasar's emission comes from its own rest frame. The absorption lines from intervening clouds will have their own redshifts. For example, a cloud at z_cloud will cause absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud) in the observed frame. Therefore, if the quasar is at z_qso, then the observed quasar emission goes up to its rest frame wavelengths multiplied by (1+z_qso). So the Lyman alpha emission line of the quasar is at 1216*(1+z_qso). However, intervening clouds at z_cloud < z_qso will produce absorption at 1216*(1+z_cloud). Therefore, to observe the absorption in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the optical range, regardless of the quasar's redshift, as long as the quasar is bright enough and at a higher redshift. Therefore, the minimum z_cloud for the absorption to be in the optical is when 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≥ 3000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≥ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z=1.47. But if the atmospheric cutoff is higher, say 3200 Angstroms, then z=1.63. However, since the problem asks for an estimate, the answer is likely around z≈1.5. But to be precise, using 3000 Angstroms gives z≈1.47, which could be approximated as 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.5. Alternatively, if using 3600 Angstroms (the start of the visible spectrum), z≈2. But that seems too high. I think the key is the atmospheric cutoff. Since ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms, the calculation using 3000 Angstroms is appropriate, leading to z≈1.5.

The observed wavelength of the absorption line is at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). So, to observe this absorption line in the optical, 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) must be greater than or equal to the minimum observable wavelength (which is around 3100 Angstroms). Wait, but actually, the quasar\'s light is redshifted, and the cloud\'s redshift is less than the quasar\'s. However, the problem states that the clouds are in deep space, so their redshift is such that the absorption line (which is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud\'s rest frame) is observed at a longer wavelength. Therefore, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms, and z is the cloud\'s redshift. To detect this with ground-based optical telescopes, lambda_obs must be in the range that the telescopes can observe, which is, say, 3000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. But ground-based telescopes can\'t observe below ~3000 Angstroms because of atmospheric absorption. Therefore, the lower limit on z would be when lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms. So solving for z: 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000 => 1 + z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468 => z >= 1.468. So approximately z >= 1.47. But wait, let me check the numbers again. 3000 divided by 1216 is indeed approximately 2.468, so z is about 1.468. However, in reality, the optical range for ground-based telescopes might start a bit higher. For example, the atmosphere\'s cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), but some telescopes might have sensitivity starting at 320 nm (3200 Angstroms). If we take 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit (since maybe the atmospheric transmission is better there), then 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. But this depends on the exact cutoff. However, the problem says "estimate the lower limit," so perhaps we can take the atmospheric cutoff as approximately 3000 Angstroms. Then the minimum redshift is about z ≈ 1.468. But let\'s check again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To observe this in the optical, which is roughly 4000-7000 Angstroms (the visible range), then the lower limit would be 4000 Angstroms. Wait, but perhaps the problem considers the entire optical range, including near-UV that some telescopes can observe. The problem states "optical ground-based telescopes." The optical window for ground-based observations is usually considered from about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to 1000 nm (10000 Angstroms), but the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm. However, the human eye sees from 400-700 nm, but telescopes with CCDs can detect a broader range. But in practice, the atmosphere is opaque below ~300 nm (3000 Angstroms) due to ozone. So the shortest wavelength observable is ~3000 Angstroms. Therefore, to shift Lyman alpha (1216 A) to 3000 A, we compute z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 = 2.468 - 1 = 1.468. So z ≈ 1.47. But let me confirm with more precise numbers. Let\'s compute 3000 divided by 1216: 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468. Subtract 1 gives z ≈ 1.468. So approximately 1.47. But sometimes people use 91.2 nm (912 Angstroms) as the Lyman limit, but here it\'s Lyman alpha at 1216 A. So, the lower limit on redshift would be such that 1216*(1+z) ≥ λ_min, where λ_min is the minimum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes. If λ_min is 3000 A, then z ≥ (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.468. But maybe the problem wants a more approximate answer, like z ≈ 1.5. Alternatively, if the optical range starts at 4000 Angstroms (violet), then z would be (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. But the problem says "lower limit," so the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just into the observable range. So if the minimum observable is 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.47. However, some sources suggest that ground-based observations can go down to about 3100 A. For example, the atmospheric cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 A), but in reality, due to ozone absorption, the cutoff is about 3100 A. So using 3100 A, z = (3100 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.55 -1 = 1.55. So maybe z ≈ 1.5 or 1.55. But perhaps the question expects a more rough estimate. Let me check standard knowledge. In astronomy, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts where the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical. Quasars at z > 2 have their Lyman alpha emission redshifted to longer than 3648 Angstroms (1216 * 3), but that\'s for the quasar\'s own emission. However, the absorption lines from intervening clouds at lower redshifts would have their Lyman alpha absorption at shorter wavelengths. Wait, maybe I confused the quasar redshift with the cloud redshift. Let me think again. Suppose a quasar is at redshift z_qso. Then, intervening clouds at redshift z_cloud < z_qso will produce Lyman alpha absorption at wavelength 1216*(1 + z_cloud). To observe this absorption in the quasar\'s spectrum, the observed wavelength must be less than the quasar\'s own Lyman alpha emission. But the problem here is just about the clouds: it says "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." Wait, actually, the clouds are causing absorption at their own rest frame\'s Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A). So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). To detect this with ground-based optical telescopes, which can see up to, say, 7000 Angstroms, but the key point is the lower limit. The lower limit is when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. So if the atmosphere cuts off below 3000 A, then 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000 A. Therefore, z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.468. So z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is about z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, Lyman alpha absorption is part of the Lyman alpha forest observed in quasar spectra. Quasars need to be at sufficiently high redshift so that their emitted light blueward of Lyman alpha (which is in the UV) is redshifted into the optical. For a cloud at redshift z, its Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z). If the quasar is at a higher redshift, then this absorption feature can be observed. But the minimum redshift for the cloud such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed in the optical would indeed be when 1216*(1+z) is equal to the shortest optical wavelength observable from the ground, which is ~3000 A. Thus, z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈ 1.5. Since the question asks for an estimate, rounding to z ≈ 1.5 is acceptable. But let me confirm once more. If 1216*(1+z) = 3000, then 1+z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.468, so z ≈ 1.468. Rounding to two significant figures, that\'s 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.5. However, sometimes in textbooks, this is approximated as z ≈ 1.5 or z ≈ 2. Let me recall: For Lyman alpha to be in the optical, which starts around 4000 Angstroms. Wait, maybe the confusion is between the emission and absorption. Wait, if the cloud\'s Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). If we want to observe that in the optical range (say 4000-7000 A), then the lower limit would be 4000 A. So, 1216*(1+z) = 4000 => z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z ≈ 2.3. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Hmm, so which is correct? The problem says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." The key is what is the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.5. If it starts at 4000 A, then z ≈ 2.3. But which is the actual lower limit? Ground-based optical telescopes can observe in the near-UV as well, down to about 3000 A. However, the atmosphere becomes opaque below that. So the shortest wavelength they can observe is around 3000 A. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with z > 2, because the forest itself consists of multiple clouds at different redshifts up to the quasar\'s redshift. But the question isn\'t about the quasar\'s redshift, but the cloud\'s redshift. So the cloud just needs to have its Lyman alpha absorption line redshifted into the observable window. If the observable window starts at 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.5. But maybe in reality, astronomers consider the optical range to start at around 3600 A (the near-UV to optical transition). For example, the atmospheric transmission is poor below 3200 A, so maybe the practical lower limit is higher. Let\'s see: If we take 3600 A (which is 360 nm, in the near-UV), then z = (3600 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.96 -1 = 1.96 ≈ 2.0. But this is getting into more detailed considerations. The problem asks for an estimate, so perhaps stating z ≈ 1.5 is acceptable, but maybe the standard answer is z ≈ 0. However, wait, that can\'t be. If the cloud is at z=0, then the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 A, which is UV and not observable from the ground. So the lower limit must be z where 1216*(1+z) is observable. Since ground-based telescopes can\'t observe below ~3000 A, z must be at least ~1.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. However, to check standard references, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra starting at redshifts z > 2, but that refers to the quasar\'s redshift. The clouds themselves can be at lower redshifts. For example, a quasar at z=3 would have its Lyman-alpha emission at 1216*(1+3)=4864 A, which is in the optical. Any clouds between us and the quasar with redshifts from 0 up to just below 3 would imprint Lyman-alpha absorption at wavelengths from 1216 A (unobservable) up to nearly 4864 A. Therefore, the clouds with redshifts high enough that their Lyman-alpha absorption is redshifted into the optical (i.e., above 3000 A) would have z >= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈1.5. So the answer is z ≈1.5, or in boxed notation, \\boxed{1.5}. But to confirm with another approach: The Lyman alpha line at rest is 1216 A. To observe it in the optical, say at 4000 A (violet), the redshift would be z=(4000/1216)-1≈2.3. But if the telescope can observe down to 3000 A, then z≈1.5. Since the question says "lower limit," it\'s the minimum redshift needed to shift the line into the observable range, which is the bluest wavelength the telescope can observe. Hence, using 3000 A gives z≈1.5. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1.5}. Alternatively, some sources state that the Lyman break is at 912 A, and the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A. The Lyman break is the ionization limit for hydrogen. When a galaxy is at higher redshift, the Lyman break shifts into the optical. But that\'s for the Lyman break, not the Lyman alpha line. For the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical, the calculation remains as above. Therefore, I think the correct answer is z≈1.5.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389350, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3253, prompt_tokens=653, total_tokens=3906, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range observable from the ground. 

Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from approximately \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) (near-ultraviolet) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \) (near-infrared), with the atmosphere blocking light below \( \sim 3000 \, \text{Å} \). The observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) of the Lyman alpha line is related to the redshift \( z \) by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \times (1 + z)
\]

For the line to be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be at least \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
3000 \, \text{Å} \leq 1216 \, \text{Å} \times (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.468
\]

\[
z \geq 2.468 - 1 \approx 1.468
\]

Rounding to a reasonable estimate, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 1.5 \).

\[
\boxed{1.5}
\]

But wait, perhaps I need to clarify: the quasar has its own redshift, but the absorbing clouds have a lower redshift. The observed wavelength of the absorption line is at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). So, to observe this absorption line in the optical, 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) must be greater than or equal to the minimum observable wavelength (which is around 3100 Angstroms). Wait, but actually, the quasar's light is redshifted, and the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's. However, the problem states that the clouds are in deep space, so their redshift is such that the absorption line (which is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame) is observed at a longer wavelength. Therefore, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms, and z is the cloud's redshift. To detect this with ground-based optical telescopes, lambda_obs must be in the range that the telescopes can observe, which is, say, 3000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. But ground-based telescopes can't observe below ~3000 Angstroms because of atmospheric absorption. Therefore, the lower limit on z would be when lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms. So solving for z: 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000 => 1 + z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468 => z >= 1.468. So approximately z >= 1.47. But wait, let me check the numbers again. 3000 divided by 1216 is indeed approximately 2.468, so z is about 1.468. However, in reality, the optical range for ground-based telescopes might start a bit higher. For example, the atmosphere's cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), but some telescopes might have sensitivity starting at 320 nm (3200 Angstroms). If we take 3600 Angstroms as the lower limit (since maybe the atmospheric transmission is better there), then 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. But this depends on the exact cutoff. However, the problem says "estimate the lower limit," so perhaps we can take the atmospheric cutoff as approximately 3000 Angstroms. Then the minimum redshift is about z ≈ 1.468. But let's check again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To observe this in the optical, which is roughly 4000-7000 Angstroms (the visible range), then the lower limit would be 4000 Angstroms. Wait, but perhaps the problem considers the entire optical range, including near-UV that some telescopes can observe. The problem states "optical ground-based telescopes." The optical window for ground-based observations is usually considered from about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to 1000 nm (10000 Angstroms), but the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm. However, the human eye sees from 400-700 nm, but telescopes with CCDs can detect a broader range. But in practice, the atmosphere is opaque below ~300 nm (3000 Angstroms) due to ozone. So the shortest wavelength observable is ~3000 Angstroms. Therefore, to shift Lyman alpha (1216 A) to 3000 A, we compute z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 = 2.468 - 1 = 1.468. So z ≈ 1.47. But let me confirm with more precise numbers. Let's compute 3000 divided by 1216: 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468. Subtract 1 gives z ≈ 1.468. So approximately 1.47. But sometimes people use 91.2 nm (912 Angstroms) as the Lyman limit, but here it's Lyman alpha at 1216 A. So, the lower limit on redshift would be such that 1216*(1+z) ≥ λ_min, where λ_min is the minimum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes. If λ_min is 3000 A, then z ≥ (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.468. But maybe the problem wants a more approximate answer, like z ≈ 1.5. Alternatively, if the optical range starts at 4000 Angstroms (violet), then z would be (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. But the problem says "lower limit," so the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just into the observable range. So if the minimum observable is 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.47. However, some sources suggest that ground-based observations can go down to about 3100 A. For example, the atmospheric cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 A), but in reality, due to ozone absorption, the cutoff is about 3100 A. So using 3100 A, z = (3100 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.55 -1 = 1.55. So maybe z ≈ 1.5 or 1.55. But perhaps the question expects a more rough estimate. Let me check standard knowledge. In astronomy, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts where the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical. Quasars at z > 2 have their Lyman alpha emission redshifted to longer than 3648 Angstroms (1216 * 3), but that's for the quasar's own emission. However, the absorption lines from intervening clouds at lower redshifts would have their Lyman alpha absorption at shorter wavelengths. Wait, maybe I confused the quasar redshift with the cloud redshift. Let me think again. Suppose a quasar is at redshift z_qso. Then, intervening clouds at redshift z_cloud < z_qso will produce Lyman alpha absorption at wavelength 1216*(1 + z_cloud). To observe this absorption in the quasar's spectrum, the observed wavelength must be less than the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission. But the problem here is just about the clouds: it says "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." Wait, actually, the clouds are causing absorption at their own rest frame's Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A). So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). To detect this with ground-based optical telescopes, which can see up to, say, 7000 Angstroms, but the key point is the lower limit. The lower limit is when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. So if the atmosphere cuts off below 3000 A, then 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000 A. Therefore, z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.468. So z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is about z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, Lyman alpha absorption is part of the Lyman alpha forest observed in quasar spectra. Quasars need to be at sufficiently high redshift so that their emitted light blueward of Lyman alpha (which is in the UV) is redshifted into the optical. For a cloud at redshift z, its Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z). If the quasar is at a higher redshift, then this absorption feature can be observed. But the minimum redshift for the cloud such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed in the optical would indeed be when 1216*(1+z) is equal to the shortest optical wavelength observable from the ground, which is ~3000 A. Thus, z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈ 1.5. Since the question asks for an estimate, rounding to z ≈ 1.5 is acceptable. But let me confirm once more. If 1216*(1+z) = 3000, then 1+z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.468, so z ≈ 1.468. Rounding to two significant figures, that's 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.5. However, sometimes in textbooks, this is approximated as z ≈ 1.5 or z ≈ 2. Let me recall: For Lyman alpha to be in the optical, which starts around 4000 Angstroms. Wait, maybe the confusion is between the emission and absorption. Wait, if the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). If we want to observe that in the optical range (say 4000-7000 A), then the lower limit would be 4000 A. So, 1216*(1+z) = 4000 => z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z ≈ 2.3. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Hmm, so which is correct? The problem says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." The key is what is the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.5. If it starts at 4000 A, then z ≈ 2.3. But which is the actual lower limit? Ground-based optical telescopes can observe in the near-UV as well, down to about 3000 A. However, the atmosphere becomes opaque below that. So the shortest wavelength they can observe is around 3000 A. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with z > 2, because the forest itself consists of multiple clouds at different redshifts up to the quasar's redshift. But the question isn't about the quasar's redshift, but the cloud's redshift. So the cloud just needs to have its Lyman alpha absorption line redshifted into the observable window. If the observable window starts at 3000 A, then z ≈ 1.5. But maybe in reality, astronomers consider the optical range to start at around 3600 A (the near-UV to optical transition). For example, the atmospheric transmission is poor below 3200 A, so maybe the practical lower limit is higher. Let's see: If we take 3600 A (which is 360 nm, in the near-UV), then z = (3600 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.96 -1 = 1.96 ≈ 2.0. But this is getting into more detailed considerations. The problem asks for an estimate, so perhaps stating z ≈ 1.5 is acceptable, but maybe the standard answer is z ≈ 0. However, wait, that can't be. If the cloud is at z=0, then the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 A, which is UV and not observable from the ground. So the lower limit must be z where 1216*(1+z) is observable. Since ground-based telescopes can't observe below ~3000 A, z must be at least ~1.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. However, to check standard references, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra starting at redshifts z > 2, but that refers to the quasar's redshift. The clouds themselves can be at lower redshifts. For example, a quasar at z=3 would have its Lyman-alpha emission at 1216*(1+3)=4864 A, which is in the optical. Any clouds between us and the quasar with redshifts from 0 up to just below 3 would imprint Lyman-alpha absorption at wavelengths from 1216 A (unobservable) up to nearly 4864 A. Therefore, the clouds with redshifts high enough that their Lyman-alpha absorption is redshifted into the optical (i.e., above 3000 A) would have z >= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈1.5. So the answer is z ≈1.5, or in boxed notation, \boxed{1.5}. But to confirm with another approach: The Lyman alpha line at rest is 1216 A. To observe it in the optical, say at 4000 A (violet), the redshift would be z=(4000/1216)-1≈2.3. But if the telescope can observe down to 3000 A, then z≈1.5. Since the question says "lower limit," it's the minimum redshift needed to shift the line into the observable range, which is the bluest wavelength the telescope can observe. Hence, using 3000 A gives z≈1.5. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{1.5}. Alternatively, some sources state that the Lyman break is at 912 A, and the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A. The Lyman break is the ionization limit for hydrogen. When a galaxy is at higher redshift, the Lyman break shifts into the optical. But that's for the Lyman break, not the Lyman alpha line. For the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical, the calculation remains as above. Therefore, I think the correct answer is z≈1.5.
