To determine the velocity of particle \( A \) produced in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), we start by considering the conservation of energy and momentum. 

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible.
   - The total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton: 
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - The initial momentum is negligible due to the antiproton's low velocity.

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The rest mass energy of each \( A \) particle is \( 300 \, \text{MeV} \), so the total rest mass energy of the four \( A \) particles is:
     \[
     4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - The remaining energy is converted into kinetic energy:
     \[
     K.E._{\text{total}} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Assuming the kinetic energy is equally distributed among the four \( A \) particles, each particle has:
     \[
     K.E._{\text{per particle}} = \frac{676 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

3. **Relativistic Energy Calculation**:
   - The total energy of each \( A \) particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy:
     \[
     E = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Using the relativistic energy relation \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{469 \, \text{MeV}}{300 \, \text{MeV}} \approx 1.563
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \implies 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
     \]
     \[
     v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{1.563^2} \approx 0.591
     \]
     \[
     v \approx \sqrt{0.591} \, c \approx 0.769c
     \]

Thus, the velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \(\boxed{0.77c}\).

Okay, so I need to find the velocity of particle A produced in the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is given as 300 MeV/c². Hmm, let's start by recalling some physics concepts here.

First, since the antiproton is moving slowly, I can assume that the proton is at rest in the lab frame. So the initial system is a proton at rest and an antiproton with very low kinetic energy. When they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. I need to find the velocity of these A particles after the reaction.

Conservation laws should apply here. The main ones are conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its momentum is negligible? Wait, but if it's moving, even slowly, it has some momentum. However, if it's "slowly moving," perhaps its kinetic energy is much smaller compared to its rest mass energy. The rest mass of a proton (and antiproton) is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then maybe we can approximate the total initial energy as just the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. That would be 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Hmm, but let me check if that's a valid assumption.

If the antiproton is moving slowly, then in the lab frame, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which for non-relativistic speeds is much less than mc². Since mc² for the antiproton is 938 MeV, even if it's moving at, say, 1% the speed of light, the kinetic energy would be roughly (1/2)(938 MeV)(0.01c)² / c² = (1/2)(938)(0.0001) ≈ 0.0469 MeV, which is indeed negligible compared to 938 MeV. So, it's reasonable to approximate the total initial energy as twice the rest energy of the proton, so 1876 MeV.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," but does that mean we can neglect its kinetic energy? The problem might want us to assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. So then the total energy is just the sum of rest energies. Therefore, the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero, and the antiproton's momentum is non-zero but small. However, if the velocity is very low, maybe we can approximate the initial total momentum as approximately zero? Wait, no. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, even slowly, the total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

But in high-energy physics, when particles annihilate, the process is often considered in the center-of-momentum frame. But here, since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-momentum frame would be moving relative to the lab frame. However, maybe in this case, since the antiproton's momentum is small, the center-of-momentum frame is approximately the lab frame? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. But if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the total momentum isn't zero. Unless the problem is implying that the antiproton is also at rest? Wait, but it says "slowly moving," so probably not. Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact wording.

The problem states: "The antiproton is slowly moving." So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. So their total momentum is non-zero. However, if the antiproton's velocity is very low, maybe we can approximate that the total energy is approximately twice the rest mass energy of the proton, and the total momentum is approximately equal to the antiproton's momentum. But since the velocity is low, the momentum is non-relativistic, so p = mv. But m is 938 MeV/c², so p = (938 MeV/c²) * v. If v is small, say, 0.01c, then p = 938 * 0.01 = 9.38 MeV/c. Then, after the annihilation, the four particles (two A⁺ and two A⁻) must carry away this momentum. But each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². So maybe in the lab frame, the A particles have some velocity such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum of the antiproton.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Wait, but if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-mass frame is moving. To find the velocity of the A particles, perhaps it's easier to work in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Then, the energy in that frame would be the total energy available, which can be calculated from the initial energies and momenta of the proton and antiproton. Then, in that frame, the four A particles would be produced at rest? But since they have rest mass 300 MeV each, four of them would have total rest mass energy 4*300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial energy in the center-of-mass frame would be higher than that, so they must have kinetic energy. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the center-of-mass frame but rather the lab frame. Let me think again.

In the lab frame, proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly. Total energy is approximately 938 MeV (proton) + 938 MeV (antiproton) = 1876 MeV. Total momentum is approximately (938 MeV/c²) * v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton, but since v is small, this momentum is small. But when they annihilate into four particles, the total energy must be 1876 MeV, and the total momentum must be equal to the initial momentum.

But each A particle has rest mass 300 MeV/c², so their rest mass energy is 300 MeV each, so four of them would be 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200) = 676 MeV would be the kinetic energy distributed among the four A particles. But how is this kinetic energy distributed? And how does the momentum work out?

But this seems complicated because in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero, so the four A particles must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum. But since the initial momentum is small (because the antiproton is moving slowly), maybe we can approximate that the four A particles are produced at rest? But that can't be, because then their total momentum would be zero, which would contradict the initial momentum. Alternatively, maybe the kinetic energy is minimal, but the problem is asking for the velocity of the A particles, which might be non-relativistic or relativistic.

Wait, but if the rest mass of each A is 300 MeV, and the available kinetic energy is 676 MeV, which is shared among four particles, so each would have about 169 MeV of kinetic energy. 169 MeV compared to 300 MeV rest mass is about 56%, so that's non-negligible. So the velocity would be relativistic. Hmm, but how do we calculate the velocity?

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach. Let's consider conservation of energy and momentum.

In the lab frame:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + K.E._antiproton

But since K.E. is negligible, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

Initial momentum: p_initial ≈ m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. Since v is small, p_initial is non-relativistic, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

After annihilation, we have four particles, each with mass m_A = 300 MeV/c². Let's denote their energies as E1, E2, E3, E4 and their momenta as p1, p2, p3, p4.

Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 1876 MeV.

Conservation of momentum: p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = p_initial ≈ m_p v.

But since we don't know the directions of the A particles, this seems complicated. However, maybe the problem is assuming that the four A particles are produced symmetrically, so that their momenta cancel out in pairs, leading to total momentum equal to the initial momentum. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if the four A particles are produced at rest, but that would require their total momentum to be zero, which contradicts the initial momentum. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center-of-mass frame. Let's try that.

First, calculate the center-of-mass energy. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = m_p c² + γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v²/c²). But if v is very small, then γ ≈ 1, so E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c². However, the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt[(E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2]. But since the proton is at rest, p1 = 0, and p2 = γ m_p v. So,

E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c²,

p_total = γ m_p v.

Then, the center-of-mass energy squared is:

s = (E_total / c²)^2 - (p_total)^2 = [ (m_p + γ m_p)^2 - (γ m_p v)^2 ].

But since γ ≈ 1, and v is small, we can approximate γ ≈ 1, so:

s ≈ [ (2 m_p)^2 - (m_p v)^2 ].

But (m_p v)^2 is (938 MeV/c² * v)^2. Since v is small, this term is negligible compared to (2 m_p)^2. Therefore, s ≈ (2 m_p)^2, so the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Therefore, even in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is about 1876 MeV.

But the four A particles must have a total rest mass energy of 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV, so the remaining energy is 676 MeV, which is the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. But how is this kinetic energy distributed?

In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the four A particles must be emitted symmetrically so that their total momentum is zero. Each A particle would have the same speed, probably. But since there are two A⁺ and two A⁻, maybe they are emitted in opposite directions in pairs. For example, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction, but that might not necessarily make the momentum zero. Alternatively, they could be emitted isotropically, but in the center-of-mass frame, the momentum vectors would cancel out.

But perhaps the simplest assumption is that each A particle has the same energy and speed, and they are emitted symmetrically. So if each A particle has energy E, then 4E = 1876 MeV → E = 469 MeV. Each A's energy is then 469 MeV. Since the rest mass energy is 300 MeV, the kinetic energy is 469 - 300 = 169 MeV, as before.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v:

1/γ² = 1 - v²/c² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² ≈ 1 - 1/(1.563)^2 ≈ 1 - 1/2.442 ≈ 1 - 0.409 ≈ 0.591.

Therefore, v ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c. So approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But wait, this is in the center-of-mass frame. However, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A. But in which frame? The problem doesn't specify, but since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame, and the proton is at rest, the lab frame is probably the frame where the answer is required. So if we calculate the velocity in the lab frame, it might be different.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero. If we assume that in the center-of-mass frame, the velocity of each A is 0.77c, but then we have to transform that velocity back to the lab frame. However, this complicates things because the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the entire energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles in the lab frame, neglecting the initial momentum. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering that the annihilation happens at rest, which would be the case if both the proton and antiproton are at rest. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so they are not exactly at rest. However, if their relative motion is negligible, then the total initial momentum is approximately zero, and we can use the center-of-mass frame (which would be the lab frame in this case) to compute the velocity.

But this is confusing. Let me check the problem statement again: "The antiproton is slowly moving and m_A c²=300MeV. What is the velocity of particle A?" It doesn't specify the frame, but typically, in such problems, if not specified, it's the lab frame. But in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so the total momentum is not zero. Therefore, the produced particles must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

But if the initial momentum is small, maybe the velocities of the A particles are primarily determined by the available energy, and the momentum is a small correction. However, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified by assuming that the proton and antiproton annihilate at rest, meaning that their total momentum is zero. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, so that's not the case. However, perhaps "slowly moving" is meant to indicate that the kinetic energy is negligible, so we can treat the system as if it's at rest. If that's the case, then the total energy is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV, and the four A particles are produced with this energy. Then, each A has energy 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV, as before, leading to velocity 0.77c. But this is under the assumption that the initial momentum is zero, which contradicts the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Since the rest mass of each A is 300 MeV, and the total rest mass of four A's is 1200 MeV, which is less than the total initial energy of 1876 MeV, so the process is possible. Then, the velocity would be determined by the kinetic energy each A has.

But to find the velocity, we need to relate the kinetic energy to velocity. For a relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c². If each A has kinetic energy K = (E - m c²) = 469 - 300 = 169 MeV, then as before, γ = 1 + K/(m c²) = 1 + 169/300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ ≈ 0.64,

1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.409,

v²/c² ≈ 0.591,

v ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769c.

So approximately 0.77c. But this is under the assumption that each A has the same energy, which would be the case in the center-of-mass frame. However, if we are in the lab frame, the energies might not be the same. But given that the problem doesn't specify the frame, and given that the answer is likely expected to be around 0.8c, maybe this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced at rest. But that can't be because their rest mass is less than the total energy. Wait, no. If the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 1876 MeV, and the rest mass energy needed is 1200 MeV, they can't be at rest. They must have kinetic energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the threshold energy for the reaction. Wait, but the reaction is given as happening, so we don't need to calculate the threshold. The question is just about the velocity of the produced particles.

Wait, another approach: since the proton and antiproton annihilate into four particles, and we can assume that the process conserves both energy and momentum. If the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum is small. So maybe the four A particles are emitted with velocities such that their total momentum equals the initial small momentum, but their kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference.

But how do we calculate their velocity?

Alternatively, if we ignore the initial momentum (approximate it as zero), then in the center-of-mass frame, the velocity would be 0.77c as calculated. But if we have to transform that back to the lab frame, where the center-of-mass is moving, then the velocity would be a combination. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic calculation. But with 300 MeV rest mass and kinetic energy of 169 MeV, the velocity is definitely relativistic.

Wait, let's check the units. The mass is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. So m_A = 300 MeV / c². The rest energy is 300 MeV. If the total energy per A is 469 MeV, then gamma is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, as before. Then, using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²):

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64

1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.409

v²/c² ≈ 0.591

v ≈ sqrt(0.591) * c ≈ 0.769c

So approximately 0.77c, which is 77% the speed of light.

But is there a different approach where we don't assume equal energy distribution?

Alternatively, if the four A particles share the kinetic energy equally, but maybe they don't have to. However, without more information about the distribution, the simplest assumption is that they are produced symmetrically with equal energy. Therefore, the velocity would be around 0.77c.

But to confirm, let's think about the physics. When particles are produced in a collision, if the process is symmetric, they are typically emitted isotropically in the center-of-mass frame. However, in the lab frame, due to the motion of the center-of-mass, there would be a preferred direction. But since the problem doesn't specify the frame, and given that the velocity is asked without reference to direction, perhaps the answer is intended to be calculated in the center-of-mass frame, leading to 0.77c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame, considering that the initial momentum is not zero. Let's try that.

In the lab frame:

Proton at rest: energy = m_p c² = 938 MeV, momentum = 0.

Antiproton: energy = m_p c² + K.E. ≈ m_p c² (since K.E. is negligible), momentum = p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Total initial energy: E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

Total initial momentum: p_initial ≈ m_p v.

After annihilation, four A particles with total energy E_total = 1876 MeV and total momentum p_total = p_initial.

Assuming that all four A particles have the same speed and are moving in the same direction (to maximize momentum), but that's not possible because they would then have maximum possible momentum, but the problem states two A⁺ and two A⁻, which are likely to be emitted symmetrically. However, without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, suppose that two A⁺ and two A⁻ are emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel in pairs, except for a net momentum equal to p_initial. For example, two A's moving in the direction of the initial antiproton's motion, and two moving opposite, but with a slight imbalance. However, this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since the initial momentum is small, maybe the velocity of the A particles is primarily determined by the available energy, and the momentum is a small correction. But this seems hand-wavy.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the lab frame, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to p_initial. If we approximate that they all have the same velocity, then each A has momentum p = γ m_A v. So total momentum is 4 γ m_A v = p_initial ≈ m_p v_p, where v_p is the antiproton's velocity.

But we also have total energy 4 γ m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

So from energy conservation:

4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.563.

So γ ≈ 1.563, which is the same as before. Then, using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we get v ≈ 0.769c as before.

But wait, but we also have momentum conservation:

4 γ m_A v = m_p v_p.

But from the energy conservation, we found γ ≈ 1.563. Then, 4 * 1.563 * m_A * v = m_p v_p.

But m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

4 * 1.563 * 300 * v = 938 * v_p

→ 4 * 1.563 * 300 / 938 * v = v_p

Calculating the coefficient:

4 * 1.563 ≈ 6.252

6.252 * 300 ≈ 1875.6

1875.6 / 938 ≈ 2.0

So approximately,

2.0 * v ≈ v_p

But the antiproton's velocity v_p is small (slowly moving). If we assume that v_p is negligible, then this equation implies that v ≈ 0. But that contradicts our previous result. Therefore, there's a inconsistency here.

Wait, this suggests that if we take into account momentum conservation, the velocity of the A particles depends on the antiproton's velocity. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe v_p is negligible, but then how do we reconcile this?

Alternatively, maybe the assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity is invalid. If they have different velocities, some moving forward and some moving backward, then the total momentum can be small even if individual velocities are high. For example, two A's moving forward and two moving backward with slightly different speeds. But without more information, it's impossible to determine.

Given that the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV and asks for the velocity of particle A, and given that in similar problems, when annihilation happens at rest, the velocity is calculated using energy conservation in the center-of-mass frame, I think the intended answer is the velocity in the center-of-mass frame, which we calculated as approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the kinetic energy and relate it to velocity classically, but that would be incorrect because at these energies, the velocities are relativistic.

Classically, kinetic energy K = (1/2) m v². So v = sqrt(2K/m). If K = 169 MeV, m = 300 MeV/c², then v = sqrt(2*169 / 300) c ≈ sqrt(1.127) c ≈ 1.06c, which is faster than light, which is impossible. Therefore, a classical calculation is invalid, and we must use relativistic equations.

Therefore, the correct approach is relativistic. So using gamma = 1.563, leading to v ≈ 0.77c.

But let's do the exact calculation for gamma:

gamma = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / gamma² ≈ 1 / (1.563333)^2 ≈ 1 / 2.444 ≈ 0.409.

Therefore,

v²/c² = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591,

v = sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.7687c ≈ 0.77c.

Rounding to two significant figures, since the mass is given as 300 MeV (two sig figs), the answer would be 0.77c. But maybe we need to calculate it more precisely.

sqrt(0.591) = sqrt(591/1000) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7687.

So approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of sqrt(1 - (m_A / E)^2), but let's see.

Wait, energy per particle is E = 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV.

Then,

E² = (pc)^2 + (m_A c²)^2,

so,

(pc)^2 = E² - (m_A c²)^2 = (469)^2 - (300)^2 = (469 - 300)(469 + 300) = 169 * 769 = 129,  169*700=118,300 and 169*69=11,661, so total 129,961 ≈ 130,000 (MeV²).

Thus, pc ≈ sqrt(130,000) ≈ 360.56 MeV.

Then,

p = 360.56 MeV / c.

But p = gamma m_A v,

gamma m_A v = 360.56 MeV / c.

But gamma = E / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563.

Thus,

v = (360.56 MeV / c) / (gamma m_A) = (360.56 / (1.563 * 300)) c ≈ (360.56 / 468.9) c ≈ 0.769c.

Same result as before. So v ≈ 0.77c.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

Since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps we can write it as (sqrt(1 - (m_A / E)^2)) c, where E is the energy per particle.

Given that E = (2 m_p c²)/4 = m_p c² / 2 = 938 / 2 = 469 MeV.

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m_A / E)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - (300 / 469)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - (0.63966)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.4092) = c * sqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686c.

So approximately 0.77c.

Given that the problem states m_A c² = 300 MeV and uses values like 300 and 938 (which is the proton mass), the answer is likely expected to be approximately 0.8c. But our calculation gives 0.77c, which is approximately 0.8c. Depending on rounding, maybe 0.77c or 0.769c.

But let's check if there's a different approach where the velocity is different.

Wait, another thought: since the proton and antiproton annihilate into four particles, maybe we need to consider that the minimum energy required for this process is when all four particles are produced at rest. But that would require energy 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the available energy of 1876 MeV, so the process is possible. The excess energy goes into kinetic energy.

But to find the velocity, we need to distribute the kinetic energy among the four particles. Assuming they all have the same speed, then each has kinetic energy (1876 - 1200)/4 = 169 MeV, as before. Then, using relativistic equations, we find v ≈ 0.77c.

Yes, I think this is solid. Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77c.

**Final Answer**
The velocity of particle \( A \) is \boxed{0.77c}.

Okay, so I need to find the velocity of particle A produced in the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is given as 300 MeV/c². Hmm, let's start by recalling some physics concepts here.

First, since the antiproton is moving slowly, I can assume that the proton is at rest in the lab frame. So the initial system is a proton at rest and an antiproton with very low kinetic energy. When they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. I need to find the velocity of these A particles after the reaction.

Conservation laws should apply here. The main ones are conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its momentum is negligible? Wait, but if it's moving, even slowly, it has some momentum. However, if it's "slowly moving," perhaps its kinetic energy is much smaller compared to its rest mass energy. The rest mass of a proton (and antiproton) is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then maybe we can approximate the total initial energy as just the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. That would be 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Hmm, but let me check if that's a valid assumption.

If the antiproton is moving slowly, then in the lab frame, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which for non-relativistic speeds is much less than mc². Since mc² for the antiproton is 938 MeV, even if it's moving at, say, 1% the speed of light, the kinetic energy would be roughly (1/2)(938 MeV)(0.01c)² / c² = (1/2)(938)(0.0001) ≈ 0.0469 MeV, which is indeed negligible compared to 938 MeV. So, it's reasonable to approximate the total initial energy as twice the rest energy of the proton, so 1876 MeV.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," but does that mean we can neglect its kinetic energy? The problem might want us to assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. So then the total energy is just the sum of rest energies. Therefore, the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero, and the antiproton's momentum is non-zero but small. However, if the velocity is very low, maybe we can approximate the initial total momentum as approximately zero? Wait, no. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, even slowly, the total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

But in high-energy physics, when particles annihilate, the process is often considered in the center-of-momentum frame. But here, since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-momentum frame would be moving relative to the lab frame. However, maybe in this case, since the antiproton's momentum is small, the center-of-momentum frame is approximately the lab frame? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. But if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the total momentum isn't zero. Unless the problem is implying that the antiproton is also at rest? Wait, but it says "slowly moving," so probably not. Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact wording.

The problem states: "The antiproton is slowly moving." So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. So their total momentum is non-zero. However, if the antiproton's velocity is very low, maybe we can approximate that the total energy is approximately twice the rest mass energy of the proton, and the total momentum is approximately equal to the antiproton's momentum. But since the velocity is low, the momentum is non-relativistic, so p = mv. But m is 938 MeV/c², so p = (938 MeV/c²) * v. If v is small, say, 0.01c, then p = 938 * 0.01 = 9.38 MeV/c. Then, after the annihilation, the four particles (two A⁺ and two A⁻) must carry away this momentum. But each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². So maybe in the lab frame, the A particles have some velocity such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum of the antiproton.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Wait, but if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-mass frame is moving. To find the velocity of the A particles, perhaps it's easier to work in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Then, the energy in that frame would be the total energy available, which can be calculated from the initial energies and momenta of the proton and antiproton. Then, in that frame, the four A particles would be produced at rest? But since they have rest mass 300 MeV each, four of them would have total rest mass energy 4*300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial energy in the center-of-mass frame would be higher than that, so they must have kinetic energy. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the center-of-mass frame but rather the lab frame. Let me think again.

In the lab frame, proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly. Total energy is approximately 938 MeV (proton) + 938 MeV (antiproton) = 1876 MeV. Total momentum is approximately (938 MeV/c²) * v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton, but since v is small, this momentum is small. But when they annihilate into four particles, the total energy must be 1876 MeV, and the total momentum must be equal to the initial momentum.

But each A particle has rest mass 300 MeV/c², so their rest mass energy is 300 MeV each, so four of them would be 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200) = 676 MeV would be the kinetic energy distributed among the four A particles. But how is this kinetic energy distributed? And how does the momentum work out?

But this seems complicated because in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero, so the four A particles must have a net momentum

I need to determine the velocity of particle A produced when a proton and a slowly moving antiproton annihilate, creating two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c². Let me work through this step by step.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I can consider the proton to be at rest in the laboratory frame. In this scenario, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum to find the velocity of the resulting A particles.

The proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv², which is likely negligible compared to its rest energy. For example, if it's moving at 1% of light speed, its kinetic energy would be about 0.0469 MeV, which is indeed insignificant compared to 938 MeV. Therefore, I can reasonably approximate the total initial energy as the sum of their rest energies: 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

Regarding momentum, since the proton is at rest, it contributes zero momentum. The total initial momentum equals that of the slowly moving antiproton, which would be (938 MeV/c²) × v. For a small velocity like 0.01c, this gives approximately 9.38 MeV/c.

After annihilation, the four A particles (two A⁺ and two A⁻) must carry away both this energy and momentum. Each A particle has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c², so the total rest energy of the four particles is 4 × 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV) must be distributed as kinetic energy among these particles.

I'm trying to determine how this kinetic energy is distributed and how the momentum conservation works out. I could approach this by considering the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero, but since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-mass frame differs from the lab frame.

Alternatively, in the lab frame, I need to account for both the non-zero initial momentum and the distribution of the 676 MeV of kinetic energy among the four resulting A particles to find their velocity.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the velocity of particle A produced when a proton and antiproton collide and generate two A⁺ particles and two A⁻ particles during the annihilation process. Here, the antiproton is moving slowly, and each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c². Let’s recall some fundamental concepts in physics.

First off, since the antiproton is moving at a slow pace, I can assume the proton is stationary in the lab frame. Thus, initially, the system comprises a proton at rest and an antiproton with minimal kinetic energy. Upon annihilation, they yield four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. My task is to ascertain the velocity of these A particles post-reaction.

The system conserves energy and momentum. Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum might be minor. Yet, if it is slowly moving, it still possesses some momentum. Assuming its kinetic energy is minimal compared to its rest mass energy, with the proton and antiproton's rest masses at approximately 938 MeV/c² each, one could approximate the total initial energy as the sum of their rest energies: 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Let’s confirm if this assumption stands.

As the antiproton moves slowly, its kinetic energy in the lab frame is (1/2)mv². This value is quite small compared to mc² for non-relativistic speeds. Given mc² for the antiproton is 938 MeV, even at 1% of light speed, the kinetic energy will be approximately (1/2)(938 MeV)(0.01c)² / c² = (1/2)(938)(0.0001) ≈ 0.0469 MeV, which is indeed negligible next to 938 MeV. Thus, the approximation of the initial total energy as twice the proton's rest energy (1876 MeV) seems reasonable.

But does the statement "slowly moving" allow us to disregard the kinetic energy entirely? It seems the problem suggests the initial kinetic energy is minor, and the total initial energy comprises just their rest energies. Consequently, the initial momentum equals the antiproton’s momentum, with the proton's momentum being zero. Even though the antiproton has non-zero momentum, it is small, and possibly the initial total momentum could be considered near zero. However, if the proton is stationary while the antiproton moves, its total momentum is solely that of the antiproton.

In high-energy physics, such annihilation processes are often analyzed in the center-of-momentum frame. Here, since the proton is stationary and the antiproton moves slowly, this frame may be moving relative to the lab frame. But perhaps, given the small momentum of the antiproton, the lab frame and center-of-momentum frame are approximately equivalent? It's hard to tell without calculations.

Alternatively, if considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero, this scenario suggests the antiproton must be at rest too—or nearly so—but probably not truly, as the task states "slowly moving.”

So, analyzing the problem: “The antiproton is slowly moving.” Thus, the proton remains at rest, and the antiproton sluggishly moves towards it, resulting in non-zero momentum. Yet, with a very low velocity, the total energy is approximately twice the rest mass energy of the proton, and the total momentum is approximately the antiproton’s momentum. Using p = mv for non-relativistic speeds with m = 938 MeV/c², if v = 0.01c, then p = 938 * 0.01 = 9.38 MeV/c. The resultant four particles must distribute this momentum, each A particle having a mass of 300 MeV/c². Consequently, their resulting velocities must equate to the initial antiproton momentum.

Nonetheless, since these calculations seem complex while analyzing in the lab frame, considering the center-of-mass frame where the initial momentum is zero could simplify things. This will allow calculations of kinetic energy distribution among particles from total initial energy after accounting for rest mass energy. But even thinking again, in the lab frame, the total energy remains approximately 1876 MeV, with the total momentum near the antiproton’s momentum, albeit minor.

Each A particle holding a rest mass of 300 MeV/c² contributes 1200 MeV in rest mass energy. The energy surplus of 676 MeV comes as their kinetic energy, warranting an even distribution among the four particles with momentum adjustments for non-zero initial states, whereas conservation principles dictate the distribution.

However, since the initial momentum is small (antiproton moving slowly), maybe we can approximate that the kinetic energy is distributed symmetrically, and the velocity can be calculated from the kinetic energy?\n\nWait, but each A particle has rest mass 300 MeV/c². The total rest mass is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. The total energy available is 1876 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 676 MeV. If this is divided equally among four particles, each would have 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, the total energy of each particle is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, using the relativistic energy equation, E = γmc², so γ = E/(mc²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64, so 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096, so v²/c² ≈ 0.5904, so v ≈ sqrt(0.5904)c ≈ 0.768c. So approximately 0.77c. But wait, this is assuming that the kinetic energy is equally distributed, but is that a valid assumption?\n\nAlternatively, maybe all the kinetic energy goes into the motion of the A particles, but their velocities are such that their momenta balance out. However, since the initial momentum is small (antiproton moving slowly), maybe the velocities of the A particles are such that their total momentum is approximately zero in the center-of-mass frame. Wait, but we are in the lab frame here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is such that in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced at rest? But their rest mass is 1200 MeV, but the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 1876 MeV, so they can\'t be at rest.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the center-of-mass energy. Let\'s try that.\n\nFirst, compute the total energy and momentum in the lab frame. Proton at rest: energy E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV. Antiproton moving with velocity v, so its energy is E_ap = γ m_p c², and momentum p_ap = γ m_p v. Since the velocity is low, γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v²/c²), but if v is very small, γ ≈ 1. So total energy E_total = E_p + E_ap ≈ 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. Total momentum p_total ≈ m_p v. But since v is small, m_p v is small.\n\nBut in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. To find the center-of-mass energy, we can use the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. So s = (1876 MeV)^2 - (m_p v c)^2. But since v is small, the second term is negligible, so s ≈ (1876 MeV)^2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 1876 MeV.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced with total energy 1876 MeV. Since each A has rest mass 300 MeV, the total rest mass energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the remaining energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy of the four A particles in the center-of-mass frame. If the kinetic energy is distributed equally, each A has 169 MeV, as before. Then, each A would have a total energy of 300 + 169 = 469 MeV, leading to a velocity of approximately 0.768c. But this is in the center-of-mass frame. However, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A. But in which frame? The problem doesn\'t specify, but since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame, and the proton is at rest, the lab frame is probably the frame where the answer is expected.\n\nBut wait, in the lab frame, the total momentum is not zero. So if the A particles are produced symmetrically, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite direction to balance the momentum? But the initial momentum is from the antiproton. If the A particles are produced isotropically in the center-of-mass frame, but then boosted to the lab frame, their velocities would vary. However, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated non-relativistically? But with velocities potentially being a significant fraction of the speed of light, that might not be appropriate. Let\'s check.\n\nGiven that the rest mass of A is 300 MeV, and the kinetic energy per A is around 169 MeV, which is more than half the rest mass, so relativistic effects are significant. So non-relativistic approximation is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a simpler way. Since the initial energy is 1876 MeV, and the four A particles have rest mass 1200 MeV, the remaining energy is 676 MeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. If all four A particles have the same speed, then each has kinetic energy 169 MeV. Then, using the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nSo 169 MeV = (γ - 1)*300 MeV\n\nTherefore, γ - 1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.563\n\nSo γ ≈ 1.563\n\nThen, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSo sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64\n\nThen, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096\n\nTherefore, v²/c² ≈ 0.5904\n\nv ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768c\n\nSo approximately 0.77c. But this is under the assumption that all four A particles have the same speed and direction, which might not be the case. However, in the center-of-mass frame, they would be moving symmetrically, but when transformed back to the lab frame, their velocities would differ. But since the initial momentum in the lab frame is small, maybe the velocity in the center-of-mass frame is approximately the velocity we\'re looking for? Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, another approach. Since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can approximate the reaction as happening at rest? Wait, but the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. If the antiproton\'s velocity is negligible, then effectively the total initial momentum is zero. But that can\'t be, since the antiproton is moving. Unless "slowly moving" is meant to imply that we can consider it at rest? Maybe the problem is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the center-of-mass frame. If we consider the proton and antiproton annihilating at rest, then the total energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV, and the four A particles must share this energy. Then, each A would have energy 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV. Then, using E = γmc², so γ = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, leading to v ≈ 0.768c as before. So maybe this is the answer.\n\nBut why does the problem mention that the antiproton is slowly moving? If they were both at rest, the center-of-mass frame would be the lab frame. But since the antiproton is moving, even slowly, the center-of-mass frame is different. But if the motion is slow, maybe the difference is negligible? So approximating the center-of-mass energy as 1876 MeV and each A particle having energy 469 MeV, leading to v ≈ 0.768c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the exact center-of-mass energy considering the antiproton\'s motion. Let\'s try that.\n\nThe proton is at rest: energy E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV, momentum p_p = 0.\n\nThe antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is p_ap = γ m_p v, and energy E_ap = γ m_p c².\n\nTotal energy E_total = E_p + E_ap = 938 + γ*938.\n\nTotal momentum p_total = p_ap = γ m_p v.\n\nThe center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.\n\nSo s = (938 + γ*938)^2 - (γ m_p v c)^2.\n\nBut m_p c² = 938 MeV, so m_p = 938 MeV / c².\n\nTherefore, s = (938(1 + γ))^2 - (γ * (938 / c²) * v c)^2\n\nSimplify the second term: (γ * 938 / c² * v c)^2 = (γ * 938 v / c)^2\n\nTherefore, s = [938(1 + γ)]² - [938 γ v / c]^2\n\nFactor out (938)^2:\n\ns = (938)^2 [ (1 + γ)^2 - (γ v / c)^2 ]\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nLet me denote β = v / c, so γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nThen, s = (938)^2 [ (1 + γ)^2 - (γ β)^2 ]\n\nExpand (1 + γ)^2:\n\n1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² β²\n\nSo:\n\n1 + 2γ + γ²(1 - β²)\n\nBut 1 - β² = 1 / γ², so:\n\n1 + 2γ + γ²*(1 / γ²) = 1 + 2γ + 1 = 2 + 2γ\n\nTherefore, s = (938)^2 * 2(1 + γ)\n\nBut wait, this seems interesting. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, expanding (1 + γ)^2 - (γ β)^2:\n\n= 1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² β²\n\nBut γ² β² = γ² (1 - 1/γ²) = γ² - 1\n\nTherefore, 1 + 2γ + γ² - (γ² - 1) = 1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² + 1 = 2 + 2γ\n\nTherefore, s = (938)^2 * 2(1 + γ)\n\nBut s is also equal to (E_cm)^2, where E_cm is the total center-of-mass energy.\n\nTherefore, E_cm = 938 * sqrt[2(1 + γ)]\n\nBut E_cm is also the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is the sum of the proton and antiproton energies in that frame.\n\nBut we need to relate γ to the velocity of the antiproton. However, since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, β is small, so γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)β². Therefore, 1 + γ ≈ 2 + (1/2)β². Then, sqrt[2(1 + γ)] ≈ sqrt[4 + β²] ≈ 2 + (β²)/4. Therefore, E_cm ≈ 938*(2 + (β²)/4). But the actual value of E_cm would be slightly larger than 2*938 MeV, but since β is small, the difference is negligible. Therefore, even if the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2*938 MeV, so the previous calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has energy 469 MeV, leading to γ ≈ 1.563 and velocity ≈ 0.768c. Since the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, and considering that in the center-of-mass frame the particles would be moving symmetrically, but when transformed back to the lab frame, their velocities would be slightly different. However, given that the antiproton\'s velocity is very low, the boost between the center-of-mass frame and the lab frame is small, so the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately the same as in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.768c, which is about 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The rest mass of each A is 300 MeV/c². The antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has low kinetic energy. The total energy is approximately 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. The total rest mass of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the available kinetic energy is 676 MeV. Assuming that this kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four A particles, each gets 169 MeV. Then, using K = (γ - 1)mc², solving for γ, then finding v. As done before, leading to v ≈ 0.768c. So this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the kinetic energy isn\'t distributed equally, but since the problem doesn\'t specify any particular distribution, equal distribution is a reasonable assumption. Therefore, the velocity would be approximately 0.77c.

To determine the velocity of particle \( A \) produced in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-} \), we start by considering the conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. The total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The rest mass energy of the four \( A \) particles is:

\[
4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The remaining energy, which is converted into kinetic energy, is:

\[
1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Assuming the kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four \( A \) particles, each particle receives:

\[
\frac{676 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The total energy of each \( A \) particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Using the relativistic energy equation \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{469 \, \text{MeV}}{300 \, \text{MeV}} \approx 1.563
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1.563} \approx 0.64
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 0.4096 \implies v^2/c^2 \approx 0.5904 \implies v \approx \sqrt{0.5904} \, c \approx 0.768c
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately:

\[
\boxed{0.77c}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

equal to the initial momentum. However, since the initial momentum is small (antiproton moving slowly), maybe we can approximate that the kinetic energy is distributed symmetrically, and the velocity can be calculated from the kinetic energy?

Wait, but each A particle has rest mass 300 MeV/c². The total rest mass is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. The total energy available is 1876 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 676 MeV. If this is divided equally among four particles, each would have 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, the total energy of each particle is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, using the relativistic energy equation, E = γmc², so γ = E/(mc²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64, so 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096, so v²/c² ≈ 0.5904, so v ≈ sqrt(0.5904)c ≈ 0.768c. So approximately 0.77c. But wait, this is assuming that the kinetic energy is equally distributed, but is that a valid assumption?

Alternatively, maybe all the kinetic energy goes into the motion of the A particles, but their velocities are such that their momenta balance out. However, since the initial momentum is small (antiproton moving slowly), maybe the velocities of the A particles are such that their total momentum is approximately zero in the center-of-mass frame. Wait, but we are in the lab frame here.

Alternatively, maybe the process is such that in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced at rest? But their rest mass is 1200 MeV, but the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 1876 MeV, so they can't be at rest.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the center-of-mass energy. Let's try that.

First, compute the total energy and momentum in the lab frame. Proton at rest: energy E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV. Antiproton moving with velocity v, so its energy is E_ap = γ m_p c², and momentum p_ap = γ m_p v. Since the velocity is low, γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v²/c²), but if v is very small, γ ≈ 1. So total energy E_total = E_p + E_ap ≈ 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. Total momentum p_total ≈ m_p v. But since v is small, m_p v is small.

But in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. To find the center-of-mass energy, we can use the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. So s = (1876 MeV)^2 - (m_p v c)^2. But since v is small, the second term is negligible, so s ≈ (1876 MeV)^2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 1876 MeV.

In the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced with total energy 1876 MeV. Since each A has rest mass 300 MeV, the total rest mass energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the remaining energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy of the four A particles in the center-of-mass frame. If the kinetic energy is distributed equally, each A has 169 MeV, as before. Then, each A would have a total energy of 300 + 169 = 469 MeV, leading to a velocity of approximately 0.768c. But this is in the center-of-mass frame. However, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A. But in which frame? The problem doesn't specify, but since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame, and the proton is at rest, the lab frame is probably the frame where the answer is expected.

But wait, in the lab frame, the total momentum is not zero. So if the A particles are produced symmetrically, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite direction to balance the momentum? But the initial momentum is from the antiproton. If the A particles are produced isotropically in the center-of-mass frame, but then boosted to the lab frame, their velocities would vary. However, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated non-relativistically? But with velocities potentially being a significant fraction of the speed of light, that might not be appropriate. Let's check.

Given that the rest mass of A is 300 MeV, and the kinetic energy per A is around 169 MeV, which is more than half the rest mass, so relativistic effects are significant. So non-relativistic approximation is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the initial energy is 1876 MeV, and the four A particles have rest mass 1200 MeV, the remaining energy is 676 MeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. If all four A particles have the same speed, then each has kinetic energy 169 MeV. Then, using the relativistic kinetic energy formula:

K = (γ - 1)mc²

So 169 MeV = (γ - 1)*300 MeV

Therefore, γ - 1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.563

So γ ≈ 1.563

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64

Then, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096

Therefore, v²/c² ≈ 0.5904

v ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768c

So approximately 0.77c. But this is under the assumption that all four A particles have the same speed and direction, which might not be the case. However, in the center-of-mass frame, they would be moving symmetrically, but when transformed back to the lab frame, their velocities would differ. But since the initial momentum in the lab frame is small, maybe the velocity in the center-of-mass frame is approximately the velocity we're looking for? Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, another approach. Since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can approximate the reaction as happening at rest? Wait, but the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. If the antiproton's velocity is negligible, then effectively the total initial momentum is zero. But that can't be, since the antiproton is moving. Unless "slowly moving" is meant to imply that we can consider it at rest? Maybe the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in the center-of-mass frame. If we consider the proton and antiproton annihilating at rest, then the total energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV, and the four A particles must share this energy. Then, each A would have energy 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV. Then, using E = γmc², so γ = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, leading to v ≈ 0.768c as before. So maybe this is the answer.

But why does the problem mention that the antiproton is slowly moving? If they were both at rest, the center-of-mass frame would be the lab frame. But since the antiproton is moving, even slowly, the center-of-mass frame is different. But if the motion is slow, maybe the difference is negligible? So approximating the center-of-mass energy as 1876 MeV and each A particle having energy 469 MeV, leading to v ≈ 0.768c.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the exact center-of-mass energy considering the antiproton's motion. Let's try that.

The proton is at rest: energy E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV, momentum p_p = 0.

The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is p_ap = γ m_p v, and energy E_ap = γ m_p c².

Total energy E_total = E_p + E_ap = 938 + γ*938.

Total momentum p_total = p_ap = γ m_p v.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

So s = (938 + γ*938)^2 - (γ m_p v c)^2.

But m_p c² = 938 MeV, so m_p = 938 MeV / c².

Therefore, s = (938(1 + γ))^2 - (γ * (938 / c²) * v c)^2

Simplify the second term: (γ * 938 / c² * v c)^2 = (γ * 938 v / c)^2

Therefore, s = [938(1 + γ)]² - [938 γ v / c]^2

Factor out (938)^2:

s = (938)^2 [ (1 + γ)^2 - (γ v / c)^2 ]

But γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Let me compute this expression.

Let me denote β = v / c, so γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)

Then, s = (938)^2 [ (1 + γ)^2 - (γ β)^2 ]

Expand (1 + γ)^2:

1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² β²

So:

1 + 2γ + γ²(1 - β²)

But 1 - β² = 1 / γ², so:

1 + 2γ + γ²*(1 / γ²) = 1 + 2γ + 1 = 2 + 2γ

Therefore, s = (938)^2 * 2(1 + γ)

But wait, this seems interesting. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, expanding (1 + γ)^2 - (γ β)^2:

= 1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² β²

But γ² β² = γ² (1 - 1/γ²) = γ² - 1

Therefore, 1 + 2γ + γ² - (γ² - 1) = 1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² + 1 = 2 + 2γ

Therefore, s = (938)^2 * 2(1 + γ)

But s is also equal to (E_cm)^2, where E_cm is the total center-of-mass energy.

Therefore, E_cm = 938 * sqrt[2(1 + γ)]

But E_cm is also the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is the sum of the proton and antiproton energies in that frame.

But we need to relate γ to the velocity of the antiproton. However, since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, β is small, so γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)β². Therefore, 1 + γ ≈ 2 + (1/2)β². Then, sqrt[2(1 + γ)] ≈ sqrt[4 + β²] ≈ 2 + (β²)/4. Therefore, E_cm ≈ 938*(2 + (β²)/4). But the actual value of E_cm would be slightly larger than 2*938 MeV, but since β is small, the difference is negligible. Therefore, even if the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2*938 MeV, so the previous calculation holds.

Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has energy 469 MeV, leading to γ ≈ 1.563 and velocity ≈ 0.768c. Since the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, and considering that in the center-of-mass frame the particles would be moving symmetrically, but when transformed back to the lab frame, their velocities would be slightly different. However, given that the antiproton's velocity is very low, the boost between the center-of-mass frame and the lab frame is small, so the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately the same as in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.768c, which is about 0.77c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The rest mass of each A is 300 MeV/c². The antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has low kinetic energy. The total energy is approximately 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. The total rest mass of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Therefore, the available kinetic energy is 676 MeV. Assuming that this kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four A particles, each gets 169 MeV. Then, using K = (γ - 1)mc², solving for γ, then finding v. As done before, leading to v ≈ 0.768c. So this seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the kinetic energy isn't distributed equally, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular distribution, equal distribution is a reasonable assumption. Therefore, the velocity would be approximately 0.77c. To express the answer more precisely, let's compute it exactly.

Given K = 169 MeV, m = 300 MeV/c².

So γ = (K + mc²)/mc² = (169 + 300)/300 = 469/300 ≈ 1.563333...

Then γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563333 ≈ 0.6395

Then, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.6395² ≈ 0.4096

Therefore, v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904

v/c ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683

Thus, v ≈ 0.7683c. Rounding to two significant figures, since the mass is given as 300 MeV (two sig figs), the velocity would be approximately 0.77c. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of sqrt fractions or something else.

Alternatively, let's redo the calculation symbolically.

Given E_total = 2m_p c² (assuming negligible kinetic energy), and the rest mass of each A is m_A c² = 300 MeV.

Total energy available: 2m_p c² = 4γm_A c²

Therefore, γ = (2m_p c²) / (4m_A c²) = m_p / (2m_A) = 938 / (2*300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563

Then, γ = 1.563, so v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 1/2.442) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 0.4096) ≈ c * sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768c.

Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77c. So the answer is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But wait, this approach assumes that all the energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles, which is correct. But in reality, the total energy is distributed between rest mass and kinetic energy. However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular constraints on the momentum, assuming that all A particles have the same speed is a simplification, but perhaps necessary to solve the problem.

Alternatively, if the four A particles are produced at rest, their total energy would be 1200 MeV, but the initial energy is 1876 MeV, so that's impossible. Therefore, they must have kinetic energy. The simplest assumption is that they share the kinetic energy equally, leading to the velocity calculated above.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 0.77c. To check if this is correct, let's see if there's another method.

Alternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum.

In the lab frame:

Initial momentum: p_initial = p_antiproton = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, γ ≈ 1)

Final momentum: sum of momenta of the four A particles. Each A has momentum γ_A m_A v_A. Assuming symmetry, maybe two A⁺ and two A⁻ are emitted in opposite directions. For simplicity, suppose two A's move in the direction of the initial antiproton motion and two in the opposite direction. Then, the total momentum would be 2γ_A m_A v_A - 2γ_A m_A v_A = 0. But that contradicts the initial momentum. Therefore, maybe they are all moving in the same direction? But that would give a large momentum. Alternatively, the two pairs are moving in directions that balance the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are emitted isotropically, but given that the initial momentum is small, the net momentum of the A particles must be equal to the initial momentum. So, the A particles have a small net momentum in the direction of the antiproton's initial motion. However, calculating this would require more detailed knowledge of the distribution of their velocities, which is not provided. Therefore, the problem must be assuming some symmetry or that the velocity is calculated in the center-of-mass frame.

Given that, maybe the velocity in the center-of-mass frame is the answer. Since in the center-of-mass frame, the velocity can be calculated as above, leading to 0.77c, and since the problem might be expecting that answer, I think that's the way to go.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. To express this as a numerical value, v ≈ 0.77c. Converting to a fraction, sqrt(0.59) is approximately 0.768, which is roughly 0.77. So the answer is approximately 0.77c. Since the problem might want an exact answer, but given the approximated steps, 0.77c is reasonable.

Alternatively, let's compute it more precisely.

Given γ = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...

Compute 1/γ² ≈ 1/(1.563333)^2 ≈ 1/2.444 ≈ 0.4095

Then 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905

sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7684

So v ≈ 0.7684c. Rounding to two decimal places, 0.77c. Alternatively, if the question expects three significant figures, it would be 0.768c, but since the given mass is 300 MeV (two sig figs), 0.77c is appropriate.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.


**Final Answer**
The velocity of particle \( A \) is \boxed{0.77c}.

But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame. Wait, no. The center-of-mass frame would have the total momentum of the proton and antiproton. Since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-mass frame would be moving relative to the lab frame. But if the antiproton\'s velocity is very low, the center-of-mass frame would be moving at a velocity much less than c. Let me check.\n\nThe velocity of the center-of-mass (COM) frame can be found using the formula:\n\nv_COM = (p_initial) / (E_total / c²)\n\nHere, p_initial is the momentum of the antiproton, which is γ m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v. The total energy E_total is the sum of the proton\'s rest energy (m_p c²) and the antiproton\'s energy (γ m_p c²). Again, since v is small, γ ≈ 1, so E_total ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, v_COM ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p) ) c² / c² ) = v / 2. So the COM frame is moving at v/2 relative to the lab frame (proton\'s rest frame). But since the antiproton\'s velocity is very low, the COM frame velocity is even lower. This suggests that in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, and the annihilation products would be emitted symmetrically. However, the problem is asking for the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame. If in the COM frame the A particles are at rest, then their velocity in the lab frame would be the COM velocity, which is v/2. But that can\'t be right because the COM frame would have some velocity, and the particles would have velocities relative to that. Wait, maybe I need to approach this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to neglect the initial antiproton\'s momentum because it\'s moving slowly. If that\'s the case, then the total initial momentum is approximately zero, and the annihilation products must have zero net momentum. Therefore, the four A particles would be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But each A particle has the same mass, so they might be emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. However, with four particles, perhaps they are emitted symmetrically in all directions, but for maximum simplicity, maybe they are emitted in two pairs moving in opposite directions along the same line.\n\nBut even so, if they are moving in opposite directions with the same speed, their momenta would cancel. But then the kinetic energy would be split among them. Let\'s proceed under the assumption that the initial momentum is negligible, so the total momentum is zero. Then, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. If all four particles are moving with the same speed but in directions that cancel each other\'s momenta, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite. However, this would require that each pair has momentum vectors that cancel. Alternatively, they could be emitted in a symmetric configuration, like a tetrahedron, but that\'s more complicated. For simplicity, let\'s assume that each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moves in opposite directions. But since there are two pairs, maybe each pair has the same speed but opposite directions. Wait, but with four particles, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed. Then the total momentum would be zero. But in that case, each A particle would have some kinetic energy. Let\'s model this.\n\nThe total energy would then be the sum of the rest energy and kinetic energy of the four A particles. The initial energy is 1876 MeV. The rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so total rest energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining 676 MeV is the total kinetic energy. If each A has the same kinetic energy, then each would have 676/4 = 169 MeV. The total energy of each A would then be 300 + 169 = 469 MeV.\n\nNow, the total energy of a particle is given by γmc², where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So for each A particle:\n\nγ = E / (m c²) = 469 MeV / 300 MeV ≈ 1.5633\n\nThen, solving for velocity:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n1/γ² = 1 - v²/c²\n\nv²/c² = 1 - 1/γ²\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2)\n\nCalculating 1.5633^2 ≈ 2.444\n\nSo 1 - 1/2.444 ≈ 1 - 0.409 ≈ 0.591\n\nv ≈ c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769 ≈ 0.77c\n\nBut wait, this calculation assumes that each A particle has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. However, this approach assumes that the initial momentum is zero, which might not be the case because the antiproton was moving, albeit slowly. If the initial momentum isn\'t zero, then the final momentum of the A particles must balance the initial momentum. However, if the antiproton\'s momentum is negligible, perhaps the approximation holds. But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the energy from the proton and antiproton annihilation is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles. But the initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy, 676 MeV, is the total kinetic energy. However, if we consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the initial momentum is zero (since the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta), but in reality, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame isn\'t the COM frame. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the lab frame is approximately the proton\'s rest frame, and the COM frame is moving with velocity v/2 as calculated before. However, maybe the problem wants us to consider that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the entire energy is the rest energy of the proton and antiproton, and the A particles are produced at rest. But that can\'t be, because then their velocity would be zero, which contradicts the need for kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a threshold calculation, but since the reaction is already possible (since energy is sufficient), perhaps we need to compute based on conservation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the initial momentum is negligible. Let\'s re-examine. The problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might imply that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. But even a small momentum might affect the final result. Let me consider the exact conservation equations.\n\nIn the lab frame (proton at rest), the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + E_{\\bar{p}}, where E_{\\bar{p}} is the total energy of the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy K_{\\bar{p}} is much less than m_p c², so E_{\\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c² + K_{\\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c². Therefore, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.\n\nThe total initial momentum is p_initial = p_{\\bar{p}} = γ m_p v. Since the velocity is low, γ ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v. But m_p c² is 938 MeV, so m_p c = 938 MeV / c. Therefore, p_initial c ≈ m_p v c = (938 MeV/c) * v. If v is, say, 0.1c, then p_initial c ≈ 93.8 MeV, which is non-negligible. Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe v is small enough that p_initial is negligible. However, without knowing the exact velocity, perhaps we can\'t proceed. But the problem doesn\'t give the velocity of the antiproton, only that it\'s slowly moving. So maybe it\'s intended to assume that the initial momentum is negligible, and thus the final total momentum is zero. Then, the four A particles are produced at rest? But that can\'t be because their rest mass is only 1200 MeV, and the initial energy is 1876 MeV, so there\'s 676 MeV of kinetic energy. So they must be moving.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero, the kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles. Then, in that frame, the four A particles would have velocities. Then, transforming back to the lab frame (proton\'s rest frame) would require considering the velocity of the COM frame. Let\'s try this approach.\n\nFirst, find the velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab frame. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum in the lab frame is p_lab = γ m_p v.\n\nThe velocity of the COM frame, u, is given by:\n\nu = (p_lab c²) / (E_lab)\n\nSince the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so E_lab ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c², and p_lab ≈ m_p v. Therefore:\n\nu ≈ (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v / 2\n\nSo the COM frame moves at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame. But since the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, we can take the limit as v approaches zero, making the COM frame approximately the lab frame. However, this might not be valid because even a small velocity could affect the result. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the velocity of the A particles in the COM frame, where the total momentum is zero, leading to symmetric emission of A particles. Then, their velocity in the COM frame would be determined by energy conservation, and then transformed back to the lab frame. Let\'s try this.\n\nIn the COM frame, the total energy is E_com = sqrt( (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 ) ). Let\'s compute that. E_lab = 2 m_p c² (approx), p_lab c ≈ m_p v c. So,\n\nE_com ≈ sqrt( (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v c)^2 ) ≈ 2 m_p c² * sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(4 c^2)) ≈ 2 m_p c² (1 - v^2/(8 c²)) )\n\nBut if v is very small, then E_com ≈ 2 m_p c². So in the COM frame, the energy available is approximately 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the four A particles is 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy in the COM frame is 676 MeV. If the A particles are emitted symmetrically with equal speed in opposite directions, each would have energy E_a = (1876 MeV)/4 = 469 MeV. Then, as before, each A particle\'s gamma factor is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633, leading to velocity ≈ 0.77c. Then, transforming this velocity back to the lab frame. Wait, but if the COM frame is moving at u = v/2 relative to the lab frame, and the A particles are moving at velocity w in the COM frame, then their velocity in the lab frame would be (u + w)/(1 + u w / c²). But since u is very small (because v is small), this would be approximately u + w. However, if the A particles are moving at 0.77c in the COM frame, then their lab frame velocity would be approximately u + 0.77c. But u is v/2, which is very small, so approximately 0.77c. But this seems contradictory because if the COM frame is moving at u, then the A particles moving in the same direction as the COM frame would have velocity u + w, and those moving opposite would have u - w. However, since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can take u as negligible, so the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame is approximately their velocity in the COM frame, which is 0.77c. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 0.77c.\n\nBut wait, this approach assumes that the COM frame is moving at a negligible velocity compared to the A particles\' velocity. However, if the COM frame\'s velocity is non-negligible, we need to perform the velocity addition properly. Let\'s check with actual numbers. Suppose the antiproton is moving at v = 0.1c. Then, u = v/2 = 0.05c. The A particles in the COM frame are moving at w = 0.77c. Then, in the lab frame, their velocity would be (0.05c + 0.77c)/(1 + (0.05c)(0.77c)/c²) = (0.82c)/(1 + 0.0385) ≈ 0.82c / 1.0385 ≈ 0.79c. But since the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," maybe v is much smaller than 0.1c, making u negligible. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame is approximately 0.77c, which is about 0.77 times the speed of light. However, this is under the assumption that all four A particles have the same speed, which might not necessarily be the case. But without more information, this is a reasonable assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. Let\'s consider that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ ≈ 1). The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v.\n\nAfter annihilation, the four A particles must have total energy E_total = 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming they all move in the same direction as the initial antiproton\'s motion). But this can\'t be right because momentum is a vector, and if they are moving in different directions, the total momentum would be the sum of their individual momenta. However, if they are moving in pairs in opposite directions, their momenta could cancel. But since the initial momentum is non-zero, they must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum. However, if the initial momentum is small, perhaps the velocities of the A particles are such that their momenta sum to p_initial.\n\nLet\'s attempt this. Suppose that two A particles move in the direction of the initial antiproton\'s motion (let\'s say the +x direction) and two move in the opposite direction. Let their velocities be v₁ and v₂ respectively. Then, the total momentum would be 2 γ₁ m_A v₁ - 2 γ₂ m_A v₂ = p_initial ≈ m_p v.\n\nThe total energy would be 2 γ₁ m_A c² + 2 γ₂ m_A c² = E_total ≈ 2 m_p c².\n\nBut this introduces two variables (v₁ and v₂) which complicates things. Perhaps to simplify, assume all four particles move in the same direction. Then, their total momentum would be 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v. But then the energy would be 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Let\'s see if this is possible.\n\nFrom the energy equation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → γ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.\n\nWhich matches the earlier value. Then, solving for v_A:\n\nγ_A = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)) → v_A ≈ 0.77c as before.\n\nBut then the momentum from this would be 4 γ_A m_A v_A = 4 * 1.5633 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.77c = 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.77 MeV/c.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1.5633 * 300 = 468.99 ≈ 469 MeV/c²\n\n469 MeV/c² * 0.77c = 469 * 0.77 MeV/c ≈ 361.13 MeV/c\n\nMultiply by 4: 4 * 361.13 ≈ 1444.5 MeV/c\n\nBut the initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v = (938 MeV/c²) * v. If p_initial must equal 1444.5 MeV/c, then:\n\nv = (1444.5 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/c²) ) ≈ 1.54c\n\nBut this is impossible, as velocity cannot exceed c. Therefore, this assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is invalid because it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption that all particles move in the same direction is wrong. Hence, the particles must move in such a way that their momenta partially cancel, allowing the net momentum to match the initial small p_initial.\n\nThis suggests that the problem might require a different approach. Let\'s consider that the initial momentum is negligible (p_initial ≈ 0). Then, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. In this case, they would be emitted symmetrically. For simplicity, assume two pairs moving in opposite directions with speed v. Each pair contributes zero net momentum. Then, the total energy would be 4 * γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Solving for γ:\n\nγ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633, leading to v ≈ 0.77c as before. This would be the velocity in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. But since the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, we need to consider the velocity transformation. However, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame, and the velocity of the A particles would be approximately 0.77c. This seems plausible, and since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, this approximation might be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A would be approximately 0.77c. To express this more precisely, let\'s compute it accurately.\n\nGiven γ = 1.5633:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2)\n\nCalculate 1.5633^2 = (1.5)^2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + (0.0633)^2 ≈ 2.25 + 0.1899 + 0.004 ≈ 2.4439\n\nSo 1/2.4439 ≈ 0.409\n\nThus, 1 - 0.409 = 0.591\n\nsqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688\n\nTherefore, v ≈ 0.7688c ≈ 0.77c\n\nExpressed as a fraction of the speed of light, this is approximately 0.77c. To check if this makes sense, the kinetic energy per particle is (γ - 1) m_A c² = (0.5633) * 300 MeV ≈ 169 MeV, which matches the earlier calculation. The total kinetic energy is 4 * 169 ≈ 676 MeV, which accounts for the remaining energy after rest mass, so this checks out.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe velocity of particle \\( A \\) is \\(\\boxed{0.77c}\\).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389857, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5290, prompt_tokens=530, total_tokens=5820, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the velocity of particle \( A \) produced in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), we start by considering the conservation of energy and momentum. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. 

The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The rest energy of the four \( A \) particles is:
\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The remaining energy is the total kinetic energy of the \( A \) particles:
\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Assuming the kinetic energy is equally distributed among the four \( A \) particles, each particle has:
\[
E_{\text{kinetic per } A} = \frac{676 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The total energy of each \( A \) particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) for each \( A \) particle is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469 \, \text{MeV}}{300 \, \text{MeV}} \approx 1.5633
\]

Using the relationship between \( \gamma \) and velocity \( v \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Solving for \( v \):
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 1.5633 \):
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - 0.409} \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c
\]

Thus, the velocity of particle \( A \) is \(\boxed{0.77c}\).

However, this seems complex because the four particles could have different velocities. To simplify, perhaps the problem assumes that all four A particles are emitted symmetrically with the same speed. If so, their momentum vectors would cancel out, but since the initial momentum was non-zero (from the antiproton), this might not hold.

Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is small enough that the final momenta of the A particles can be considered to cancel each other out. But this might not be possible unless they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. Since there are two positive and two negative A particles, perhaps they are produced in pairs such that their total momentum cancels.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, the momentum is zero, and each A particle has the same speed. Then, when transforming back to the lab frame (where the antiproton is moving), the velocities would adjust accordingly. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame. Wait, no. The center-of-mass frame would have the total momentum of the proton and antiproton. Since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-mass frame would be moving relative to the lab frame. But if the antiproton's velocity is very low, the center-of-mass frame would be moving at a velocity much less than c. Let me check.

The velocity of the center-of-mass (COM) frame can be found using the formula:

v_COM = (p_initial) / (E_total / c²)

Here, p_initial is the momentum of the antiproton, which is γ m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v. The total energy E_total is the sum of the proton's rest energy (m_p c²) and the antiproton's energy (γ m_p c²). Again, since v is small, γ ≈ 1, so E_total ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, v_COM ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p) ) c² / c² ) = v / 2. So the COM frame is moving at v/2 relative to the lab frame (proton's rest frame). But since the antiproton's velocity is very low, the COM frame velocity is even lower. This suggests that in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, and the annihilation products would be emitted symmetrically. However, the problem is asking for the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame. If in the COM frame the A particles are at rest, then their velocity in the lab frame would be the COM velocity, which is v/2. But that can't be right because the COM frame would have some velocity, and the particles would have velocities relative to that. Wait, maybe I need to approach this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to neglect the initial antiproton's momentum because it's moving slowly. If that's the case, then the total initial momentum is approximately zero, and the annihilation products must have zero net momentum. Therefore, the four A particles would be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But each A particle has the same mass, so they might be emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. However, with four particles, perhaps they are emitted symmetrically in all directions, but for maximum simplicity, maybe they are emitted in two pairs moving in opposite directions along the same line.

But even so, if they are moving in opposite directions with the same speed, their momenta would cancel. But then the kinetic energy would be split among them. Let's proceed under the assumption that the initial momentum is negligible, so the total momentum is zero. Then, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. If all four particles are moving with the same speed but in directions that cancel each other's momenta, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite. However, this would require that each pair has momentum vectors that cancel. Alternatively, they could be emitted in a symmetric configuration, like a tetrahedron, but that's more complicated. For simplicity, let's assume that each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moves in opposite directions. But since there are two pairs, maybe each pair has the same speed but opposite directions. Wait, but with four particles, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed. Then the total momentum would be zero. But in that case, each A particle would have some kinetic energy. Let's model this.

The total energy would then be the sum of the rest energy and kinetic energy of the four A particles. The initial energy is 1876 MeV. The rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so total rest energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining 676 MeV is the total kinetic energy. If each A has the same kinetic energy, then each would have 676/4 = 169 MeV. The total energy of each A would then be 300 + 169 = 469 MeV.

Now, the total energy of a particle is given by γmc², where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So for each A particle:

γ = E / (m c²) = 469 MeV / 300 MeV ≈ 1.5633

Then, solving for velocity:

γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)

1/γ² = 1 - v²/c²

v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ²

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2)

Calculating 1.5633^2 ≈ 2.444

So 1 - 1/2.444 ≈ 1 - 0.409 ≈ 0.591

v ≈ c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769 ≈ 0.77c

But wait, this calculation assumes that each A particle has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. However, this approach assumes that the initial momentum is zero, which might not be the case because the antiproton was moving, albeit slowly. If the initial momentum isn't zero, then the final momentum of the A particles must balance the initial momentum. However, if the antiproton's momentum is negligible, perhaps the approximation holds. But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the energy from the proton and antiproton annihilation is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles. But the initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy, 676 MeV, is the total kinetic energy. However, if we consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the initial momentum is zero (since the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta), but in reality, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame isn't the COM frame. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the lab frame is approximately the proton's rest frame, and the COM frame is moving with velocity v/2 as calculated before. However, maybe the problem wants us to consider that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the entire energy is the rest energy of the proton and antiproton, and the A particles are produced at rest. But that can't be, because then their velocity would be zero, which contradicts the need for kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a threshold calculation, but since the reaction is already possible (since energy is sufficient), perhaps we need to compute based on conservation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the initial momentum is negligible. Let's re-examine. The problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might imply that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. But even a small momentum might affect the final result. Let me consider the exact conservation equations.

In the lab frame (proton at rest), the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + E_{\bar{p}}, where E_{\bar{p}} is the total energy of the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy K_{\bar{p}} is much less than m_p c², so E_{\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c² + K_{\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c². Therefore, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

The total initial momentum is p_initial = p_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p v. Since the velocity is low, γ ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v. But m_p c² is 938 MeV, so m_p c = 938 MeV / c. Therefore, p_initial c ≈ m_p v c = (938 MeV/c) * v. If v is, say, 0.1c, then p_initial c ≈ 93.8 MeV, which is non-negligible. Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe v is small enough that p_initial is negligible. However, without knowing the exact velocity, perhaps we can't proceed. But the problem doesn't give the velocity of the antiproton, only that it's slowly moving. So maybe it's intended to assume that the initial momentum is negligible, and thus the final total momentum is zero. Then, the four A particles are produced at rest? But that can't be because their rest mass is only 1200 MeV, and the initial energy is 1876 MeV, so there's 676 MeV of kinetic energy. So they must be moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero, the kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles. Then, in that frame, the four A particles would have velocities. Then, transforming back to the lab frame (proton's rest frame) would require considering the velocity of the COM frame. Let's try this approach.

First, find the velocity of the COM frame relative to the lab frame. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum in the lab frame is p_lab = γ m_p v.

The velocity of the COM frame, u, is given by:

u = (p_lab c²) / (E_lab)

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so E_lab ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c², and p_lab ≈ m_p v. Therefore:

u ≈ (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v / 2

So the COM frame moves at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame. But since the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, we can take the limit as v approaches zero, making the COM frame approximately the lab frame. However, this might not be valid because even a small velocity could affect the result. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the velocity of the A particles in the COM frame, where the total momentum is zero, leading to symmetric emission of A particles. Then, their velocity in the COM frame would be determined by energy conservation, and then transformed back to the lab frame. Let's try this.

In the COM frame, the total energy is E_com = sqrt( (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 ) ). Let's compute that. E_lab = 2 m_p c² (approx), p_lab c ≈ m_p v c. So,

E_com ≈ sqrt( (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v c)^2 ) ≈ 2 m_p c² * sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(4 c^2)) ≈ 2 m_p c² (1 - v^2/(8 c²)) )

But if v is very small, then E_com ≈ 2 m_p c². So in the COM frame, the energy available is approximately 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the four A particles is 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy in the COM frame is 676 MeV. If the A particles are emitted symmetrically with equal speed in opposite directions, each would have energy E_a = (1876 MeV)/4 = 469 MeV. Then, as before, each A particle's gamma factor is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633, leading to velocity ≈ 0.77c. Then, transforming this velocity back to the lab frame. Wait, but if the COM frame is moving at u = v/2 relative to the lab frame, and the A particles are moving at velocity w in the COM frame, then their velocity in the lab frame would be (u + w)/(1 + u w / c²). But since u is very small (because v is small), this would be approximately u + w. However, if the A particles are moving at 0.77c in the COM frame, then their lab frame velocity would be approximately u + 0.77c. But u is v/2, which is very small, so approximately 0.77c. But this seems contradictory because if the COM frame is moving at u, then the A particles moving in the same direction as the COM frame would have velocity u + w, and those moving opposite would have u - w. However, since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can take u as negligible, so the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame is approximately their velocity in the COM frame, which is 0.77c. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 0.77c.

But wait, this approach assumes that the COM frame is moving at a negligible velocity compared to the A particles' velocity. However, if the COM frame's velocity is non-negligible, we need to perform the velocity addition properly. Let's check with actual numbers. Suppose the antiproton is moving at v = 0.1c. Then, u = v/2 = 0.05c. The A particles in the COM frame are moving at w = 0.77c. Then, in the lab frame, their velocity would be (0.05c + 0.77c)/(1 + (0.05c)(0.77c)/c²) = (0.82c)/(1 + 0.0385) ≈ 0.82c / 1.0385 ≈ 0.79c. But since the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," maybe v is much smaller than 0.1c, making u negligible. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame is approximately 0.77c, which is about 0.77 times the speed of light. However, this is under the assumption that all four A particles have the same speed, which might not necessarily be the case. But without more information, this is a reasonable assumption.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ ≈ 1). The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v.

After annihilation, the four A particles must have total energy E_total = 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming they all move in the same direction as the initial antiproton's motion). But this can't be right because momentum is a vector, and if they are moving in different directions, the total momentum would be the sum of their individual momenta. However, if they are moving in pairs in opposite directions, their momenta could cancel. But since the initial momentum is non-zero, they must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum. However, if the initial momentum is small, perhaps the velocities of the A particles are such that their momenta sum to p_initial.

Let's attempt this. Suppose that two A particles move in the direction of the initial antiproton's motion (let's say the +x direction) and two move in the opposite direction. Let their velocities be v₁ and v₂ respectively. Then, the total momentum would be 2 γ₁ m_A v₁ - 2 γ₂ m_A v₂ = p_initial ≈ m_p v.

The total energy would be 2 γ₁ m_A c² + 2 γ₂ m_A c² = E_total ≈ 2 m_p c².

But this introduces two variables (v₁ and v₂) which complicates things. Perhaps to simplify, assume all four particles move in the same direction. Then, their total momentum would be 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v. But then the energy would be 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Let's see if this is possible.

From the energy equation:

4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → γ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.

Which matches the earlier value. Then, solving for v_A:

γ_A = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)) → v_A ≈ 0.77c as before.

But then the momentum from this would be 4 γ_A m_A v_A = 4 * 1.5633 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.77c = 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.77 MeV/c.

Calculating:

1.5633 * 300 = 468.99 ≈ 469 MeV/c²

469 MeV/c² * 0.77c = 469 * 0.77 MeV/c ≈ 361.13 MeV/c

Multiply by 4: 4 * 361.13 ≈ 1444.5 MeV/c

But the initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v = (938 MeV/c²) * v. If p_initial must equal 1444.5 MeV/c, then:

v = (1444.5 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/c²) ) ≈ 1.54c

But this is impossible, as velocity cannot exceed c. Therefore, this assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is invalid because it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption that all particles move in the same direction is wrong. Hence, the particles must move in such a way that their momenta partially cancel, allowing the net momentum to match the initial small p_initial.

This suggests that the problem might require a different approach. Let's consider that the initial momentum is negligible (p_initial ≈ 0). Then, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. In this case, they would be emitted symmetrically. For simplicity, assume two pairs moving in opposite directions with speed v. Each pair contributes zero net momentum. Then, the total energy would be 4 * γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Solving for γ:

γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633, leading to v ≈ 0.77c as before. This would be the velocity in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. But since the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, we need to consider the velocity transformation. However, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame, and the velocity of the A particles would be approximately 0.77c. This seems plausible, and since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, this approximation might be acceptable.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A would be approximately 0.77c. To express this more precisely, let's compute it accurately.

Given γ = 1.5633:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2)

Calculate 1.5633^2 = (1.5)^2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + (0.0633)^2 ≈ 2.25 + 0.1899 + 0.004 ≈ 2.4439

So 1/2.4439 ≈ 0.409

Thus, 1 - 0.409 = 0.591

sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688

Therefore, v ≈ 0.7688c ≈ 0.77c

Expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, this is approximately 0.77c. To check if this makes sense, the kinetic energy per particle is (γ - 1) m_A c² = (0.5633) * 300 MeV ≈ 169 MeV, which matches the earlier calculation. The total kinetic energy is 4 * 169 ≈ 676 MeV, which accounts for the remaining energy after rest mass, so this checks out.

Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.


**Final Answer**
The velocity of particle \( A \) is \(\boxed{0.77c}\).
