To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy required for the pair production process \(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\). 

1. **Threshold Energy Calculation**:
   - The invariant squared energy \(s\) for the photon-photon interaction must be at least \((2m_e c^2)^2\), where \(m_e\) is the electron mass.
   - For two photons with energies \(E_\gamma\) (gamma-ray) and \(\epsilon\) (CMB photon) colliding head-on, the invariant \(s\) is given by:
     \[
     s = 4 E_\gamma \epsilon
     \]
   - Setting \(s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2\), we get:
     \[
     4 E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (2m_e c^2)^2
     \]
   - Solving for \(E_\gamma\):
     \[
     E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 \epsilon} = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}
     \]

2. **Substituting Values**:
   - The rest mass energy of the electron \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV}\).
   - The average energy of the CMB photon \(\epsilon = 10^{-3} \text{ eV}\).
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}}
     \]
   - Calculating the numerator:
     \[
     (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261121 \times 10^{12} \text{ eV}^2
     \]
   - Dividing by \(10^{-3} \text{ eV}\):
     \[
     E_\gamma \geq \frac{0.261121 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \text{ eV} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}
     \]

3. **Approximation and Final Answer**:
   - The calculated threshold energy is approximately \(2.61 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}\), which is approximately 261 TeV.
   - Given the problem's context and significant figures, the answer is rounded to an order of magnitude, resulting in:

\[
\boxed{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process of annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about this process.

First, I remember that high-energy gamma-rays traveling through the universe can interact with photons from the CMB. If the combined energy of the gamma-ray photon and the CMB photon is sufficient, they can annihilate to form an electron-positron pair. This process would effectively remove the gamma-ray from existence, hence limiting its lifetime in the universe.

The key here is the threshold energy required for this pair production to happen. I think the condition involves the rest mass energy of the electron (and positron, but since they are the same, just twice the electron mass). The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is much lower. So the gamma-ray photon needs to have a high enough energy such that when combined with the low-energy CMB photon, the total energy exceeds the rest mass energy required for pair production.

But how exactly is the threshold calculated? Let me recall the formula. In pair production, the minimum energy required is when the two photons collide head-on, and their combined energy in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the electron rest mass energy. But since the CMB photon has a very low energy compared to the gamma-ray, maybe we can approximate their interaction in a frame where the gamma-ray is highly energetic, and the CMB photon is like a soft photon.

Alternatively, using the invariant quantity for photon-photon interactions. The invariant squared energy s should be greater than or equal to (2m_e c^2)^2. The invariant s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. So for two photons moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors would be opposite. Let me think.

Suppose the high-energy gamma-ray has energy Eγ and the CMB photon has energy ε. If they collide head-on, then their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's set the gamma-ray moving in the +z direction and the CMB photon in the -z direction. Then, the 4-momenta would be:

For gamma-ray: (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ/c)
For CMB photon: (ε, 0, 0, -ε/c)

Then, the total energy is Eγ + ε, and the total momentum is Eγ/c - ε/c. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 c^2 / c^2, which simplifies to (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Wait, but units here might be tricky. Let's work in natural units where c=1 to simplify.

In natural units, the 4-momenta are (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ) and (ε, 0, 0, -ε). Then the total energy is Eγ + ε, and the total momentum is Eγ - ε in the z-direction. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Let's compute that:

s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = [Eγ^2 + 2 Eγ ε + ε^2] - [Eγ^2 - 2 Eγ ε + ε^2] = 4 Eγ ε.

So s = 4 Eγ ε. For pair production to occur, s must be at least (2 m_e)^2, since the rest mass of the electron-positron pair is 2 m_e. Therefore:

4 Eγ ε ≥ (2 m_e)^2

Then solving for Eγ:

Eγ ≥ (2 m_e)^2 / (4 ε) = (4 m_e^2) / (4 ε) = m_e^2 / ε.

So the threshold energy Eγ is m_e^2 / ε. Plugging in the numbers:

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c^2 = 0.511 × 10^6 eV. But since we are working in natural units where c=1, m_e = 0.511 MeV. Then m_e^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2. The energy ε is 10^-3 eV.

So Eγ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV).

Let me compute that. First, square 0.511 MeV:

(0.511)^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2.

Then divide by 10^-3 eV. But note that 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so 1 (MeV)^2 = 10^12 (eV)^2.

Therefore, 0.261121 (MeV)^2 = 0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2.

Divide by 10^-3 eV:

0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2 / 10^-3 eV = 0.261121 × 10^15 eV.

Convert that to eV:

0.261121 × 10^15 eV = 2.61121 × 10^14 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.

But wait, that's in eV. To express it in more standard units, maybe TeV? Since 1 TeV = 10^12 eV. So 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV. Approximately 260 TeV.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again step by step to be sure.

First, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. So m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². But in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), m_e is 0.511 MeV. So m_e^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2. Then ε is 10^-3 eV. So:

Eγ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^{-3} eV)

Compute numerator: 0.511^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2. 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so 1 (MeV)^2 = (10^6 eV)^2 = 10^{12} (eV)^2. Therefore, 0.261121 (MeV)^2 = 0.261121 × 10^{12} (eV)^2.

Divide by ε = 10^{-3} eV:

Eγ = 0.261121 × 10^{12} (eV)^2 / 10^{-3} eV = 0.261121 × 10^{15} eV = 2.61121 × 10^{14} eV.

Convert to TeV: 1 TeV = 10^{12} eV, so divide by 10^{12}:

2.61121 × 10^{14} eV / 10^{12} eV/TeV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.

So the threshold energy is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this threshold would be able to annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus limiting their lifetime in the universe.

But wait, the problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So this threshold energy is the energy above which gamma-rays would interact significantly with the CMB, leading to their annihilation. Therefore, the answer should be around 260 TeV. But let me check if there's a standard value for this.

From what I remember, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, but my calculation gave 260 TeV. Hmm. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV, but the typical photon energy is actually around k_B T, where T is the temperature of the CMB. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. Let me check what 2.7 K corresponds to in eV.

k_B is the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K. So k_B * T = 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 2.33 × 10^-4 eV. So that's about 0.000233 eV. The problem states the average photon energy is 10^-3 eV, which is about 4 times higher. Maybe the problem is using a different value, or considering the average energy in a different way. But since the problem explicitly says the average photon energy is 10^-3 eV, I should use that value.

Alternatively, perhaps the average energy is 3 times k_B T, but even then, 3 * 2.33e-4 eV ≈ 7e-4 eV, still not 1e-3. Anyway, the problem says 1e-3 eV, so proceed with that.

But let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the units.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so Eγ and ε are in energy units (eV), and m_e is also in energy units (eV). So the formula Eγ = m_e^2 / ε is correct.

Given m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. So m_e = 511,000 eV / c². But in natural units where c=1, m_e is 511,000 eV. So m_e^2 = (511,000)^2 (eV)^2.

Then ε = 1e-3 eV.

So Eγ = (511,000)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator: 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 10^10 = 26.1121 * 10^10 = 2.61121e11 (eV)^2.

Divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

Eγ = 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 eV = 2.61121e14 eV = 261.121 TeV.

Yes, that's correct. So approximately 260 TeV.

But I recall that the actual threshold for the CMB is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). Wait, why the discrepancy? Maybe because the CMB photon energy is lower? Wait, in reality, the average CMB photon energy is about 6e-4 eV (since k_B*T is about 0.00025 eV for 2.7 K, and average photon energy is ~2.7 k_B T). If the average photon energy is lower, then the threshold energy would be higher. But in this problem, the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is higher than the actual CMB's average photon energy, so the threshold would be lower. Wait, no. If the CMB photon energy is higher, then the required gamma-ray energy is lower. Since Eγ ~ m_e^2 / ε, so higher ε leads to lower Eγ. So if in reality, the average photon energy is lower (e.g., 6e-4 eV), then the threshold Eγ would be higher (around 400 TeV). But the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so the threshold would be about 260 TeV. However, in standard physics, the pair production threshold on CMB is around 100 TeV? Wait, perhaps I need to check.

Wait, let me check some references. For instance, the interaction length of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB becomes significant above ~10^14 eV (100 TeV). However, if I calculate using the CMB temperature of 2.7 K (which gives kT ~ 0.00025 eV), then the threshold energy would be:

Eγ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (0.00025 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 / 0.00025 eV = (2.61e11 eV^2) / 0.00025 eV = 1.04e15 eV = 1.04e3 TeV = ~1000 TeV. Wait, that's 1 PeV. But this contradicts my previous thought that the threshold is around 100 TeV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the cross-section for pair production is maximized when the product of the energies is around (m_e c^2)^2, but the actual interaction can happen at lower energies with a lower cross-section. So even though the threshold is at 260 TeV (for the given 1e-3 eV CMB photon), the cross-section becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray lifetime only at higher energies? Or maybe the calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed ~260 TeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average photon energy in a different way. Let me think again. The cross-section for gamma-gamma pair production depends on the photon energies and the angle between them. The threshold condition for head-on collision is the most favorable, so the minimum gamma-ray energy required is when the CMB photon is coming directly opposite. But the CMB photons have a blackbody distribution, so not all photons are at the average energy. However, the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so maybe they want us to use that value for epsilon.

Alternatively, maybe the average photon energy is not the right value to use here. The cross-section for pair production is dependent on the number density of target photons with sufficient energy. The threshold energy for a head-on collision is Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon * (1 - cos(theta))), where theta is the angle between the two photons. For head-on collisions, theta = pi, so 1 - cos(theta) = 2. Therefore, the threshold becomes Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (2 epsilon). Wait, this might be where I went wrong earlier. Let's check.

Yes, perhaps I forgot the factor of 1 - cos(theta). If the collision is not head-on, the threshold energy is higher. But the maximum cross-section occurs when the collision is head-on. So the minimal gamma-ray energy required is when theta = pi, so 1 - cos(theta) = 2. Therefore, the threshold energy is Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon * 2).

Wait, so perhaps in my previous calculation, I missed a factor of 2. Let's rederive the threshold condition properly.

The correct formula for the threshold condition for pair production is:

s ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2,

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons with energies E1 and E2, colliding at an angle theta, the invariant s is:

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos(theta)).

Therefore, the threshold condition is:

2 E1 E2 (1 - cos(theta)) ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

To find the minimum gamma-ray energy Eγ = E1, we need to consider the most favorable angle, which is theta = pi (head-on collision), so 1 - cos(theta) = 2. Then:

2 Eγ epsilon * 2 ≥ 4 m_e^2 c^4,

So 4 Eγ epsilon ≥ 4 m_e^2 c^4,

Dividing both sides by 4:

Eγ epsilon ≥ m_e^2 c^4.

Therefore, the threshold energy is Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon.

Wait, that's the same as before. So even considering the angle, when we take the head-on collision (which gives the minimal threshold), the formula is Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. So my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the threshold energy is indeed (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = ~261 TeV.

But why does this contradict my previous thought that the threshold is around 100 TeV? Let me check with the actual CMB parameters. If the CMB temperature is 2.7 K, then the average photon energy is about k_B T ~ 0.00025 eV. But the average energy of a blackbody photon is actually about 2.7 k_B T, which is ~0.0007 eV. So if we use 0.0007 eV as epsilon, then:

Eγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 0.0007 eV = (2.61e11 eV^2) / 0.0007 eV ≈ 3.73e14 eV = 373 TeV.

But in reality, the threshold for significant interaction is lower. Maybe because even though the average photon energy is 0.0007 eV, there are photons in the high-energy tail of the blackbody spectrum which have higher energies. So even if the average is low, the presence of higher-energy photons allows pair production at lower gamma-ray energies. Therefore, the calculation using the average energy might not be accurate.

But since the problem explicitly states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV, we should use that value. Therefore, proceeding with that, the threshold energy is 261 TeV. However, in standard references, the pair production threshold for CMB photons is often quoted as around 80 TeV. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me check an external source.

Wait, according to some sources, the threshold for pair production of high-energy photons with the CMB is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, this is known as the threshold for the "gamma-ray horizon," beyond which gamma-rays from distant sources are absorbed. But according to the calculation here, with epsilon = 1e-3 eV, we get 261 TeV. If we use the actual average CMB photon energy of ~0.0007 eV, the threshold would be (0.511e6)^2 / 0.0007 ≈ 373 TeV. But this is higher than the standard 100 TeV. What's going on?

Wait, maybe the cross-section is non-zero even below the threshold energy because of the distribution of photon energies and angles. Even if the average photon energy is low, some photons in the high-energy tail of the CMB can interact with the gamma-ray. Therefore, the effective threshold is lower. The calculation we did gives the minimum energy required for a head-on collision with a photon of energy epsilon, but in reality, there are photons with higher energies in the CMB, albeit fewer. Therefore, the actual threshold is determined by integrating over the CMB photon spectrum and considering all possible angles.

However, the problem asks: "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So it's likely referring to the energy above which the interaction becomes significant, which is determined by the peak of the cross-section or the effective optical depth. However, given that the problem provides the average photon energy, and asks for a calculation based on that, perhaps we are supposed to use the simple threshold formula.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the formula once more.

The threshold condition for pair production is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass. So:

sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c^2.

For two photons colliding at an angle theta, the invariant s is:

s = 2 E_gamma E_CMB (1 - cos(theta)).

Therefore:

2 E_gamma E_CMB (1 - cos(theta)) ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

To find the minimum E_gamma, we take theta = pi (head-on collision), so 1 - cos(theta) = 2:

2 E_gamma E_CMB * 2 ≥ 4 m_e^2 c^4,

Which simplifies to:

E_gamma ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.

Yes, so that's correct. So if E_CMB is 1e-3 eV, then:

E_gamma ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e12 eV = 2.61e11 eV = 261 TeV.

But in reality, the CMB has a range of photon energies following the blackbody spectrum. The number density of photons decreases exponentially at high energies, but there's still a non-zero number. Therefore, even though the average energy is low, the presence of higher energy photons in the tail allows pair production to occur at lower gamma-ray energies. Therefore, the effective threshold is lower than 261 TeV when considering the entire CMB spectrum.

However, since the problem specifies the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV, it's possible that we are meant to use this average value in the calculation, even though in reality the threshold would be different when considering the actual photon distribution.

Alternatively, the problem might be simplifying the scenario by using the average energy and head-on collision to estimate the threshold. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 260 TeV. But since the problem mentions "lifetimes in the universe limited by this process," it's referring to the energy above which the gamma-rays are likely to interact with the CMB within the age or size of the universe. This would depend on the cross-section and the density of CMB photons.

Wait, but maybe the question is simply asking for the threshold energy, not considering the interaction rate. If it's just the threshold, then the answer is 261 TeV. However, if it's about the energy where the interaction becomes significant (i.e., the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe), then the calculation is more involved and requires integrating over the CMB photon spectrum and the cross-section. But given the information provided, and the mention of average photon energy, I think the question is expecting the threshold energy calculation.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 260 TeV, or 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But let's write it properly.

First, express 0.511 MeV in eV: 0.511 × 10^6 eV.

Then, squared: (0.511 × 10^6)^2 = 0.261 × 10^12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261 × 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.

Convert to TeV: 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

So the threshold energy is about 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this would be able to produce electron-positron pairs via interaction with CMB photons, limiting their lifetime.

But let me check once more with another approach. The energy of the gamma-ray photon in the CMB photon's rest frame needs to be sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. But since the CMB photon is low energy, we can consider the gamma-ray's energy in the lab frame (which is the same as the CMB rest frame, approximately, since the CMB is isotropic). Wait, no, the CMB is isotropic, so we have to consider that photons are coming from all directions. But the most probable interaction is with photons moving in the opposite direction to the gamma-ray. So using the head-on collision approximation is still valid.

Alternatively, using the photon energy in the lab frame where the CMB is a bath of photons with energy 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray has energy E. To produce an electron-positron pair, the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2 m_e c^2. But the center-of-mass energy squared is s = 2 E epsilon (1 - cos(theta)). For head-on collision, theta = pi, so s = 4 E epsilon. Then s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, 4 E epsilon ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2, leading to E ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon) = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Which is the same as before. So yes, 261 TeV.

Therefore, I think the answer is 2.6 × 10^14 eV, or 260 TeV.

**Final Answer**
The energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is \boxed{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

Wait, but my calculation gave 261 TeV, which is 2.61 × 10^14 eV. But the answer is boxed as 2 × 10^14 eV. Maybe the problem expects an order-of-magnitude answer, or there's an approximation. Let me check the given average photon energy again. It says 10^-3 eV. If I use that, then 0.511 MeV is 0.511 × 10^6 eV. Squared is 0.261 × 10^12 eV². Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV. So 2.6 × 10^14 eV. Maybe the answer is written as 3 × 10^14 eV or 2 × 10^14 eV. But in the final answer above, it's written as 2 × 10^14 eV. Perhaps the original calculation approximates m_e c^2 as 0.5 MeV, then (0.5 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 eV = 2.5e14 eV, which is 250 TeV. So rounding to one significant figure, 3 × 10^14 eV, but the problem states the average photon energy as 10^-3 eV (one significant figure). So maybe the answer is 3 × 10^14 eV. But the calculation with 0.511 gives 2.6 × 10^14, which is approximately 3 × 10^14. Alternatively, if the question expects 1e14 eV (100 TeV), but that would be inconsistent with the given average energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation. Let me recompute with m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

So m_e c² = 0.511 × 10^6 eV.

Then (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 × 10^{12} (eV)^2 ≈ 0.261 × 10^{12} (eV)^2.

Divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

Eγ = 0.261 × 10^{12} / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 × 10^{15} eV = 2.61 × 10^{14} eV.

Yes, that's correct. So 2.6 × 10^14 eV. If the problem expects one significant figure, it would be 3 × 10^14 eV. But given that the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (one significant figure), then the answer should also be one significant figure, so 3 × 10^14 eV. However, the original calculation with more precise numbers gives 2.6 × 10^14, which is approximately 2.6e14. But the user's final answer was boxed as 2 × 10^14. Maybe the standard approximation is to use m_e c² = 0.5 MeV, leading to Eγ = (0.5 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e12 / 1e-3 = 0.25e15 = 2.5e14 ≈ 3e14. But perhaps the answer is commonly approximated as ~10^14 eV (100 TeV), but according to precise calculation here, it's ~260 TeV.

Wait, but 2.6 × 10^14 eV is 260 TeV, which is 2.6 × 10^2 TeV. However, in the final answer, the user wrote 2 × 10^14 eV, which is 200 TeV. Maybe that's an approximation. Alternatively, maybe the original solution expected using 1 MeV for m_e c², which would give (1 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 1e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 1e15 eV = 1e3 TeV = 1000 TeV, which is 1 PeV. But that doesn't align. I think the correct answer based on precise calculation is 2.6 × 10^14 eV, but given the problem's data, perhaps the intended answer is 1e14 eV (100 TeV). However, since the user's calculation arrived at 2.6 × 10^14 eV, but wrote 2 × 10^14 eV in the final answer, maybe there's a miscalculation or approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is significant enough that even below the threshold, the interaction can occur due to the spread in photon energies and angles, so the effective energy where the lifetime is limited is lower. However, without more detailed calculations involving the cross-section and photon spectrum, it's hard to say. Given the problem's simplicity, I think the intended answer is the threshold energy, which is approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But the user wrote 2 × 10^14 eV. Maybe rounding down. To match the problem's significant figures, since the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (one significant figure), the answer should be one significant figure, so 3 × 10^14 eV. But that's not what the user wrote. Alternatively, maybe the question expects m_e c² = 0.5 MeV, leading to (0.5e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 0.25e12 / 1e-3 = 0.25e15 = 2.5e14, which would be 2.5 × 10^14 eV, approximately 3 × 10^14 eV. But the user's final answer was 2 × 10^14 eV. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the process requires twice the energy? Wait, no, the threshold is for the combined energy. Wait, the invariant s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So s = 4 E_gamma epsilon ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So E_gamma ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon) = (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 epsilon) = m_e^2 c^4 / epsilon. Which is the same as before. So no, the calculation is correct.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 260 TeV or 2.6 × 10^14 eV. However, since the problem might expect an order of magnitude estimate, and given possible rounding, the answer is \boxed{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process of annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about this process.

First, I remember that high-energy gamma-rays traveling through the universe can interact with photons from the CMB. If the combined energy of the gamma-ray photon and the CMB photon is sufficient, they can annihilate to form an electron-positron pair. This process would effectively remove the gamma-ray from existence, hence limiting its lifetime in the universe.

The key here is the threshold energy required for this pair production to happen. I think the condition involves the rest mass energy of the electron (and positron, but since they are the same, just twice the electron mass). The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is much lower. So the gamma-ray photon needs to have a high enough energy such that when combined with the low-energy CMB photon, the total energy exceeds the rest mass energy required for pair production.

But how exactly is the threshold calculated? Let me recall the formula. In pair production, the minimum energy required is when the two photons collide head-on, and their combined energy in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the electron rest mass energy. But since the CMB photon has a very low energy compared to the gamma-ray, maybe we can approximate their interaction in a frame where the gamma-ray is highly energetic, and the CMB photon is like a soft photon.

Alternatively, using the invariant quantity for photon-photon interactions. The invariant squared energy s should be greater than or equal to (2m_e c^2)^2. The invariant s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. So for two photons moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors would be opposite. Let me think.

Suppose the high-energy gamma-ray has energy Eγ and the CMB photon has energy ε. If they collide head-on, then their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's set the gamma-ray moving in the +z direction and the CMB photon in the -z direction. Then, the 4-momenta would be:

For gamma-ray: (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ/c)
For CMB photon: (ε, 0, 0, -ε/c)

Then, the total energy is Eγ + ε, and the total momentum is Eγ/c - ε/c. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 c^2 / c^2, which simplifies to (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Wait, but units here might be tricky. Let's work in natural units where c=1 to simplify.

In natural units, the 4-momenta are (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ) and (ε, 0, 0, -ε). Then the total energy is Eγ + ε, and the total momentum is Eγ - ε in the z-direction. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2. Let's compute that:

s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = [Eγ^2 + 2 Eγ ε + ε^2] - [Eγ^2 - 2 Eγ ε + ε^2] = 4 Eγ ε.

So s = 4 Eγ ε. For pair production to occur, s must be at least (2 m_e)^2, since the rest mass of the electron-positron pair is 2 m_e. Therefore:

4 Eγ ε ≥ (2 m_e)^2

Then solving for Eγ:

Eγ ≥ (2 m_e)^2 / (4 ε) = (4 m_e^2) / (4 ε) = m_e^2 / ε.

So the threshold energy Eγ is m_e^2 / ε. Plugging in the numbers:

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c^2 = 0.511 × 10^6 eV. But since we are working in natural units where c=1, m_e = 0.511 MeV. Then m_e^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2. The energy ε is 10^-3 eV.

So Eγ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV).

Let me compute that. First, square 0.511 MeV:

(0.511)^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2.

Then divide by 10^-3 eV. But note that 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so 1 (MeV)^2 = 10^12 (eV)^2.

Therefore, 0.261121 (MeV)^2 = 0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2.

Divide by 10^-3 eV:

0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2 / 10^-3 eV = 0.261121 × 10^15 eV.

Convert that to eV:

0.261121 × 10^15 eV = 2.61121 × 10^14 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV.

But wait, that's in eV. To express it in more standard units, maybe TeV? Since 1 TeV = 10^12 eV. So 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV. Approximately 260 TeV.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again step by step to be sure.

First, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. So m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². But in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), m_e is 0.511 MeV. So m_e^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2. Then ε is 10^-3 eV. So:

Eγ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^{-3} eV)

Compute numerator: 0.511^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2. 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so 1 (MeV)^2 = (10^6 eV)^2 = 10^{12} (eV)^2. Therefore, 0.261121 (MeV)^2 = 0.261121 × 10^{12} (eV)^2.

Divide by ε = 10^{-3} eV:

Eγ = 0.261121 × 10^{12} (eV)^2 / 10^{-3} eV = 0.261121 × 10^{15} eV = 2.61121 × 10^{14} eV.

Convert to TeV: 1 TeV = 10^{12} eV, so divide by 10^{12}:

2.61121 × 10^{14} eV / 10^{12} eV/TeV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.

So the threshold energy is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this threshold would be able to annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus limiting their lifetime in the universe.

But wait, the problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So this threshold energy is the energy above which gamma-rays would interact significantly with the CMB, leading to their annihilation. Therefore, the answer should be around 260 TeV. But let me check if there's a standard value for this.

From what I remember, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, but my calculation gave 260 TeV. Hmm. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV, but the typical photon energy is actually around k_B T, where T is the temperature of the CMB. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. Let me check what 2.7 K corresponds to in eV.

k_B is the Boltzmann constant, which is appr

I need to determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes would be limited by annihilation with CMB photons, creating electron-positron pairs. The average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV. Let me think through this process.

High-energy gamma-rays traveling through the universe can interact with CMB photons. When their combined energy is sufficient, they can annihilate to form an electron-positron pair, effectively removing the gamma-ray from existence and limiting its cosmic lifetime.

For this pair production to occur, a threshold energy is required, involving the rest mass energy of the electron (0.511 MeV). Since the CMB photon energy (10^-3 eV) is much lower, the gamma-ray must have sufficient energy so that when combined with the CMB photon, their total energy exceeds the threshold for pair production.

To calculate this threshold, I'll consider when two photons collide head-on. The invariant squared energy s must exceed (2m_e c^2)^2. Using natural units where c=1, I can represent the 4-momenta as (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ) for the gamma-ray and (ε, 0, 0, -ε) for the CMB photon.

The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2, which simplifies to 4Eγε. For pair production, 4Eγε ≥ (2m_e)^2, which means Eγ ≥ m_e^2/ε.

Substituting the values: m_e = 0.511 MeV and ε = 10^-3 eV, I get:
Eγ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2/(10^-3 eV)

Computing this step by step:
(0.511)^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2
0.261121 (MeV)^2 = 0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2
0.261121 × 10^12 (eV)^2/10^-3 eV = 0.261121 × 10^15 eV = 2.61121 × 10^14 eV

Converting to TeV (1 TeV = 10^12 eV):
2.61121 × 10^14 eV/10^12 eV/TeV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV

Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by annihilation with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs.

I recall that the standard threshold value for this process is around 10^14 eV or 100 TeV, which differs from my calculation of 260 TeV. This discrepancy might be related to the actual photon energy distribution in the CMB, which follows a blackbody spectrum at temperature 2.7 K, rather than just using the average energy.

I need to determine the energy of gamma-rays that have their lifetimes limited by interacting with CMB photons, resulting in electron-positron pair production. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. To recall, gamma-rays can collide with CMB photons, and if their combined energy is enough, they can annihilate to form an electron-positron pair, removing the gamma-ray and thus limiting its lifetime in the universe.

The critical factor here is the threshold energy required for this process, which involves the electron's rest mass energy. The electron's rest mass energy is approximately 0.511 MeV. However, since the CMB photon energy is much lower at 10^-3 eV, the gamma-ray must have sufficient energy so that, together with the CMB photon, the energy surpasses that needed for pair production.

To understand how this threshold is calculated, consider that the minimum energy required happens when the two photons collide head-on, with their combined energy in the center-of-momentum frame being at least twice the electron's rest mass energy. This can be analyzed in a frame where the gamma-ray is highly energetic, and the CMB photon acts as a soft photon.

Using the invariant quantity for photon-photon interactions, the invariant squared energy s should be at least (2m_e c^2)^2. For photons, E = pc, so for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momentum vectors are opposite. Assuming the gamma-ray energy is Eγ, and the CMB photon energy is ε, with head-on collision, the 4-momenta are:

Gamma-ray: (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ/c)
CMB photon: (ε, 0, 0, -ε/c)

Thus, the total energy is Eγ + ε, and the total momentum is Eγ/c - ε/c. In natural units (c=1), the simplified invariant s becomes:

s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = 4 Eγ ε.

For pair production, s must be at least (2 m_e)^2, the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. So:

4 Eγ ε ≥ (2 m_e)^2

Solving for Eγ, we get:

Eγ ≥ (2 m_e)^2 / (4 ε) = m_e^2 / ε.

Plugging in the values:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV, and ε = 10^-3 eV. In natural units, m_e = 0.511 MeV, so m_e^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2. Then,

Eγ ≥ (0.511)^2 × 10^12 / 10^-3 = 0.261121 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

So, the threshold energy for this process is approximately 261 TeV, meaning gamma-rays with energies above this level can effectively interact with CMB photons and lead to their annihilation, thereby limiting their lifetimes in the universe.

So k_B * T = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 2.33e-4 eV. But the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is about 4 times higher. Maybe the problem is simplifying and using 10^-3 eV as an average, but in reality, the average energy might be a bit lower. However, since the problem gives 10^-3 eV, we should use that.\n\nBut let\'s see. If we use the actual average photon energy of the CMB, which is about 6.6e-4 eV (since average energy for blackbody is about 2.7 k_B T), then:\n\nEγ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (6.6e-4 eV) = (0.261e12 (eV)^2) / (6.6e-4 eV) = 0.261e12 / 6.6e-4 eV ≈ 3.95e14 eV ≈ 400 TeV.\n\nBut in the problem, it\'s given as 1e-3 eV. So using 1e-3 eV:\n\nEγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.511^2 * 1e12) eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nSo that\'s where the number comes from. However, in literature, I think the typical threshold quoted for pair production on the CMB is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is around 10^20 eV for cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons, but for photons, the cutoff is lower. Wait, but maybe I\'m mixing up different processes.\n\nWait, the GZK cutoff is for protons interacting with CMB photons to produce pions. For photons, the pair production process with CMB photons is the relevant one. The threshold energy for that is indeed around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV, but according to my calculation, with the given average photon energy of 1e-3 eV, it\'s about 260 TeV. Hmm. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe threshold condition is s ≥ (2m_e)^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons colliding head-on, s = 4 E ε, where E is the energy of the high-energy photon, and ε is the energy of the CMB photon. So solving for E:\n\nE ≥ (2m_e)^2 / (4 ε) = m_e^2 / ε.\n\nBut m_e is 0.511 MeV. So m_e^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 (eV)^2. Then divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:\n\nE ≥ 0.261e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nSo that\'s correct. However, in reality, the CMB photon energy is a distribution, not a single value. The average might be around 1e-3 eV, but there are photons with higher and lower energies. The threshold depends on the specific energy of the CMB photon. So the cross-section for the interaction peaks when the product E ε is around m_e^2. Therefore, even though the average energy is 1e-3 eV, the actual threshold for the highest energy photons that can interact would be lower. Wait, no. For a given CMB photon energy ε, the threshold E is m_e^2 / ε. So higher energy CMB photons would allow lower energy gamma-rays to pair produce. But since the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, there\'s a distribution. However, the problem states to use the average photon energy of 1e-3 eV, so we should use that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. But maybe in the problem, they expect a simpler calculation. Let me check if I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, the invariant s is 4 E ε in the case of head-on collision. Then s ≥ (2m_e)^2. So 4 E ε ≥ 4 m_e^2 → E ε ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E ≥ m_e^2 / ε. That seems correct.\n\nBut m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, but when we use natural units where c=1, m_e is in units of eV, and ε is in eV. So m_e = 0.511e6 eV. Then m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV². Epsilon is 1e-3 eV. So E ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV.\n\nCalculating:\n\n(0.511e6)^2 = 0.511² * 1e12 = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 (eV²). Then divide by 1e-3 eV:\n\n2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV. Which is 261 TeV. So that\'s correct.\n\nBut in some references, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is quoted as around 80 TeV. Wait, maybe they use the temperature of the CMB (2.7 K) corresponding to kT ~ 0.00023 eV, and then compute the threshold energy as ~m_e^2 / (kT) ~ (0.511e6)^2 / 0.00023e9 (since 0.00023 eV is 0.23e-3 eV). Wait, but let\'s compute that:\n\nm_e = 0.511e6 eV\n\nkT = 0.23e-3 eV\n\nE_threshold = (0.511e6)^2 / (0.23e-3) = (0.261e12) / (0.23e-3) = 0.261 / 0.23 * 1e15 = approx 1.135 * 1e15 eV = 1.135e15 eV = 1.135 PeV. Wait, that\'s even higher. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I\'m missing a factor here. Let me check. If the typical photon energy is taken as kT, then E_threshold = m_e^2 / (kT). But if the photon has energy kT, then:\n\nE_threshold = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (k*T) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² / (2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV) ≈ (0.261) * 1e12 / (2.326e-4) eV ≈ 0.261 / 2.326e-4 * 1e12 ≈ 0.112 * 1e16 ≈ 1.12e15 eV ≈ 1.1 PeV. But that contradicts the previous result. So there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion arises because in the blackbody spectrum, the average photon energy is not exactly kT. The average energy for a blackbody is approximately 2.7 kT. So if T = 2.7 K, then average energy is 2.7 * k_B * T = 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 6.3e-4 eV. So if the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is a bit higher than the actual average, but maybe it\'s a rough estimate.\n\nBut regardless, according to the problem, we are to use 1e-3 eV as the average photon energy, so we should proceed with that. Hence, E_threshold = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 261 TeV.\n\nHowever, when I look up literature, for example, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is often stated to be around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation in literature uses the CMB photon energy at the peak of the blackbody spectrum, which is about 1.6 kT. For T = 2.7 K, kT = 0.00023 eV, so peak energy is 1.6 * 0.00023 ≈ 0.00037 eV. Then the threshold energy would be (0.511e6)^2 / 0.00037e3 = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 0.00037 ≈ (0.261 * 1e12) / 0.00037 ≈ 0.261 / 0.00037 * 1e12 ≈ 705.4 * 1e12 ≈ 7e14 eV = 700 TeV. Hmm, that\'s even higher. But this contradicts the literature value.\n\nWait, maybe I\'m missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let\'s go back to the invariant s. The threshold condition is s ≥ (2m_e)^2. For a head-on collision, s = 4 E ε. So 4 E ε ≥ (2 m_e)^2 → E ε ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E ≥ m_e^2 / ε.\n\nBut if the photons are not colliding head-on, the effective s would be less. So the threshold energy would be higher for non-head-on collisions. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, the actual cross-section depends on the angle of collision. The maximum cross-section occurs when they collide head-on. Therefore, the minimum energy required is when they collide head-on, so the threshold energy is E_threshold = m_e^2 / ε.\n\nBut in reality, since the CMB photons are coming from all directions, the effective energy required for pair production is higher. Wait, but how is that calculated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section for the interaction is maximized when the photons collide head-on, but even for other angles, there is some contribution. Therefore, to compute the mean free path, you have to integrate over all possible angles and energies of the CMB photons. However, since the problem asks for the energy at which the lifetime is "limited" by this process, it\'s probably referring to the threshold energy above which the interaction becomes possible, i.e., the minimum gamma-ray energy required for pair production with the average CMB photon. But given that the CMB photon energy is a distribution, the threshold is not a sharp cutoff, but the interaction becomes significant around that energy.\n\nBut the problem states to use the average photon energy of the CMB, which is 1e-3 eV. Therefore, using that, the threshold energy is 261 TeV.\n\nBut why does literature often cite around 100 TeV? Let me check. For example, according to some sources, the threshold energy for pair production on the CMB is about 10^14 eV (100 TeV). Let me see the calculation.\n\nSuppose the CMB photon has energy 0.001 eV (as in the problem), then:\n\nE_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / 0.001 = 0.261e12 / 0.001 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV. So that\'s correct.\n\nBut if the CMB photon energy is taken as 0.0006 eV (which is closer to the actual average energy of ~0.0006 eV for a 2.7 K blackbody), then:\n\nE_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / 0.0006 = 0.261e12 / 0.0006 = 4.35e14 eV = 435 TeV.\n\nHmm. But that still doesn\'t get us to 100 TeV. Wait, maybe the confusion is because when considering the cross-section, even though the threshold is higher, the interaction can still happen with lower energy gamma-rays if there are higher energy CMB photons. But since the CMB has a thermal distribution, the number of higher energy photons decreases exponentially. Therefore, the effective threshold is determined by the peak of the product of the photon density and the cross-section. However, the problem simplifies this by using the average photon energy, so we can proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic calculation or a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe process is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. The rest frame of the system would require that the total energy is at least 2 m_e c^2. But since one photon is very high energy and the other is low energy, we can consider the frame where the high-energy photon is interacting with a low-energy photon. To produce an electron-positron pair, the energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2 m_e c^2.\n\nAlternatively, using the head-on collision formula again. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = 4 E_gamma epsilon (1 - cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between the two photons. For head-on collision, theta = 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1, so (1 - cos(theta)) = 2. Therefore, s = 4 E_gamma epsilon * 2 = 8 E_gamma epsilon. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let\'s clarify: the general expression for s when two photons with energies E1 and E2 collide at an angle theta is:\n\ns = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos(theta)).\n\nBut in the case of head-on collision, theta = 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1, so (1 - cos(theta)) = 2. Therefore, s = 2 E1 E2 * 2 = 4 E1 E2. Which matches the previous result. So in that case, s = 4 E1 E2.\n\nTherefore, the threshold condition is s ≥ (2 m_e)^2, so 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e)^2 => E1 E2 ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E1 ≥ m_e^2 / E2.\n\nSo if E2 is the CMB photon energy (epsilon), then E1 ≥ m_e^2 / epsilon.\n\nThat\'s consistent with what I had before. Therefore, the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma is m_e^2 / epsilon. So with epsilon = 1e-3 eV, E_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, since the problem might expect an order-of-magnitude estimate, maybe 300 TeV or 200 TeV. But given that the calculation gives 261 TeV, which is approximately 260 TeV, I think that\'s the answer.\n\nBut let me check once more with actual physical constants.\n\nElectron mass m_e = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg\n\nSpeed of light c = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nSo m_e c^2 = 9.10938356e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 8.1871057e-14 joules.\n\nConvert joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so m_e c^2 = 8.1871057e-14 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 511,000 eV = 511 keV ≈ 0.511 MeV. Correct.\n\nSo m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Then m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511 MeV)^2.\n\nBut in the calculation, we have E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon c^2 * c^2). Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, energy and mass are related by E = m c^2. So m_e c^2 is energy, and m_e is mass. But in the formula, s = 4 E_gamma epsilon, and s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, 4 E_gamma epsilon >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Solving for E_gamma:\n\nE_gamma >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon) = (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 epsilon) = m_e^2 c^4 / epsilon.\n\nBut since epsilon is given in eV, and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, we can write:\n\nE_gamma >= (0.511 MeV)^2 / epsilon.\n\nGiven epsilon = 1e-3 eV, we need to convert MeV to eV:\n\n0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE_gamma >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nYes, this is consistent. Therefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Since the problem mentions "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process," this would be the energy above which the gamma-rays would start interacting significantly with the CMB photons, leading to a limited lifetime. Therefore, the threshold energy is around 260 TeV.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. The wavelength of a CMB photon with energy 1e-3 eV is lambda = hc / E. Planck constant h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c = 3e8 m/s. So lambda = (4.135667696e-15 eV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 1e-3 eV = 1.2407e-3 m, which is about 1.24 mm, which is in the microwave region, consistent with CMB.\n\nThe gamma-ray photon with energy 260 TeV has a wavelength lambda = hc / E = (4.135667696e-15 eV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 260e12 eV = 1.2407e-6 m / 260e12 = 4.77e-21 m, which is incredibly short, but that\'s expected for gamma-rays.\n\nAlternatively, using the gamma-ray energy in terms of frequency: E = h f, so f = E / h = 260e12 eV / 4.135667696e-15 eV·s ≈ 6.29e28 Hz, which is extremely high frequency, typical for gamma-rays.\n\nTherefore, all the numbers check out. So I think the correct answer is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this threshold would annihilate with CMB photons, limiting their lifetime in the universe.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the gamma-rays is limited by this process at approximately \\boxed{2 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}.\n\nWait, hold on. The calculation gave 261 TeV, which is 2.61 × 10^14 eV. The problem might expect the answer in units of 10^14 eV, so 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But the final answer provided here is 2 × 10^14 eV, which is 200 TeV. But my calculation says 261 TeV. However, the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. If instead, the average photon energy was higher, say 1.5e-3 eV, then the threshold would be lower. But the problem specifies 1e-3 eV. However, maybe the answer is expected to be an order of magnitude, so 10^14 eV (100 TeV) or 3 × 10^14 eV (300 TeV). But in the calculation, it\'s 2.6 × 10^14 eV. If I were to round it, 3 × 10^14 eV. But the problem might expect the answer as 1 × 10^14 eV (100 TeV) which is 0.1 PeV. But according to the precise calculation with the given numbers, it\'s 261 TeV or 2.6 × 10^14 eV. Therefore, the correct answer should be boxed as \\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}} or \\boxed{260 \\text{ TeV}}. However, looking at the initial problem statement, it says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" Given that the calculation gives ~260 TeV, but standard answers might round it to 100 TeV (1e14 eV) or 300 TeV (3e14 eV). But since the exact calculation gives ~2.6e14 eV, and the problem gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV, I think the precise answer is 2.6e14 eV. However, the assistant initially wrote 261 TeV, which is 2.61e14 eV. So maybe the answer is to be given as 1e14 eV (100 TeV) or 3e14 eV (300 TeV). Wait, but in the calculation, it\'s 2.6e14 eV. Let me check the exact calculation once again:\n\n(0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So 2.61 x 10^14 eV. So writing that as \\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}} or \\boxed{260 \\text{ TeV}} is accurate. However, if the problem expects a more approximate answer, maybe 3 x 10^14 eV or 300 TeV. But given that the problem provides the average photon energy as 1e-3 eV, which leads to 2.6e14 eV, I think the precise answer should be 2.6e14 eV. However, in the initial thought process, I converted 2.61e14 eV to 261 TeV. But 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 261 TeV is 2.61e14 eV. So either representation is correct. Depending on the problem\'s expected answer format, it might prefer 260 TeV or 2.6 x 10^14 eV. Since the question mentions "energy gamma-rays," and high-energy gamma-rays are often discussed in TeV ranges, writing it in TeV might be more intuitive. However, the problem might expect the answer in eV. Given that, and since 2.6 x 10^14 eV is 260 TeV, I\'ll present both and see which is more appropriate.\n\nBut the problem says "Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3}eV." So they give the CMB photon energy in eV, so the answer should be in eV as well. Therefore, converting 261 TeV to eV is 2.61 x 10^14 eV. However, in the final answer, the assistant wrote 2 x 10^14 eV. Maybe rounding to one significant figure, since the given average energy is 1e-3 eV (one significant figure). If we follow significant figures, the given average energy is 1e-3 eV, which is one significant figure, so the answer should be 3e14 eV (since 0.511 is three significant figures, but if the given epsilon is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig: 3e14 eV). But 0.511 is three sig figs, epsilon is one, so when multiplying/dividing, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is one. But 0.511^2 is 0.261, which is three sig figs, divided by 1e-3 (one sig fig), gives 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV. But with one sig fig, that would be 3e14 eV. However, the problem might not care about sig figs and just want the exact calculation. Since the problem didn\'t specify, but in physics, usually, we keep the same number of sig figs as the given data. The given data is 10^-3 eV, which is one sig fig. The electron mass is a known constant, 0.511 MeV, which is three sig figs. So when multiplying/dividing, we take the least number of sig figs, which is one. Therefore, the answer should be 3 x 10^14 eV. But 2.61e14 rounds to 3e14 with one sig fig. Therefore, if the problem expects one significant figure, the answer is 3 x 10^14 eV. However, if they expect two or three, it\'s 2.6 x 10^14 or 2.61 x 10^14. But given that the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (one sig fig), perhaps the answer should be given with one sig fig. But I need to check the style. The problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" and gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV. If we take the calculation as 2.61e14 eV, but round to one sig fig, it\'s 3e14 eV. However, in many cases, constants like the electron mass are considered exact, so maybe we keep two sig figs. The electron mass is 0.511 MeV, which is three sig figs. The average energy is 1e-3 eV, one sig fig. So when multiplying/dividing, the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, 3e14 eV. But in the calculation, it\'s 2.6e14, which is 260 TeV, but in standard notation, 260 is two sig figs. Wait, 2.6e14 is two sig figs. If the average energy is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 3e14 eV. However, this is a bit conflicting. In many textbooks, when using constants like m_e, which are known precisely, even if the input has one sig fig, they might present the answer with more sig figs, indicating that the uncertainty is dominated by the input. So if the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (which could be considered as 1.0e-3 eV, implying one sig fig), then the answer would be 3e14 eV. However, if the average energy is considered to have one sig fig, but m_e is known to three, then the answer is 2.6e14 eV. Given that, and since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer without strict sig fig adherence, I think writing \\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}} or \\boxed{260 \\text{ TeV}} is appropriate. However, looking back at my initial final answer, I wrote 2e14 eV, which is 200 TeV. That was a mistake. The correct answer is approximately 260 TeV or 2.6e14 eV. Therefore, the correct boxed answer should be \\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385740, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6474, prompt_tokens=1907, total_tokens=8381, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process of annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, we start by considering the threshold energy required for this process. The key condition is that the invariant squared energy \( s \) must be at least \((2m_e)^2\), where \( m_e \) is the electron mass.

The invariant squared energy \( s \) for two photons colliding head-on is given by:
\[ s = 4 E_\gamma \varepsilon \]
where \( E_\gamma \) is the energy of the gamma-ray photon and \( \varepsilon \) is the energy of the CMB photon. For pair production to occur, we need:
\[ 4 E_\gamma \varepsilon \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \]

Solving for \( E_\gamma \):
\[ E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2 m_e c^2)^2}{4 \varepsilon} = \frac{m_e^2 c^4}{\varepsilon} \]

Given:
- The average energy of a CMB photon \( \varepsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \)
- The rest mass energy of an electron \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \)

Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} \]
\[ E_\gamma \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} \]
\[ E_\gamma \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} \]
\[ E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} \]

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by this process is approximately:
\[ \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} \]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

. 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K. So k_B * T = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 2.33e-4 eV. But the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is about 4 times higher. Maybe the problem is simplifying and using 10^-3 eV as an average, but in reality, the average energy might be a bit lower. However, since the problem gives 10^-3 eV, we should use that.

But let's see. If we use the actual average photon energy of the CMB, which is about 6.6e-4 eV (since average energy for blackbody is about 2.7 k_B T), then:

Eγ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (6.6e-4 eV) = (0.261e12 (eV)^2) / (6.6e-4 eV) = 0.261e12 / 6.6e-4 eV ≈ 3.95e14 eV ≈ 400 TeV.

But in the problem, it's given as 1e-3 eV. So using 1e-3 eV:

Eγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.511^2 * 1e12) eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

So that's where the number comes from. However, in literature, I think the typical threshold quoted for pair production on the CMB is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is around 10^20 eV for cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons, but for photons, the cutoff is lower. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up different processes.

Wait, the GZK cutoff is for protons interacting with CMB photons to produce pions. For photons, the pair production process with CMB photons is the relevant one. The threshold energy for that is indeed around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV, but according to my calculation, with the given average photon energy of 1e-3 eV, it's about 260 TeV. Hmm. Let me check the formula again.

The threshold condition is s ≥ (2m_e)^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons colliding head-on, s = 4 E ε, where E is the energy of the high-energy photon, and ε is the energy of the CMB photon. So solving for E:

E ≥ (2m_e)^2 / (4 ε) = m_e^2 / ε.

But m_e is 0.511 MeV. So m_e^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 (eV)^2. Then divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

E ≥ 0.261e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

So that's correct. However, in reality, the CMB photon energy is a distribution, not a single value. The average might be around 1e-3 eV, but there are photons with higher and lower energies. The threshold depends on the specific energy of the CMB photon. So the cross-section for the interaction peaks when the product E ε is around m_e^2. Therefore, even though the average energy is 1e-3 eV, the actual threshold for the highest energy photons that can interact would be lower. Wait, no. For a given CMB photon energy ε, the threshold E is m_e^2 / ε. So higher energy CMB photons would allow lower energy gamma-rays to pair produce. But since the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, there's a distribution. However, the problem states to use the average photon energy of 1e-3 eV, so we should use that.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. But maybe in the problem, they expect a simpler calculation. Let me check if I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, the invariant s is 4 E ε in the case of head-on collision. Then s ≥ (2m_e)^2. So 4 E ε ≥ 4 m_e^2 → E ε ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E ≥ m_e^2 / ε. That seems correct.

But m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, but when we use natural units where c=1, m_e is in units of eV, and ε is in eV. So m_e = 0.511e6 eV. Then m_e^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV². Epsilon is 1e-3 eV. So E ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Calculating:

(0.511e6)^2 = 0.511² * 1e12 = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 (eV²). Then divide by 1e-3 eV:

2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV. Which is 261 TeV. So that's correct.

But in some references, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is quoted as around 80 TeV. Wait, maybe they use the temperature of the CMB (2.7 K) corresponding to kT ~ 0.00023 eV, and then compute the threshold energy as ~m_e^2 / (kT) ~ (0.511e6)^2 / 0.00023e9 (since 0.00023 eV is 0.23e-3 eV). Wait, but let's compute that:

m_e = 0.511e6 eV

kT = 0.23e-3 eV

E_threshold = (0.511e6)^2 / (0.23e-3) = (0.261e12) / (0.23e-3) = 0.261 / 0.23 * 1e15 = approx 1.135 * 1e15 eV = 1.135e15 eV = 1.135 PeV. Wait, that's even higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me check. If the typical photon energy is taken as kT, then E_threshold = m_e^2 / (kT). But if the photon has energy kT, then:

E_threshold = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (k*T) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² / (2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV) ≈ (0.261) * 1e12 / (2.326e-4) eV ≈ 0.261 / 2.326e-4 * 1e12 ≈ 0.112 * 1e16 ≈ 1.12e15 eV ≈ 1.1 PeV. But that contradicts the previous result. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because in the blackbody spectrum, the average photon energy is not exactly kT. The average energy for a blackbody is approximately 2.7 kT. So if T = 2.7 K, then average energy is 2.7 * k_B * T = 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 6.3e-4 eV. So if the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is a bit higher than the actual average, but maybe it's a rough estimate.

But regardless, according to the problem, we are to use 1e-3 eV as the average photon energy, so we should proceed with that. Hence, E_threshold = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 261 TeV.

However, when I look up literature, for example, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is often stated to be around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the calculation in literature uses the CMB photon energy at the peak of the blackbody spectrum, which is about 1.6 kT. For T = 2.7 K, kT = 0.00023 eV, so peak energy is 1.6 * 0.00023 ≈ 0.00037 eV. Then the threshold energy would be (0.511e6)^2 / 0.00037e3 = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 0.00037 ≈ (0.261 * 1e12) / 0.00037 ≈ 0.261 / 0.00037 * 1e12 ≈ 705.4 * 1e12 ≈ 7e14 eV = 700 TeV. Hmm, that's even higher. But this contradicts the literature value.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let's go back to the invariant s. The threshold condition is s ≥ (2m_e)^2. For a head-on collision, s = 4 E ε. So 4 E ε ≥ (2 m_e)^2 → E ε ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E ≥ m_e^2 / ε.

But if the photons are not colliding head-on, the effective s would be less. So the threshold energy would be higher for non-head-on collisions. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, the actual cross-section depends on the angle of collision. The maximum cross-section occurs when they collide head-on. Therefore, the minimum energy required is when they collide head-on, so the threshold energy is E_threshold = m_e^2 / ε.

But in reality, since the CMB photons are coming from all directions, the effective energy required for pair production is higher. Wait, but how is that calculated?

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section for the interaction is maximized when the photons collide head-on, but even for other angles, there is some contribution. Therefore, to compute the mean free path, you have to integrate over all possible angles and energies of the CMB photons. However, since the problem asks for the energy at which the lifetime is "limited" by this process, it's probably referring to the threshold energy above which the interaction becomes possible, i.e., the minimum gamma-ray energy required for pair production with the average CMB photon. But given that the CMB photon energy is a distribution, the threshold is not a sharp cutoff, but the interaction becomes significant around that energy.

But the problem states to use the average photon energy of the CMB, which is 1e-3 eV. Therefore, using that, the threshold energy is 261 TeV.

But why does literature often cite around 100 TeV? Let me check. For example, according to some sources, the threshold energy for pair production on the CMB is about 10^14 eV (100 TeV). Let me see the calculation.

Suppose the CMB photon has energy 0.001 eV (as in the problem), then:

E_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / 0.001 = 0.261e12 / 0.001 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV. So that's correct.

But if the CMB photon energy is taken as 0.0006 eV (which is closer to the actual average energy of ~0.0006 eV for a 2.7 K blackbody), then:

E_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / 0.0006 = 0.261e12 / 0.0006 = 4.35e14 eV = 435 TeV.

Hmm. But that still doesn't get us to 100 TeV. Wait, maybe the confusion is because when considering the cross-section, even though the threshold is higher, the interaction can still happen with lower energy gamma-rays if there are higher energy CMB photons. But since the CMB has a thermal distribution, the number of higher energy photons decreases exponentially. Therefore, the effective threshold is determined by the peak of the product of the photon density and the cross-section. However, the problem simplifies this by using the average photon energy, so we can proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic calculation or a different approach. Let me think again.

The process is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. The rest frame of the system would require that the total energy is at least 2 m_e c^2. But since one photon is very high energy and the other is low energy, we can consider the frame where the high-energy photon is interacting with a low-energy photon. To produce an electron-positron pair, the energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2 m_e c^2.

Alternatively, using the head-on collision formula again. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = 4 E_gamma epsilon (1 - cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between the two photons. For head-on collision, theta = 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1, so (1 - cos(theta)) = 2. Therefore, s = 4 E_gamma epsilon * 2 = 8 E_gamma epsilon. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, let's clarify: the general expression for s when two photons with energies E1 and E2 collide at an angle theta is:

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos(theta)).

But in the case of head-on collision, theta = 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1, so (1 - cos(theta)) = 2. Therefore, s = 2 E1 E2 * 2 = 4 E1 E2. Which matches the previous result. So in that case, s = 4 E1 E2.

Therefore, the threshold condition is s ≥ (2 m_e)^2, so 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e)^2 => E1 E2 ≥ m_e^2. Therefore, E1 ≥ m_e^2 / E2.

So if E2 is the CMB photon energy (epsilon), then E1 ≥ m_e^2 / epsilon.

That's consistent with what I had before. Therefore, the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma is m_e^2 / epsilon. So with epsilon = 1e-3 eV, E_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, since the problem might expect an order-of-magnitude estimate, maybe 300 TeV or 200 TeV. But given that the calculation gives 261 TeV, which is approximately 260 TeV, I think that's the answer.

But let me check once more with actual physical constants.

Electron mass m_e = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg

Speed of light c = 3 × 10^8 m/s

So m_e c^2 = 9.10938356e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 8.1871057e-14 joules.

Convert joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so m_e c^2 = 8.1871057e-14 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 511,000 eV = 511 keV ≈ 0.511 MeV. Correct.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Then m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511 MeV)^2.

But in the calculation, we have E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon c^2 * c^2). Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, energy and mass are related by E = m c^2. So m_e c^2 is energy, and m_e is mass. But in the formula, s = 4 E_gamma epsilon, and s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, 4 E_gamma epsilon >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon) = (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 epsilon) = m_e^2 c^4 / epsilon.

But since epsilon is given in eV, and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, we can write:

E_gamma >= (0.511 MeV)^2 / epsilon.

Given epsilon = 1e-3 eV, we need to convert MeV to eV:

0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

Therefore:

E_gamma >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Yes, this is consistent. Therefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Since the problem mentions "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process," this would be the energy above which the gamma-rays would start interacting significantly with the CMB photons, leading to a limited lifetime. Therefore, the threshold energy is around 260 TeV.

But let me check with another approach. The wavelength of a CMB photon with energy 1e-3 eV is lambda = hc / E. Planck constant h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c = 3e8 m/s. So lambda = (4.135667696e-15 eV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 1e-3 eV = 1.2407e-3 m, which is about 1.24 mm, which is in the microwave region, consistent with CMB.

The gamma-ray photon with energy 260 TeV has a wavelength lambda = hc / E = (4.135667696e-15 eV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 260e12 eV = 1.2407e-6 m / 260e12 = 4.77e-21 m, which is incredibly short, but that's expected for gamma-rays.

Alternatively, using the gamma-ray energy in terms of frequency: E = h f, so f = E / h = 260e12 eV / 4.135667696e-15 eV·s ≈ 6.29e28 Hz, which is extremely high frequency, typical for gamma-rays.

Therefore, all the numbers check out. So I think the correct answer is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this threshold would annihilate with CMB photons, limiting their lifetime in the universe.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the gamma-rays is limited by this process at approximately \boxed{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

Wait, hold on. The calculation gave 261 TeV, which is 2.61 × 10^14 eV. The problem might expect the answer in units of 10^14 eV, so 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But the final answer provided here is 2 × 10^14 eV, which is 200 TeV. But my calculation says 261 TeV. However, the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. If instead, the average photon energy was higher, say 1.5e-3 eV, then the threshold would be lower. But the problem specifies 1e-3 eV. However, maybe the answer is expected to be an order of magnitude, so 10^14 eV (100 TeV) or 3 × 10^14 eV (300 TeV). But in the calculation, it's 2.6 × 10^14 eV. If I were to round it, 3 × 10^14 eV. But the problem might expect the answer as 1 × 10^14 eV (100 TeV) which is 0.1 PeV. But according to the precise calculation with the given numbers, it's 261 TeV or 2.6 × 10^14 eV. Therefore, the correct answer should be boxed as \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} or \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}}. However, looking at the initial problem statement, it says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" Given that the calculation gives ~260 TeV, but standard answers might round it to 100 TeV (1e14 eV) or 300 TeV (3e14 eV). But since the exact calculation gives ~2.6e14 eV, and the problem gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV, I think the precise answer is 2.6e14 eV. However, the assistant initially wrote 261 TeV, which is 2.61e14 eV. So maybe the answer is to be given as 1e14 eV (100 TeV) or 3e14 eV (300 TeV). Wait, but in the calculation, it's 2.6e14 eV. Let me check the exact calculation once again:

(0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So 2.61 x 10^14 eV. So writing that as \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} or \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}} is accurate. However, if the problem expects a more approximate answer, maybe 3 x 10^14 eV or 300 TeV. But given that the problem provides the average photon energy as 1e-3 eV, which leads to 2.6e14 eV, I think the precise answer should be 2.6e14 eV. However, in the initial thought process, I converted 2.61e14 eV to 261 TeV. But 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 261 TeV is 2.61e14 eV. So either representation is correct. Depending on the problem's expected answer format, it might prefer 260 TeV or 2.6 x 10^14 eV. Since the question mentions "energy gamma-rays," and high-energy gamma-rays are often discussed in TeV ranges, writing it in TeV might be more intuitive. However, the problem might expect the answer in eV. Given that, and since 2.6 x 10^14 eV is 260 TeV, I'll present both and see which is more appropriate.

But the problem says "Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3}eV." So they give the CMB photon energy in eV, so the answer should be in eV as well. Therefore, converting 261 TeV to eV is 2.61 x 10^14 eV. However, in the final answer, the assistant wrote 2 x 10^14 eV. Maybe rounding to one significant figure, since the given average energy is 1e-3 eV (one significant figure). If we follow significant figures, the given average energy is 1e-3 eV, which is one significant figure, so the answer should be 3e14 eV (since 0.511 is three significant figures, but if the given epsilon is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig: 3e14 eV). But 0.511 is three sig figs, epsilon is one, so when multiplying/dividing, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is one. But 0.511^2 is 0.261, which is three sig figs, divided by 1e-3 (one sig fig), gives 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV. But with one sig fig, that would be 3e14 eV. However, the problem might not care about sig figs and just want the exact calculation. Since the problem didn't specify, but in physics, usually, we keep the same number of sig figs as the given data. The given data is 10^-3 eV, which is one sig fig. The electron mass is a known constant, 0.511 MeV, which is three sig figs. So when multiplying/dividing, we take the least number of sig figs, which is one. Therefore, the answer should be 3 x 10^14 eV. But 2.61e14 rounds to 3e14 with one sig fig. Therefore, if the problem expects one significant figure, the answer is 3 x 10^14 eV. However, if they expect two or three, it's 2.6 x 10^14 or 2.61 x 10^14. But given that the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (one sig fig), perhaps the answer should be given with one sig fig. But I need to check the style. The problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" and gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV. If we take the calculation as 2.61e14 eV, but round to one sig fig, it's 3e14 eV. However, in many cases, constants like the electron mass are considered exact, so maybe we keep two sig figs. The electron mass is 0.511 MeV, which is three sig figs. The average energy is 1e-3 eV, one sig fig. So when multiplying/dividing, the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, 3e14 eV. But in the calculation, it's 2.6e14, which is 260 TeV, but in standard notation, 260 is two sig figs. Wait, 2.6e14 is two sig figs. If the average energy is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 3e14 eV. However, this is a bit conflicting. In many textbooks, when using constants like m_e, which are known precisely, even if the input has one sig fig, they might present the answer with more sig figs, indicating that the uncertainty is dominated by the input. So if the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (which could be considered as 1.0e-3 eV, implying one sig fig), then the answer would be 3e14 eV. However, if the average energy is considered to have one sig fig, but m_e is known to three, then the answer is 2.6e14 eV. Given that, and since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer without strict sig fig adherence, I think writing \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} or \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}} is appropriate. However, looking back at my initial final answer, I wrote 2e14 eV, which is 200 TeV. That was a mistake. The correct answer is approximately 260 TeV or 2.6e14 eV. Therefore, the correct boxed answer should be \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}

Wait, the average energy of a blackbody is approximately 2.7kT, which for T=2.7 K gives kT ≈ 0.235 meV, so average energy ~0.7 meV. But the problem states average as 10^-3 eV, which is 1 meV. Close enough. So maybe my calculation is correct. Alternatively, the threshold formula might have a factor. Let me recheck.\n\nThe threshold condition for pair production is that the center-of-momentum energy must be at least 2m_e c^2. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (pγ c - p_CMB c)^2. Since photons are massless, pγ = Eγ/c and p_CMB = ε/c. Assuming they collide head-on, the momentum vectors are opposite. So,\n\ns = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = (Eγ + ε + Eγ - ε)(Eγ + ε - Eγ + ε) = (2Eγ)(2ε) = 4Eγ ε\n\nSo s = 4Eγ ε. For threshold, s = (2m_e c^2)^2, so 4Eγ ε = (2m_e c^2)^2 => Eγ = (2m_e c^2)^2/(4ε) = (m_e c^2)^2/ε\n\nYes, so Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε. Plugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV, and ε = 1e-3 eV:\n\nEγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV\n\nSo that's 261 TeV. However, I remember that the commonly cited threshold for this process is around 80 TeV. Wait, why the discrepancy? Let me check the formula again. Is the threshold energy different when considering the angle of collision?\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation assumes a head-on collision. If the photons are not colliding head-on, the required energy would be higher. But since we are considering an average, maybe the cross-section is maximized for head-on collisions, and the threshold is calculated accordingly. However, the typical approach is to use the head-on collision for the threshold calculation. But the average photon energy in the CMB is 10^-3 eV, but the CMB has a blackbody spectrum. Wait, but the problem says to use the average photon energy of 10^-3 eV, so maybe we can proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the threshold is lower. Let me check with numbers. The rest mass energy of the electron is 0.511 MeV. So the minimum energy needed is when the two photons combine to 1.022 MeV. If one photon is 1e-3 eV, then Eγ * 1e-3 eV >= (0.511e6 eV)^2. Wait, but that would be the same as before. Hmm. Wait, let's think in terms of center of mass energy.\n\nThe center of mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2. For photons moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, so p1c = E1, p2c = E2. Then s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - (-E2))^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the momenta are vectors. Let me be precise.\n\nAssume gamma-ray is moving along +z direction with energy Eγ, and CMB photon is moving along -z direction with energy ε. Then their 4-momenta are (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ) and (ε, 0, 0, -ε). The sum is (Eγ + ε, 0, 0, Eγ - ε). The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = 4 Eγ ε. So s = 4 Eγ ε. For pair production, s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 Eγ ε >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, Eγ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε. Which is the same as before, 261 TeV.\n\nBut I thought the threshold was lower. Wait, but maybe in the CMB, the photon energy isn't 1e-3 eV but higher, or perhaps the calculation uses the temperature? Let me check. The average energy of a photon in the CMB is approximately 2.7kT. The CMB temperature is T = 2.725 K. k = 8.617e-5 eV/K. So kT = 2.725 * 8.617e-5 eV ≈ 2.348e-4 eV. The average photon energy is about 2.7kT ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, which is roughly 6e-4 eV. The problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is a bit higher. If I use 6e-4 eV, then Eγ = (0.511e6)^2 / 6e-4 = 0.261e12 / 6e-4 = 0.261e16 / 6 ≈ 4.35e14 eV = 435 TeV. Hmm, even higher. So why do sources say that the threshold is around 80 TeV?\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is done in the lab frame where the CMB photon is at rest, which isn't correct, but maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section becomes significant above a certain energy, but the threshold is indeed 261 TeV. Wait, but according to some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff for cosmic protons is around 10^20 eV due to interactions with CMB photons, but for photons, the cutoff is lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation here is correct, but in reality, the CMB photons have a distribution, so even though the average is 1e-3 eV, higher energy photons in the Wien tail can interact with lower energy gamma-rays. Wait, but in this problem, we are told to use the average photon energy. So the answer would be 261 TeV. However, perhaps the actual threshold is lower because even if the average is 1e-3 eV, the lower energy CMB photons would require higher gamma-ray energies. Wait, no, lower energy CMB photons would require higher gamma-ray energies. If the CMB photon has lower energy, then the required gamma-ray energy would be higher. Conversely, higher energy CMB photons would allow lower energy gamma-rays to pair produce.\n\nBut the problem states to use the average photon energy of 10^-3 eV, so we should use that. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, another possible mistake is unit conversion. Let me check again.\n\nm_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV\n\nEγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 x 10^12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is approximately 260 TeV. But I need to confirm this with standard references.\n\nWait, according to some sources, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is about 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, here's a quick check: the energy threshold for pair production is E_gamma ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB). If epsilon_CMB ~ 0.001 eV, then E_gamma ~ (0.511e6)^2 / 0.001 ~ 0.261e12 / 0.001 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV, as calculated. However, some sources mention that the threshold is around 80 TeV. Wait, maybe they use a different value for epsilon_CMB. If instead of the average energy, they use the temperature kT. Let's compute with kT = 2.35e-4 eV (for T=2.7 K). Then E_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / (2.35e-4) = 0.261e12 / 2.35e-4 = 1.11e15 eV = 1,110 TeV. That's even higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section becomes significant when the product of the energies exceeds (m_e c^2)^2. But the threshold is when the sum in the center of mass is 2m_e c^2. Wait, but the calculation seems correct. So maybe the standard answer is around 100 TeV, but with the given average energy of 1e-3 eV, it's 261 TeV. Therefore, perhaps the answer expected here is ~260 TeV. Alternatively, the question might not be precise and wants the order of magnitude, so 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, 10^14 eV is 100 TeV, but 2.6e14 is 260 TeV. So depending on the desired precision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using 2m_e c^2 as the threshold for the center of mass energy, but that would be different. Wait, the center of mass energy needs to be at least 2m_e c^2. The center of mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2. For photons moving in opposite directions, p1c = E1, p2c = E2, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? That can't be. Wait, no, if they are moving in opposite directions, then p1 is +E1/c and p2 is -E2/c. So the vector sum is p1 - p2 = E1/c + E2/c. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the invariant.\n\nThe invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. If they are moving in opposite directions, then p1 is in +z, p2 is in -z. So their vector sum is p1 - p2. But in terms of magnitude, |p1 c| = E1, |p2 c| = E2. So the spatial part of the 4-vector is (0,0,E1 - E2). Wait, no, if the first photon has momentum (0,0,E1/c) and the second has (0,0,-E2/c), then the total momentum is (0,0,E1/c - E2/c). Then the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. Which matches the previous result. So s = 4 E1 E2. For s >= (2m_e c^2)^2, we have 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.\n\nIf E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is 1e-3 eV, then E1 >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, this calculation seems correct. So the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, common literature values sometimes cite lower thresholds, possibly because they consider the photon distribution. Since the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, there are photons with energies higher than the average. The cross-section for pair production depends on the photon density above a certain energy. Therefore, even though the average is 1e-3 eV, the presence of higher-energy photons in the Wien tail allows pair production at lower gamma-ray energies. However, the problem specifies to use the average photon energy, so we can disregard the spectrum and use the given value.\n\nThus, the gamma-ray energy threshold is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this value would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately \\boxed{260 \\text{ TeV}}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386057, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3369, prompt_tokens=683, total_tokens=4052, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we need to consider the threshold energy required for the pair production process \(\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\). 

1. **Threshold Energy Calculation**:
   - The invariant squared energy \(s\) for the collision must exceed the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is \(2m_e c^2\).
   - For two photons colliding head-on, the invariant squared energy \(s\) is given by \(4E_\gamma \varepsilon\), where \(E_\gamma\) is the energy of the gamma-ray and \(\varepsilon\) is the energy of the CMB photon.
   - The threshold condition is \(4E_\gamma \varepsilon \geq (2m_e c^2)^2\).

2. **Substituting Values**:
   - The rest mass energy of the electron \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV}\).
   - The average energy of a CMB photon \(\varepsilon = 10^{-3} \text{ eV}\).

3. **Solving for \(E_\gamma\)**:
   - Rearranging the threshold condition: \(E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\varepsilon}\).
   - Substituting the values: 
     \[
     E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = \frac{0.261121 \times 10^{12} \text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV} = 261 \text{ TeV}
     \]

Thus, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons. 

\[
\boxed{260 \text{ TeV}}
\]

The threshold condition for pair production is that the center-of-momentum energy must be at least 2m_e c^2. The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (pγ c - p_CMB c)^2. Since photons are massless, pγ = Eγ/c and p_CMB = ε/c. Assuming they collide head-on, the momentum vectors are opposite. So,

s = (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = (Eγ + ε + Eγ - ε)(Eγ + ε - Eγ + ε) = (2Eγ)(2ε) = 4Eγ ε

So s = 4Eγ ε. For threshold, s = (2m_e c^2)^2, so 4Eγ ε = (2m_e c^2)^2 => Eγ = (2m_e c^2)^2/(4ε) = (m_e c^2)^2/ε

Yes, so Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε. Plugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV, and ε = 1e-3 eV:

Eγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV

So that's 261 TeV. However, I remember that the commonly cited threshold for this process is around 80 TeV. Wait, why the discrepancy? Let me check the formula again. Is the threshold energy different when considering the angle of collision?

Wait, perhaps the calculation assumes a head-on collision. If the photons are not colliding head-on, the required energy would be higher. But since we are considering an average, maybe the cross-section is maximized for head-on collisions, and the threshold is calculated accordingly. However, the typical approach is to use the head-on collision for the threshold calculation. But the average photon energy in the CMB is 10^-3 eV, but the CMB has a blackbody spectrum. Wait, but the problem says to use the average photon energy of 10^-3 eV, so maybe we can proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the threshold is lower. Let me check with numbers. The rest mass energy of the electron is 0.511 MeV. So the minimum energy needed is when the two photons combine to 1.022 MeV. If one photon is 1e-3 eV, then Eγ * 1e-3 eV >= (0.511e6 eV)^2. Wait, but that would be the same as before. Hmm. Wait, let's think in terms of center of mass energy.

The center of mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2. For photons moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, so p1c = E1, p2c = E2. Then s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - (-E2))^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the momenta are vectors. Let me be precise.

Assume gamma-ray is moving along +z direction with energy Eγ, and CMB photon is moving along -z direction with energy ε. Then their 4-momenta are (Eγ, 0, 0, Eγ) and (ε, 0, 0, -ε). The sum is (Eγ + ε, 0, 0, Eγ - ε). The invariant s is (Eγ + ε)^2 - (Eγ - ε)^2 = 4 Eγ ε. So s = 4 Eγ ε. For pair production, s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 Eγ ε >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, Eγ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε. Which is the same as before, 261 TeV.

But I thought the threshold was lower. Wait, but maybe in the CMB, the photon energy isn't 1e-3 eV but higher, or perhaps the calculation uses the temperature? Let me check. The average energy of a photon in the CMB is approximately 2.7kT. The CMB temperature is T = 2.725 K. k = 8.617e-5 eV/K. So kT = 2.725 * 8.617e-5 eV ≈ 2.348e-4 eV. The average photon energy is about 2.7kT ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, which is roughly 6e-4 eV. The problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is a bit higher. If I use 6e-4 eV, then Eγ = (0.511e6)^2 / 6e-4 = 0.261e12 / 6e-4 = 0.261e16 / 6 ≈ 4.35e14 eV = 435 TeV. Hmm, even higher. So why do sources say that the threshold is around 80 TeV?

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in the lab frame where the CMB photon is at rest, which isn't correct, but maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section becomes significant above a certain energy, but the threshold is indeed 261 TeV. Wait, but according to some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff for cosmic protons is around 10^20 eV due to interactions with CMB photons, but for photons, the cutoff is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation here is correct, but in reality, the CMB photons have a distribution, so even though the average is 1e-3 eV, higher energy photons in the Wien tail can interact with lower energy gamma-rays. Wait, but in this problem, we are told to use the average photon energy. So the answer would be 261 TeV. However, perhaps the actual threshold is lower because even if the average is 1e-3 eV, the lower energy CMB photons would require higher gamma-ray energies. Wait, no, lower energy CMB photons would require higher gamma-ray energies. If the CMB photon has lower energy, then the required gamma-ray energy would be higher. Conversely, higher energy CMB photons would allow lower energy gamma-rays to pair produce.

But the problem states to use the average photon energy of 10^-3 eV, so we should use that. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, another possible mistake is unit conversion. Let me check again.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV

Eγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 x 10^12 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is approximately 260 TeV. But I need to confirm this with standard references.

Wait, according to some sources, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is about 10^14 eV (100 TeV). For example, here's a quick check: the energy threshold for pair production is E_gamma ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB). If epsilon_CMB ~ 0.001 eV, then E_gamma ~ (0.511e6)^2 / 0.001 ~ 0.261e12 / 0.001 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV, as calculated. However, some sources mention that the threshold is around 80 TeV. Wait, maybe they use a different value for epsilon_CMB. If instead of the average energy, they use the temperature kT. Let's compute with kT = 2.35e-4 eV (for T=2.7 K). Then E_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / (2.35e-4) = 0.261e12 / 2.35e-4 = 1.11e15 eV = 1,110 TeV. That's even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section becomes significant when the product of the energies exceeds (m_e c^2)^2. But the threshold is when the sum in the center of mass is 2m_e c^2. Wait, but the calculation seems correct. So maybe the standard answer is around 100 TeV, but with the given average energy of 1e-3 eV, it's 261 TeV. Therefore, perhaps the answer expected here is ~260 TeV. Alternatively, the question might not be precise and wants the order of magnitude, so 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, 10^14 eV is 100 TeV, but 2.6e14 is 260 TeV. So depending on the desired precision.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using 2m_e c^2 as the threshold for the center of mass energy, but that would be different. Wait, the center of mass energy needs to be at least 2m_e c^2. The center of mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2. For photons moving in opposite directions, p1c = E1, p2c = E2, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? That can't be. Wait, no, if they are moving in opposite directions, then p1 is +E1/c and p2 is -E2/c. So the vector sum is p1 - p2 = E1/c + E2/c. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the invariant.

The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. If they are moving in opposite directions, then p1 is in +z, p2 is in -z. So their vector sum is p1 - p2. But in terms of magnitude, |p1 c| = E1, |p2 c| = E2. So the spatial part of the 4-vector is (0,0,E1 - E2). Wait, no, if the first photon has momentum (0,0,E1/c) and the second has (0,0,-E2/c), then the total momentum is (0,0,E1/c - E2/c). Then the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. Which matches the previous result. So s = 4 E1 E2. For s >= (2m_e c^2)^2, we have 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

If E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is 1e-3 eV, then E1 >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, this calculation seems correct. So the answer should be approximately 260 TeV. However, common literature values sometimes cite lower thresholds, possibly because they consider the photon distribution. Since the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, there are photons with energies higher than the average. The cross-section for pair production depends on the photon density above a certain energy. Therefore, even though the average is 1e-3 eV, the presence of higher-energy photons in the Wien tail allows pair production at lower gamma-ray energies. However, the problem specifies to use the average photon energy, so we can disregard the spectrum and use the given value.

Thus, the gamma-ray energy threshold is approximately 260 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this value would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.

**Final Answer**
The energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}}.

To determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons via $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we use the invariant energy squared $s$ for the photon-photon collision. The threshold occurs when $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, where $m_e c^2 = 0.511\ \text{MeV}$ is the electron rest energy. For head-on collisions between a gamma-ray photon (energy $E_\gamma$) and a CMB photon (average energy $\epsilon = 10^{-3}\ \text{eV}$), the invariant $s$ is:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma \epsilon.
\]

Setting $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, we solve for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4\epsilon} = \frac{(0.511\ \text{MeV})^2}{10^{-3}\ \text{eV}}.
\]

Converting units ($1\ \text{MeV} = 10^6\ \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6\ \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3}\ \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14}\ \text{eV} = \boxed{261\ \text{TeV}}.
\]

Gamma-rays with energies **above ~260 TeV** are efficiently attenuated by the CMB via pair production, limiting their lifetime in the universe.

Therefore, the answer should be around 10^14 eV or hundreds of TeV.
