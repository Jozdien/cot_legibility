To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a Hydrogen atom, we start by calculating both energies.

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE)**:
   The transition energy is determined using the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \mu m\):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Converting the wavelength to meters:
   \[
   \lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}}{4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts:
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:
   The energy shift due to the paramagnetic term is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]
   where \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m = 1\) (small value):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Comparison**:
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   This ratio is approximately \(10^{-5}\), indicating the paramagnetic coupling term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the order of magnitude ratio is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy in a Hydrogen atom. Hmm, the problem says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis, and we're dealing with small m values (orbital magnetic quantum number) with B = 1 Tesla. The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is given by the Zeeman effect. For the orbital magnetic moment, the energy shift is ΔE_paramagnetic = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is related to the orbital angular momentum. Specifically, μ = - (μ_B * m), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton and m is the magnetic quantum number. So, substituting that in, the energy shift should be ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * m * B. Since B is in the same direction, the negative signs might cancel out. Let me check that formula again. Yeah, the Zeeman energy is E = -μ·B, and since μ = -μ_B * m * ħ / ħ (since m is the projection), maybe the units work out. Wait, actually, the Bohr magneton μ_B is defined as (eħ)/(2m_e), right? So the energy should be E = μ_B * B * m. Because μ = -μ_B * m * z_hat, so the dot product with B (which is along z) gives -μ_B * m * B, but the energy is -μ·B, so it becomes μ_B * m * B. Okay, so that's the paramagnetic term.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given by the energy difference between two states in the Hydrogen atom. The wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm corresponds to a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition. To find ΔE, I can use the relation ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me confirm that: yes, energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, so the transition energy ΔE would be equal to that.

So first, let's compute ΔE from the wavelength. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. Plugging into the formula:

ΔE = hc / λ

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

Let me calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J

Hmm, 4.09e-19 Joules. To make this easier, maybe convert this to electronvolts since atomic energy levels are often in eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a hydrogen transition, maybe from n=4 to n=2 or something. But maybe we can just keep it in Joules for comparison.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is μ_B * B * m. Let's compute that. μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Since the problem mentions small m values, let's take m=1 for the order of magnitude, as m can be integers from -l to +l, and for small m, maybe m=1 is the largest "small" value. Although maybe m=1 is not considered small? Wait, the problem says "small values of m", but m can be 0, ±1, ±2,... up to ±l. If l is small, like l=1 or 2, then m=1 is a typical value. Maybe the exact value of m isn't crucial because we're comparing orders of magnitude. Let's proceed with m=1.

So, ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Compare that to the transition energy ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 J. So the ratio is ΔE_paramagnetic / ΔE ≈ 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.267e-5. That's about 2.27e-5, so the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude would be 10^-5.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to be sure.

First, compute ΔE:

λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = let's compute that division.

0.4861e-6 is 4.861e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.409 * 1e-18 = 4.09e-19 J. Yes, that's correct.

Then μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T, so with B=1 T and m=1, paramagnetic energy is 9.274e-24 J.

So ratio is 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 = approx 2.267e-5. So about 2.3e-5, which is ~10^-5.

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the transition energy and the paramagnetic term. The problem says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy". So the paramagnetic term is much smaller, by a factor of 1e-5. So their ratio is ~1e-5.

Alternatively, if we take the paramagnetic term as ~1e-23 J (if m=1, 9e-24 is ~1e-23) and transition energy ~1e-18 J (since 4e-19 is closer to 1e-18?), but wait, 4e-19 is 4 x 10^-19, which is 0.4e-18. So maybe the order of magnitude is 1e-18 for transition and 1e-23 for paramagnetic, so ratio is 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is 5 orders of magnitude smaller. So the answer should be that the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, meaning the paramagnetic term is 5 orders smaller.

Yes, that seems right. Let me just check the Bohr magneton value again. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T, correct. And with B=1 T, m=1, so 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is ~4e-19 J, so 4e-19 / 9e-24 ≈ 4.4e4, which is about 1e4? Wait, no, 4e-19 / 9e-24 = (4/9)*1e5 ≈ 0.444*1e5 ≈ 4.4e4, which is ~10^4. Wait, wait, hold on, this is the inverse ratio. If ΔE is 4e-19 and paramagnetic term is 9e-24, then ΔE_param / ΔE = 9e-24 / 4e-19 ≈ 2.25e-5, which is ~1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times smaller. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So when they ask to compare the order of magnitude, it's the ratio of the two energies. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller.

I think that makes sense. Let me just confirm once more.

Alternatively, if I compute the transition energy in terms of eV, which is 2.55 eV, and the paramagnetic term in eV. Since 1 J = 1.602e-19 eV, so 9.274e-24 J is 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV compared to 2.55 eV. So 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So about 2.3e-5 ratio, which is ~1e-5. So yes, same result.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So when comparing, the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

**Final Answer**
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the order of magnitude ratio is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

Let's approach the comparison between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy in a Hydrogen atom. The magnetic field B is oriented along the Oz axis at 1 Tesla, and we're examining small m values (orbital magnetic quantum number). The transition energy is associated with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I'll analyze this systematically.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is described by the Zeeman effect. For the orbital magnetic moment, the energy shift is expressed as ΔE_paramagnetic = -μ·B, where μ represents the magnetic moment. This magnetic moment μ is connected to the orbital angular momentum, specifically μ = -(μ_B * m), with μ_B being the Bohr magneton and m the magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift can be written as ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * m * B. Since B aligns with the magnetic moment direction, the negative signs may cancel each other. Reviewing the formula, the Zeeman energy is E = -μ·B, and since μ = -μ_B * m * ħ / ħ (m being the projection), the units should align properly. The Bohr magneton μ_B equals (eħ)/(2m_e), so the energy equation becomes E = μ_B * B * m. This is because μ = -μ_B * m * z_hat, and when dotted with B (along z), gives -μ_B * m * B. Since the energy is -μ·B, it becomes μ_B * m * B. This explains the paramagnetic term.

Regarding the transition energy ΔE, it's determined by the energy difference between two Hydrogen atom states. The wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm corresponds to a photon emitted or absorbed during this transition. To calculate ΔE, I'll use the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c represents the speed of light. This confirms that energy of

Alright, let's work on determining how to compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy in a Hydrogen atom. The problem specifies that the magnetic field B is oriented along the Oz axis and we're considering small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m, with B set at 1 Tesla. The transition energy is linked to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Let’s dissect this step by step.

Firstly, the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian relates to the Zeeman effect. Regarding the orbital magnetic moment, the energy shift is given by ΔE_paramagnetic = -μ·B, where μ represents the magnetic moment. This magnetic moment μ is connected to the orbital angular momentum, specifically as μ = - (μ_B * m), with μ_B being the Bohr magneton and m the magnetic quantum number. Substituting this in, the energy shift becomes ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * m * B. Since B is in the same orientation, any negative signs might negate each other. Let’s double-check this formula. Yes, the Zeeman energy is defined as E = -μ·B, and if μ = -μ_B * m * ħ/ħ (because m is the projection), the units might agree. Actually, isn’t the Bohr magneton μ_B given by (eħ)/(2m_e)? Therefore, the energy is E = μ_B * B * m. Since μ = -μ_B * m * z_hat, the dot product with B (along z) results in -μ_B * m * B, but from E = -μ·B, it simplifies to μ_B * m * B. That’s the paramagnetic term.

Moving on to the transition energy ΔE, it’s characterized by the energy difference between two states in the Hydrogen atom. The wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm is associated with a photon either emitted or absorbed during the transition. The relation ΔE = hc/λ can be used to find ΔE, with h as Planck's constant and c as the speed of light. Confirming that: indeed, the energy of...

Since m is small (like m = 1, 0, -1, maybe), even though B is 1 T, I need to see how big μ_B is.\n\nLet me write down the constants:\n\nPlanck\'s constant h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s\n\nSpeed of light c = 3.00e8 m/s\n\nBohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) where e is elementary charge, ħ is reduced Planck\'s constant (h/(2π)), and m_e is electron mass.\n\nBut maybe I can just look up the value of μ_B. Let me recall: μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.\n\nYes, that\'s right. So μ_B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T.\n\nSo, for B = 1 T and m = 1 (since small m, maximum 1 maybe), the paramagnetic energy term is μ_B * B * m ≈ 9.27e-24 J.\n\nNow, compute ΔE from λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m.\n\nΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s)/(0.4861e-6 m)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.00e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m\n\nDivide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = (1.9878 / 0.4861) * 10^(-25 +6) = approx 4.09 * 10^-19 J\n\nSo ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 Joules.\n\nNow, compare this to the paramagnetic term, which is ~9.27e-24 J for m=1, B=1T.\n\nSo the ratio is paramagnetic term / ΔE ≈ 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.26e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.26e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.\n\nBut let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn\'t make a calculation error.\n\nFirst, μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T. So if B=1 T and m=1, then ΔE_paramagnetic = 9.274e-24 J.\n\nThen, ΔE_photon = hc/λ. Let\'s compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19 = approx 4.09 * 1e-19 J. So yes, 4.09e-19 J. Then 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ (9.27 / 4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26 * 1e-5. So 2.26e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.\n\nWait, but the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy". So the paramagnetic term is 1e-24, and the transition energy is 1e-19. So the ratio is 1e-24 / 1e-19 = 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. Hence, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.\n\nAlternatively, expressed as the paramagnetic term being ~10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Wait, but my calculation showed 2.26e-5, which is about 2e-5, so closer to 1e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5, so five orders of magnitude.\n\nBut let me check if I used the right units for everything. The energy from the photon is in Joules, same as the paramagnetic term. Yes, both are in Joules. So the ratio is unitless, and it\'s 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J, transition energy is 1e-19 J, so the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times smaller. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, or five orders of magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy, then it\'s ~1e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of approximately 10^5.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers once again.\n\nCompute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Correct.\n\nLambda is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. So 0.4861e-6 m. So hc/lambda = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19. Let\'s compute 1.9878 / 0.4861. 0.4861 * 4 = 1.9444. 1.9878 - 1.9444 = 0.0434. So 4 + 0.0434 / 0.4861 ≈ 4 + 0.089 ≈ 4.089. So approximately 4.089e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 J.\n\nParamagnetic term: μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.\n\nRatio: 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 9.274 / 4.09 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26e-5.\n\nSo that\'s 2.26e-5, which is approximately 1e-5 in order of magnitude. So the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J, transition energy is 1e-19 J, so the paramagnetic term is 5 orders of magnitude smaller.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another way this could be approached. For example, sometimes in atomic physics, energies are expressed in electronvolts. Let\'s see if converting to eV gives a better intuition.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So the transition energy ΔE is 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That makes sense, since visible light photons are on the order of a few eV. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, which is blue light, corresponding to the Balmer series in Hydrogen, probably the transition from n=4 to n=2 or something like that.

To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a Hydrogen atom, we start by calculating both terms.

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:
   The energy shift due to the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman effect) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]
   where \(\mu_B\) is the Bohr magneton (\(9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\)), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m\) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (taken as 1 for small values). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Transition Energy**:
   The transition energy \(\Delta E\) corresponding to a wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\) is calculated using the photon energy formula:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Converting \(\lambda\) to meters (\(0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\)):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \cdot 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Comparison**:
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 2.26 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   This ratio indicates that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the order of magnitude ratio is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

photon is E = hc/λ, so the transition energy ΔE is equal to that.

So, first I need to compute ΔE from the given λ, and then compute the paramagnetic coupling term μ_B * B * m, and then compare their orders of magnitude. Since m is small (like m = 1, 0, -1, maybe), even though B is 1 T, I need to see how big μ_B is.

Let me write down the constants:

Planck's constant h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

Speed of light c = 3.00e8 m/s

Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) where e is elementary charge, ħ is reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)), and m_e is electron mass.

But maybe I can just look up the value of μ_B. Let me recall: μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

Yes, that's right. So μ_B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T.

So, for B = 1 T and m = 1 (since small m, maximum 1 maybe), the paramagnetic energy term is μ_B * B * m ≈ 9.27e-24 J.

Now, compute ΔE from λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s)/(0.4861e-6 m)

Let me compute that:

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.00e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = (1.9878 / 0.4861) * 10^(-25 +6) = approx 4.09 * 10^-19 J

So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 Joules.

Now, compare this to the paramagnetic term, which is ~9.27e-24 J for m=1, B=1T.

So the ratio is paramagnetic term / ΔE ≈ 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.26e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.26e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

But let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

First, μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T. So if B=1 T and m=1, then ΔE_paramagnetic = 9.274e-24 J.

Then, ΔE_photon = hc/λ. Let's compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19 = approx 4.09 * 1e-19 J. So yes, 4.09e-19 J. Then 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ (9.27 / 4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26 * 1e-5. So 2.26e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Wait, but the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy". So the paramagnetic term is 1e-24, and the transition energy is 1e-19. So the ratio is 1e-24 / 1e-19 = 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. Hence, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

Alternatively, expressed as the paramagnetic term being ~10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Wait, but my calculation showed 2.26e-5, which is about 2e-5, so closer to 1e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5, so five orders of magnitude.

But let me check if I used the right units for everything. The energy from the photon is in Joules, same as the paramagnetic term. Yes, both are in Joules. So the ratio is unitless, and it's 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J, transition energy is 1e-19 J, so the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times smaller. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, or five orders of magnitude.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy, then it's ~1e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of approximately 10^5.

But let me double-check the numbers once again.

Compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Correct.

Lambda is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. So 0.4861e-6 m. So hc/lambda = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19. Let's compute 1.9878 / 0.4861. 0.4861 * 4 = 1.9444. 1.9878 - 1.9444 = 0.0434. So 4 + 0.0434 / 0.4861 ≈ 4 + 0.089 ≈ 4.089. So approximately 4.089e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 J.

Paramagnetic term: μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Ratio: 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 9.274 / 4.09 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.26e-5.

So that's 2.26e-5, which is approximately 1e-5 in order of magnitude. So the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J, transition energy is 1e-19 J, so the paramagnetic term is 5 orders of magnitude smaller.

Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

But let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For example, sometimes in atomic physics, energies are expressed in electronvolts. Let's see if converting to eV gives a better intuition.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So the transition energy ΔE is 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That makes sense, since visible light photons are on the order of a few eV. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, which is blue light, corresponding to the Balmer series in Hydrogen, probably the transition from n=4 to n=2 or something like that. But maybe that's tangential.

The paramagnetic term is 9.27e-24 J, which is 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV, which is about 0.000058 eV. Comparing to 2.55 eV, so 0.000058 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, same ratio as before, 2.27e-5. So same conclusion.

Therefore, the paramagnetic energy is about 1e-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 1e5, so five orders of magnitude.

Therefore, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J, transition energy is 1e-19 J, so the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e5, or five orders of magnitude.

Hence, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

**Final Answer**
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the order of magnitude ratio is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is roughly on the order of 10^-5 times the transition energy.

First, calculating ΔE: hc/λ. h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value now defined), c=299792458 m/s. Let\'s use precise numbers. h*c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m. Then, λ=0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m. Wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm (since 1 μm=1e-6 m, so 0.4861e-6 m = 486.1e-9 m). Therefore, ΔE = 1.98644586e-25 / 486.1e-9 ≈ 4.086e-19 J. Yes, that\'s correct. 4.086e-19 J. Then, converting that to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.086e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That makes sense because 486.1 nm is the wavelength for the H-beta line in the Balmer series, corresponding to the transition from n=4 to n=2, which is about 2.55 eV. Therefore, the transition energy is approximately 2.55 eV.\n\nThe paramagnetic term is μ_B * B * m. μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T and m=1, ΔE_paramagnetic = 9.274e-24 J. To compare this to the transition energy in the same units: 4.086e-19 J. The ratio is 9.274e-24 / 4.086e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27 x 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller (since 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 2.27e-5 is about 0.0000227, so roughly 4.4e4 times smaller). Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. But since 2.27e-5 is ~2e-5, which is 10^-5 order. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5 compared to the transition energy. Thus, when comparing their orders of magnitude, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy. The problem asks to compare their orders of magnitude. So the paramagnetic term is of order 1e-23 J (9.27e-24 J) and transition energy is ~4e-19 J, so 1e-23 vs 1e-18 (since 4e-19 is ~0.4e-18). Wait, 4e-19 is 4 x 10^-19, which is 0.4 x 10^-18. So the transition energy is about 10^-18 J, and paramagnetic term is 10^-23 J. The ratio is 10^-23 / 10^-18 = 1e-5, so five orders of magnitude. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is five orders of magnitude smaller. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5 times smaller. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy ΔE.\n\nBut to confirm, 1e-23 divided by 1e-18 is indeed 1e-5, so five orders. Since 4e-19 is 4 x 1e-19, which is 0.4 x 1e-18, but that\'s still in the same order of magnitude as 1e-18. So the transition energy is ~1e-18 J, paramagnetic term ~1e-23 J, so 1e-23 / 1e-18 = 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times the transition energy, so five orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is of the order of 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5. So when asked to compare the order of magnitude, it\'s five orders of magnitude smaller.\n\nBut the problem states "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy". So the ratio is paramagnetic / transition = ~1e-5, so the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller, but more precisely five. Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. However, in the earlier calculation, the ratio was 2.27e-5, which is closer to 1e-5 than 1e-4. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 1e-5, so five orders of magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, the transition energy is approximately 4.09e-19 J, and paramagnetic term is 9.27e-24 J. Taking the ratio: 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. The order of magnitude is 1e-5, so the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is on the order of 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. Hence, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5. This would be the case for m=1, and since the problem mentions small m values (which are integers like m=0, ±1, ±2), the maximum would be for m=1 or 2. Even if m=2, the paramagnetic term would be ~2e-5 times the transition energy, still order 1e-5.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a Hydrogen atom under the given conditions, we analyze their respective magnitudes:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (ΔE_para):**  
   The energy shift due to the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\) (Bohr magneton)  
   - \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\)  
   - \(m = 1\) (small orbital magnetic quantum number).  

   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The energy corresponding to a photon with wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) (Planck constant)  
   - \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) (speed of light)  
   - \(\lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\).  

   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{para}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows the paramagnetic coupling term is **\(\sim 10^{-5}\)** times smaller than the transition energy.  

**Conclusion:**  
The paramagnetic coupling term is about **five orders of magnitude smaller** than the transition energy (\(\Delta E_{\text{para}} \sim 10^{-5} \cdot \Delta E\)).  

\boxed{10^{-5}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Let me check the units: λ is in micrometers, so converting to meters (0.4861e-6 m). h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. Plugging these into ΔE gives 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / 0.4861e-6. Calculating this should yield the transition energy in joules. Then, converting to electron volts might be helpful for comparison, but since we need the ratio, perhaps keeping both terms in joules is better.

Now, calculating the paramagnetic energy: μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T, and m is a small integer (say m=1). Therefore, ΔE_paramagnetic = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy ΔE would be (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 0.4861e-6. Let's compute that numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 J. Comparing the two energies: ΔE_paramagnetic (≈1e-23 J) vs. ΔE (≈4e-19 J). The ratio is 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is roughly on the order of 10^-5 times the transition energy. Alternatively, the transition energy is about 4.4e4 times larger than the paramagnetic term.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation steps again for accuracy. First, calculating ΔE: hc/λ. h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value now defined), c=299792458 m/s. Let's use precise numbers. h*c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m. Then, λ=0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m. Wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm (since 1 μm=1e-6 m, so 0.4861e-6 m = 486.1e-9 m). Therefore, ΔE = 1.98644586e-25 / 486.1e-9 ≈ 4.086e-19 J. Yes, that's correct. 4.086e-19 J. Then, converting that to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.086e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That makes sense because 486.1 nm is the wavelength for the H-beta line in the Balmer series, corresponding to the transition from n=4 to n=2, which is about 2.55 eV. Therefore, the transition energy is approximately 2.55 eV.

The paramagnetic term is μ_B * B * m. μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T and m=1, ΔE_paramagnetic = 9.274e-24 J. To compare this to the transition energy in the same units: 4.086e-19 J. The ratio is 9.274e-24 / 4.086e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27 x 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller (since 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 2.27e-5 is about 0.0000227, so roughly 4.4e4 times smaller). Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. But since 2.27e-5 is ~2e-5, which is 10^-5 order. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5 compared to the transition energy. Thus, when comparing their orders of magnitude, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy. The problem asks to compare their orders of magnitude. So the paramagnetic term is of order 1e-23 J (9.27e-24 J) and transition energy is ~4e-19 J, so 1e-23 vs 1e-18 (since 4e-19 is ~0.4e-18). Wait, 4e-19 is 4 x 10^-19, which is 0.4 x 10^-18. So the transition energy is about 10^-18 J, and paramagnetic term is 10^-23 J. The ratio is 10^-23 / 10^-18 = 1e-5, so five orders of magnitude. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is five orders of magnitude smaller. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5 times smaller. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy ΔE.

But to confirm, 1e-23 divided by 1e-18 is indeed 1e-5, so five orders. Since 4e-19 is 4 x 1e-19, which is 0.4 x 1e-18, but that's still in the same order of magnitude as 1e-18. So the transition energy is ~1e-18 J, paramagnetic term ~1e-23 J, so 1e-23 / 1e-18 = 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times the transition energy, so five orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is of the order of 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5. So when asked to compare the order of magnitude, it's five orders of magnitude smaller.

But the problem states "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy". So the ratio is paramagnetic / transition = ~1e-5, so the paramagnetic term is 1e-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller, but more precisely five. Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. However, in the earlier calculation, the ratio was 2.27e-5, which is closer to 1e-5 than 1e-4. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 1e-5, so five orders of magnitude.

Alternatively, the transition energy is approximately 4.09e-19 J, and paramagnetic term is 9.27e-24 J. Taking the ratio: 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. The order of magnitude is 1e-5, so the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is on the order of 10^-5 compared to the transition energy. Hence, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5. This would be the case for m=1, and since the problem mentions small m values (which are integers like m=0, ±1, ±2), the maximum would be for m=1 or 2. Even if m=2, the paramagnetic term would be ~2e-5 times the transition energy, still order 1e-5. Therefore, the conclusion holds.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a Hydrogen atom, we start by calculating both terms.

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:
   The energy shift due to the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]
   where \(\mu_B\) is the Bohr magneton (\(9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\)), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m\) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (taken as 1 for small values). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Transition Energy**:
   The transition energy \(\Delta E\) is calculated using the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Ratio Calculation**:
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}
   \]

Thus, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy is \(\boxed{10^{-5}}\).

wait, for hydrogen transitions, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. But perhaps here, since the problem gives a specific wavelength, we can just use the photon energy formula. Let me check: 0.4861 μm is in the visible range, possibly part of the Balmer series. For example, the H-beta line is around 486 nm, which matches this wavelength. So, the transition energy would correspond to that photon's energy.

Now, the problem asks to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (ΔE_paramagnetic) with the transition energy (ΔE). So, we need to compute both values and then take their ratio.

Let’s compute ΔE_paramagnetic first. Given B = 1 T, m is small (like m = 1, maybe? The problem says small values of m, so m = 1 is the first case). The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T. So, ΔE_paramagnetic = μ_B * B * m. Plugging in the numbers: 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. If m is 2 or 3, this term would be multiplied by that, but since m is small, let's just take m=1 for order of magnitude.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is calculated using λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 meters. Using ΔE = hc/λ. Planck’s constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Therefore, ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 0.4861e-6 m ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / 0.4861e-6 m ≈ 4.09e-19 J.

Now, the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy is ΔE_paramagnetic / ΔE ≈ 9.274e-24 J / 4.09e-19 J ≈ 2.267e-5. So, approximately 2.27 x 10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Wait, but let me check the units again. The paramagnetic term is in Joules, and the transition energy is also in Joules, so the ratio is unitless, as expected. Let me verify the calculations once more. Let's compute hc/λ:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but approx 6.626e-34)

c = 299,792,458 m/s ≈ 3e8 m/s

λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m

So hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 0.4861e-6

First compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19 ≈ 4.09 * 1e-19 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. That's correct.

Paramagnetic term: μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Ratio: 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ (9.274 / 4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.267 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27e-5. So yes, approximately 2.3e-5. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5.

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So when comparing their orders of magnitude, the paramagnetic term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller. Since 1e-5 is 10^-5, so the ratio is ~10^-5. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5.

But let me check if m is considered. The problem says "small values of m". The magnetic quantum number m for hydrogen can be integers from -l to +l. Since we're talking about orbital magnetic quantum number, and for Hydrogen, transitions would have Δm = 0, ±1. But the paramagnetic term here is for a particular m.

So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is of the order 1e-5 compared to the transition energy. So in boxed notation, \boxed{10^{-5}}.

**Final Answer**
The order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy is \boxed{10^{-5}}.
