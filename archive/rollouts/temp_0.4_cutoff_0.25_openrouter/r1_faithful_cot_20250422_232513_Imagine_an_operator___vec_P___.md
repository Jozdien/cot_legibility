# Original Question

Imagine an operator $\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\hbar)$.

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), we use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

Given the state vector \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), we first verify that it is normalized:

\[
| \psi_1 |^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 + | \psi_3 |^2 = \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]

Next, we compute the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\). The matrix form of \(P_z\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar, 0, -\hbar\). The expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \hbar + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 (-\hbar) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 + \frac{1}{4} (-\hbar) \right) = 0
\]

For \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\), the matrix form of \(P_z^2\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2\). The expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \hbar^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \hbar^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
\]

Thus, the uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Let me recall that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula:

ΔP_z = √[⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²]

So, first, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and then ⟨P_z²⟩. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that P_z is diagonal in this basis. Let me check the matrix for P_z provided.

The matrix for P_z has the first row (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), and third row (0, 0, -ℏ). So yes, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ on the diagonal. That makes sense because the basis states are eigenvectors of P_z. Each basis vector corresponds to a state with a definite P_z value, which are ℏ, 0, -ℏ for the first, second, and third components respectively.

Given the state vector ψ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. But we need to compute the uncertainty of P_z in this state.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is straightforward. The expectation value is the sum over the probabilities of each basis state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So, the state vector components are:

ψ₁ = -1/2

ψ₂ = 1/√2

ψ₃ = -1/2

But wait, probabilities are the square of the absolute values. Let me check normalization first. Let's compute the squared norm of ψ:

|ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² + |ψ₃|² = (1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (1/2)² = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this is just the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ℏ + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ℏ)

Compute each term:

|ψ₁|² = (1/2)² = 1/4

|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2

|ψ₃|² = (1/2)² = 1/4

Therefore,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0

Okay, so the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will just be the square of each diagonal entry. So the matrix for P_z² is:

First row: (ℏ², 0, 0)

Second row: (0, 0, 0)

Third row: (0, 0, ℏ²)

Wait, because (ℏ)^2 = ℏ², 0^2 = 0, (-ℏ)^2 = ℏ². So, the diagonal entries are ℏ², 0, ℏ². Wait, no. Wait, original P_z has entries (ℏ, 0, -ℏ) on the diagonal. So squaring each entry gives (ℏ², 0, ℏ²). So the P_z² matrix is diagonal with entries ℏ², 0, ℏ². Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is again the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by the squared eigenvalues.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ℏ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ℏ²

Plugging in the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)ℏ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ²

Therefore, the uncertainty squared is:

(ΔP_z)² = ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ℏ² - (0)² = (1/2)ℏ²

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of that, which is √(1/2)ℏ = ℏ / √2

But let me confirm the calculation again to be sure.

First, ⟨P_z⟩: since the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ. The coefficients are -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values. Since the coefficients are real here (except for possible phase factors, but the given state has real components), so the probabilities are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4). Then, the expectation value is 1/4 * ℏ + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * (-ℏ) = 0. That's correct.

Then, ⟨P_z²⟩ is 1/4 * ℏ² + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². So variance is 1/2 ℏ², so uncertainty is ℏ / √2. That seems right.

Wait, but let me check if P_z squared is actually diagonal with entries ℏ², 0, ℏ². The original P_z matrix is diagonal with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ. Therefore, P_z squared would be:

[ℏ 0 0       [ℏ 0 0       [ℏ² 0  0
0 0 0   *   0 0 0   =    0  0  0
0 0 -ℏ]      0 0 -ℏ]       0  0 ℏ²]

Yes, because matrix multiplication of a diagonal matrix with itself squares each diagonal entry. So the (3,3) entry is (-ℏ)^2 = ℏ². Therefore, P_z² is indeed diagonal with entries ℏ², 0, ℏ². Therefore, my calculation is correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty is ℏ / √2. So the answer should be ℏ divided by square root of 2. So in boxed form, \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

But let me just think again. The state given is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. The question is about the uncertainty in P_z. Since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z (unless the uncertainty is zero), which it isn't here because we have a superposition of different P_z eigenstates. Therefore, the uncertainty should be non-zero, which it is. So the answer makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. For example, since the state is given as a column vector in the P_z basis, and we are to compute the uncertainty in P_z, which is straightforward as done above. Another way to check is to compute the expectation values by explicit matrix multiplication.

Let me try that. The state vector is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

Compute ⟨P_z⟩: ψ† P_z ψ. ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since ψ has real components, it's just the transpose.

So ψ† P_z ψ = [ -1/2  1/√2  -1/2 ] * P_z * [ -1/2 ]
                                           [ 1/√2 ]
                                           [ -1/2 ]

But since P_z is diagonal, the multiplication is straightforward. Each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So:

First component: (-1/2) * ℏ

Second component: (1/√2) * 0

Third component: (-1/2) * (-ℏ) = (1/2)ℏ

So adding them up: (-1/2)ℏ + 0 + (1/2)ℏ = 0. Same as before.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, same approach:

ψ† P_z² ψ = [ -1/2  1/√2  -1/2 ] * P_z² * [ -1/2 ]
                                            [ 1/√2 ]
                                            [ -1/2 ]

Again, P_z² is diagonal with entries ℏ², 0, ℏ².

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ℏ² = (1/4)ℏ²

Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0

Third component: (-1/2)^2 * ℏ² = (1/4)ℏ²

Total: (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². So same result.

Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So yes, the answer is correct.

I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

I need to determine the uncertainty ΔP_z for the operator P_z when the system is in a particular eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty is calculated using the formula:

ΔP_z = √[⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²]

To proceed, I must calculate both the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The state vector is represented as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, suggesting that P_z is diagonal in this basis. I'll verify this by examining the provided matrix for P_z.

Looking at the matrix for P_z, I see that the first row is (ℏ, 0, 0), the second row is (0, 0, 0), and the third row is (0, 0, -ℏ). This confirms it's a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ. This is logical since the basis states are eigenvectors of P_z, with each basis vector corresponding to a state with definite P_z values of ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the first, second, and third components respectively.

The state vector ψ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. To find the uncertainty of P_z in this state, I'll start by calculating ⟨P_z⟩.

So here, since P_z is diagonal, the given state\'s components directly relate to the eigenstates of P_z, so no need for any change of basis. Hence, the calculation is straightforward.

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), we use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

Given the state vector \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\) in the basis of eigenvectors of \(P_z\), we first check the normalization of the state:

\[
| \psi_1 |^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 + | \psi_3 |^2 = \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]

The state is normalized. Next, we compute the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\). The matrix for \(P_z\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), \(0\), and \(-\hbar\). The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the state components:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \hbar + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) 0 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) (-\hbar) = 0
\]

Next, we compute \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\). The matrix \(P_z^2\) has eigenvalues \(\hbar^2\), \(0\), and \(\hbar^2\) on the diagonal:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \hbar^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) 0 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
\]

Finally, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

² = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Good, it's normalized.

So, the probabilities are:

For the first basis state (P_z = ℏ): |ψ₁|² = 1/4

For the second basis state (P_z = 0): |ψ₂|² = 1/2

For the third basis state (P_z = -ℏ): |ψ₃|² = 1/4

Therefore, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ℏ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4 - ℏ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will just be the square of the diagonal entries. Let's see:

P_z² matrix would have entries (ℏ², 0, 0) in the first row, (0, 0, 0) in the second, and (0, 0, (-ℏ)²) = (0, 0, ℏ²) in the third. So the diagonal entries are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the squared eigenvalues:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)(ℏ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ℏ²) = (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is √[⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²] = √[(1/2)ℏ² - 0] = √(1/2)ℏ = (ℏ)/√2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the P_z matrix exactly diagonal with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ? The problem statement says: "matrix form of the operator P_z has components in the first row as (ℏ, 0, 0), that in the second row as (0, 0, 0) and that in the third row as (0,0, -ℏ)". Yes, that's correct. So P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ. Therefore, when we square it, we get ℏ², 0, ℏ² on the diagonal.

The state vector is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me confirm again the probabilities. The square of the absolute value of each component:

First component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2

Third component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So probabilities sum to 1, which is good. Therefore, expectation value of P_z is indeed 0. Then, expectation value of P_z squared is (1/4)(ℏ²) + (1/4)(ℏ²) = 1/2 ℏ². Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So that should be the answer.

But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, maybe the state is not given in the eigenbasis of P_z? Wait, the problem says "the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z." So yes, the given state is expressed in the basis where P_z is diagonal, so the components directly give the probabilities for P_z measurements.

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in the calculation? Let's see: ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ℏ + 0 + (1/4)(-ℏ) = 0. Correct. ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)ℏ² + 0 + (1/4)ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ / sqrt(2). That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in some units where ℏ is 1, but the answer should include ℏ. Since the matrices have ℏ in their components, the answer should indeed have ℏ. So ΔP_z = ℏ / √2.

Therefore, the uncertainty is ℏ divided by the square root of 2. Let me check if I can write that as (ℏ)/√2, which is equivalent to ℏ√(1/2). Either form is acceptable, but the former is more standard.

So, I think that's the answer. But let me think again: when you have a state expressed in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is straightforward as the sum of |c_i|^2 times eigenvalues. So here, since P_z is diagonal, the given state's components directly relate to the eigenstates of P_z, so no need for any change of basis. Hence, the calculation is straightforward. Therefore, the uncertainty is indeed ℏ over root two.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

To determine the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the given eigenstate of \(P_x\), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

The state vector is given as \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), and the matrix form of \(P_z\) is diagonal with entries \((\hbar, 0, -\hbar)\).

First, we calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\):

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \hbar + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 (-\hbar)
\]

Substituting the components of \(\psi\):

\[
|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0
\]

Next, we calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\):

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \hbar^2 + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 \hbar^2
\]

Substituting the components of \(\psi\):

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}
\]

Finally, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

= 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So, the state is properly normalized.

Now, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies to:

⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ℏ + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ℏ) 

Plugging in the values:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ℏ + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * (-ℏ) = (ℏ/4 - ℏ/4) = 0

So, the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. Therefore, the diagonal entries of P_z² are (ℏ², 0, ℏ²). Thus, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ℏ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ℏ² 

Again, substituting the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ℏ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ℏ² = (ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/2

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is:

ΔP_z = √[⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²] = √[ℏ²/2 - 0] = √(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / √2

But let me verify this calculation again to ensure there are no mistakes.

First, confirming the components of the state vector and their probabilities:

ψ₁ = -1/2, |ψ₁|² = 1/4

ψ₂ = 1/√2, |ψ₂|² = 1/2

ψ₃ = -1/2, |ψ₃|² = 1/4

So, when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, each term is:

First component: 1/4 * ℏ

Second component: 1/2 * 0

Third component: 1/4 * (-ℏ)

Adding these gives 1/4 ℏ - 1/4 ℏ = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, first component: 1/4 * ℏ²

Second component: 1/2 * 0

Third component: 1/4 * ℏ²

Total: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 ℏ². So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = ℏ²/2.

Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2). That seems right.

Alternatively, sqrt(1/2) ℏ, which is equivalent. So, the answer should be ℏ divided by square root of 2.

But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, did I correctly use the state vector components? The components given are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Squaring each component's magnitude gives 1/4, 1/2, 1/4. Correct. The eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So, the first component corresponds to eigenvalue ℏ, second to 0, third to -ℏ. So when computing ⟨P_z⟩, the first term is 1/4 * ℏ, the third term is 1/4 * (-ℏ), which cancels. Correct.

Similarly, for ⟨P_z²⟩, the eigenvalues squared would be ℏ², 0, ℏ². So, same coefficients, leading to 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty is ℏ / √2.

But let me verify once more. Suppose I compute the expectation value using matrix multiplication explicitly. The state vector is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (ℏ, 0, -ℏ). So, P_z ψ would be [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]^T

Then, ψ† P_z ψ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by P_z ψ.

But since the components are real (except for possible phase factors, but given the components are all real numbers, the state is real), so ψ† is just the transpose. So:

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]^T

= (-1/2)(-ℏ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ℏ/2)

= (ℏ/4) + 0 - (ℏ/4) = 0. Correct.

Similarly, for P_z squared, the matrix is diagonal with entries (ℏ², 0, ℏ²). So, P_z² ψ is [ ℏ²*(-1/2), 0, ℏ²*(-1/2) ]^T. Then, ψ† P_z² ψ is:

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ℏ²/2, 0, -ℏ²/2 ]^T

= (-1/2)(-ℏ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ℏ²/2)

= (ℏ²/4) + 0 + (ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/2. Correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty is indeed √(ℏ²/2) = ℏ/√2.

Just to make sure, let's recall that the general formula for uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. Since the expectation of P_z is zero, the uncertainty is just the square root of the expectation of P_z squared. Which we found to be ℏ²/2. So, square root of that is ℏ divided by sqrt(2). So, the answer is ℏ over square root of 2.

Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator, it can be written as (ℏ sqrt(2))/2, but usually, ℏ / sqrt(2) is acceptable.

I think that should be the answer. Let me check once more for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). When taking the squared magnitudes, the signs don't matter, so indeed, each of the first and third components have magnitude 1/2, squared gives 1/4. The middle component is 1/√2, squared is 1/2. So, probabilities sum to 1. Correct.

The eigenvalues for P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So, the expectation value is (1/4)(ℏ) + (1/4)(-ℏ) = 0. Correct. The expectation value of P_z squared is (1/4)(ℏ²) + (1/4)(ℏ²) = ℏ²/2. Correct.

Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So, I think this is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

To calculate the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the given eigenstate of \(P_x\), we follow these steps:

1. **Verify Normalization of the State Vector**:
   The state vector is \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}\).
   
   Compute the squared norm:
   \[
   |\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 + |\psi_3|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
   \]
   The state is normalized.

2. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   Since \(P_z\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar, 0, -\hbar\):
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0
   \]

3. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   \(P_z^2\) has diagonal entries \(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2\):
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2
   \]

4. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\)

Wait, but the components are -1/2, 1/√2, and -1/2. The squares would be (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So the state is properly normalized.

Now, ⟨P_z⟩ is:

ψ† P_z ψ = sum over i |ψ_i|² * (P_z)_ii.

But since the basis vectors are eigenstates of P_z, the expectation value is:

( |ψ₁|² * ℏ ) + ( |ψ₂|² * 0 ) + ( |ψ₃|² * (-ℏ) )

Which is ( (1/4) * ℏ ) + (1/2 * 0 ) + (1/4 * (-ℏ) ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Next, compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² would be the matrix with diagonal entries (ℏ², 0, ℏ²). Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

|ψ₁|² * ℏ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ℏ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ².

Therefore, ΔP_z = √[⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²] = √[(1/2)ℏ² - 0] = √(1/2)ℏ = ℏ / √2.

Hence, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ℏ divided by the square root of 2.
