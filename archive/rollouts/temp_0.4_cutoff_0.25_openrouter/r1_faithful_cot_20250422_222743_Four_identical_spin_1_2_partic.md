# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by noting that each energy level \( E_n = n^2E \) (where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \)) can hold at most two particles due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

### Ground State
For the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \) (energy \( E_1 = E \))
- Two particles in \( n=2 \) (energy \( E_2 = 4E \))

Total energy: \( 2E + 2 \times 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

### First Excited State
The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level \( n=2 \) to the next available level \( n=3 \):
- Two particles in \( n=1 \)
- One particle in \( n=2 \)
- One particle in \( n=3 \) (energy \( E_3 = 9E \))

Total energy: \( 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

### Second Excited State
The second excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving:
- One particle in \( n=1 \)
- Two particles in \( n=2 \)
- One particle in \( n=3 \)

Total energy: \( E + 2 \times 4E + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

### Final Answer
- Ground state energy: \(\boxed{10E}\)
- First excited state energy: \(\boxed{15E}\)
- Second excited state energy: \(\boxed{18E}\)

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Let me start by recalling what I know about particles in a 1D infinite well. 

First, the energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = n²E, where E is the unit energy defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each energy level is quantized and increases with the square of the quantum number n. Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. In other words, each spatial orbital can hold at most two particles with opposite spins.

Now, for multiple particles, we need to fill the lowest energy levels while respecting the Pauli principle. Let me think: for four particles, since each energy level can hold two particles (one spin up and one spin down), we would fill the lowest two energy levels with two particles each. Wait, but hold on—if each energy level can have two particles, then for four particles, you would fill the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) each with two particles. That would give the ground state. But let me make sure.

But wait, no. Wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states. So each spatial orbital (each n) can have two electrons (or particles). So for four particles, you need two spatial orbitals. Each with two particles. So n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So total of four particles. That would be the ground state. Then the first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next energy level. Hmm. Wait, but how does that work with fermions?

Wait, maybe I should list the possible states systematically. Let's think of the possible configurations. For fermions, each quantum state is defined by a unique combination of spatial quantum number n and spin. But since the particles are identical, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So we need to construct Slater determinants for the system.

But maybe for the purpose of determining the energy levels, we can just consider the occupation of the spatial orbitals, since the energy doesn't depend on spin. So each spatial orbital (n) can have at most two particles (spin up and spin down). So for four particles, the lowest energy configuration would be filling the lowest two orbitals: two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Then the total energy would be 2E_1 + 2E_2. Since E_n = n²E, E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E. So total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. That would be the ground state.

Then, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration with higher energy. To get the first excited state, we need to promote one of the particles from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next available orbital (n=3). But wait, if we have two particles in n=1, two in n=2, that's four particles. If we promote one from n=2 to n=3, then we'd have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But since each spatial orbital can hold two particles, having one in n=2 and one in n=3 is allowed. But is that the next lowest energy?

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me check. The energy levels go n=1 (E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), n=4 (16E), etc. So if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. But wait, another possibility: if instead of promoting one from n=2 to n=3, maybe there's another configuration where we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But no, since n=1 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible. So the first excited state must be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. But wait, does that configuration have a higher energy than another possible configuration?

Wait, could there be a configuration where we have two in n=1, two in n=3? But that would require promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. The energy for that would be 2E + 2*9E = 20E, which is higher than 15E, so 15E would be lower. So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but let me think again. When you have multiple particles, the excited states can sometimes be determined by the total energy of the system. The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy. The first excited state is the next lowest total energy, and so on. So in the ground state, we have filled up to n=2. To get the first excited state, we need to have the next possible configuration where the total energy is just higher than the ground state. If we consider the possible ways to arrange four fermions in the energy levels, the next configuration would be when one particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So that gives two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy: 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Alternatively, what if we promote two particles from n=2 to n=3? Then we would have two in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy would be 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. That's higher than 15E, so 15E is indeed the first excited state.

Then, the second excited state would be the next one. What's the next possible configuration? After 15E, the next higher total energy could be either promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. But wait, no, because we had two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote the remaining one in n=2 to n=3, we get two in n=1 and two in n=3. That's 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 is already filled with two particles. To promote a particle from n=1 to a higher level, you would need to have an available slot in a higher level, but since n=2 is partially filled. Wait, but in the first excited state, we have one particle in n=2. So to promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 already has one particle. Since each spatial orbital can take two, we can add another one there. Wait, but in the ground state, we had two in n=2. Then in the first excited state, we have one in n=2. So is there a configuration where we have two in n=1, two in n=2, but also some in higher levels? Wait, no. Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't necessarily promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Let's think again. Let's list all possible configurations for four particles and calculate their total energies.

Possible configurations:

1. All four particles in the lowest two levels: two in n=1, two in n=2. Energy: 2E + 8E = 10E (ground state).

2. Next, configurations where one particle is in a higher level. The possible ways:

   a. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

   b. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.

   c. One in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, but n=1 can't have one if we are promoting from n=2. Wait, no. If we start from the ground state (two in n=1, two in n=2), promoting one from n=2 to n=3 gives two, one, one. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. But n=1 can only have two particles. If we have one in n=1, that would mean we have a hole there. But that would require that one particle was promoted from n=1 to n=3. But promoting a particle from n=1 (which is lower) to n=3 (higher) would require more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. So the energy for that configuration would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, which is higher than 15E. So 15E is lower.

So between the options, 15E is the lowest possible excited state. Then the next one would be either 18E or 20E. Which one is lower? 18E vs. 20E. 18E is lower. So is there a configuration with 18E?

Wait, how would that configuration look? If we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So total energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But how does that configuration arise? To get that, you have to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. So if you promote one of them to n=3, you leave one in n=1, and add one in n=3. But then n=2 is still filled with two. So the configuration would be (1, 2, 1). Wait, but in terms of energy, that's 1 + 2*4 + 9 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E. Whereas the configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 is 15E. So 15E is lower, so that's the first excited state.

Then the next would be 18E. But is there a configuration with energy between 15E and 18E? Let's see. For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. That's 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E. Which is higher. Or two in n=1, two in n=3: 2 + 18 = 20E. Also higher. Or one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E. So 18E is next. So then the second excited state would be 18E. But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where three particles are in higher orbitals. Let me check.

Wait, but another thought. If we have four particles, and we can have different combinations. For example, maybe having two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E), or two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4 (2 + 9 + 16 = 27E). That's higher. Alternatively, promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3: 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E). So 20E. So the order seems to be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited), then 20E, etc.

Wait, but is 18E indeed a valid configuration? Let me verify. To get 18E, we need one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But how is that possible? Since the Pauli exclusion principle allows two particles per spatial orbital. So n=1 has one particle (either spin up or down), n=2 has two particles (both spins), and n=3 has one particle. Is that allowed? Yes. Because each spatial orbital can have up to two. So n=2 is filled with two, n=1 has one, and n=3 has one. So that's four particles in total. So that configuration is allowed.

But why is this configuration higher in energy than the one with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, 15E is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. 18E is one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. So in the first case, we have more particles in lower orbitals. So why is 15E lower than 18E? Let me compute the energies again.

Wait, 2E (from n=1) + 4E (from n=2) + 9E (from n=3) = 15E. For the other configuration, 1E (from n=1) + 8E (from n=2) + 9E (from n=3) = 18E. So yes, 15E is lower. So promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 would actually increase the energy. Wait, but how do you promote from n=1 to n=2? In the ground state, n=1 is full. To promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, you need to have an available slot in n=2. But in the ground state, n=2 is already full. So you can't promote from n=1 to n=2. So the first excited state must involve promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3. Hence, the 15E configuration. Then, the next excited state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, but since there's only one left in n=2, you can't do that. Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, n=2 has one particle left. So to get another excited state, you can either promote that remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (total energy 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E). Or, alternatively, promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (total energy 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E). So which of these comes first? 18E is lower than 20E, so 18E would be the second excited state, then 20E would be the third.

But wait, how do you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3? In the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. To promote one of them, you have to move it to a higher energy level. But you can't just move it to n=2 because n=2 is already filled in the ground state. So to promote a particle from n=1, you have to move it to n=3 or higher. But moving it to n=3 would require more energy than moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. So in the first excited state, we moved a particle from n=2 to n=3 (since that requires less energy). Then, for the second excited state, perhaps moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 is not possible because there's only one left. So then, the next possible is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. So that gives the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). Then, moving the last particle from n=2 to n=3 gives two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). Then, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4 would give another configuration, but that would be even higher.

So in that case, the order would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

But let me check again if there are any other possible configurations with total energy between 15E and 18E. For example, could we have a configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4? That would be 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E, which is higher. Or one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3. That would be 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E. So no, those are higher. So 18E is indeed the next after 15E.

Alternatively, if we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles. So three in n=2 is not allowed. Similarly, other combinations might not be possible due to the Pauli exclusion.

Therefore, I think the energies are:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the configuration for 18E. The configuration is one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Let's count the particles: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Correct. Each spatial orbital is within the occupancy limit: n=1 has one (allowed), n=2 has two (allowed), n=3 has one (allowed). So that's a valid configuration.

But how does this configuration compare in energy to another possible one where we have two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. Wait, that would be 2 + 9 + 16 = 27E. Which is higher. So no. So 18E is indeed the next.

Alternatively, could we have a configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, but with different spins? But spin doesn't affect the energy, so the total energy remains the same. So all such configurations with the same spatial occupation have the same energy.

Therefore, I think the conclusion is correct. Ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{18E}.

Okay, so I need to figure out the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Let me start by recalling what I know about particles in a 1D infinite well. 

First, the energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = n²E, where E is the unit energy defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each energy level is quantized and increases with the square of the quantum number n.

But wait, no. Wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states. So each spatial orbital (each n) can have two electrons (or particles). So for four particles, you need two spatial orbitals. Each with two particles. So n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So total of four particles. That would be the ground state.

Then, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration with higher energy. To get the first excited state, we need to promote one of the particles from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next available orbital (n=3).

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me check. The energy levels go n=1 (E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), n=4 (16E), etc. So if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. But wait, another possibility: if instead of promoting one from n=2 to n=3, maybe there's another configuration where we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But no, since n=1 can only hold two particle

# Anthropic completion

Let me analyze the energy states for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'll start by reviewing the fundamental properties of such a system.

For a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = n²E, where E represents the unit energy π²ħ²/(2mL²). Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 fermions, they must follow the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This means each spatial orbital can accommodate a maximum of two particles, provided they have opposite spins.

When arranging multiple particles, we need to fill the lowest available energy levels while adhering to the Pauli principle. For four particles, let me think about how to distribute them. Since each energy level can hold two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down), I would place two particles in the n=1 level and two particles in the n=2 level to achieve the ground state configuration.

Let me verify this: with two particles in the n=1 orbital and two in the n=2 orbital, we have a total of four particles. This should constitute the ground state. The energy calculation would be 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1²E) + 2(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E for the ground state.

To determine the first excited state, I need to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). This would give a configuration of two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The corresponding energy would be 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

I should consider whether there might be alternative configurations with lower energy. Looking at the energy progression: n=1 (E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), n=4 (16E), etc., I need to determine if any other arrangement could produce a lower excited state energy than 15E. However, since n=1 can only accommodate two particles due to the Pauli principle, the configuration of two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 appears to be the first excited state.

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Let me review what I know about particles in such a well.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are E_n = n²E, where E is the unit energy defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). These energy levels are quantized and increase with the square of the quantum number n. Given that the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, they adhere to the Pauli exclusion principle, which means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state—each spatial orbital can accommodate a maximum of two particles with opposite spins.

For multiple particles, we need to populate the lowest energy levels while adhering to the Pauli principle. For four particles, since each energy level can hold two particles (one spin up and one spin down), we fill the two lowest energy levels with two particles each. If each energy level can occupy two particles, for four particles, we fill the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) with two particles each, forming the ground state. Let me ensure this is correct.

Remember, spin-1/2 particles have two potential spin states, allowing two particles (of opposite spins) per spatial orbital. Thus, for four particles, two spatial orbitals are needed with two particles each: n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). This configuration represents the ground state. The first excited state occurs when one particle is moved to the next energy level, but how does this apply to fermions?

To systematically explore the possible states, let's consider the configurations for fermions, each quantum state distinguished by a unique combination of spatial quantum number n and spin. Since the particles are identical, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric upon exchange, constructed using Slater determinants.

However, to determine energy levels, we can examine the occupation of spatial orbitals, as energy isn't spin-dependent. Each spatial orbital (n) may contain at most two particles (one spin up, one down). In the lowest energy configuration, the system fills the first two orbitals: two particles in n=1 and two in n=2, resulting in a total energy of 2E_1 + 2E_2. Given E_n = n²E, E_1 = E and E_2 = 4E, the total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E, constituting the ground state.

The first excited state is the nearest configuration with higher energy. To reach the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next available orbital (n=3). Thus, we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Having one particle in n=2 and one in n=3 is permissible, given that each spatial orbital can contain up to two particles, but is this the next lowest energy?

Let's verify if there's another configuration. Energy levels are ordered as n=1 (E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), n=4 (16E), etc. With two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the total energy becomes 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, could there be another setup, such as three particles in n=1 and one in n=2? That wouldn't work, as n=1 can only hold two particles.

But the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, if we have two in n=1, two in n=3? That would have higher energy: 2E + 2*9E = 20E, which is higher. So 15E is lower. So 15E is the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be when we promote another particle. Let's see. From the first excited state (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3), the next step would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So then we have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Then the total energy is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we have another configuration? For example, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4? Let's see: if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be E + 8E + 16E = 25E, which is higher than 20E. So 20E is lower. Alternatively, promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. So that's the same as promoting one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3. So that would be 20E. So that's the second excited state.\n\nWait, but wait—is there another configuration between 15E and 20E? Let me check. What if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Hmm. Or two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4? 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. So higher. So the next possible is 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting one from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 can only have two particles. If we take one from n=1 and put it in n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, that's lower than 20E. But is that possible? Wait, if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But how many particles is that? 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So that is allowed. But how does that compare energy-wise?\n\nWait, in the ground state, we had two in n=1 and two in n=2 (total 10E). The first excited state was two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). Then this configuration is one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (E + 8E + 9E = 18E). Wait, but 18E is lower than 20E. So why didn't we consider that as the first excited state? Hmm. Because maybe that configuration isn't possible due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Wait, why would it not be possible? Let me think.\n\nEach spatial orbital can hold two particles with opposite spins. So in the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3: n=1 has one particle, n=2 has two particles (which is allowed), and n=3 has one particle. So that's four particles in total. So that should be allowed. But why is the energy lower than the previous first excited state? Wait, no, the energy would actually be E (from n=1) + 2*4E (from two in n=2) + 9E (from n=3). Wait, no, if you have two particles in n=2, each contributes 4E, so total 8E. Then one in n=1 (E) and one in n=3 (9E). So total energy is E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But 18E is less than 15E? Wait, no, 18E is more than 15E. Wait, 15E is 2E + 4E + 9E. Wait, 2E (two in n=1) + 4E (one in n=2) + 9E (one in n=3) = 15E. Whereas the other configuration is 1E (one in n=1) + 8E (two in n=2) + 9E (one in n=3) = 18E. So 18E is higher than 15E. Therefore, the configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 is lower in energy (15E) than the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, and the next is 18E? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recast this. The ground state is two in n=1 and two in n=2 (10E). To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So that would leave two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, if we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy here is 1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Since 15E is lower than 18E, the first excited state must be 15E, as promoting from n=2 to n=3 is a smaller energy jump than promoting from n=1 to n=3. So the first excited state is indeed 15E.\n\nThen, the next excited state would be promoting another particle. Which particle? From where? If we have the first excited state as two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. The next possible promotion could be either promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy here is 2*1E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4. Let's see: if we take one from n=1 and put it in n=4, we would have one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy here is 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. Which is higher than 20E, so that's not the second excited state. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4? But n=3 already has one particle. Promoting that would leave two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Still higher than 20E. Alternatively, promoting the other particle from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. That's 20E. So that's the next possible. Then, 20E is the second excited state. \n\nBut wait, is there another configuration with energy between 15E and 20E? Let's think. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already partially filled. Wait, but n=2 can hold two particles. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, then n=1 would have one, n=2 would have two, and n=3 has one. Wait, but that's the same as the 18E configuration. Which is higher than 15E. So no, that's higher. Alternatively, promoting from n=3 to n=4? That would be even higher. So the next possible is 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Wait, that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. That's higher than 20E. So no. Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. Higher. So no. So the next is 20E.\n\nAlternatively, is there a configuration where we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E). Which is lower than 20E. So is 18E lower than 20E? Yes. So then, why isn't 18E the second excited state? Because we need to consider the order of promoting particles. The first excited state is 15E. Then promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E. But if we can instead promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in 18E, which is lower than 20E. So then, which comes first? Which is lower in energy: 18E or 20E? Since 18E is less than 20E, then 18E would be the second excited state, and 20E the third. But wait, perhaps the way the particles are promoted matters. Let's think about the possible transitions.\n\nIn the ground state (10E), the highest occupied energy level is n=2. The first excited state is created by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E. Then, the next possible promotion could be either promoting the other particle from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in 20E) or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (resulting in 18E). But which of these requires less energy? The energy difference between n=2 and n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. The energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So promoting from n=2 to n=3 costs 5E, whereas promoting from n=1 to n=3 costs 8E. Therefore, the next promotion after the first excited state would be promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3 (costing 5E) rather than promoting from n=1 (which would cost more). Therefore, the second excited state is 20E, not 18E. Wait, but the total energy is additive. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the first excited state (15E), if we promote the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, we remove 4E and add 9E, so net +5E, making total 15E +5E=20E. Alternatively, if we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we remove 1E and add 9E, so net +8E, making total 15E +8E=23E. Wait, but that's not correct. Because in the first excited state (15E), we already have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we need to have an empty slot in n=3. But n=3 already has one particle. Since each spatial orbital can hold two particles, promoting another to n=3 is allowed. So promoting one from n=1 to n=3 would result in one in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy would be 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. So that's higher than 20E. So perhaps the order is: ground state (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (20E). But then where does 18E come in? If we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (total 18E), how is that achieved? To get there, you would have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But in the ground state, n=2 is already filled with two particles. So you can't promote another to n=2. Wait, unless you first promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, then from n=1 to n=2. But that would require two promotions, which would lead to higher energy states.\n\nWait, perhaps the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 isn't reachable by a single promotion from the ground state. Because to get there, you need to both promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 and promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But that would require two promotions, which would correspond to a higher excited state. Therefore, such a configuration would have higher energy than the first excited state. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, the second is 20E, and the third might be 18E or 23E. Wait, but this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me approach this systematically by considering all possible configurations and their energies. \n\nThe total number of particles is 4. Each spatial orbital n can hold 0, 1, or 2 particles. The total number of particles must be 4. The possible configurations (n1, n2, n3, ...) where n1 is the number of particles in the first orbital, n2 in the second, etc., such that the sum is 4 and each ni is 0,1, or 2.\n\nThe ground state is filling the lowest orbitals first with maximum 2 particles each. So n1=2, n2=2, n3=0, ... Energy: 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E.\n\nNext, the first excited state. To get the next lowest energy, we need the configuration with the lowest possible increase in energy. The highest occupied orbital in the ground state is n=2. Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 gives n1=2, n2=1, n3=1. Energy: 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\nThen, promoting the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 gives n1=2, n2=0, n3=2. Energy: 2*1E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nAlternatively, another way to get a higher energy is promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But in the ground state, n1 is filled with 2 particles. Promoting one from n=1 to n=3 would give n1=1, n2=2, n3=1. Energy: 1*1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But this configuration is higher in energy than 15E but lower than 20E. However, is this configuration accessible via a single promotion from the ground state?\n\nWait, to go from the ground state (2,2,0) to (1,2,1), you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. But that requires an energy of 9E - 1E = 8E per particle. Whereas promoting from n=2 to n=3 is 5E per particle. So the first excited state is 15E, then promoting another from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E. However, the configuration (1,2,1) is a separate configuration that is not reachable by a single promotion from the ground state. Wait, no, actually, you can reach it by promoting one from n=1 to n=3 directly. But that would require more energy. So the energy required to promote from n=1 to n=3 is higher than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is the one with the lower energy promotion (from n=2 to n=3), resulting in 15E. Then, the next possible promotion from the first excited state would be promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, resulting in 20E. However, if you have enough energy, you could also promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but that requires more energy. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:\n\n1. Ground state: 10E\n\n2. First excited: 15E\n\n3. Second excited: 18E\n\n4. Third excited: 20E\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So up to the second excited state. Therefore, the second excited state would be 18E? But according to the energy levels, 15E is first, then 18E, then 20E. So if the question is asking for up to the second excited state, then 18E would be the second. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the configuration (1,2,1) is not allowed due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Let me check. In the configuration (1,2,1), n=1 has one particle (spin up or down), n=2 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=3 has one particle (spin up or down). So all particles are in distinct quantum states. Therefore, this configuration is allowed. Therefore, the energy of this state is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Therefore, the order is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, etc. So the first excited state is 15E, the second is 18E, and the third is 20E. Therefore, if the question is asking for the ground state, first, and second excited states, the answer would be 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. Let me check the possible configurations again:\n\nGround state: (2,2,0) = 10E\n\nFirst excited: (2,1,1) = 15E\n\nSecond excited: (1,2,1) = 18E\n\nThird excited: (2,0,2) = 20E\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration with the same energy as 18E. For example, (2,1,1,1). But that would require four particles: 2+1+1+0=4, but (2,1,1,1) sums to 5. Not allowed. So no. Alternatively, (1,1,2). But that would be 1E +4E +18E=23E. Higher. So no. So the possible configurations in order of increasing energy are:\n\n1. 10E\n\n2. 15E\n\n3. 18E\n\n4. 20E\n\nTherefore, the second excited state is 18E. So the answer would be ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But let me check another source or example to make sure.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is by considering the Fermi level. For four particles in a 1D box, with two particles per energy level. The filled levels would be n=1 and n=2. The Fermi energy would be n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. The next would be promoting another from n=2 to n=3, or promoting from n=1 to n=3. The energy required for promoting from n=2 to n=3 is less, so the first excited state is 15E, second is 20E. However, the configuration (1,2,1) is a different configuration that may have a different energy. But the question is, can that configuration be reached by a single promotion from the ground state?\n\nWait, no. To reach (1,2,1) from (2,2,0), you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. That requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, such a transition would occur at a higher energy. So in terms of the order of excited states, the first excited state is 15E (promoting from n=2 to n=3), the second excited state is 18E (promoting from n=1 to n=3), and the third is 20E (promoting the second particle from n=2 to n=3). Therefore, the answer would depend on whether promoting from n=1 is considered a separate excited state.\n\nBut in reality, when you have multiple ways to reach excited states, the one with the lowest energy difference comes first. Since promoting from n=2 to n=3 requires less energy (5E) than promoting from n=1 to n=3 (8E), the first excited state is 15E, then the next is 20E (another promotion from n=2 to n=3), then promoting from n=1 to n=3 would be 18E, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, the energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies. So if you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, the total energy increases by 5E (from 4E to 9E). If you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, the total energy increases by 8E (from 1E to 9E). Therefore, the configuration (2,1,1) is lower in energy than (1,2,1). Therefore, the order is:\n\n1. (2,2,0) = 10E\n\n2. (2,1,1) = 15E\n\n3. (1,2,1) = 18E\n\n4. (2,0,2) = 20E\n\n5. (1,1,2) = 23E\n\n6. etc.\n\nTherefore, the first three states are 10E, 15E, 18E. Hence, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut I need to confirm this with an example. Let's look at the hydrogen atom or similar systems. For fermions, the excited states are determined by the possible ways to promote particles to higher orbitals with the least energy cost. So the first promotion is the one that costs the least energy. In this case, promoting from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next (n=3) costs 5E. Promoting from a lower orbital (n=1) to a higher one (n=3) costs more (8E). Therefore, the order should be: ground state (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (18E), third excited (20E), etc.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 18E\n\nBut wait, another perspective: sometimes, when you have multiple particles, the excited states can also involve different spin configurations. But in this case, since the energy doesn't depend on spin, all the spin configurations for a given spatial occupation have the same energy. Therefore, they don't contribute to splitting of energy levels. Therefore, the energy is solely determined by the spatial occupation.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that after the ground state (10E), the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut let me check with a different approach. Let's list all possible distributions of 4 particles in the energy levels with each level holding at most 2 particles, and calculate their energies:\n\n1. [2,2,0,...] → 2*1 + 2*4 = 10E\n\n2. [2,1,1,0,...] → 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E\n\n3. [1,2,1,0,...] → 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E\n\n4. [2,0,2,0,...] → 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E\n\n5. [1,1,2,0,...] → 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E\n\n6. [1,1,1,1,...] → 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30E\n\nSo ordering these by energy:\n\n10E (1), 15E (2), 18E (3), 20E (4), 23E (5), 30E (6), etc.\n\nTherefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E, third excited 20E. Therefore, the answer to the original question is:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 18E\n\nTherefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ground state energy is \\boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \\boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \\boxed{18E}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386300, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6315, prompt_tokens=964, total_tokens=7279, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle and the energy levels of the system. Each spatial orbital (quantum number \( n \)) can hold at most two particles with opposite spins. The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy configuration is obtained by filling the lowest energy levels with two particles each.
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) and two particles in \( n = 2 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - Promote one particle from the highest occupied level \( n = 2 \) to the next available level \( n = 3 \).
   - Configuration: Two particles in \( n = 1 \), one particle in \( n = 2 \), and one particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - Promote one particle from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 3 \), resulting in a different configuration.
   - Configuration: One particle in \( n = 1 \), two particles in \( n = 2 \), and one particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

\[
\boxed{10E}, \quad \boxed{15E}, \quad \boxed{18E}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

. So you can't have three in n=1. So the next possible configuration is promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. So total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Is that the first excited state?

Wait, but maybe there's a lower energy configuration. If instead, we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, if we have two in n=1, two in n=3? That would have higher energy: 2E + 2*9E = 20E, which is higher. So 15E is lower. So 15E is the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be when we promote another particle. Let's see. From the first excited state (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3), the next step would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So then we have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Then the total energy is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we have another configuration? For example, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4? Let's see: if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be E + 8E + 16E = 25E, which is higher than 20E. So 20E is lower. Alternatively, promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. So that's the same as promoting one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3. So that would be 20E. So that's the second excited state.

Wait, but wait—is there another configuration between 15E and 20E? Let me check. What if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Hmm. Or two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4? 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. So higher. So the next possible is 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting one from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 can only have two particles. If we take one from n=1 and put it in n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, that's lower than 20E. But is that possible? Wait, if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But how many particles is that? 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So that is allowed. But how does that compare energy-wise?

Wait, in the ground state, we had two in n=1 and two in n=2 (total 10E). The first excited state was two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). Then this configuration is one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (E + 8E + 9E = 18E). Wait, but 18E is lower than 20E. So why didn't we consider that as the first excited state? Hmm. Because maybe that configuration isn't possible due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Wait, why would it not be possible? Let me think.

Each spatial orbital can hold two particles with opposite spins. So in the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3: n=1 has one particle, n=2 has two particles (which is allowed), and n=3 has one particle. So that's four particles in total. So that should be allowed. But why is the energy lower than the previous first excited state? Wait, no, the energy would actually be E (from n=1) + 2*4E (from two in n=2) + 9E (from n=3). Wait, no, if you have two particles in n=2, each contributes 4E, so total 8E. Then one in n=1 (E) and one in n=3 (9E). So total energy is E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But 18E is less than 15E? Wait, no, 18E is more than 15E. Wait, 15E is 2E + 4E + 9E. Wait, 2E (two in n=1) + 4E (one in n=2) + 9E (one in n=3) = 15E. Whereas the other configuration is 1E (one in n=1) + 8E (two in n=2) + 9E (one in n=3) = 18E. So 18E is higher than 15E. Therefore, the configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 is lower in energy (15E) than the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, and the next is 18E? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recast this. The ground state is two in n=1 and two in n=2 (10E). To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So that would leave two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, if we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy here is 1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Since 15E is lower than 18E, the first excited state must be 15E, as promoting from n=2 to n=3 is a smaller energy jump than promoting from n=1 to n=3. So the first excited state is indeed 15E.

Then, the next excited state would be promoting another particle. Which particle? From where? If we have the first excited state as two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. The next possible promotion could be either promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy here is 2*1E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4. Let's see: if we take one from n=1 and put it in n=4, we would have one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy here is 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. Which is higher than 20E, so that's not the second excited state. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4? But n=3 already has one particle. Promoting that would leave two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Still higher than 20E. Alternatively, promoting the other particle from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. That's 20E. So that's the next possible. Then, 20E is the second excited state. 

But wait, is there another configuration with energy between 15E and 20E? Let's think. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already partially filled. Wait, but n=2 can hold two particles. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, then n=1 would have one, n=2 would have two, and n=3 has one. Wait, but that's the same as the 18E configuration. Which is higher than 15E. So no, that's higher. Alternatively, promoting from n=3 to n=4? That would be even higher. So the next possible is 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Wait, that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. That's higher than 20E. So no. Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. Higher. So no. So the next is 20E.

Alternatively, is there a configuration where we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E). Which is lower than 20E. So is 18E lower than 20E? Yes. So then, why isn't 18E the second excited state? Because we need to consider the order of promoting particles. The first excited state is 15E. Then promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E. But if we can instead promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in 18E, which is lower than 20E. So then, which comes first? Which is lower in energy: 18E or 20E? Since 18E is less than 20E, then 18E would be the second excited state, and 20E the third. But wait, perhaps the way the particles are promoted matters. Let's think about the possible transitions.

In the ground state (10E), the highest occupied energy level is n=2. The first excited state is created by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E. Then, the next possible promotion could be either promoting the other particle from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in 20E) or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (resulting in 18E). But which of these requires less energy? The energy difference between n=2 and n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. The energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So promoting from n=2 to n=3 costs 5E, whereas promoting from n=1 to n=3 costs 8E. Therefore, the next promotion after the first excited state would be promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3 (costing 5E) rather than promoting from n=1 (which would cost more). Therefore, the second excited state is 20E, not 18E. Wait, but the total energy is additive. Let me see.

Wait, in the first excited state (15E), if we promote the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, we remove 4E and add 9E, so net +5E, making total 15E +5E=20E. Alternatively, if we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we remove 1E and add 9E, so net +8E, making total 15E +8E=23E. Wait, but that's not correct. Because in the first excited state (15E), we already have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we need to have an empty slot in n=3. But n=3 already has one particle. Since each spatial orbital can hold two particles, promoting another to n=3 is allowed. So promoting one from n=1 to n=3 would result in one in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy would be 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. So that's higher than 20E. So perhaps the order is: ground state (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (20E). But then where does 18E come in? If we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (total 18E), how is that achieved? To get there, you would have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But in the ground state, n=2 is already filled with two particles. So you can't promote another to n=2. Wait, unless you first promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, then from n=1 to n=2. But that would require two promotions, which would lead to higher energy states.

Wait, perhaps the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 isn't reachable by a single promotion from the ground state. Because to get there, you need to both promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 and promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But that would require two promotions, which would correspond to a higher excited state. Therefore, such a configuration would have higher energy than the first excited state. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, the second is 20E, and the third might be 18E or 23E. Wait, but this is getting confusing.

Let me approach this systematically by considering all possible configurations and their energies. 

The total number of particles is 4. Each spatial orbital n can hold 0, 1, or 2 particles. The total number of particles must be 4. The possible configurations (n1, n2, n3, ...) where n1 is the number of particles in the first orbital, n2 in the second, etc., such that the sum is 4 and each ni is 0,1, or 2.

The ground state is filling the lowest orbitals first with maximum 2 particles each. So n1=2, n2=2, n3=0, ... Energy: 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E.

Next, the first excited state. To get the next lowest energy, we need the configuration with the lowest possible increase in energy. The highest occupied orbital in the ground state is n=2. Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 gives n1=2, n2=1, n3=1. Energy: 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Then, promoting the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 gives n1=2, n2=0, n3=2. Energy: 2*1E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E.

Alternatively, another way to get a higher energy is promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But in the ground state, n1 is filled with 2 particles. Promoting one from n=1 to n=3 would give n1=1, n2=2, n3=1. Energy: 1*1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But this configuration is higher in energy than 15E but lower than 20E. However, is this configuration accessible via a single promotion from the ground state?

Wait, to go from the ground state (2,2,0) to (1,2,1), you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. But that requires an energy of 9E - 1E = 8E per particle. Whereas promoting from n=2 to n=3 is 5E per particle. So the first excited state is 15E, then promoting another from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E. However, the configuration (1,2,1) is a separate configuration that is not reachable by a single promotion from the ground state. Wait, no, actually, you can reach it by promoting one from n=1 to n=3 directly. But that would require more energy. So the energy required to promote from n=1 to n=3 is higher than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is the one with the lower energy promotion (from n=2 to n=3), resulting in 15E. Then, the next possible promotion from the first excited state would be promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, resulting in 20E. However, if you have enough energy, you could also promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but that requires more energy. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:

1. Ground state: 10E

2. First excited: 15E

3. Second excited: 18E

4. Third excited: 20E

But wait, the question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So up to the second excited state. Therefore, the second excited state would be 18E? But according to the energy levels, 15E is first, then 18E, then 20E. So if the question is asking for up to the second excited state, then 18E would be the second. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration (1,2,1) is not allowed due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Let me check. In the configuration (1,2,1), n=1 has one particle (spin up or down), n=2 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=3 has one particle (spin up or down). So all particles are in distinct quantum states. Therefore, this configuration is allowed. Therefore, the energy of this state is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Therefore, the order is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, etc. So the first excited state is 15E, the second is 18E, and the third is 20E. Therefore, if the question is asking for the ground state, first, and second excited states, the answer would be 10E, 15E, and 18E.

But I need to confirm this. Let me check the possible configurations again:

Ground state: (2,2,0) = 10E

First excited: (2,1,1) = 15E

Second excited: (1,2,1) = 18E

Third excited: (2,0,2) = 20E

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration with the same energy as 18E. For example, (2,1,1,1). But that would require four particles: 2+1+1+0=4, but (2,1,1,1) sums to 5. Not allowed. So no. Alternatively, (1,1,2). But that would be 1E +4E +18E=23E. Higher. So no. So the possible configurations in order of increasing energy are:

1. 10E

2. 15E

3. 18E

4. 20E

Therefore, the second excited state is 18E. So the answer would be ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But let me check another source or example to make sure.

Wait, another way to think about it is by considering the Fermi level. For four particles in a 1D box, with two particles per energy level. The filled levels would be n=1 and n=2. The Fermi energy would be n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. The next would be promoting another from n=2 to n=3, or promoting from n=1 to n=3. The energy required for promoting from n=2 to n=3 is less, so the first excited state is 15E, second is 20E. However, the configuration (1,2,1) is a different configuration that may have a different energy. But the question is, can that configuration be reached by a single promotion from the ground state?

Wait, no. To reach (1,2,1) from (2,2,0), you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. That requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, such a transition would occur at a higher energy. So in terms of the order of excited states, the first excited state is 15E (promoting from n=2 to n=3), the second excited state is 18E (promoting from n=1 to n=3), and the third is 20E (promoting the second particle from n=2 to n=3). Therefore, the answer would depend on whether promoting from n=1 is considered a separate excited state.

But in reality, when you have multiple ways to reach excited states, the one with the lowest energy difference comes first. Since promoting from n=2 to n=3 requires less energy (5E) than promoting from n=1 to n=3 (8E), the first excited state is 15E, then the next is 20E (another promotion from n=2 to n=3), then promoting from n=1 to n=3 would be 18E, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, the energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies. So if you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, the total energy increases by 5E (from 4E to 9E). If you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, the total energy increases by 8E (from 1E to 9E). Therefore, the configuration (2,1,1) is lower in energy than (1,2,1). Therefore, the order is:

1. (2,2,0) = 10E

2. (2,1,1) = 15E

3. (1,2,1) = 18E

4. (2,0,2) = 20E

5. (1,1,2) = 23E

6. etc.

Therefore, the first three states are 10E, 15E, 18E. Hence, the second excited state is 18E.

But I need to confirm this with an example. Let's look at the hydrogen atom or similar systems. For fermions, the excited states are determined by the possible ways to promote particles to higher orbitals with the least energy cost. So the first promotion is the one that costs the least energy. In this case, promoting from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next (n=3) costs 5E. Promoting from a lower orbital (n=1) to a higher one (n=3) costs more (8E). Therefore, the order should be: ground state (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (18E), third excited (20E), etc.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

But wait, another perspective: sometimes, when you have multiple particles, the excited states can also involve different spin configurations. But in this case, since the energy doesn't depend on spin, all the spin configurations for a given spatial occupation have the same energy. Therefore, they don't contribute to splitting of energy levels. Therefore, the energy is solely determined by the spatial occupation.

Therefore, the conclusion is that after the ground state (10E), the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 18E.

But let me check with a different approach. Let's list all possible distributions of 4 particles in the energy levels with each level holding at most 2 particles, and calculate their energies:

1. [2,2,0,...] → 2*1 + 2*4 = 10E

2. [2,1,1,0,...] → 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E

3. [1,2,1,0,...] → 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E

4. [2,0,2,0,...] → 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E

5. [1,1,2,0,...] → 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E

6. [1,1,1,1,...] → 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30E

So ordering these by energy:

10E (1), 15E (2), 18E (3), 20E (4), 23E (5), 30E (6), etc.

Therefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E, third excited 20E. Therefore, the answer to the original question is:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

Therefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.

**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{18E}.

If we move another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy here would be 2E + 18E = 20E. However, there might be another configuration where one particle goes to n=4 instead. Let's check: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Alternatively, if we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but n=1 can have a maximum of two particles. Wait, in the first excited state, we already had two in n=1. If we try to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but that would leave one in n=1 and three in higher levels. However, since each level can take two, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require that the n=1 level only has one particle, which is allowed. But that would be a different configuration. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. After the first excited state (2,1,1), the next possible arrangement could be (2,0,2) which is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, if we have (1,2,1), but that would require the n=1 level to have only one particle. However, since the particles are fermions, each spatial orbital can have two. If we have two particles in n=1 (which is allowed), then moving one from n=2 to n=3 would give (2,1,1). If we then move another from n=2 to n=3, we get (2,0,2). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would result in (1,2,1), but that would require the n=1 level to have only one particle. However, since the particles are spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two. So if we have two in n=1 (both spins occupied), we can't have just one in n=1 unless one spin is missing, but that's allowed. Wait, but if we remove a particle from n=1, but we have four particles total. Let me check: Ground state is (2,2,0,0,...). First excited is (2,1,1,0,...). Second excited could be either (2,0,2,0) with energy 2E + 18E = 20E, or (1,2,1,0) with energy 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but 18E is lower than 20E. Wait, but is (1,2,1,0) a valid configuration? Let's see. If we have two particles in n=2 (each with opposite spin), one in n=1, and one in n=3. But that would require that the n=1 level has only one particle. Is that allowed? Yes, as long as each spatial state has at most two particles. But in this case, n=1 has one particle (either spin-up or spin-down), which is allowed. However, does this configuration have lower energy than (2,0,2,0)?\n\nLet's compute the energies:\n\n- (1,2,1,0): 1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n- (2,0,2,0): 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nBut 18E is lower than 20E, so perhaps (1,2,1,0) would be the second excited state. But wait, how do we get there? To reach this configuration, we would need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 while leaving another in n=2. But in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles, and n=2 is filled with two. To get to (1,2,1), we would need to move one particle from n=1 to n=3, but then we have one in n=1 and three in n=2 and n=3. Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles. Wait, if we have two particles in n=2 (already filled), then moving one from n=1 to n=3 would leave one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's exactly (1,2,1). But does this configuration have lower energy than (2,0,2)?\n\nYes, because 18E < 20E. Therefore, perhaps the second excited state is (1,2,1) with energy 18E. However, this seems contradictory to my initial thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the ground state, we have (2,2,0). The first excited state is (2,1,1) with energy 15E. Then, the next possible excited state would be either (1,2,1) or (2,0,2). Let's see which one has lower energy. (1,2,1) gives 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, and (2,0,2) gives 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. So 18E is lower. Therefore, (1,2,1) would be the second excited state, and (2,0,2) would be the third excited state.\n\nBut wait, how is (1,2,1) achieved? Because in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled. To get to (1,2,1), we need to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But in the ground state, both n=1 and n=2 are filled with two particles each. So, in order to move a particle from n=1 to n=3, we would have to leave one particle in n=1. But since each spatial state can hold two particles, having one in n=1 is allowed. So that configuration is possible. Therefore, the energy would be 18E, which is lower than 20E. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:\n\n- Ground state: (2,2,0) → 10E\n- First excited: (2,1,1) → 15E\n- Second excited: (1,2,1) → 18E\n- Third excited: (2,0,2) → 20E\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So according to this, the second excited state would be 18E. However, I need to confirm if this configuration is possible. Let me check if there's any other configuration with energy between 15E and 18E. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's 15E. Then, if we promote one particle from n=2 to n=4, we get (2,0,1,1) which would be 2E + 0 + 9E + 16E = 27E. That's higher. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives (1,2,1) with 18E. So 18E is the next possible energy level after 15E. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then promote another particle from n=1 to n=3, leading to (1,2,1) at 18E. Then promoting another from n=2 to n=3 gives (1,1,2), which would be E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Alternatively, (1,2,1) is 18E, which is lower than 20E.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are determined by filling the lowest energy levels while obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.

1. **Ground State (Lowest Energy):**  
   Place two particles in the lowest energy level \( n=1 \) (each with opposite spin) and the remaining two in \( n=2 \).  
   Energy:  
   \[
   2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
   \]

2. **First Excited State:**  
   Promote one particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=1 \), one in \( n=2 \), and one in \( n=3 \).  
   Energy:  
   \[
   2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
   \]

3. **Second Excited State:**  
   Promote one particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \), leading to one particle in \( n=1 \), two in \( n=2 \), and one in \( n=3 \).  
   Energy:  
   \[
   1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
- Ground state energy: \(\boxed{10E}\)  
- First excited state energy: \(\boxed{15E}\)  
- Second excited state energy: \(\boxed{18E}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The next possible arrangement would be two in n=1 and two in n=3, but that would have a higher energy (2E + 18E = 20E), so 15E is indeed the first excited state.

For the second excited state, the next configuration would involve promoting another particle. If we move another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy here would be 2E + 18E = 20E. However, there might be another configuration where one particle goes to n=4 instead. Let's check: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Alternatively, if we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but n=1 can have a maximum of two particles. Wait, in the first excited state, we already had two in n=1. If we try to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but that would leave one in n=1 and three in higher levels. However, since each level can take two, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require that the n=1 level only has one particle, which is allowed. But that would be a different configuration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. After the first excited state (2,1,1), the next possible arrangement could be (2,0,2) which is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, if we have (1,2,1), but that would require the n=1 level to have only one particle. However, since the particles are fermions, each spatial orbital can have two. If we have two particles in n=1 (which is allowed), then moving one from n=2 to n=3 would give (2,1,1). If we then move another from n=2 to n=3, we get (2,0,2). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would result in (1,2,1), but that would require the n=1 level to have only one particle. However, since the particles are spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two. So if we have two in n=1 (both spins occupied), we can't have just one in n=1 unless one spin is missing, but that's allowed. Wait, but if we remove a particle from n=1, but we have four particles total. Let me check: Ground state is (2,2,0,0,...). First excited is (2,1,1,0,...). Second excited could be either (2,0,2,0) with energy 2E + 18E = 20E, or (1,2,1,0) with energy 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but 18E is lower than 20E. Wait, but is (1,2,1,0) a valid configuration? Let's see. If we have two particles in n=2 (each with opposite spin), one in n=1, and one in n=3. But that would require that the n=1 level has only one particle. Is that allowed? Yes, as long as each spatial state has at most two particles. But in this case, n=1 has one particle (either spin-up or spin-down), which is allowed. However, does this configuration have lower energy than (2,0,2,0)?

Let's compute the energies:

- (1,2,1,0): 1E + 2*4E + 1*9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
- (2,0,2,0): 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E.

But 18E is lower than 20E, so perhaps (1,2,1,0) would be the second excited state. But wait, how do we get there? To reach this configuration, we would need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 while leaving another in n=2. But in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles, and n=2 is filled with two. To get to (1,2,1), we would need to move one particle from n=1 to n=3, but then we have one in n=1 and three in n=2 and n=3. Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles. Wait, if we have two particles in n=2 (already filled), then moving one from n=1 to n=3 would leave one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's exactly (1,2,1). But does this configuration have lower energy than (2,0,2)?

Yes, because 18E < 20E. Therefore, perhaps the second excited state is (1,2,1) with energy 18E. However, this seems contradictory to my initial thought. Let me check again.

Wait, in the ground state, we have (2,2,0). The first excited state is (2,1,1) with energy 15E. Then, the next possible excited state would be either (1,2,1) or (2,0,2). Let's see which one has lower energy. (1,2,1) gives 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, and (2,0,2) gives 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. So 18E is lower. Therefore, (1,2,1) would be the second excited state, and (2,0,2) would be the third excited state.

But wait, how is (1,2,1) achieved? Because in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled. To get to (1,2,1), we need to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But in the ground state, both n=1 and n=2 are filled with two particles each. So, in order to move a particle from n=1 to n=3, we would have to leave one particle in n=1. But since each spatial state can hold two particles, having one in n=1 is allowed. So that configuration is possible. Therefore, the energy would be 18E, which is lower than 20E. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:

- Ground state: (2,2,0) → 10E
- First excited: (2,1,1) → 15E
- Second excited: (1,2,1) → 18E
- Third excited: (2,0,2) → 20E

But wait, the problem asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So according to this, the second excited state would be 18E. However, I need to confirm if this configuration is possible. Let me check if there's any other configuration with energy between 15E and 18E. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's 15E. Then, if we promote one particle from n=2 to n=4, we get (2,0,1,1) which would be 2E + 0 + 9E + 16E = 27E. That's higher. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives (1,2,1) with 18E. So 18E is the next possible energy level after 15E. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

But wait, another possibility: if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then promote another particle from n=1 to n=3, leading to (1,2,1) at 18E. Then promoting another from n=2 to n=3 gives (1,1,2), which would be E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Alternatively, (1,2,1) is 18E, which is lower than 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 18E.

But I need to make sure that the configuration (1,2,1) is allowed. Since each spatial orbital can have up to two particles, having two in n=2 (allowed), one in n=1 (allowed), and one in n=3 (allowed) is permissible. Therefore, this is a valid configuration.

Therefore, the energies would be:

- Ground state: 10E
- First excited state: 15E
- Second excited state: 18E

But let me check once more. The possible configurations in order of increasing energy would be:

1. (2,2,0) → 10E
2. (2,1,1) → 15E
3. (1,2,1) → 18E
4. (2,0,2) → 20E
5. (1,1,2) → 23E
6. (2,1,0,1) → 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E (But this might not be possible, since you can't have a particle in n=4 without filling lower states? Wait, no, you can have particles in higher states as long as Pauli is satisfied. However, the total number of particles is four. Let me clarify.)

Wait, the configuration (2,1,0,1) would have two in n=1, one in n=2, none in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But is this a lower energy than (1,2,1)? No, because 18E is lower. So the order would be 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

Thus, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited: 15E

Second excited: 18E

Wait, but n=3 is lower in energy than n=4. So promoting to n=3 gives lower energy than promoting to n=4. Therefore, the first excited state should be the configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n\nWait a second, but actually, when particles are fermions, the next state would involve having the highest energy particle in the next available orbital. Let me think again. The ground state has filled up to n=2. So the next possible configuration would be removing one particle from n=2 and placing it into n=3. So, particles would be in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy would be 2*1²E + 1*2²E + 1*3²E = 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. \n\nAlternatively, could we have a configuration where two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? Yes. That's the same. Alternatively, if we try to put three particles in n=2, but n=2 can only hold two. So that's forbidden. So the first excited state is 15E.\n\nFor the second excited state, the next higher energy configuration. What comes after that? The next possible configuration would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, or moving a particle from n=3 to n=4. Let's see. If we have two particles in n=1, and if we have zero in n=2, and two in n=3. But that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3. The energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 20E. Alternatively, moving one particle from n=1 to n=3. Wait, but n=1 is already filled with two particles. If you move a particle from n=2 to n=4, then the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. But n=1 is filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you would have to leave a hole in n=1, but n=1 is the lowest energy, so that would require more energy. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4: configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=4. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 16E = 25E, which is higher. So the next possible configurations after 15E would be either 20E (two in n=1, two in n=3) or 22E (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4). Comparing these energies, 20E is lower than 22E, so the second excited state would be 20E.\n\nWait, but is the configuration with two in n=1, two in n=3 allowed? Each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So yes, two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=3 (each with opposite spins). But how does this compare to the previous configuration? Let's check the total energy. If you have two in n=1, two in n=3: total energy 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. So 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state would be 20E.\n\nBut wait, is there a configuration between 15E and 20E? Let's check. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next possible is moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=3 to n=4, but that would increase energy. So there's a jump from 15E to 20E. So the next higher energy after 15E is 20E, which would be the second excited state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another configuration where we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. But that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but another thought: since particles are fermions, you have to consider the order in which you fill the states. Let me list all possible configurations for four particles.\n\nGround state: Fill the lowest possible orbitals. Each orbital can have two particles. So n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E. That's the ground state.\n\nFirst excited state: The next possible configuration with the lowest energy. To get this, you need to promote one particle from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next available orbital (n=3). So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. That must be the first excited state.\n\nSecond excited state: The next configuration. There are two possibilities here. Either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so n=1 (2), n=3 (2)), which gives 2E + 18E = 20E, or promote the particle in n=3 to n=4 (n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1)), which gives 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1)), which would have energy 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but is that possible? Let me check.\n\nIf you have four particles, and you have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four particles. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But is this configuration allowed?\n\nWait, but n=1 can have two particles. If we take one particle from n=1 and promote it to n=3, then n=1 would have one particle (which is allowed, since each spatial orbital can have up to two), n=2 has two, and n=3 has one. The total energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But why is this configuration possible?\n\nBut wait, when considering the Pauli exclusion principle, the spatial orbitals can have two particles each. If we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that's allowed. But is this configuration lower in energy than the one with two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E)? No, because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require adding energy. Wait, actually, in the ground state, you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. To get to the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. But the energy would be higher than the ground state. But the first excited state was already 15E. However, 18E is higher than 15E, so this configuration would be a higher excited state. But perhaps the order is:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited: 15E\n\nSecond excited: 18E\n\nThird excited: 20E, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the first excited state, we had two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we get one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). But why is that higher in energy? Because moving a particle from a lower energy level (n=1) to a higher one (n=3) requires energy. So the energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 adds 8E. But in this case, the previous configuration (15E) is 2E + 4E + 9E. If we move one particle from n=1 to n=3, we have 1E + 4E + 9E + 4E (wait, no, if we move a particle from n=1 to n=3, the n=2 remains with one particle? Wait, no. Let me recast.\n\nOriginal first excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (2E + 4E + 9E = 15E). If we take a particle from n=1 (which has two) and move it to n=2 (which had one, but can take another?), but n=2 can have two. Wait, but if we move from n=1 to n=2, that would be a lower energy promotion. But n=2 already has one particle. If we move one from n=1 to n=2, then n=1 would have one, n=2 would have two, and n=3 would have one. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But why would that be higher than 15E? Because moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 is a lower energy transition. Wait, but n=2 is lower than n=3, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would actually lower the energy. Wait, but n=1 is already filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you would have to have a vacancy in n=2. But in the first excited state, n=2 has one particle. So moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would result in n=1 having one, n=2 having two. But that configuration is lower in energy (since you're moving a particle to a lower energy level). Wait, but if you start from the ground state (n=1 with two, n=2 with two), and move a particle from n=2 to n=3, you get the first excited state. But if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, but in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. So you can't move from n=1 to n=2 in the ground state. Therefore, the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Then, the next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3: 20E). But there's another possibility: moving a different particle. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let's see.\n\nWait, in the ground state (10E), you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state (15E) is moving one from n=2 to n=3. To get the second excited state, you can either move another from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in 20E) or move a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let's compute that energy. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you get one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Which is lower than 20E, so 18E would come before 20E. But is this possible?\n\nWait, but how do you move a particle from n=1 to n=3? In the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you need to have an available slot in n=3, which is empty in the ground state. So, yes, you can promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but you have to leave a hole in n=1. However, promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. The energy difference for moving from n=1 to n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E, whereas moving from n=2 to n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. So the first excited state is moving from n=2 to n=3 (lower energy cost). Then, the second excited state can be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 20E) or moving one from n=1 to n=3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, 18E would be the second excited state and 20E the third.\n\nBut wait, in the first excited state (15E), you have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. From there, the next possible excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4 (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Or moving a particle from n=3 to n=4 (15E -> 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 (but n=2 already has one, so moving another would fill it to two, but how does that affect the energy? Wait, from the first excited state (15E), if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you end up with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So this is another possible configuration. But how does this transition happen? Moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would lower the energy (since n=2 is lower than n=3), but you have to consider that in the first excited state, the particles are already in higher energy states. Wait, in the first excited state (15E), you have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you need to have an available slot in n=2. Since n=2 has one particle, you can add another. So moving a particle from n=1 (which has two) to n=2 (which has one) would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The total energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But how is this possible? Because moving a particle from a lower energy level (n=1) to a higher one (n=2) would require energy input. Wait, no: n=2 is higher than n=1. Wait, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would actually be moving it to a higher energy level, which requires energy. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no: n=2 is higher in energy than n=1, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would require energy. Therefore, the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) is higher in energy than the first excited state (15E). Therefore, the order would be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited: 15E\n\nSecond excited: 18E\n\nThird excited: 20E\n\nBut wait, but moving from the first excited state (15E) to 18E requires adding energy (moving a particle from n=1 to n=2). But n=2 is higher than n=1, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would increase the total energy. However, in the first excited state, the particles are in n=1, n=2, and n=3. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you're increasing the energy of that particle. The energy difference between n=1 and n=2 is 4E - E = 3E. So moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 adds 3E to the total energy, making it 15E + 3E = 18E. So 18E is higher than 15E, so it's a valid excited state. Then, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 would add 5E (9E - 4E) to the 15E, resulting in 15E + 5E = 20E. Wait, but if you have two particles in n=2, moving one to n=3 would take the configuration from two in n=1, two in n=2, to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, no. Wait, starting from the ground state (10E), moving one from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E. Then, moving another from n=2 to n=3 would require that n=2 has another particle. But in the first excited state, there's only one particle in n=2. So you can't move another from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, to get to 20E, you need to move two particles from n=2 to n=3. But in the ground state, you have two in n=2. So moving both to n=3 would result in two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). But moving both would require promoting two particles, each requiring 5E (from n=2 to n=3). But is this a single excitation or two separate excitations? If you move both particles from n=2 to n=3, that would be a double excitation, resulting in a higher energy state. However, in terms of energy levels, the configuration two in n=1 and two in n=3 has energy 20E. But how does this compare to the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E)? Since 18E is lower than 20E, the 18E state would be the second excited state, and 20E the third.\n\nBut wait, how do we reach the 18E state from the ground state? It involves promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but that would require multiple excitations. However, in reality, excited states are determined by the minimal number of excitations. The first excited state is a single excitation (one particle promoted). The second excited state could be another single excitation from the first excited state. However, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 in the first excited state would require energy, resulting in 18E. Alternatively, moving the particle in n=3 to n=4 would result in 22E. Therefore, the order is:\n\n1. Ground state: 10E\n\n2. First excited: 15E\n\n3. Second excited: 18E\n\n4. Third excited: 20E\n\nBut the question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the second excited state would be 18E. But I need to verify if this is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider all possible configurations for four fermions in the well.\n\nEach spatial orbital n can hold two electrons (spin up and down). The total number of particles is four. Let's list the possible ways to distribute four particles into the orbitals with the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n1. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2): total energy 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 + 8 = 10E. Ground state.\n\n2. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): energy 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. First excited state.\n\n3. Next, possible configurations:\n\n   a. Fill n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1): energy 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E.\n\n   b. Fill n=1 (2), n=3 (2): energy 2 + 18 = 20E.\n\n   c. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1): energy 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E.\n\nComparing these, 18E is lower than 20E and 22E. So 18E would be the second excited state, followed by 20E as the third.\n\nBut are there any other configurations? For example, n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (2): energy 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E, which is higher. So the next lowest is 18E.\n\nBut how do we get the 18E configuration? It requires moving one particle from n=1 to n=2 and one from n=2 to n=3. But is that possible through a single excitation? Or does it require two separate excitations?\n\nIn quantum mechanics, excited states are determined by the number of particles promoted. The ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the lowest energy configuration with one particle promoted. The second excited state is the next lowest, which could be either another single promotion or a double promotion.\n\nWait, the first excited state (15E) has one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. The second excited state could be another single promotion from n=2 to n=4 (resulting in 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E) or promoting a different particle. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (which would require more energy). However, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 would result in 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Is this considered a separate excitation path?\n\nBut in terms of energy levels, the configuration with energy 18E is lower than 20E. Therefore, the order should be:\n\n1. 10E (Ground state)\n\n2. 15E (First excited state)\n\n3. 18E (Second excited state)\n\n4. 20E (Third excited state)\n\nBut the question asks for the first and second excited states. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited: 15E\n\nSecond excited: 18E\n\nBut I need to confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider the concept of Fermi level.\n\nFor four particles in a 1D box, the Fermi level would be n=2, since two particles can occupy each level. So the highest occupied orbital in the ground state is n=2. The first excitation would be promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E). The second excitation could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 (20E) or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut another perspective: the energy required to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 is higher than promoting from n=2 to n=3. However, when considering the total energy of the system, even though the individual promotion from n=1 to n=3 is a larger jump, the total energy of the system with one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E) is lower than the system with two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, 18E comes before 20E.\n\nBut wait, this seems contradictory. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy per particle, but the total system energy might be lower because other particles are in lower orbitals. Let me compute the energy differences.\n\nFrom the ground state (10E):\n\n- To reach 15E: promote one particle from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E). Energy increase: 5E.\n\n- To reach 18E: promote one particle from n=1 (1E) to n=2 (4E). Energy increase: 3E. But wait, but in the first excited state (15E), you can't promote from n=1 to n=2 because n=2 is already partially filled. Wait, no. Actually, to get to 18E, you have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3. But that would be two promotions. However, excited states are typically considered as states with a certain number of excitations. The first excited state is a single excitation, the second would be the next lowest energy state regardless of the number of excitations.\n\nAlternatively, in atomic physics, the excited states are ordered by their total energy, not by the number of excitations. Therefore, regardless of how the energy is achieved, the order is purely by total energy. So the states would be ordered as:\n\n10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second), 20E (third), etc.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 18E\n\nBut I need to verify this with an example. Let's take another case. Suppose we have three particles. The ground state would be two in n=1 and one in n=2, energy 2E + 4E = 6E. First excited state would be two in n=1 and one in n=3, energy 2E + 9E = 11E. Alternatively, one in n=1 and two in n=2, energy 1E + 8E = 9E. Which is lower? 9E is lower than 11E. Therefore, for three particles, the first excited state is 9E, not 11E, even though it involves promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. Therefore, the total energy is the determining factor, not the number of excitations.\n\nApplying this to four particles:\n\nThe configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) is lower in energy than two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, 18E is the second excited state.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 18E\n\nHowever, I want to check some references or similar problems to confirm.\n\nWait, in the case of four electrons in a 1D box, the ground state is filled up to n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one electron from n=2 to n=3. The next excited state could be promoting another electron from n=2 to n=3 (total two in n=3) or promoting an electron from n=1 to n=2. But since promoting from n=1 to n=2 requires less energy, but that would fill n=2 completely. Wait, but n=2 was already partially filled in the first excited state.\n\nWait, in the first excited state (15E), n=2 has one electron. Promoting an electron from n=1 to n=2 would fill n=2 and result in one electron in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy of this configuration is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Since this is lower than promoting another electron from n=2 to n=3 (which would result in 20E), this 18E state is indeed the second excited state.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n\n- Ground state: 10E\n\n- First excited state: 15E\n\n- Second excited state: 18E\n\nHence, the answer is as above.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ground state energy is \\boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \\boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \\boxed{18E}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386713, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6933, prompt_tokens=822, total_tokens=7755, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we consider the following steps:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:
   - The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).
   - Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate up to two particles (spin-up and spin-down) due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

2. **Ground State**:
   - For four particles, the lowest energy configuration fills the lowest available energy levels.
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 1 \) and two particles occupy \( n = 2 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

3. **First Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied level \( n = 2 \) to the next available level \( n = 3 \).
   - Configuration: two particles in \( n = 1 \), one particle in \( n = 2 \), and one particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

4. **Second Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration involves promoting another particle from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 2 \), resulting in a different configuration.
   - Configuration: one particle in \( n = 1 \), two particles in \( n = 2 \), and one particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

- **Ground state**: \(\boxed{10E}\)
- **First excited state**: \(\boxed{15E}\)
- **Second excited state**: \(\boxed{18E}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Similarly, two in n=1, two in n=2 (ground state), two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (first excited), and then two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? Wait, but n=3 is lower in energy than n=4. So promoting to n=3 gives lower energy than promoting to n=4. Therefore, the first excited state should be the configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait a second, but actually, when particles are fermions, the next state would involve having the highest energy particle in the next available orbital. Let me think again. The ground state has filled up to n=2. So the next possible configuration would be removing one particle from n=2 and placing it into n=3. So, particles would be in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy would be 2*1²E + 1*2²E + 1*3²E = 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. 

Alternatively, could we have a configuration where two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? Yes. That's the same. Alternatively, if we try to put three particles in n=2, but n=2 can only hold two. So that's forbidden. So the first excited state is 15E.

For the second excited state, the next higher energy configuration. What comes after that? The next possible configuration would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, or moving a particle from n=3 to n=4. Let's see. If we have two particles in n=1, and if we have zero in n=2, and two in n=3. But that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3. The energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 20E. Alternatively, moving one particle from n=1 to n=3. Wait, but n=1 is already filled with two particles. If you move a particle from n=2 to n=4, then the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. But n=1 is filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you would have to leave a hole in n=1, but n=1 is the lowest energy, so that would require more energy. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4: configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=4. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 16E = 25E, which is higher. So the next possible configurations after 15E would be either 20E (two in n=1, two in n=3) or 22E (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4). Comparing these energies, 20E is lower than 22E, so the second excited state would be 20E.

Wait, but is the configuration with two in n=1, two in n=3 allowed? Each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So yes, two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=3 (each with opposite spins). But how does this compare to the previous configuration? Let's check the total energy. If you have two in n=1, two in n=3: total energy 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. So 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state would be 20E.

But wait, is there a configuration between 15E and 20E? Let's check. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next possible is moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=3 to n=4, but that would increase energy. So there's a jump from 15E to 20E. So the next higher energy after 15E is 20E, which would be the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps another configuration where we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. But that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but another thought: since particles are fermions, you have to consider the order in which you fill the states. Let me list all possible configurations for four particles.

Ground state: Fill the lowest possible orbitals. Each orbital can have two particles. So n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E. That's the ground state.

First excited state: The next possible configuration with the lowest energy. To get this, you need to promote one particle from the highest occupied orbital (n=2) to the next available orbital (n=3). So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. That must be the first excited state.

Second excited state: The next configuration. There are two possibilities here. Either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so n=1 (2), n=3 (2)), which gives 2E + 18E = 20E, or promote the particle in n=3 to n=4 (n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1)), which gives 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1)), which would have energy 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but is that possible? Let me check.

If you have four particles, and you have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four particles. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But is this configuration allowed?

Wait, but n=1 can have two particles. If we take one particle from n=1 and promote it to n=3, then n=1 would have one particle (which is allowed, since each spatial orbital can have up to two), n=2 has two, and n=3 has one. The total energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But why is this configuration possible?

But wait, when considering the Pauli exclusion principle, the spatial orbitals can have two particles each. If we have one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that's allowed. But is this configuration lower in energy than the one with two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E)? No, because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require adding energy. Wait, actually, in the ground state, you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. To get to the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, you need to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. But the energy would be higher than the ground state. But the first excited state was already 15E. However, 18E is higher than 15E, so this configuration would be a higher excited state. But perhaps the order is:

Ground state: 10E

First excited: 15E

Second excited: 18E

Third excited: 20E, etc.

But wait, in the first excited state, we had two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we get one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). But why is that higher in energy? Because moving a particle from a lower energy level (n=1) to a higher one (n=3) requires energy. So the energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 adds 8E. But in this case, the previous configuration (15E) is 2E + 4E + 9E. If we move one particle from n=1 to n=3, we have 1E + 4E + 9E + 4E (wait, no, if we move a particle from n=1 to n=3, the n=2 remains with one particle? Wait, no. Let me recast.

Original first excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (2E + 4E + 9E = 15E). If we take a particle from n=1 (which has two) and move it to n=2 (which had one, but can take another?), but n=2 can have two. Wait, but if we move from n=1 to n=2, that would be a lower energy promotion. But n=2 already has one particle. If we move one from n=1 to n=2, then n=1 would have one, n=2 would have two, and n=3 would have one. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But why would that be higher than 15E? Because moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 is a lower energy transition. Wait, but n=2 is lower than n=3, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would actually lower the energy. Wait, but n=1 is already filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you would have to have a vacancy in n=2. But in the first excited state, n=2 has one particle. So moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would result in n=1 having one, n=2 having two. But that configuration is lower in energy (since you're moving a particle to a lower energy level). Wait, but if you start from the ground state (n=1 with two, n=2 with two), and move a particle from n=2 to n=3, you get the first excited state. But if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, but in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. So you can't move from n=1 to n=2 in the ground state. Therefore, the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Then, the next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3: 20E). But there's another possibility: moving a different particle. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let's see.

Wait, in the ground state (10E), you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state (15E) is moving one from n=2 to n=3. To get the second excited state, you can either move another from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in 20E) or move a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let's compute that energy. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you get one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Which is lower than 20E, so 18E would come before 20E. But is this possible?

Wait, but how do you move a particle from n=1 to n=3? In the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. To move a particle from n=1 to n=3, you need to have an available slot in n=3, which is empty in the ground state. So, yes, you can promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, but you have to leave a hole in n=1. However, promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. The energy difference for moving from n=1 to n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E, whereas moving from n=2 to n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. So the first excited state is moving from n=2 to n=3 (lower energy cost). Then, the second excited state can be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 20E) or moving one from n=1 to n=3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, 18E would be the second excited state and 20E the third.

But wait, in the first excited state (15E), you have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. From there, the next possible excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4 (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Or moving a particle from n=3 to n=4 (15E -> 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 (but n=2 already has one, so moving another would fill it to two, but how does that affect the energy? Wait, from the first excited state (15E), if you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you end up with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So this is another possible configuration. But how does this transition happen? Moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would lower the energy (since n=2 is lower than n=3), but you have to consider that in the first excited state, the particles are already in higher energy states. Wait, in the first excited state (15E), you have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you need to have an available slot in n=2. Since n=2 has one particle, you can add another. So moving a particle from n=1 (which has two) to n=2 (which has one) would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The total energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But how is this possible? Because moving a particle from a lower energy level (n=1) to a higher one (n=2) would require energy input. Wait, no: n=2 is higher than n=1. Wait, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would actually be moving it to a higher energy level, which requires energy. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no: n=2 is higher in energy than n=1, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would require energy. Therefore, the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) is higher in energy than the first excited state (15E). Therefore, the order would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited: 15E

Second excited: 18E

Third excited: 20E

But wait, but moving from the first excited state (15E) to 18E requires adding energy (moving a particle from n=1 to n=2). But n=2 is higher than n=1, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would increase the total energy. However, in the first excited state, the particles are in n=1, n=2, and n=3. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=2, you're increasing the energy of that particle. The energy difference between n=1 and n=2 is 4E - E = 3E. So moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 adds 3E to the total energy, making it 15E + 3E = 18E. So 18E is higher than 15E, so it's a valid excited state. Then, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 would add 5E (9E - 4E) to the 15E, resulting in 15E + 5E = 20E. Wait, but if you have two particles in n=2, moving one to n=3 would take the configuration from two in n=1, two in n=2, to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, no. Wait, starting from the ground state (10E), moving one from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E. Then, moving another from n=2 to n=3 would require that n=2 has another particle. But in the first excited state, there's only one particle in n=2. So you can't move another from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, to get to 20E, you need to move two particles from n=2 to n=3. But in the ground state, you have two in n=2. So moving both to n=3 would result in two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). But moving both would require promoting two particles, each requiring 5E (from n=2 to n=3). But is this a single excitation or two separate excitations? If you move both particles from n=2 to n=3, that would be a double excitation, resulting in a higher energy state. However, in terms of energy levels, the configuration two in n=1 and two in n=3 has energy 20E. But how does this compare to the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E)? Since 18E is lower than 20E, the 18E state would be the second excited state, and 20E the third.

But wait, how do we reach the 18E state from the ground state? It involves promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but that would require multiple excitations. However, in reality, excited states are determined by the minimal number of excitations. The first excited state is a single excitation (one particle promoted). The second excited state could be another single excitation from the first excited state. However, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 in the first excited state would require energy, resulting in 18E. Alternatively, moving the particle in n=3 to n=4 would result in 22E. Therefore, the order is:

1. Ground state: 10E

2. First excited: 15E

3. Second excited: 18E

4. Third excited: 20E

But the question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So the second excited state would be 18E. But I need to verify if this is correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider all possible configurations for four fermions in the well.

Each spatial orbital n can hold two electrons (spin up and down). The total number of particles is four. Let's list the possible ways to distribute four particles into the orbitals with the Pauli exclusion principle.

1. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2): total energy 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 + 8 = 10E. Ground state.

2. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): energy 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. First excited state.

3. Next, possible configurations:

   a. Fill n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1): energy 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E.

   b. Fill n=1 (2), n=3 (2): energy 2 + 18 = 20E.

   c. Fill n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1): energy 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E.

Comparing these, 18E is lower than 20E and 22E. So 18E would be the second excited state, followed by 20E as the third.

But are there any other configurations? For example, n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (2): energy 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E, which is higher. So the next lowest is 18E.

But how do we get the 18E configuration? It requires moving one particle from n=1 to n=2 and one from n=2 to n=3. But is that possible through a single excitation? Or does it require two separate excitations?

In quantum mechanics, excited states are determined by the number of particles promoted. The ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the lowest energy configuration with one particle promoted. The second excited state is the next lowest, which could be either another single promotion or a double promotion.

Wait, the first excited state (15E) has one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. The second excited state could be another single promotion from n=2 to n=4 (resulting in 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E) or promoting a different particle. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (which would require more energy). However, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 would result in 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Is this considered a separate excitation path?

But in terms of energy levels, the configuration with energy 18E is lower than 20E. Therefore, the order should be:

1. 10E (Ground state)

2. 15E (First excited state)

3. 18E (Second excited state)

4. 20E (Third excited state)

But the question asks for the first and second excited states. Therefore, the answer would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited: 15E

Second excited: 18E

But I need to confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider the concept of Fermi level.

For four particles in a 1D box, the Fermi level would be n=2, since two particles can occupy each level. So the highest occupied orbital in the ground state is n=2. The first excitation would be promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E). The second excitation could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 (20E) or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state is 18E.

But another perspective: the energy required to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 is higher than promoting from n=2 to n=3. However, when considering the total energy of the system, even though the individual promotion from n=1 to n=3 is a larger jump, the total energy of the system with one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3 (18E) is lower than the system with two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, 18E comes before 20E.

But wait, this seems contradictory. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy per particle, but the total system energy might be lower because other particles are in lower orbitals. Let me compute the energy differences.

From the ground state (10E):

- To reach 15E: promote one particle from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E). Energy increase: 5E.

- To reach 18E: promote one particle from n=1 (1E) to n=2 (4E). Energy increase: 3E. But wait, but in the first excited state (15E), you can't promote from n=1 to n=2 because n=2 is already partially filled. Wait, no. Actually, to get to 18E, you have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3. But that would be two promotions. However, excited states are typically considered as states with a certain number of excitations. The first excited state is a single excitation, the second would be the next lowest energy state regardless of the number of excitations.

Alternatively, in atomic physics, the excited states are ordered by their total energy, not by the number of excitations. Therefore, regardless of how the energy is achieved, the order is purely by total energy. So the states would be ordered as:

10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second), 20E (third), etc.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

But I need to verify this with an example. Let's take another case. Suppose we have three particles. The ground state would be two in n=1 and one in n=2, energy 2E + 4E = 6E. First excited state would be two in n=1 and one in n=3, energy 2E + 9E = 11E. Alternatively, one in n=1 and two in n=2, energy 1E + 8E = 9E. Which is lower? 9E is lower than 11E. Therefore, for three particles, the first excited state is 9E, not 11E, even though it involves promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. Therefore, the total energy is the determining factor, not the number of excitations.

Applying this to four particles:

The configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) is lower in energy than two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, 18E is the second excited state.

Thus, the answer is:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

However, I want to check some references or similar problems to confirm.

Wait, in the case of four electrons in a 1D box, the ground state is filled up to n=2. The first excited state would involve promoting one electron from n=2 to n=3. The next excited state could be promoting another electron from n=2 to n=3 (total two in n=3) or promoting an electron from n=1 to n=2. But since promoting from n=1 to n=2 requires less energy, but that would fill n=2 completely. Wait, but n=2 was already partially filled in the first excited state.

Wait, in the first excited state (15E), n=2 has one electron. Promoting an electron from n=1 to n=2 would fill n=2 and result in one electron in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy of this configuration is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Since this is lower than promoting another electron from n=2 to n=3 (which would result in 20E), this 18E state is indeed the second excited state.

Therefore, the energies are:

- Ground state: 10E

- First excited state: 15E

- Second excited state: 18E

Hence, the answer is as above.

**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{18E}.
