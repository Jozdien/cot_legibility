# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:

The mutation in **Mutant 2** is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mutant 1**: A missense mutation (CTC → TAC) changes leucine to tyrosine. This may alter protein structure but is unlikely to fully abolish function unless the residue is critical.
2. **Mutant 2**: A nonsense mutation (CTC → TAA) introduces a premature stop codon at the third amino acid. This truncates the protein to just **Met-Phe-Stop**, rendering it nonfunctional. A nonfunctional enzyme would fail to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.
3. **Mutant 3**: Two missense mutations (CTC → TAC and ACT → GTC) alter leucine to tyrosine and threonine to valine. These changes might impair the protein but are less likely to completely disrupt its activity.
4. **Mutant 4**: An in-frame deletion of the codon GGT (glycine). While this removes one amino acid, the reading frame remains intact. The protein might retain partial function unless glycine is essential for catalysis.

**Conclusion**: Mutant 2’s premature stop codon ensures a severely truncated, nonfunctional protein, making it the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

Okay, so I need to figure out which of these four mutants would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. The original gene has five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon area. Since the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized because of this gene, disrupting the gene's function should stop the compound from being made. 

First, I should recall that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, specifically alkylating guanine bases, leading to G to A transitions. But sometimes it can also cause other point mutations. The key here is to look for mutations that would disrupt the gene product, which is probably a protein. So, the mutations could lead to a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation), a frameshift (insertion or deletion that changes the reading frame), or maybe a critical amino acid change (missense mutation) that inactivates the protein.

Looking at the original DNA sequence:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me transcribe this into mRNA (since DNA is 5' to 3', mRNA would be complementary, so it's the same as the non-coding strand but with U instead of T). Wait, no. The original DNA is given as 5' to 3', so the coding strand is the complementary strand. But maybe it's easier to look at the coding sequence directly here. Let me check the start codon. The original starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then the next codons:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So the original amino acids would be:

Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg ... Stop

Now, let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, let's break it down. Let me compare each position:

Original: positions 4-6: TTT (codon 2) becomes TCT in mutant 1? Wait, let's align them properly.

Wait, original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So the first codon is ATG (same). Second codon in original is TTT (Phe), in mutant 1 it's TTC (still Phe, because TTT and TTC both code for Phe). Third codon original is CTC (Leu), mutant 1 is TAC (Tyr). So CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. So a Leu to Tyr change. That might affect the protein's structure, but maybe not completely abolish its function. Not sure if this would eliminate the compound. Depends on how critical that amino acid is.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So the first codon ATG. Second codon TTC (Phe, same as mutant 1). Third codon in original CTC, here it's TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in mutant 2, after the second codon (TTC), the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be Met - Phe - Stop. That's a nonsense mutation, leading to a truncated protein. That would likely completely disrupt the protein's function. So if the gene product is nonfunctional, the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be synthesized. This seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, let's align the sequences. The original sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So comparing:

Original positions: TTT (Phe) CTC (Leu) GCT (Ala) GGT (Gly) ACT (Thr) TCT (Ser) ...

Mutant3: TTT (Phe) TAC (Tyr) GCT (Ala) GGT (Gly) GTC (Val) ACT (Thr) TCT (Ser)...

So the second codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So another missense mutation. Then the fifth codon in original is ACT (Thr), which in mutant3 is GTC (Val). So another missense. So two amino acid changes. Depending on where these are, but maybe they disrupt the protein's function. However, it's possible the protein could still be partially functional. Not as definitive as a premature stop codon.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, comparing the sequences. Original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So it seems like there's a deletion here. Let me check the length. Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT... So GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser).

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT... So missing GGT? Let's count the nucleotides. Original from GCT (positions 10-12?), then GGT is 13-15, ACT 16-18, TCT 19-21.

Mutant4: After GCT (positions 10-12), then ACT (13-15?), so the GGT (nucleotides 13-15) are missing. That would be a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which is a codon. So it's an in-frame deletion. So the protein would lack the glycine at that position. So the amino acid sequence would be GCT (Ala) followed by ACT (Thr), skipping GGT. So the protein is shorter by one amino acid (Gly), but the reading frame remains the same. This might affect protein structure, but maybe not as severely as a premature stop. However, if that glycine is critical for the enzyme's function, it could disrupt activity. But in-frame deletions can sometimes still allow the protein to function, especially if the amino acid isn't in a critical region.

So which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound? Mutant2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) very early in the protein (third codon), leading to a severely truncated protein. This is likely to result in a nonfunctional protein, which would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants have missense mutations or an in-frame deletion, which might reduce activity but not necessarily eliminate it entirely. Therefore, Mutant2 is the best candidate.

# Anthropic completion

To determine which mutant would most effectively eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, I need to analyze the mutations in the first exon of the five-exon, four-intron gene. Since this gene enables synthesis of the unwanted compound, disrupting its function should prevent the compound's production.

I should remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) typically causes point mutations, particularly G to A transitions through guanine alkylation, though it can produce other point mutations as well. The most effective mutations would disrupt the gene product by creating a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), causing a frameshift (through insertion or deletion), or changing a critical amino acid (missense mutation) that renders the protein inactive.

Examining the original DNA sequence:

Original: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

If I convert this to mRNA, it would be the same sequence but with U replacing T. However, I can analyze the coding sequence directly. The sequence begins with ATG, which is the start codon encoding methionine, followed by the codons:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine which of these four mutants is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound present in the barley cultivar. The original gene contains five exons and four introns, and the mutations are found in the first exon region. Since this gene is responsible for the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting its function should prevent the compound from being produced.

First, it's important to note that ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is a chemical mutagen known to cause point mutations, typically by alkylating guanine bases, leading to G to A transitions, though it can also result in other types of point mutations. The objective is to find mutations that would disrupt the gene's product, presumably a protein. Potential disruptions could be a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), a frameshift (insertions or deletions that alter the reading frame), or a crucial amino acid change (missense mutation) that deactivates the protein.

If we examine the original DNA sequence:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

This would be transcribed into mRNA. Knowing that DNA is oriented 5' to 3', the mRNA will be complementary, mirroring the non-coding strand but with uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). However, since we’re examining the sequence, it might be more straightforward to consider the coding sequence directly. Starting with the methionine start codon (ATG), the subsequent codons are:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT

So 15 nucleotides. Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT is 4 codons. So 12 nucleotides. So 3 nucleotides less. That suggests a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which is a codon. So this would result in a deletion of one amino acid (GGT is glycine at codon5) but no frameshift. So the protein would lack one amino acid (glycine at position5), but the rest would be in frame.

TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Wait, let's split into triplets properly. Let me write the original gene sequence as:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So each triplet is a codon. Let me translate this into amino acids.

ATG = Methionine (start)
TTT = Phenylalanine (F)
CTC = Leucine (L)
GCT = Alanine (A)
GGT = Glycine (G)
ACT = Threonine (T)
TCT = Serine (S)
GTG = Valine (V)
GAT = Aspartic acid (D)
GAA = Glutamic acid (E)
CAT = Histidine (H)
ATT = Isoleucine (I)
TAT = Tyrosine (Y)
TGT = Cysteine (C)
CGT = Arginine (R)
... and then TGA is the stop codon.

So the original protein sequence is: M F L A G T S V D E H I Y C R ... (stop)

Now, looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Original: TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: TTC TAC GCT...

Wait, original sequence around the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, let's break down the changes. The original has TTT at position 2 (codon 2), which is F. Then CTC (codon 3, L), GCT (codon4, A). 

Mutant1: After ATG (codon1), the next is TTC (codon2). TTC is still F. Then TAC (codon3). TAC is Y (tyrosine). Then GCT (codon4, A). So codon3 changed from CTC (L) to TAC (Y). That's a missense mutation: Leucine to Tyrosine. That might affect the protein's structure, but maybe not completely eliminate it. Unless this is a critical residue. But the question is which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. A missense might reduce activity but not necessarily eliminate. 

Mutant2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT...

So, codon2: TTT becomes TTC (still F), codon3: CTC becomes TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon. So here, in mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after the second codon. So the protein would be Methionine (ATG) - Phenylalanine (TTC) - Stop. That's a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation). This would result in a very short, non-functional protein. If the anti-nutritional compound is produced by this gene, then truncating the protein early would likely eliminate its production. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, let's compare step by step. Original sequence:

Positions (codon1 to codon6):

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT

7: TCT...

Mutant3:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: TAC (original was CTC)
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: GTC (original was ACT)
7: ACT (original was TCT?)

Wait, maybe there's an insertion or deletion here? Let me check the actual sequences.

Original sequence: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT

Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT

So, comparing nucleotide by nucleotide:

Original: C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant3: T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T...

Wait, let's see. From the original:

First exon area: the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So, the third codon in original is CTC (Leucine), which in mutant3 is TAC (Tyrosine). Then the sixth codon in original is ACT (Threonine), in mutant3 it's GTC (Valine). So two missense mutations here: L to Y and T to V. So two amino acid changes. Depending on where these are, but again, unless they're in critical regions, the protein might still be functional. So this might not eliminate the compound, just alter the protein's function partially.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, comparing:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, missing "GGT"? Let's check the actual sequences. Original has "CTCGCTGGTACTTCT", mutant4 has "TACGCTACTTCT". So original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (codons 3,4,5,6,7). Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (codons 3,4,5,6). So there's a deletion of "GGT" (codon5: GGT). So the length here is shorter. Let me count nucleotides. Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT is 5 codons (3 to 7). Each codon is 3 nucleotides. So 15 nucleotides. Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT is 4 codons. So 12 nucleotides. So 3 nucleotides less. That suggests a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which is a codon. So this would result in a deletion of one amino acid (GGT is glycine at codon5) but no frameshift. So the protein would lack one amino acid (glycine at position5), but the rest would be in frame. This is an in-frame deletion. Depending on where this glycine is, it might affect the protein structure, but maybe not completely inactivate it. So this could be a less severe mutation than a premature stop codon.

So summarizing:

Mutant1: Missense (L to Y) in codon3.

Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (stop at codon3).

Mutant3: Two missense mutations (L to Y and T to V).

Mutant4: In-frame deletion of codon5 (GGT, glycine).

The most likely to eliminate the compound would be the nonsense mutation (Mutant2), because it truncates the protein early, leading to a non-functional product. The other mutants might have partial function if the protein is only slightly altered. So the answer should be Mutant2.

Stop (TGA)\n\nNow, let\'s analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\nMutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\n\nComparing to original, the changes are:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT...\nMutant 1: TCT ACG CT...\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence, the original has TTT at positions 4-6 (codon 2: TTT = F), then CTC (codon 3: CTC = L), then GCT (codon4: GCT = A).\n\nIn Mutant 1, positions 4-6 are TCT (codon 2: TCT = S), then ACG (codon3: ACG = T), then GCT (A). So codon 2 changes from F (TTT) to S (TCT), codon 3 from L (CTC) to T (ACG). This is two missense mutations. But does this disrupt the protein enough to eliminate function? Maybe, but depends on the protein\'s structure. However, two amino acid substitutions may not completely abolish function, especially if they are in non-critical regions.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\nMutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT...\nMutant 2: TCT AAG CT...\n\nSo codon 2: TTT (F) becomes TCT (S), codon3: CTC (L) becomes AAG (K). Again, two missense mutations (F→S and L→K). Similar to Mutant 1; possible impact but not necessarily a knockout.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\nMutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nWait, let\'s check the exact changes. Original sequence starting after ATG:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence, after the initial ATG, original has TTT (F), then CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc.\n\nMutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nOriginal: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S), etc.\n\nMutant3: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: TAC (Y), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: GTC (V), 19-21: ACT (T), 22-24: TCT (S)...\n\nWait, but inserting "GTC" here. Wait, the original sequence around that area is GGT ACT TCT (GGT is codon5: GGT=G, ACT=codon6: T, TCT=codon7: S). In Mutant3, the sequence becomes GGT GTC ACT TCT. So, inserting "GTC" between GGT and ACT? Wait, perhaps there\'s an insertion here. Let me check the actual mutation.\n\nOriginal: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\nMutant3: ...GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nComparing the sequences:\n\nOriginal: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo, after GCT GGT (A G), the original has ACT TCT (T S), but Mutant3 has GTC ACT TCT. Wait, how is that possible? Let\'s check the DNA sequence.\n\nOriginal: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nDNA: ...GCT (positions 10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24)...\n\nMutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...\n\nSo, positions 16-18 in original are ACT (codon for T), but in Mutant3, positions 16-18 are GTC (codon for V), then ACT (T), so this suggests that there\'s an insertion of a \'G\' at position 16? Wait, original sequence from positions 13-15 is GGT (GGT), then 16-18 is ACT. Mutant3 has GGT (13-15), then GTC (16-18), ACT (19-21), TCT (22-24). Wait, this would mean that the original ACT (positions 16-18) is replaced by GTC, and the subsequent ACT is shifted. But the original sequence after GGT is ACT TCT GTG GAT... In Mutant3, after GGT, it\'s GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT... So there\'s a insertion of a \'GTC\' in place of \'ACT\', but that would require a substitution of A to G at position 16, C to T at 17, and T to C at 18? Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact nucleotides.\n\nOriginal sequence fragment starting from GCT (positions 10-12):\n\nOriginal: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n          10-12: GCT\n          13-15: GGT\n          16-18: ACT\n          19-21: TCT\n          22-24: GTG\n\nMutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo positions 10-12: GCT (same)\n13-15: GGT (same)\n16-18: GTC (instead of ACT)\n19-21: ACT (originally TCT)\n22-24: TCT (originally GTG)\nWait, this can\'t be right. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a duplication or a frameshift. Wait, the user-provided Mutant3 is:\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing the original and mutant3:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\nMutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo the original has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\nMutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nSo starting from position 4 (after ATG), original is TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), etc.\n\nIn Mutant3, positions 4-6: TTT (same), positions 7-9: TAC (instead of CTC), then GCT (10-12 same), GGT (13-15 same), GTC (16-18 instead of ACT), ACT (19-21 instead of TCT), TCT (22-24 instead of GTG), etc.\n\nSo, mutation at position 7-9: CTC → TAC (changing codon 3 from CTC (L) to TAC (Y)), and then codon 6 (original ACT (T) becomes GTC (V)), codon7 (TCT (S) becomes ACT (T)), codon8 (GTG (V) becomes TCT (S)), etc. Wait, but this would only be possible if there\'s a substitution in the original sequence. Let\'s check the actual DNA changes:\n\nOriginal sequence fragment: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nBreaking down the nucleotides:\n\nOriginal positions 4-21 (assuming each codon is 3 nucleotides):\n\n4-6: TTT\n7-9: CTC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: ACT\n19-21: TCT\n22-24: GTG\n\nMutant3:\n\n4-6: TTT (same)\n7-9: TAC (so C→A at position 7, T→C at 8? Wait, original CTC (positions7-9). To become TAC, that would require changing the first C to T (position7: C→T), the second T (position8) stays T? Wait, original is CTC (positions7-9: C, T, C). To get TAC, that would be T (position7), A (position8), C (position9). So, positions7 and 8 are changed: C→T and T→A. So that\'s two nucleotide substitutions: C7T and T8A. Then, positions10-12: GCT (same). Then GGT (13-15 same). Then positions16-18: original ACT becomes GTC. So A→G at position16, C→T at 17, T→C at 18. Then positions19-21: original TCT becomes ACT, so T→A at position19. So this is a series of substitutions causing multiple amino acid changes. However, since the reading frame isn\'t shifted (no insertions or deletions), this is a series of missense mutations. The question is whether any of these changes would disrupt the protein\'s function. However, multiple substitutions could lead to a non-functional protein, but it\'s not guaranteed. It might depend on the specific residues changed. But compared to a frameshift or a premature stop codon, this might be less likely to completely eliminate the protein\'s function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\nMutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo, after ATG TTT, original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT..., while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence:\n\nOriginal positions7-15: CTC GCT GGT (codons3-5: L, A, G)\nMutant4 positions7-15: TAC GCT ACT (codons3-5: Y, A, T)\n\nWait, but the original sequence from positions7-15 is CTC GCT GGT (CTC is positions7-9, GCT 10-12, GGT 13-15). Mutant4 has TAC (positions7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15). So, the original GGT (positions13-15, codon5: G) becomes ACT (codon5: T). Also, positions7-9: CTC→TAC (L→Y). Additionally, there\'s a deletion here? Because the original sequence after GGT (positions13-15) is ACT TCT GTG..., but in Mutant4, after ACT (positions13-15), it\'s TCT GTG... So maybe a deletion of some nucleotides. Wait, let\'s check the exact sequences.\n\nOriginal: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\nMutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nThe original has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\nMutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo between GCT and ACT, the original has GGT (positions13-15), which is missing in Mutant4. Therefore, there\'s a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT) at positions13-15. This would cause the loss of codon5 (GGT), which codes for glycine (G). The deletion of an entire codon (three nucleotides) would result in a protein missing one amino acid (a in-frame deletion), but the reading frame remains intact. This might disrupt the protein\'s structure if that glycine is critical, but it\'s not a frameshift. However, in-frame deletions can sometimes be tolerated, depending on the importance of the missing residue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a larger deletion. Let\'s check the user\'s provided sequences again:\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing the sequences:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\nMutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo, "CTCGCTGGTACT" in original becomes "TACGCTACT" in Mutant4. Let\'s count the nucleotides.\n\nOriginal fragment starting from position4 (after ATG):\n\nPositions4-6: TTT\n7-9: CTC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: ACT\n19-21: TCT\n22-24: GTG\n...\n\nMutant4:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT\n7-9: TAC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: ACT\n16-18: TCT\n19-21: GTG\n...\n\nSo, the original sequence from positions7-18 (CTC GCT GGT ACT) is replaced with TAC GCT ACT. So that\'s a deletion of GGT (positions13-15) and a substitution in positions7-9 (CTC→TAC). So, the deletion of codon5 (GGT) and a missense mutation in codon3 (CTC→TAC, L→Y). This results in an in-frame deletion of glycine and substitution of leucine to tyrosine. Depending on the protein\'s structure, this could disrupt its function. However, similar to the other missense mutations, it\'s possible but not certain.\n\nNow, considering all mutants:\n\n- **Mutant1 and Mutant2** have missense mutations (F→S and L→K; F→S and L→T). These could affect the protein but may not completely disable it.\n\n- **Mutant3** has multiple missense mutations (L→Y, T→V, S→T, etc.), which might disrupt the protein more severely, but still no frameshift or stop codon.\n\n- **Mutant4** has a deletion of a codon (GGT, glycine) and a missense mutation (L→Y). This is an in-frame deletion, which might disrupt the protein\'s structure but not the reading frame.\n\nHowever, none of these mutants introduce a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation, which are more likely to completely disrupt the protein\'s function. But wait, looking again at the original gene\'s sequence, the start codon is ATG, and the stop codon is TGA at the end. The mutations are in the first exon, early in the coding sequence.\n\nWait, let\'s check if any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon. A nonsense mutation would result in a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the coding sequence. Let\'s check each mutant:\n\n**Mutant1**: The changes are in codons 2 and 3 (F→S, L→T). No stop codons introduced.\n\n**Mutant2**: Codon2 (F→S), codon3 (L→K). No stop codons.\n\n**Mutant3**: Codon3 (L→Y), codon6 (T→V), codon7 (S→T), etc. No stop codons.\n\n**Mutant4**: Codon3 (L→Y), codon5 (G deleted), codon6 (T). No stop codons.\n\nSo none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. Therefore, the next best option would be a frameshift mutation, which alters the reading frame and likely leads to a premature stop codon downstream. However, looking at the mutants:\n\n- **Mutant3** has substitutions but no insertions or deletions (indels), so the reading frame remains the same.\n\n- **Mutant4** has a deletion of three nucleotides (codon5), which is an in-frame deletion, so the reading frame is preserved. Therefore, no frameshift.\n\nWait, but looking at Mutant3\'s sequence again: the user wrote "Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nComparing the sequences:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nMutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s an insertion here. Let\'s check the exact nucleotides:\n\nOriginal fragment: CT CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ...\n\nMutant3 fragment: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT ...\n\nWait, maybe there\'s an insertion of "GTC" leading to a frameshift? Let me count the nucleotides.\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions7-9: CTC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: ACT\n19-21: TCT\n22-24: GTG\n...\n\nMutant3:\n\nPositions7-9: TAC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: GTC\n19-21: ACT\n22-24: TCT\n...\n\nSo from positions7-9, original is CTC, mutant3 is TAC (substitution). Then positions10-15 are same (GCTGGT). Then original has ACT (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (16-18), ACT (19-21). So the ACT in original (16-18) is replaced by GTC, and the following TCT (19-21) becomes ACT (19-21), then TCT (22-24). This suggests substitutions but no frameshift. Therefore, reading frame remains the same.\n\nTherefore, none of the mutants have a frameshift or a premature stop codon. So the next best possibility is that one of the missense mutations or in-frame deletions disrupts a critical part of the protein, such as the active site or a crucial domain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the sequences. Let me check Mutant4 again. The user wrote:\n\nMutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\nMutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nSo, in Mutant4, after TTT (codon2: F), the next codon is TAC (Y) instead of CTC (L). Then, the original has GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S)... but in Mutant4, after TAC (codon3: Y), it\'s GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S)... So the GGT (G) codon is missing. This indicates a deletion of the GGT codon (positions13-15 in original), which is three nucleotides. Since it\'s a three-nucleotide deletion, it\'s an in-frame deletion, leading to the loss of glycine at position5. So the protein would have a deletion of glycine but the rest of the sequence would be in frame. Depending on where this glycine is located, this could disrupt the protein\'s structure. Glycine is often important in protein structure due to its flexibility. However, it\'s possible that this deletion, combined with the L→Y mutation in codon3, could severely impair the protein\'s function. But without knowing the protein\'s structure, it\'s hard to say for sure.\n\nComparing all mutants, Mutant4 has both a missense mutation and an in-frame deletion, which might be more disruptive than single missense mutations. However, without a frameshift or a stop codon, the protein might still be partially functional. However, if the anti-nutritional compound is a product of a multi-step enzymatic pathway, even a partially functional enzyme might still produce it. Therefore, the most effective mutation would be one that completely disrupts the gene product.\n\nWait, but none of the mutants have a frameshift or stop codon. So among the given options, which is the most likely to eliminate the compound?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a frameshift in one of the mutants. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Mutant3: the user wrote "Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s an insertion here. Let\'s count the number of nucleotides. Original segment from TTT (positions4-6) to TCT (positions19-21):\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions4-21: 18 nucleotides)\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT (positions4-24: 21 nucleotides)\n\nWait, no, that can\'t be. Maybe there\'s an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT. If that\'s the case, then Mutant3 has an insertion of GTC, making the sequence GGT GTC ACT instead of GGT ACT. That would be an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) at position16-18, which is an in-frame insertion. This would add an extra amino acid (valine, V) between G and T. However, this is still an in-frame mutation and might not disrupt the reading frame. Therefore, the protein would have an extra amino acid but might still be functional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a different mutation. Let me check the exact sequences again:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\nMutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nSo, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\nMutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo, the first three codons after TTT (codon2: F) are:\n\nOriginal: CTC (L) GCT (A) GGT (G) ACT (T) TCT (S)...\nMutant3: TAC (Y) GCT (A) GGT (G) GTC (V) ACT (T) TCT (S)...\n\nSo the ACT (T) in original becomes GTC (V) ACT (T) in Mutant3. Wait, that would require inserting GTC between GGT and ACT. So inserting three nucleotides (GTC) would shift the subsequent codons, but since it\'s an in-frame insertion (three nucleotides), the reading frame isn\'t altered. So the protein would have an extra valine (V) inserted between G and T. This might disrupt the protein\'s structure if that region is critical, but it\'s not a frameshift.\n\nGiven that none of the mutants have a frameshift or a premature stop codon, the best bet is the mutation that causes the most disruptive missense mutations or in-frame deletions. Between the mutants:\n\n- Mutant4 has a deletion of a codon (G) and a missense mutation (L→Y). This could be more disruptive than single substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, Mutant2: changing CTC (L) to AAG (K) and TTT (F) to TCT (S). Leucine to lysine is a bigger change (hydrophobic to positively charged), which might disrupt protein structure more.\n\nBut without knowing the protein\'s structure, it\'s hard to say. However, in the absence of frameshifts or stop codons, the next best option is a mutation that disrupts the start codon. But the start codon in all mutants is ATG, which is intact.\n\nWait, checking the start codon in each mutant:\n\nAll mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is preserved. Therefore, translation should initiate normally.\n\nGiven that, the most disruptive mutation would likely be Mutant4, which deletes an entire codon (glycine) and changes another residue (leucine to tyrosine). The loss of a residue and a significant amino acid change might disrupt the protein\'s function more than single substitutions. Alternatively, Mutant2\'s change from leucine to lysine (a charged residue) in codon3 might be more disruptive.\n\nAnother angle: EMS typically induces point mutations, mostly transitions (G→A, C→T). Let\'s check the mutations:\n\nMutant1: The original has TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\n\nMutant1: TCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a substitution at position7: C→T and position8: T→C. So CTC (codon3) becomes TCT (codon3). But that\'s a C→T transition at position7 (which is a common EMS mutation), leading to CTC→TTC (if only position7 changes), but in this case, it\'s changed to TCT. Wait, perhaps there\'s a T insertion. Maybe I should look at the exact changes.\n\nOriginal sequence fragment: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant1: TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T...\n\nWait, no, the user wrote Mutant1 as:\n\nMutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nSo, after ATG, original has TTT (codon2: F), then CTC (codon3: L), GCT (A), GGT (G), etc.\n\nMutant1: After ATG, TTC (codon2: F), TAC (codon3: Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), etc.\n\nSo codon2 changes from TTT (F) to TTC (F) – synonymous mutation, no change. Codon3 changes from CTC (L) to TAC (Y). This is a C→T transition at position7 (since CTC→TAC requires C→T at position7 and T→A at position8). Wait, the third base of codon2 in original is T (TTT), which remains T in Mutant1 (TTC). So codon2 is still F. Codon3: CTC→TAC. This would require C→T at position7 and T→A at position8. The C→T transition is a common EMS mutation, but the T→A transversion is less likely with EMS, which primarily causes transitions. Therefore, Mutant1\'s mutation at position8 (T→A) might not be typical for EMS, but the user doesn\'t specify that we should consider EMS\'s mutation bias.\n\nSimilarly, Mutant2:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nWait, the user wrote Mutant2 as:\n\nMutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nSo codon2: TTT→TTC (F→F, synonymous), codon3: CTC→TAA. TAA is a stop codon. Wait, this is critical!\n\nWait, original codon3 is CTC (L), Mutant2 codon3 is TAA (stop). If this is the case, then Mutant2 has a nonsense mutation in codon3, leading to premature termination. This would result in a truncated protein of just 3 amino acids (M-F-stop), which would certainly eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. But why didn\'t I notice this earlier?\n\nWait, let\'s check the actual DNA sequences again:\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nBreaking down the first few codons:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nWait, positions7-9 in original: CTC (L), in Mutant2: TAA (stop). So codon3 in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon. This is a nonsense mutation, leading to a truncated protein. This would be the most effective mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the protein would be non-functional.\n\nBut why did I not see this earlier? Because I misread the Mutant2 sequence. Let\'s verify:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant2 sequence after ATG: TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nSo the original third codon (positions7-9) is CTC (L), and in Mutant2, it\'s TAA (stop). Therefore, this is a nonsense mutation at codon3, resulting in a severely truncated protein. This would almost certainly eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound, assuming the compound is produced by the full-length protein.\n\nThis makes Mutant2 the correct answer. My earlier analysis missed this because I didn\'t properly parse the codons in Mutant2. The key is that changing CTC (L) to TAA (stop) introduces a premature termination codon early in the gene, which would result in a non-functional protein. This is a classic example of a knockout mutation caused by EMS-induced point mutations (C→T transition in the third position of codon3, changing CTC→TAA). However, CTC to TAA would require two mutations: C→T at position7 and C→A at position9? Let\'s check the DNA sequence:\n\nOriginal codon3: CTC (DNA: C T C)\nMutant2 codon3: TAA (DNA: T A A)\n\nSo positions7-9: C→T at position7, T→A at position8, and C→A at position9. Wait, that\'s three nucleotide changes. But EMS typically causes single point mutations. However, the user\'s provided Mutant2 sequence is:\n\nOriginal: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...\nMutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...\n\nSo, comparing the DNA:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...\nMutant2: T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...\n\nSo, after the initial TTT (positions4-6), original has C T C (positions7-9), while Mutant2 has T A A (positions7-9). Therefore, three nucleotide changes: C→T at position7, T→A at position8, and C→A at position9. This is three mutations in a row, which is highly unlikely from EMS mutagenesis, which typically induces single nucleotide changes. However, the question states that the mutations were discovered in the target gene\'s sequence, regardless of EMS\'s typical mutation pattern. Therefore, even if it\'s three changes, according to the given sequences, Mutant2 has a premature stop codon at codon3.\n\nHowever, this seems unrealistic because three simultaneous point mutations in adjacent nucleotides are improbable. Perhaps there was a mistake in transcribing the mutant sequences. Let me double-check the user\'s input:\n\nOriginal gene:\n\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant2:\n\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nComparing the original and Mutant2 sequences:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTG GTA CT...\n\nWait, perhaps the spaces between codons are different. Let\'s parse it correctly:\n\nOriginal: positions1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT...\n\nMutant2: positions1-3: ATG, 4-6: TCT, 7-9: AAG, 10-12: CTG, 13-15: GTA, 16-18: CT...\n\nWait, this can\'t be right. Let\'s look at the actual nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\nMutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTG GTA CTT CT...\n\nWait, no, the user\'s Mutant2 sequence is: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nSo after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTC (codon2: F)\nPositions7-9: TAA (codon3: stop)\nPositions10-12: GCT (codon4: A)\nPositions13-15: GGT (codon5: G)\nPositions16-18: ACT (codon6: T)\n...\n\nTherefore, codon3 in Mutant2 is TAA (stop). This requires that positions7-9 are TAA. Original positions7-9 are CTC, so to get TAA, the changes are:\n\nPosition7: C→T\nPosition8: T→A\nPosition9: C→A\n\nThree mutations in a row. While this is possible, it\'s highly unlikely from a single EMS treatment, which usually causes single point mutations. However, the question presents these as the given mutant sequences, so we must work with them.\n\nAssuming Mutant2 has a premature stop codon at codon3, this would result in a severely truncated protein (only two amino acids: M-F-stop), which would almost certainly be non-functional. Therefore, Mutant2 would be the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMy initial analysis overlooked this because I misaligned the codons in Mutant2. This underscores the importance of careful codon-by-codon comparison.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Mutant2.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385583, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8460, prompt_tokens=562, total_tokens=9022, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's coding sequence:

### **Key Analysis**
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - **Changes**: Codon 2 (TTT → TCT: **F→S**) and Codon 3 (CTC → ACG: **L→T**).  
   - **Effect**: Two missense mutations. While disruptive, the protein may retain partial function.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - **Changes**: Codon 3 (CTC → TAA: **L→STOP**).  
   - **Effect**: Introduces a **premature stop codon** at position 3, truncating the protein to just two amino acids (M-F-stop). This **nonsense mutation** completely abolishes protein function, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - **Changes**: Multiple missense mutations (e.g., L→Y, T→V, S→T) and an in-frame insertion.  
   - **Effect**: Alters several amino acids but preserves the reading frame. The protein may retain partial activity.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - **Changes**: Codon 3 (CTC → TAC: **L→Y**) and deletion of codon 5 (GGT: **G**).  
   - **Effect**: In-frame deletion and missense mutation. While disruptive, the protein might still function partially.  

### **Conclusion**
**Mutant 2** introduces a **premature stop codon** early in the gene (codon 3), resulting in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.  

**Answer:** Mutant 2

TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Translating these codons:

Methionine (M) - Phenylalanine (F) - Leucine (L) - Alanine (A) - Glycine (G) - Threonine (T) - Serine (S) - Valine (V) - Aspartic acid (D) - Glutamic acid (E) - Histidine (H) - Isoleucine (I) - Tyrosine (Y) - Cysteine (C) - Arginine (R) ... Stop (TGA)

Now, let's analyze each mutant:

**Mutant 1:**
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Comparing to original, the changes are:

Original: TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: TCT ACG CT...

Looking at the DNA sequence, the original has TTT at positions 4-6 (codon 2: TTT = F), then CTC (codon 3: CTC = L), then GCT (codon4: GCT = A).

In Mutant 1, positions 4-6 are TCT (codon 2: TCT = S), then ACG (codon3: ACG = T), then GCT (A). So codon 2 changes from F (TTT) to S (TCT), codon 3 from L (CTC) to T (ACG). This is two missense mutations. But does this disrupt the protein enough to eliminate function? Maybe, but depends on the protein's structure. However, two amino acid substitutions may not completely abolish function, especially if they are in non-critical regions.

**Mutant 2:**
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Comparing to original:

Original: TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 2: TCT AAG CT...

So codon 2: TTT (F) becomes TCT (S), codon3: CTC (L) becomes AAG (K). Again, two missense mutations (F→S and L→K). Similar to Mutant 1; possible impact but not necessarily a knockout.

**Mutant 3:**
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, let's check the exact changes. Original sequence starting after ATG:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Looking at the DNA sequence, after the initial ATG, original has TTT (F), then CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc.

Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Breaking it down:

Original: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S), etc.

Mutant3: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: TAC (Y), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: GTC (V), 19-21: ACT (T), 22-24: TCT (S)...

Wait, but inserting "GTC" here. Wait, the original sequence around that area is GGT ACT TCT (GGT is codon5: GGT=G, ACT=codon6: T, TCT=codon7: S). In Mutant3, the sequence becomes GGT GTC ACT TCT. So, inserting "GTC" between GGT and ACT? Wait, perhaps there's an insertion here. Let me check the actual mutation.

Original: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant3: ...GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Comparing the sequences:

Original: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, after GCT GGT (A G), the original has ACT TCT (T S), but Mutant3 has GTC ACT TCT. Wait, how is that possible? Let's check the DNA sequence.

Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

DNA: ...GCT (positions 10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24)...

Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, positions 16-18 in original are ACT (codon for T), but in Mutant3, positions 16-18 are GTC (codon for V), then ACT (T), so this suggests that there's an insertion of a 'G' at position 16? Wait, original sequence from positions 13-15 is GGT (GGT), then 16-18 is ACT. Mutant3 has GGT (13-15), then GTC (16-18), ACT (19-21), TCT (22-24). Wait, this would mean that the original ACT (positions 16-18) is replaced by GTC, and the subsequent ACT is shifted. But the original sequence after GGT is ACT TCT GTG GAT... In Mutant3, after GGT, it's GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT... So there's a insertion of a 'GTC' in place of 'ACT', but that would require a substitution of A to G at position 16, C to T at 17, and T to C at 18? Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact nucleotides.

Original sequence fragment starting from GCT (positions 10-12):

Original: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
          10-12: GCT
          13-15: GGT
          16-18: ACT
          19-21: TCT
          22-24: GTG

Mutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So positions 10-12: GCT (same)
13-15: GGT (same)
16-18: GTC (instead of ACT)
19-21: ACT (originally TCT)
22-24: TCT (originally GTG)
Wait, this can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a duplication or a frameshift. Wait, the user-provided Mutant3 is:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing the original and mutant3:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So the original has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So starting from position 4 (after ATG), original is TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), etc.

In Mutant3, positions 4-6: TTT (same), positions 7-9: TAC (instead of CTC), then GCT (10-12 same), GGT (13-15 same), GTC (16-18 instead of ACT), ACT (19-21 instead of TCT), TCT (22-24 instead of GTG), etc.

So, mutation at position 7-9: CTC → TAC (changing codon 3 from CTC (L) to TAC (Y)), and then codon 6 (original ACT (T) becomes GTC (V)), codon7 (TCT (S) becomes ACT (T)), codon8 (GTG (V) becomes TCT (S)), etc. Wait, but this would only be possible if there's a substitution in the original sequence. Let's check the actual DNA changes:

Original sequence fragment: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Breaking down the nucleotides:

Original positions 4-21 (assuming each codon is 3 nucleotides):

4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG

Mutant3:

4-6: TTT (same)
7-9: TAC (so C→A at position 7, T→C at 8? Wait, original CTC (positions7-9). To become TAC, that would require changing the first C to T (position7: C→T), the second T (position8) stays T? Wait, original is CTC (positions7-9: C, T, C). To get TAC, that would be T (position7), A (position8), C (position9). So, positions7 and 8 are changed: C→T and T→A. So that's two nucleotide substitutions: C7T and T8A. Then, positions10-12: GCT (same). Then GGT (13-15 same). Then positions16-18: original ACT becomes GTC. So A→G at position16, C→T at 17, T→C at 18. Then positions19-21: original TCT becomes ACT, so T→A at position19. So this is a series of substitutions causing multiple amino acid changes. However, since the reading frame isn't shifted (no insertions or deletions), this is a series of missense mutations. The question is whether any of these changes would disrupt the protein's function. However, multiple substitutions could lead to a non-functional protein, but it's not guaranteed. It might depend on the specific residues changed. But compared to a frameshift or a premature stop codon, this might be less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function.

**Mutant 4:**
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, after ATG TTT, original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT..., while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Looking at the DNA sequence:

Original positions7-15: CTC GCT GGT (codons3-5: L, A, G)
Mutant4 positions7-15: TAC GCT ACT (codons3-5: Y, A, T)

Wait, but the original sequence from positions7-15 is CTC GCT GGT (CTC is positions7-9, GCT 10-12, GGT 13-15). Mutant4 has TAC (positions7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15). So, the original GGT (positions13-15, codon5: G) becomes ACT (codon5: T). Also, positions7-9: CTC→TAC (L→Y). Additionally, there's a deletion here? Because the original sequence after GGT (positions13-15) is ACT TCT GTG..., but in Mutant4, after ACT (positions13-15), it's TCT GTG... So maybe a deletion of some nucleotides. Wait, let's check the exact sequences.

Original: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

The original has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So between GCT and ACT, the original has GGT (positions13-15), which is missing in Mutant4. Therefore, there's a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT) at positions13-15. This would cause the loss of codon5 (GGT), which codes for glycine (G). The deletion of an entire codon (three nucleotides) would result in a protein missing one amino acid (a in-frame deletion), but the reading frame remains intact. This might disrupt the protein's structure if that glycine is critical, but it's not a frameshift. However, in-frame deletions can sometimes be tolerated, depending on the importance of the missing residue.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a larger deletion. Let's check the user's provided sequences again:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing the sequences:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, "CTCGCTGGTACT" in original becomes "TACGCTACT" in Mutant4. Let's count the nucleotides.

Original fragment starting from position4 (after ATG):

Positions4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
...

Mutant4:

Positions4-6: TTT
7-9: TAC
10-12: GCT
13-15: ACT
16-18: TCT
19-21: GTG
...

So, the original sequence from positions7-18 (CTC GCT GGT ACT) is replaced with TAC GCT ACT. So that's a deletion of GGT (positions13-15) and a substitution in positions7-9 (CTC→TAC). So, the deletion of codon5 (GGT) and a missense mutation in codon3 (CTC→TAC, L→Y). This results in an in-frame deletion of glycine and substitution of leucine to tyrosine. Depending on the protein's structure, this could disrupt its function. However, similar to the other missense mutations, it's possible but not certain.

Now, considering all mutants:

- **Mutant1 and Mutant2** have missense mutations (F→S and L→K; F→S and L→T). These could affect the protein but may not completely disable it.

- **Mutant3** has multiple missense mutations (L→Y, T→V, S→T, etc.), which might disrupt the protein more severely, but still no frameshift or stop codon.

- **Mutant4** has a deletion of a codon (GGT, glycine) and a missense mutation (L→Y). This is an in-frame deletion, which might disrupt the protein's structure but not the reading frame.

However, none of these mutants introduce a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation, which are more likely to completely disrupt the protein's function. But wait, looking again at the original gene's sequence, the start codon is ATG, and the stop codon is TGA at the end. The mutations are in the first exon, early in the coding sequence.

Wait, let's check if any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon. A nonsense mutation would result in a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the coding sequence. Let's check each mutant:

**Mutant1**: The changes are in codons 2 and 3 (F→S, L→T). No stop codons introduced.

**Mutant2**: Codon2 (F→S), codon3 (L→K). No stop codons.

**Mutant3**: Codon3 (L→Y), codon6 (T→V), codon7 (S→T), etc. No stop codons.

**Mutant4**: Codon3 (L→Y), codon5 (G deleted), codon6 (T). No stop codons.

So none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. Therefore, the next best option would be a frameshift mutation, which alters the reading frame and likely leads to a premature stop codon downstream. However, looking at the mutants:

- **Mutant3** has substitutions but no insertions or deletions (indels), so the reading frame remains the same.

- **Mutant4** has a deletion of three nucleotides (codon5), which is an in-frame deletion, so the reading frame is preserved. Therefore, no frameshift.

Wait, but looking at Mutant3's sequence again: the user wrote "Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing the sequences:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps there's an insertion here. Let's check the exact nucleotides:

Original fragment: CT CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ...

Mutant3 fragment: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, maybe there's an insertion of "GTC" leading to a frameshift? Let me count the nucleotides.

Original:

Positions7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
...

Mutant3:

Positions7-9: TAC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: GTC
19-21: ACT
22-24: TCT
...

So from positions7-9, original is CTC, mutant3 is TAC (substitution). Then positions10-15 are same (GCTGGT). Then original has ACT (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (16-18), ACT (19-21). So the ACT in original (16-18) is replaced by GTC, and the following TCT (19-21) becomes ACT (19-21), then TCT (22-24). This suggests substitutions but no frameshift. Therefore, reading frame remains the same.

Therefore, none of the mutants have a frameshift or a premature stop codon. So the next best possibility is that one of the missense mutations or in-frame deletions disrupts a critical part of the protein, such as the active site or a crucial domain.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the sequences. Let me check Mutant4 again. The user wrote:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in Mutant4, after TTT (codon2: F), the next codon is TAC (Y) instead of CTC (L). Then, the original has GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S)... but in Mutant4, after TAC (codon3: Y), it's GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S)... So the GGT (G) codon is missing. This indicates a deletion of the GGT codon (positions13-15 in original), which is three nucleotides. Since it's a three-nucleotide deletion, it's an in-frame deletion, leading to the loss of glycine at position5. So the protein would have a deletion of glycine but the rest of the sequence would be in frame. Depending on where this glycine is located, this could disrupt the protein's structure. Glycine is often important in protein structure due to its flexibility. However, it's possible that this deletion, combined with the L→Y mutation in codon3, could severely impair the protein's function. But without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say for sure.

Comparing all mutants, Mutant4 has both a missense mutation and an in-frame deletion, which might be more disruptive than single missense mutations. However, without a frameshift or a stop codon, the protein might still be partially functional. However, if the anti-nutritional compound is a product of a multi-step enzymatic pathway, even a partially functional enzyme might still produce it. Therefore, the most effective mutation would be one that completely disrupts the gene product.

Wait, but none of the mutants have a frameshift or stop codon. So among the given options, which is the most likely to eliminate the compound?

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a frameshift in one of the mutants. Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant3: the user wrote "Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps there's an insertion here. Let's count the number of nucleotides. Original segment from TTT (positions4-6) to TCT (positions19-21):

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions4-21: 18 nucleotides)
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT (positions4-24: 21 nucleotides)

Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe there's an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT. If that's the case, then Mutant3 has an insertion of GTC, making the sequence GGT GTC ACT instead of GGT ACT. That would be an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) at position16-18, which is an in-frame insertion. This would add an extra amino acid (valine, V) between G and T. However, this is still an in-frame mutation and might not disrupt the reading frame. Therefore, the protein would have an extra amino acid but might still be functional.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different mutation. Let me check the exact sequences again:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first three codons after TTT (codon2: F) are:

Original: CTC (L) GCT (A) GGT (G) ACT (T) TCT (S)...
Mutant3: TAC (Y) GCT (A) GGT (G) GTC (V) ACT (T) TCT (S)...

So the ACT (T) in original becomes GTC (V) ACT (T) in Mutant3. Wait, that would require inserting GTC between GGT and ACT. So inserting three nucleotides (GTC) would shift the subsequent codons, but since it's an in-frame insertion (three nucleotides), the reading frame isn't altered. So the protein would have an extra valine (V) inserted between G and T. This might disrupt the protein's structure if that region is critical, but it's not a frameshift.

Given that none of the mutants have a frameshift or a premature stop codon, the best bet is the mutation that causes the most disruptive missense mutations or in-frame deletions. Between the mutants:

- Mutant4 has a deletion of a codon (G) and a missense mutation (L→Y). This could be more disruptive than single substitutions.

Alternatively, Mutant2: changing CTC (L) to AAG (K) and TTT (F) to TCT (S). Leucine to lysine is a bigger change (hydrophobic to positively charged), which might disrupt protein structure more.

But without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say. However, in the absence of frameshifts or stop codons, the next best option is a mutation that disrupts the start codon. But the start codon in all mutants is ATG, which is intact.

Wait, checking the start codon in each mutant:

All mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is preserved. Therefore, translation should initiate normally.

Given that, the most disruptive mutation would likely be Mutant4, which deletes an entire codon (glycine) and changes another residue (leucine to tyrosine). The loss of a residue and a significant amino acid change might disrupt the protein's function more than single substitutions. Alternatively, Mutant2's change from leucine to lysine (a charged residue) in codon3 might be more disruptive.

Another angle: EMS typically induces point mutations, mostly transitions (G→A, C→T). Let's check the mutations:

Mutant1: The original has TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant1: TCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So comparing:

Original: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Wait, perhaps there's a substitution at position7: C→T and position8: T→C. So CTC (codon3) becomes TCT (codon3). But that's a C→T transition at position7 (which is a common EMS mutation), leading to CTC→TTC (if only position7 changes), but in this case, it's changed to TCT. Wait, perhaps there's a T insertion. Maybe I should look at the exact changes.

Original sequence fragment: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, no, the user wrote Mutant1 as:

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, after ATG, original has TTT (codon2: F), then CTC (codon3: L), GCT (A), GGT (G), etc.

Mutant1: After ATG, TTC (codon2: F), TAC (codon3: Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), etc.

So codon2 changes from TTT (F) to TTC (F) – synonymous mutation, no change. Codon3 changes from CTC (L) to TAC (Y). This is a C→T transition at position7 (since CTC→TAC requires C→T at position7 and T→A at position8). Wait, the third base of codon2 in original is T (TTT), which remains T in Mutant1 (TTC). So codon2 is still F. Codon3: CTC→TAC. This would require C→T at position7 and T→A at position8. The C→T transition is a common EMS mutation, but the T→A transversion is less likely with EMS, which primarily causes transitions. Therefore, Mutant1's mutation at position8 (T→A) might not be typical for EMS, but the user doesn't specify that we should consider EMS's mutation bias.

Similarly, Mutant2:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, the user wrote Mutant2 as:

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So codon2: TTT→TTC (F→F, synonymous), codon3: CTC→TAA. TAA is a stop codon. Wait, this is critical!

Wait, original codon3 is CTC (L), Mutant2 codon3 is TAA (stop). If this is the case, then Mutant2 has a nonsense mutation in codon3, leading to premature termination. This would result in a truncated protein of just 3 amino acids (M-F-stop), which would certainly eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. But why didn't I notice this earlier?

Wait, let's check the actual DNA sequences again:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking down the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, positions7-9 in original: CTC (L), in Mutant2: TAA (stop). So codon3 in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon. This is a nonsense mutation, leading to a truncated protein. This would be the most effective mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the protein would be non-functional.

But why did I not see this earlier? Because I misread the Mutant2 sequence. Let's verify:

Original sequence after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2 sequence after ATG: TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So the original third codon (positions7-9) is CTC (L), and in Mutant2, it's TAA (stop). Therefore, this is a nonsense mutation at codon3, resulting in a severely truncated protein. This would almost certainly eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound, assuming the compound is produced by the full-length protein.

This makes Mutant2 the correct answer. My earlier analysis missed this because I didn't properly parse the codons in Mutant2. The key is that changing CTC (L) to TAA (stop) introduces a premature termination codon early in the gene, which would result in a non-functional protein. This is a classic example of a knockout mutation caused by EMS-induced point mutations (C→T transition in the third position of codon3, changing CTC→TAA). However, CTC to TAA would require two mutations: C→T at position7 and C→A at position9? Let's check the DNA sequence:

Original codon3: CTC (DNA: C T C)
Mutant2 codon3: TAA (DNA: T A A)

So positions7-9: C→T at position7, T→A at position8, and C→A at position9. Wait, that's three nucleotide changes. But EMS typically causes single point mutations. However, the user's provided Mutant2 sequence is:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

So, comparing the DNA:

Original: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...
Mutant2: T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...

So, after the initial TTT (positions4-6), original has C T C (positions7-9), while Mutant2 has T A A (positions7-9). Therefore, three nucleotide changes: C→T at position7, T→A at position8, and C→A at position9. This is three mutations in a row, which is highly unlikely from EMS mutagenesis, which typically induces single nucleotide changes. However, the question states that the mutations were discovered in the target gene's sequence, regardless of EMS's typical mutation pattern. Therefore, even if it's three changes, according to the given sequences, Mutant2 has a premature stop codon at codon3.

However, this seems unrealistic because three simultaneous point mutations in adjacent nucleotides are improbable. Perhaps there was a mistake in transcribing the mutant sequences. Let me double-check the user's input:

Original gene:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing the original and Mutant2 sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTG GTA CT...

Wait, perhaps the spaces between codons are different. Let's parse it correctly:

Original: positions1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT...

Mutant2: positions1-3: ATG, 4-6: TCT, 7-9: AAG, 10-12: CTG, 13-15: GTA, 16-18: CT...

Wait, this can't be right. Let's look at the actual nucleotides:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTG GTA CTT CT...

Wait, no, the user's Mutant2 sequence is: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Breaking this down:

ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T...

So after ATG:

Positions4-6: TTC (codon2: F)
Positions7-9: TAA (codon3: stop)
Positions10-12: GCT (codon4: A)
Positions13-15: GGT (codon5: G)
Positions16-18: ACT (codon6: T)
...

Therefore, codon3 in Mutant2 is TAA (stop). This requires that positions7-9 are TAA. Original positions7-9 are CTC, so to get TAA, the changes are:

Position7: C→T
Position8: T→A
Position9: C→A

Three mutations in a row. While this is possible, it's highly unlikely from a single EMS treatment, which usually causes single point mutations. However, the question presents these as the given mutant sequences, so we must work with them.

Assuming Mutant2 has a premature stop codon at codon3, this would result in a severely truncated protein (only two amino acids: M-F-stop), which would almost certainly be non-functional. Therefore, Mutant2 would be the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

My initial analysis overlooked this because I misaligned the codons in Mutant2. This underscores the importance of careful codon-by-codon comparison.

Therefore, the correct answer is Mutant2.

This causes a deletion of the glycine (G) at that position. Since it's a three-nucleotide deletion, it doesn't cause a frameshift. The reading frame remains the same, but the protein is missing one amino acid (Glycine at position 5). This is an in-frame deletion. Depending on the importance of this glycine, the protein might retain some function. If the glycine is critical for the enzyme's structure or active site, this mutation could disrupt function.

   - **Mutation**: The third codon after the start codon (ATG) changes from **CTC** (Leucine) to **TAA**, a premature stop codon.  
   - **Effect**: This nonsense mutation truncates the protein after the second amino acid (M-F-Stop). A severely truncated protein is non-functional, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Translating these codons into amino acids using the standard genetic code:

ATG (Methionine, M)
TTT (Phenylalanine, F)
CTC (Leucine, L)
GCT (Alanine, A)
GGT (Glycine, G)
ACT (Threonine, T)
TCT (Serine, S)
GTG (Valine, V)
GAT (Aspartic acid, D)
GAA (Glutamic acid, E)
CAT (Histidine, H)
ATT (Isoleucine, I)
TAT (Tyrosine, Y)
TGT (Cysteine, C)
CGT (Arginine, R)
...
TGA (Stop)

So the original protein sequence starts as M-F-L-A-G-T-S-V-D-E-H-I-Y-C-R... until the stop codon.

Now, let's analyze each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to original:
Original: TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: TCT ACG CT...

Looking at the differences. Let's break down the original and mutant sequences here. The original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT... The mutant is ATG TTC TAC GCT...

Original DNA: positions after ATG (positions 4-6): TTT (codon for F)
Mutant 1: positions 4-6: TCT (codon for S)

Then original positions 7-9: CTC (codon for L)
Mutant 1: positions 7-9: TAC (codon for Y)

So, in Mutant 1, the third codon changes from F (TTT) to S (TCT) and the fourth codon from L (CTC) to Y (TAC). This is a missense mutation. Whether this would disrupt the protein function depends on the role of these amino acids, but since it's early in the gene, maybe in the N-terminus, it could affect protein structure. However, it's not a frameshift or a stop codon, so the protein might still be produced but altered. If these residues are critical, the protein might be non-functional. However, this is not guaranteed.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 2: TTA AGC TGG...

Wait, let's align properly. Original sequence after ATG:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 2: TTA AGC TGG TAC TTC TGT...

Wait, the mutant sequence here is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Breaking down the codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, after the ATG (M), the next codon in mutant 2 is TTC (F), same as original's TTT (F), since TTC also codes for F. Then the third codon in original is CTC (L), but in mutant 2, it's TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So here, the third codon after the start becomes a stop codon. That would result in a truncated protein: M-F-Stop. This is a nonsense mutation. If the protein is truncated so early, it's unlikely to be functional. Therefore, this mutation (Mutant 2) would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the gene product is not produced beyond the second amino acid. This seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Comparing codons:

Original: TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V)
Mutant 3: TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V)

So, the second codon remains F (TTT), third codon changes from L (CTC) to Y (TAC). Then the fifth codon changes from ACT (T) to GTC (V). So two missense mutations: L→Y and T→V. Depending on where these are in the protein, this could disrupt function. However, since both are substitutions, the protein is still full-length. If these amino acids are critical for enzyme activity, this might work, but it's not a guaranteed knockout. The anti-nutritional compound's synthesis might be reduced but not eliminated. However, without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say. However, compared to Mutant 2, which introduces a premature stop codon, Mutant 3 might not be as effective in eliminating the compound.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Looking at the sequence: After ATG TTT (F), original has CTC GCT GGT ACT..., whereas mutant 4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, let's break down the codons:

Original: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), etc.

Mutant 4: After ATG TTT (positions 4-6: TTT, F), then positions 7-9: TAC (Y), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: ACT (T), skipping GGT (original 13-15: GGT). So there's a deletion here. Comparing the sequences:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 4: ...TAC GCT ACT...

So, the original sequence from position 7-15 is CTC GCT GGT ACT (codons L, A, G, T). Mutant 4 is TAC GCT ACT (codons Y, A, T). There's a deletion of the GGT codon (GGT) which is three nucleotides. Wait, but how? Let me check the actual DNA sequences.

Original sequence segment:

positions 1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

Mutant 4 sequence:

After ATG TTT (positions 4-6: TTT), then TAC (positions 7-9: TAC), GCT (10-12: GCT), then ACT (13-15: ACT). Original had GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18). So in mutant 4, the GGT (positions 13-15 in original) is missing. Therefore, there's a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT) at positions 13-15. This causes a deletion of the glycine (G) at that position. Since it's a three-nucleotide deletion, it doesn't cause a frameshift. The reading frame remains the same, but the protein is missing one amino acid (Glycine at position 5). This is an in-frame deletion. Depending on the importance of this glycine, the protein might retain some function. If the glycine is critical for the enzyme's structure or active site, this mutation could disrupt function. However, in-frame deletions are less disruptive than frameshifts or nonsense mutations. So, unless the deleted amino acid is crucial, the protein might still be partially functional. Therefore, this mutation might reduce but not eliminate the compound.

Comparing all mutants:

Mutant 1: Two missense mutations (F→S and L→Y). Possible partial disruption.

Mutant 2: Early nonsense mutation (third codon after start is stop). Results in a severely truncated protein (only two amino acids). This would almost certainly eliminate the protein, thus the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant 3: Two missense mutations (L→Y and T→V). Possible disruption, but not guaranteed.

Mutant 4: In-frame deletion of a glycine. Possible disruption but may retain function.

Therefore, the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound is Mutant 2, as it introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a non-functional protein.
