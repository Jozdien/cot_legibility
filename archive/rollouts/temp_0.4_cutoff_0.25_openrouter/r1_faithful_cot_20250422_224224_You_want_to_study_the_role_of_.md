# Original Question

You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic construct is due to a **premature stop codon** introduced immediately after the HA tag sequence. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Issue:
- **Premature Stop Codon**: The provided DNA sequence reveals that after the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA), the next codons are **AAA (Lys) → TGA (Stop)**. This TGA stop codon terminates translation prematurely, preventing the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein. The resulting truncated protein would only include the HA tag followed by a single lysine residue, explaining the lack of detectable overexpression.

### Why This Happened:
1. **Cloning Error**: The HA tag was likely fused to the GADD45G coding sequence in a way that introduced the **TGA stop codon**. This could stem from:
   - **Incorrect Primer Design**: Overlap PCR primers used to link the HA tag to GADD45G might have included unintended nucleotides (e.g., AAA-TGA) during synthesis.
   - **Ligation Artifact**: Improper ligation of the HA tag and GADD45G fragments could have disrupted the reading frame or introduced extraneous bases.
   - **Vector Backbone Issue**: If the HA tag was cloned into a vector with residual sequences (e.g., from restriction sites or multiple cloning regions), these might have added the AAA-TGA codons.

2. **Sequence Verification Oversight**: The error might have gone unnoticed if the cloned construct was not fully sequenced or if the sequencing analysis overlooked the region immediately downstream of the HA tag.

### Solution:
- **Correct the Coding Sequence**: Remove the **AAA-TGA** codons after the HA tag to ensure the GADD45G coding sequence follows seamlessly. The corrected sequence should read:
  ```
  ...GCC (end of HA tag) → [GADD45G coding sequence without AAA-TGA]...
  ```
- **Verify Reading Frame**: Confirm that the HA tag and GADD45G are in the same reading frame using sequencing or in silico translation tools.
- **Optimize Kozak Sequence**: Ensure a strong Kozak sequence (e.g., **CCACCAUGG**) surrounds the start codon to enhance translation initiation efficiency.

### Expected Outcome:
After correcting the premature stop codon and validating the construct, the HA-tagged GADD45G protein should be overexpressed in CHO cells, enabling downstream applications like affinity purification and identification of protein partners during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in the transfected CHO cells. Let's start by going through the process step by step. The researcher created a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G, which includes an HA tag at the N-terminus. They used a plasmid transfected into CHO cells with Lipofectamine, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't expressing well.

First, I should check the plasmid construct design. The HA tag is added to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The construct's plus strand sequence is provided. Maybe there's an issue with the cloning. Let me look at the sequence. The HA tag sequence is usually a short peptide (YPYDVPDYA), which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence TATCCCTATGATGTGCCCGATTACGCC. Let me check if this sequence is present in the provided construct.

Looking at the start of the given sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

The start codon is ATG, which is present. Then the next part is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC. Let's break that down. TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Translating that: TAC is tyrosine (Y), CCA is proline (P), TAC is Y, GAT is aspartic acid (D), GTT is valine (V), CCA is P, GAT is D, TAC is Y, GCC is alanine (A). So the amino acid sequence would be Y P Y D V P D Y A. Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the nucleotide sequence should be TAT CCT TAT GAT GTT CCT GAT TAT GCT or something similar. Let me check the given nucleotides again.

The provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA... So after the ATG (which is the start codon for methionine), the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K)... So the HA tag here is Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. But the HA tag should be YPYDVPDYA. So the amino acids are correct except maybe the last A? Wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. Let's count the codons. The HA tag in the construct starts after the initial ATG. So the first amino acid after Met would be Y (TAC), then P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC). So that's 9 amino acids: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A... So the HA tag is correctly incorporated here. The start codon is ATG for methionine, followed by the HA tag. Wait, but in the construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the recombinant protein should start with the HA tag, which is a peptide tag added to the N-terminus. That would mean the start codon is followed immediately by the HA tag sequence. So the initial ATG is the start, then the HA tag. Wait, but the HA tag is usually added as a tag, not replacing the start codon. Wait, maybe the HA tag is inserted after the start codon. Let me think.

Wait, the HA tag is an epitope tag, so the construct should have the HA tag fused to the N-terminus of GADD45G. So the coding sequence would be: start codon (ATG) followed by the HA tag sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA tag is right after the initial methionine. But in the provided sequence, after ATG, the next codon is TAC (Y), which is the first amino acid of the HA tag. But the HA tag is usually preceded by a methionine? Or is the HA tag part of the mature protein without an additional methionine? Wait, the HA tag is a 9-amino acid peptide (YPYDVPDYA). So the construct's coding sequence should start with ATG (Met), followed by the HA tag codons. But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next codon is TAC (Y). So the recombinant protein would start with Met followed by YPYDVPDYA. But typically, the HA tag is inserted without an additional methionine, but maybe in this case, the start methionine is part of the HA tag? Wait, no. The HA tag is added as an N-terminal tag, so the construct would have the HA tag immediately following the start methionine. Wait, no. Wait, the start methionine is part of the protein. The HA tag is added as a tag, so the construct would have the HA tag's coding sequence right after the start codon. For example, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, so the DNA would be TATCCCTATGATGTGCCCGATTACGCT, but in the given sequence, the start is ATG (Met) followed by TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Translating that gives Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. So the HA tag is present here as Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, which is 9 amino acids. But the HA tag is actually YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. Let me count: Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC). So that's 9 amino acids. So the HA tag is correctly added after the start methionine. So the recombinant protein would be Met followed by the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA), then the rest of GADD45G. But maybe the presence of the methionine before the HA tag is causing an issue? Wait, no. The methionine is the start codon, so the protein starts with Met, then the HA tag. But sometimes tags are added without the initial methionine, but in this case, the start codon is necessary. So that part seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's a problem with the Kozak sequence. The Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotes. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The sequence surrounding the start codon in the construct is ... (looking at the beginning of the provided sequence). The start codon is ATG. Let's look at the nucleotides before and after. The sequence given starts with ATG TAC CCA..., so the nucleotides before ATG would be the upstream sequence in the plasmid. Since the provided sequence starts with ATG, perhaps the Kozak sequence is not optimal. If the Kozak sequence is missing or suboptimal, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low protein expression.

In mammalian expression vectors, the Kozak sequence typically has a purine (A or G) at position -3 relative to the ATG. Let's check the sequence. The construct's coding sequence starts at ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG would be part of the plasmid's promoter or other regulatory elements. Since the user provided only the coding sequence from the ATG onwards, maybe the upstream sequence lacks a proper Kozak consensus, leading to poor translation initiation. For example, if the sequence before ATG is not optimal (like a C instead of A/G at position -3), the ribosome might not recognize the start codon efficiently, resulting in low expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or other elements missing, but since they're using a standard mammalian expression plasmid, the promoter and Kozak sequence should be present. However, if the Kozak sequence is not properly included in the construct, that could be the problem.

Another possibility is that the HA tag introduces a frameshift. Wait, but the user says they introduced the HA tag sequence into the coding sequence. If the insertion was done correctly in-frame, then it should not cause a frameshift. Let's check. The HA tag is inserted at the N-terminus, so right after the start codon. The original GADD45G coding sequence would follow the HA tag. If the HA tag was inserted in-frame, then the rest of the GADD45G should be in the same reading frame. Let's see: after the HA tag sequence, the next part is AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG... Wait, let's translate the HA tag part first.

The HA tag codons are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...

Translating: ATG (Met), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop?), then CTC TGG...

Wait, hold on. After the HA tag, which ends with GCC (A), the next codon is AAA (K), then TGA (which is a stop codon). Wait, that can't be right. Because if after the HA tag (which is 9 amino acids: Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), then the next codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). So the protein would terminate right after the HA tag. That's a problem! The TGA is a stop codon, so the GADD45G coding sequence isn't present; instead, the construct has a stop codon immediately after the HA tag. That would result in a very short protein (just the HA tag plus a few amino acids), which explains why they can't overexpress the full-length protein. The construct is designed such that after the HA tag, there's a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequence:

After the HA tag's last codon (GCC for alanine), the next codon is AAA (lysine), then TGA (stop). So the sequence is:

...GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...

Breaking it down:

GCC (A) - AAA (K) - TGA (Stop) - CTC (L) - TGG (W)...

So the coding sequence has a stop codon right after the HA tag and a lysine. That would terminate translation, preventing the production of the full-length GADD45G protein. Instead, only a short peptide (Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K) would be produced. Therefore, the protein isn't overexpressed because the construct contains a premature stop codon.

But why is there a TGA there? Let's check the original plan. The user wanted to add the HA tag to the N-terminus of GADD45G. So the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence without any intervening stop codons. The presence of TGA (stop codon) suggests that there was a cloning error, perhaps a mistake in the insertion of the HA tag, leading to a frameshift or accidental introduction of a stop codon.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing the subsequent codons to be out of frame and leading to a premature stop. But in this case, the HA tag is in frame, but the stop codon is immediately after. Let me check the nucleotide sequence again.

The HA tag is supposed to be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. However, in the provided construct, after the HA tag's GCC (A), there's AAA (K), then TGA (stop). So the sequence after the HA is AAA TGA..., which is lysine followed by a stop. That's incorrect. The GADD45G coding sequence should start immediately after the HA tag without any stop codon. Therefore, the construct has an erroneously inserted stop codon, which truncates the protein. This would result in no full-length GADD45G expression, hence the failure to overexpress the protein.

The error likely occurred during the genetic engineering of the plasmid. When the HA tag was inserted, perhaps a mistake in the cloning process introduced the TGA stop codon. For example, if the HA tag was ligated in a way that added extra nucleotides, leading to a frame shift or insertion of a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag sequence might have been designed with an error, such as incorrect codon usage leading to a stop codon.

Another possibility is that the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the GADD45G sequence was cloned in the wrong reading frame relative to the HA tag, leading to a frameshift and premature stop. However, looking at the sequence, the HA tag is followed by AAA TGA. If the GADD45G was supposed to be in frame, then AAA (K) and then the rest of GADD45G. But if the GADD45G sequence was cloned out of frame, then after the HA tag (which is in frame), the insertion could lead to a different reading frame, introducing a stop codon. But in this case, the HA tag is 9 amino acids (27 nucleotides), so if the GADD45G was inserted in frame, the 27 nucleotides would be part of the HA tag, and the next codon should be the start of GADD45G. However, the presence of TGA right after suggests that either the HA tag was incorrectly designed with an extra nucleotide, or the GADD45G sequence was ligated in a way that introduced a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was synthesized with an error. Let's check the HA tag's DNA sequence. The standard HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which translates to TAT CCT TAT GAT GTT CCT GAT TAT GCT. Let's compare with the provided sequence:

Provided HA part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA...

Wait, the HA tag in the construct is:

TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCC (A)

So the nucleotide sequence for the HA tag in the construct is TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC. Comparing to the standard HA tag DNA sequence, which should be TATCCCTATGATGTGCCCGATTACGCT (but codons can vary). However, the provided HA sequence uses different codons for some amino acids. For example, the first Y is TAC instead of TAT, which is fine (both code for Y). The P is CCA (proline), which is correct. The D is GAT, which is correct. The V is GTT, which is correct. The next P is CCA again. The D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCC. So the HA tag's DNA sequence is slightly different in codon usage but results in the same amino acids. So that's okay; synonymous codons are used. However, after the HA tag (GCC for A), the next codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). So the issue is that after the HA tag, there's a lysine and a stop codon, which should not be there. The GADD45G coding sequence should follow immediately after the HA tag's last codon (GCC) without any stop.

Therefore, the error is the presence of AAA TGA (Lys-Stop) after the HA tag. This is likely due to a cloning mistake where a fragment was inserted that includes these codons, or a PCR error introduced them. For example, if the HA tag was amplified with a primer that added extra nucleotides, or if there was a ligation error between the HA tag and the GADD45G sequence, leading to the insertion of these codons and the premature stop.

In summary, the construct contains a premature stop codon right after the HA tag, which truncates the protein and prevents the overexpression of the full-length GADD45G. The researcher probably made a mistake during the cloning process, such as incorrect ligation or primer design, leading to the insertion of the TGA stop codon.

I need to analyze why the GADD45G protein isn't showing expected overexpression in the transfected CHO cells. The researcher developed a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G, which contains an HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected CHO cells with a plasmid using Lipofectamine, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but found poor protein expression.

I should first examine the plasmid construct design. The HA tag was added to GADD45G's N-terminus. I have the construct's plus strand sequence, so I should verify if there might be cloning issues. The HA tag is a short peptide (YPYDVPDYA) corresponding to the nucleotide sequence TATCCCTATGATGTGCCCGATTACGCC, and I need to confirm its presence in the provided construct.

Examining the sequence beginning: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

The standard HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA. When I compare, the encoded amino acid sequence in the construct matches this. After the initial ATG (methionine), I count 9 codons that translate to the HA tag sequence. So the construct correctly incorporates the HA tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, with the start codon followed immediately by the HA tag sequence.

I need to determine why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as predicted in the transfected CHO cells. Let's examine the procedure carefully. The researcher developed a transgenic mouse model with inducible GADD45G overexpression, which includes an HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected CHO cells using a plasmid with Lipofectamine, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't expressing well.

First, I'll review the plasmid construct design. The HA tag is linked to GADD45G's N-terminus, and the plus strand sequence of the construct is provided. There might be an issue with cloning. I need to examine the sequence. Typically, the HA tag is the short peptide (YPYDVPDYA), corresponding to the nucleotide sequence TATCCCTATGATGTGCCCGATTACGCC. I'll verify if this sequence is included in the construct.

Checking the start of the sequence given: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

The start codon, ATG, is present. Then the sequence continues: TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC. Breaking it down: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC translates to: TAC is tyrosine (Y), CCA is proline (P), TAC is Y, GAT is aspartic acid (D), GTT is valine (V), CCA is P, GAT is D, TAC is Y, GCC is alanine (A). The resulting amino acid sequence is Y P Y D V P D Y A. The HA tag should be YPYDVPDYA, so the nucleotide sequence needs to be TAT CCT TAT GAT GTT CCT GAT TAT GCT or similar. I'll recheck the nucleotides.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA... Following the ATG (methionine), the codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K)... The HA tag here is Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, matching the intended tag, except perhaps the last A. However, the HA tag is indeed 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. Counting the codons, the HA tag in the construct follows the initial ATG. Starting with Met, the sequence is Y (TAC), then P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC). This totals 9 amino acids: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. The HA tag is accurately placed here. The HA tag should be at the N-terminus, added as a tag without substituting the start codon. The initial ATG marks the start, followed by the HA tag. It seems the HA tag is indeed fused to the N-terminus of GADD45G, with the coding sequence as follows: start codon (ATG) followed by the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence. Thus, the HA tag accompanies the initial methionine at the sequence's start. However, the construct must show the HA tag connected to the N-terminus of GADD45G.

Correcting the construct to eliminate this stop codon will restore proper expression.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=" the given sequence, after ATG, the next codon is TAC (Y), which is correct for the HA tag. Then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So that seems correct for the HA tag. So that part seems okay.\n\nBut maybe there's a problem with the Kozak sequence? The Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The start codon is ATG. Let's check the nucleotides around the start codon. The sequence before ATG: ... (the construct starts with ATG, so maybe there's no Kozak sequence?) Wait, the construct's plus strand starts with ATG, so the mRNA would start with AUG. But in eukaryotic expression vectors, there's usually a Kozak sequence before the start codon to enhance translation. If the Kozak sequence is missing or suboptimal, the translation initiation might be inefficient, leading to low protein expression.\n\nLooking at the sequence: The start codon is at the very beginning of the provided sequence. So the context is ATG TAC CCA... So the nucleotides before ATG would depend on the vector. If the vector doesn't include a proper Kozak sequence (like a GCCGCCACC before the ATG), then the initiation might be poor. But in the provided sequence, the start is ATG followed immediately by the HA tag. If the vector doesn't have a Kozak sequence, that could be the problem. However, the user mentioned that they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells. If the plasmid was designed for mammalian expression, it should include a Kozak sequence. But maybe they forgot to include it, leading to inefficient translation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the open reading frame. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the start codon. Let's see: ATG (M) followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc. So the HA tag is in frame. Then after the HA tag, the sequence continues into the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, but the user says the construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G sequence. Let's check if the HA tag is correctly fused without any frameshift.\n\nAfter the HA tag codons (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), the next codon is AAA, which is lysine (K). Let's see if that's part of the native GADD45G sequence. The native GADD45G protein starts with a methionine, but here it's replaced by the HA tag. Wait, but the HA tag is added as a fusion, so the original start codon of GADD45G would be removed, and the HA tag is added right after the new ATG. So the HA tag should be followed by the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence, excluding its original start codon. If the cloning was done correctly, the HA tag should be in frame with the GADD45G sequence. Let's check.\n\nAfter the HA tag sequence in the provided DNA, the codons after the HA tag (which ends with GCC, alanine) are AAA (Lys), TGA (stop codon?), wait, no: AAA is lysine, then TGA is a stop codon. Wait, hold on. Let me translate the given DNA sequence from the start.\n\nStart: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG...\n\nTranslating:\n\nATG - M\n\nTAC - Y\n\nCCA - P\n\nTAC - Y\n\nGAT - D\n\nGTT - V\n\nCCA - P\n\nGAT - D\n\nTAC - Y\n\nGCC - A\n\nAAA - K\n\nTGA - Stop\n\nWait, that's a problem! After the HA tag, there's a TGA stop codon. The HA tag in the construct is followed by a stop codon, which would terminate translation prematurely. That's a major issue. The HA tag is only 9 amino acids, and then the next codon is AAA (Lys), but wait, the DNA sequence after the HA tag is AAA TGA CTC TGG...\n\nWait, let me check the actual nucleotides. The HA tag ends with GCC (alanine), then the next codon is AAA (lysine), then TGA (stop codon). Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-examine the sequence:\n\nThe provided DNA sequence starts with:\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nStart codon ATG, then:\n\nTAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...\n\nSo after the HA tag (up to GCC), the next three nucleotides are AAA (position ...GCC AAA TGA...). So after the HA tag's GCC (alanine), the next codon is AAA (lysine), then TGA (stop codon). That's a problem. The TGA would terminate translation after lysine. So the recombinant protein would be M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-Stop. So only 10 amino acids, which is way too short. That's why the protein isn't expressed; the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. The intended construct should have the HA tag followed by the full-length GADD45G, but here, immediately after the HA tag, there's a stop codon, so the protein is truncated and not expressed properly.\n\nBut why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the original GADD45G sequence. The native GADD45G coding sequence, after its start codon, should not have a stop codon early on. The error must have occurred during the cloning. The researcher probably inserted the HA tag in such a way that introduced a frameshift or accidentally included a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the primer design when adding the HA tag, leading to an insertion of a stop codon.\n\nLooking at the sequence: After the HA tag (GCC), the next codon is AAA (Lys), then TGA (stop). But in the correct construct, after the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence should continue. The TGA here is likely an error. Let's check the nucleotide sequence again. The HA tag ends with GCC (which is alanine, the last residue of the HA tag). Then the next nucleotides are AAA TGA CTC TGG... So AAA is lysine, TGA is stop, then CTC is leucine (if in frame). But since TGA is a stop codon, translation stops there. The presence of TGA suggests that either the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift, leading to an early stop, or there was a mutation introduced during cloning.\n\nWait, maybe the HA tag was inserted in a different reading frame. Let's check. The HA tag is supposed to be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the reading frame should continue into GADD45G. But here, after the HA tag, the next codon is AAA, which is in the same frame. However, the TGA follows. If the original GADD45G sequence at that position doesn't have a stop codon, then the TGA was introduced by the cloning. How?\n\nLooking at the HA tag's last codon (GCC) and the following sequence: GCC AAA TGA. The GCC is part of the HA tag (alanine). The next codon AAA is lysine, then TGA. If the original GADD45G sequence after the HA tag was supposed to have a lysine followed by another amino acid, but instead there's a stop codon, that's an error. For example, maybe the original codon after the HA tag was supposed to be AAA (Lys) followed by something else, but a mutation during cloning changed the next codon to TGA. Alternatively, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation caused a frameshift. Let's check the possible reading frames.\n\nSuppose the HA tag was inserted without a frameshift. The HA tag is 9 codons (including the initial methionine?), wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids starting after the methionine. Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. So the construct should be ATG (M) followed by the HA tag (9 aa), then the rest of GADD45G. So the total from the start would be 1 (M) + 9 (HA) = 10 amino acids before the native GADD45G sequence starts. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (which ends at GCC for alanine), the next codon is AAA (Lys), then TGA (stop). So maybe the original GADD45G sequence starts with a lysine, but here, due to a cloning error, the next codon is a stop. Alternatively, maybe the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift. Let's check the nucleotide sequence.\n\nThe HA tag in the construct is:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...\n\nWhich translates to M Y P Y D V P D Y A K Stop...\n\nThe HA tag is Y P Y D V P D Y A, which is 9 amino acids. The K (AAA) and Stop (TGA) are after. So the problem is that after the HA tag, there's a lysine and then a stop codon. That suggests that either the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, causing the following codons to be out of frame and leading to a premature stop, or there's an error in the inserted HA tag sequence that introduced a stop codon.\n\nWait, but the HA tag itself is in frame. Let me check the HA tag's nucleotide sequence. The HA tag is usually encoded by the sequence TAC CCT TAC GAT GTC CCG GAC TAC GCC, which translates to Y P Y D V P D Y A. The provided sequence for the HA tag is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Let's compare:\n\nStandard HA codons (optimized maybe?):\n\nY: TAC or TAT\n\nP: CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT\n\nD: GAT or GAC\n\nV: GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG\n\nSo the provided HA codons are:\n\nY (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC).\n\nThat's correct for the HA tag. So the HA tag is correctly inserted. Then the next codon is AAA (K), which might be the start of the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the construct, it's followed by TGA (stop). In the native GADD45G gene, after the start codon (which is replaced by the HA tag here), the next codons should not have a stop. Therefore, the TGA must have been introduced during cloning. How?\n\nPossibly, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation of the HA tag fragment with the GADD45G fragment was done incorrectly, leading to a frame shift or a point mutation. Alternatively, a primer used to amplify the HA tag or GADD45G might have had a mutation introducing the TGA. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing the subsequent codons to be out of frame, leading to a stop codon shortly after.\n\nWait, if the HA tag was inserted in frame, then the following sequence should be in frame. Let's check the original GADD45G coding sequence. Suppose the native GADD45G starts with ATG (M), then the next codons. If the researcher replaced the native ATG with the HA tag, keeping the rest of the sequence in frame, then after the HA tag, the sequence should continue in the same reading frame as the native GADD45G. However, in the provided construct, after the HA tag (which is 9 codons, 27 nucleotides), the next codon is AAA (Lys), which would correspond to the 10th codon. But in the provided sequence, the 10th codon is AAA followed by TGA. If the native GADD45G at that position does not have a stop codon, then the TGA is an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted such that it added an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift. Let's check the length of the HA tag insertion. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 bp). If the insertion was done correctly without adding or deleting nucleotides, the reading frame should remain correct. But if there was an error in the insertion (e.g., inserting 26 or 28 nucleotides), that would cause a frameshift. Let's check the length of the HA tag in the provided sequence.\n\nFrom the start codon ATG, the HA tag goes up to GCC (the 9th codon):\n\n1. ATG (M)\n2. TAC (Y)\n3. CCA (P)\n4. TAC (Y)\n5. GAT (D)\n6. GTT (V)\n7. CCA (P)\n8. GAT (D)\n9. TAC (Y)\n10. GCC (A)\n\nWait, that's 10 codons. Wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA), but here, the start is M followed by YPYDVPDYA. So total 10 amino acids (including the initial M). Wait, no—the HA tag is added as a tag, so the start codon is M, then the HA tag. So M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. That's 9 amino acids after the M. Wait, no: the HA tag is 9 aa without the initial M. Wait, the user said the HA tag is at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the recombinant protein should be HA-GADD45G. Therefore, the start codon is followed by the HA tag, then GADD45G. So the HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag should be 9 aa, then the GADD45G sequence follows. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (positions 1-9: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), the 10th codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). If the native GADD45G sequence after its original start codon (which has been replaced by the HA tag) doesn't have a stop codon at that position, then the TGA is an error.\n\nSo the mistake here is that the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag, which truncates the protein, making it too short and likely not functional, hence no overexpression detected. The researcher probably made a cloning error where a TGA was introduced, possibly due to a mutation during PCR or incorrect ligation. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift that introduced a stop codon early on.\n\nAnother angle: The HA tag sequence is followed by a splice site or other regulatory element that causes truncation. But more likely, the presence of the TGA stop codon right after the HA tag is the issue. The researcher needs to check the construct's sequence to ensure that the HA tag is correctly fused in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence without introducing any premature stop codons.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387169, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3982, prompt_tokens=1554, total_tokens=5536, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic mouse model stems from a **premature stop codon** introduced immediately after the HA tag in the construct. Here's the breakdown:

1. **HA Tag Integration**:  
   The HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was correctly inserted at the N-terminus of GADD45G. The nucleotide sequence for the HA tag aligns with the expected codons (e.g., `TAC` for Y, `CCA` for P, etc.), and it is in-frame with the start codon (ATG).

2. **Premature Stop Codon**:  
   Directly following the HA tag, the sequence includes `AAA TGA`:
   - `AAA` encodes lysine (K), which might be part of the native GADD45G sequence.  
   - **`TGA` is a stop codon**, which terminates translation prematurely. This results in a truncated protein of only 10 amino acids (M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K), preventing the full-length GADD45G from being expressed.

3. **Root Cause**:  
   The premature TGA stop codon likely arose from a **cloning error**, such as:
   - A frameshift during HA tag insertion, altering the reading frame and introducing a stop codon.  
   - Accidental incorporation of the TGA triplet during primer design or PCR amplification.  
   - Incorrect ligation of the HA tag fragment to the GADD45G sequence, disrupting the open reading frame.

4. **Solution**:  
   To resolve this, the construct must be redesigned to **remove the TGA stop codon** and ensure the HA tag is seamlessly fused in-frame with the full-length GADD45G coding sequence. This involves:
   - Verifying the nucleotide sequence of the HA-GADD45G junction.  
   - Using sequencing or restriction digest to confirm the absence of unintended mutations.  
   - Ensuring proper Kozak sequence (if missing) to enhance translation initiation.

**Conclusion**: The premature stop codon after the HA tag halts translation, preventing overexpression of the recombinant GADD45G protein. Correcting the construct to eliminate this stop codon will restore proper expression.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

the given sequence, after ATG, the next codon is TAC (Y), which is correct for the HA tag. Then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So that seems correct for the HA tag. So that part seems okay.

But maybe there's a problem with the Kozak sequence? The Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The start codon is ATG. Let's check the nucleotides around the start codon. The sequence before ATG: ... (the construct starts with ATG, so maybe there's no Kozak sequence?) Wait, the construct's plus strand starts with ATG, so the mRNA would start with AUG. But in eukaryotic expression vectors, there's usually a Kozak sequence before the start codon to enhance translation. If the Kozak sequence is missing or suboptimal, the translation initiation might be inefficient, leading to low protein expression.

Looking at the sequence: The start codon is at the very beginning of the provided sequence. So the context is ATG TAC CCA... So the nucleotides before ATG would depend on the vector. If the vector doesn't include a proper Kozak sequence (like a GCCGCCACC before the ATG), then the initiation might be poor. But in the provided sequence, the start is ATG followed immediately by the HA tag. If the vector doesn't have a Kozak sequence, that could be the problem. However, the user mentioned that they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells. If the plasmid was designed for mammalian expression, it should include a Kozak sequence. But maybe they forgot to include it, leading to inefficient translation.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the open reading frame. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the start codon. Let's see: ATG (M) followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc. So the HA tag is in frame. Then after the HA tag, the sequence continues into the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, but the user says the construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G sequence. Let's check if the HA tag is correctly fused without any frameshift.

After the HA tag codons (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), the next codon is AAA, which is lysine (K). Let's see if that's part of the native GADD45G sequence. The native GADD45G protein starts with a methionine, but here it's replaced by the HA tag. Wait, but the HA tag is added as a fusion, so the original start codon of GADD45G would be removed, and the HA tag is added right after the new ATG. So the HA tag should be followed by the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence, excluding its original start codon. If the cloning was done correctly, the HA tag should be in frame with the GADD45G sequence. Let's check.

After the HA tag sequence in the provided DNA, the codons after the HA tag (which ends with GCC, alanine) are AAA (Lys), TGA (stop codon?), wait, no: AAA is lysine, then TGA is a stop codon. Wait, hold on. Let me translate the given DNA sequence from the start.

Start: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG...

Translating:

ATG - M

TAC - Y

CCA - P

TAC - Y

GAT - D

GTT - V

CCA - P

GAT - D

TAC - Y

GCC - A

AAA - K

TGA - Stop

Wait, that's a problem! After the HA tag, there's a TGA stop codon. The HA tag in the construct is followed by a stop codon, which would terminate translation prematurely. That's a major issue. The HA tag is only 9 amino acids, and then the next codon is AAA (Lys), but wait, the DNA sequence after the HA tag is AAA TGA CTC TGG...

Wait, let me check the actual nucleotides. The HA tag ends with GCC (alanine), then the next codon is AAA (lysine), then TGA (stop codon). Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-examine the sequence:

The provided DNA sequence starts with:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Breaking it down:

Start codon ATG, then:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...

So after the HA tag (up to GCC), the next three nucleotides are AAA (position ...GCC AAA TGA...). So after the HA tag's GCC (alanine), the next codon is AAA (lysine), then TGA (stop codon). That's a problem. The TGA would terminate translation after lysine. So the recombinant protein would be M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-Stop. So only 10 amino acids, which is way too short. That's why the protein isn't expressed; the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. The intended construct should have the HA tag followed by the full-length GADD45G, but here, immediately after the HA tag, there's a stop codon, so the protein is truncated and not expressed properly.

But why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the original GADD45G sequence. The native GADD45G coding sequence, after its start codon, should not have a stop codon early on. The error must have occurred during the cloning. The researcher probably inserted the HA tag in such a way that introduced a frameshift or accidentally included a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the primer design when adding the HA tag, leading to an insertion of a stop codon.

Looking at the sequence: After the HA tag (GCC), the next codon is AAA (Lys), then TGA (stop). But in the correct construct, after the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence should continue. The TGA here is likely an error. Let's check the nucleotide sequence again. The HA tag ends with GCC (which is alanine, the last residue of the HA tag). Then the next nucleotides are AAA TGA CTC TGG... So AAA is lysine, TGA is stop, then CTC is leucine (if in frame). But since TGA is a stop codon, translation stops there. The presence of TGA suggests that either the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift, leading to an early stop, or there was a mutation introduced during cloning.

Wait, maybe the HA tag was inserted in a different reading frame. Let's check. The HA tag is supposed to be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the reading frame should continue into GADD45G. But here, after the HA tag, the next codon is AAA, which is in the same frame. However, the TGA follows. If the original GADD45G sequence at that position doesn't have a stop codon, then the TGA was introduced by the cloning. How?

Looking at the HA tag's last codon (GCC) and the following sequence: GCC AAA TGA. The GCC is part of the HA tag (alanine). The next codon AAA is lysine, then TGA. If the original GADD45G sequence after the HA tag was supposed to have a lysine followed by another amino acid, but instead there's a stop codon, that's an error. For example, maybe the original codon after the HA tag was supposed to be AAA (Lys) followed by something else, but a mutation during cloning changed the next codon to TGA. Alternatively, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation caused a frameshift. Let's check the possible reading frames.

Suppose the HA tag was inserted without a frameshift. The HA tag is 9 codons (including the initial methionine?), wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids starting after the methionine. Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. So the construct should be ATG (M) followed by the HA tag (9 aa), then the rest of GADD45G. So the total from the start would be 1 (M) + 9 (HA) = 10 amino acids before the native GADD45G sequence starts. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (which ends at GCC for alanine), the next codon is AAA (Lys), then TGA (stop). So maybe the original GADD45G sequence starts with a lysine, but here, due to a cloning error, the next codon is a stop. Alternatively, maybe the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift. Let's check the nucleotide sequence.

The HA tag in the construct is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Which translates to M Y P Y D V P D Y A K Stop...

The HA tag is Y P Y D V P D Y A, which is 9 amino acids. The K (AAA) and Stop (TGA) are after. So the problem is that after the HA tag, there's a lysine and then a stop codon. That suggests that either the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, causing the following codons to be out of frame and leading to a premature stop, or there's an error in the inserted HA tag sequence that introduced a stop codon.

Wait, but the HA tag itself is in frame. Let me check the HA tag's nucleotide sequence. The HA tag is usually encoded by the sequence TAC CCT TAC GAT GTC CCG GAC TAC GCC, which translates to Y P Y D V P D Y A. The provided sequence for the HA tag is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Let's compare:

Standard HA codons (optimized maybe?):

Y: TAC or TAT

P: CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT

D: GAT or GAC

V: GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG

So the provided HA codons are:

Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC).

That's correct for the HA tag. So the HA tag is correctly inserted. Then the next codon is AAA (K), which might be the start of the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the construct, it's followed by TGA (stop). In the native GADD45G gene, after the start codon (which is replaced by the HA tag here), the next codons should not have a stop. Therefore, the TGA must have been introduced during cloning. How?

Possibly, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation of the HA tag fragment with the GADD45G fragment was done incorrectly, leading to a frame shift or a point mutation. Alternatively, a primer used to amplify the HA tag or GADD45G might have had a mutation introducing the TGA. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing the subsequent codons to be out of frame, leading to a stop codon shortly after.

Wait, if the HA tag was inserted in frame, then the following sequence should be in frame. Let's check the original GADD45G coding sequence. Suppose the native GADD45G starts with ATG (M), then the next codons. If the researcher replaced the native ATG with the HA tag, keeping the rest of the sequence in frame, then after the HA tag, the sequence should continue in the same reading frame as the native GADD45G. However, in the provided construct, after the HA tag (which is 9 codons, 27 nucleotides), the next codon is AAA (Lys), which would correspond to the 10th codon. But in the provided sequence, the 10th codon is AAA followed by TGA. If the native GADD45G at that position does not have a stop codon, then the TGA is an error.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted such that it added an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift. Let's check the length of the HA tag insertion. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 bp). If the insertion was done correctly without adding or deleting nucleotides, the reading frame should remain correct. But if there was an error in the insertion (e.g., inserting 26 or 28 nucleotides), that would cause a frameshift. Let's check the length of the HA tag in the provided sequence.

From the start codon ATG, the HA tag goes up to GCC (the 9th codon):

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (V)
7. CCA (P)
8. GAT (D)
9. TAC (Y)
10. GCC (A)

Wait, that's 10 codons. Wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA), but here, the start is M followed by YPYDVPDYA. So total 10 amino acids (including the initial M). Wait, no—the HA tag is added as a tag, so the start codon is M, then the HA tag. So M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. That's 9 amino acids after the M. Wait, no: the HA tag is 9 aa without the initial M. Wait, the user said the HA tag is at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the recombinant protein should be HA-GADD45G. Therefore, the start codon is followed by the HA tag, then GADD45G. So the HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag should be 9 aa, then the GADD45G sequence follows. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (positions 1-9: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), the 10th codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). If the native GADD45G sequence after its original start codon (which has been replaced by the HA tag) doesn't have a stop codon at that position, then the TGA is an error.

So the mistake here is that the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag, which truncates the protein, making it too short and likely not functional, hence no overexpression detected. The researcher probably made a cloning error where a TGA was introduced, possibly due to a mutation during PCR or incorrect ligation. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift that introduced a stop codon early on.

Another angle: The HA tag sequence is followed by a splice site or other regulatory element that causes truncation. But more likely, the presence of the TGA stop codon right after the HA tag is the issue. The researcher needs to check the construct's sequence to ensure that the HA tag is correctly fused in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence without introducing any premature stop codons.

Mammalian expression vectors require a Kozak consensus sequence (CCACCAUGG) around the start codon to ensure efficient initiation of translation. The start codon here is ATG. Looking at the sequence before and after:\n\nThe start codon is ATG. The preceding nucleotides are ... (the construct starts with ATG, so there\'s nothing before). The nucleotides after ATG are TAC. So the sequence is ATG TAC... which is Met-Tyr (the first amino acid after Met would be Tyr). Wait, but the HA tag starts with Tyr (YPYDVPDYA). However, the start codon is ATG (Met), followed by TAC (Tyr). That would mean the recombinant protein starts with Met-Tyr, but the HA tag is supposed to start with Tyr. However, in the construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be a tag added to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct\'s coding sequence should start with the HA tag, which starts with Tyr (TAC). However, the start codon (ATG) is followed by TAC (Tyr), so the protein would start with Met-Tyr. But the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which starts with Tyr. So the presence of the initial Met is correct (since all proteins start with Met), but then the HA tag follows. However, sometimes tags are added after the initial Met, which is usually cleaved if a signal peptide is present, but in this case, maybe the Met is retained. But maybe the presence of the Met is interfering? Or perhaps the Kozak sequence is not optimal.\n\nWait, the Kozak sequence in mammals is typically a nucleotide sequence surrounding the start codon that enhances translation initiation. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG (if any) and after. In this construct, the ATG is the very first nucleotides. So the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC... So the start codon is at the beginning. There is no Kozak sequence here. The absence of a Kozak sequence could lead to inefficient translation initiation, resulting in low protein expression. That\'s a possible reason.\n\nAlternatively, the construct might not have a promoter or other regulatory elements. But the user mentioned that they created a plasmid for inducible overexpression, so the construct should have a promoter (like CMV or another inducible promoter), but maybe the promoter is not functional in CHO cells. However, they transfected CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, implying that the plasmid has a mammalian selection marker (like neomycin resistance), so the promoter for the selection marker is working. But the GADD45G construct\'s promoter might not be active in CHO cells. However, if the construct is under an inducible promoter (e.g., tetracycline-inducible), they might not have induced it properly. But the problem states that they tested the expression level and couldn\'t overexpress the protein as expected. If the promoter is inducible, perhaps they didn\'t include the inducing agent. But the user says they "select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct." Maybe they tested under non-induced conditions. But the problem states that the user realized the sequence is the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the construct is designed with the HA tag but in the wrong reading frame. Wait, the HA tag is correctly inserted. Let\'s check. The start codon is ATG (Met), then the next codon is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. So the HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA. The HA tag in the construct starts after the Met. So the recombinant protein would be Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A... which adds an extra Met at the N-terminus. However, sometimes the start Met is cleaved off, but that depends on the sequence. If the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus without the Met, then the presence of the Met might interfere. But usually, the HA tag is added as a tag, so the Met would be part of the recombinant protein. However, some vectors are designed to have a Kozak sequence and the start codon followed by the tag. If the Kozak sequence is missing, translation initiation would be inefficient.\n\nAnother possibility is that the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the open reading frame of GADD45G. Wait, the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. The original GADD45G coding sequence would start with its own ATG. By inserting the HA tag at the N-terminus, the start codon would be the same as the original, but with HA tag codons added before the original GADD45G sequence. Wait, but in the provided sequence, the HA tag is at the very beginning after the ATG. Let me check the sequence.\n\nThe provided sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ... So after the start codon, the HA tag is encoded as TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC, which translates to Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. Then comes AAA (Lys), TGA CTC TGG ... Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA. The sequence here gives Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, which is correct. Then the next amino acid is Lys (AAA), which would be part of the GADD45G sequence. But perhaps the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift in the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, no. If the HA tag was inserted in-frame with the original GADD45G coding sequence, then the rest should be in frame. Let me check. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 nucleotides). The original GADD45G coding sequence would start at nucleotide position 28 (after the HA tag). Let\'s see: the HA tag ends with GCC (A) at position 27. The next codon is AAA (position 28-30), which is Lys. If the original GADD45G starts with AAA, then the insertion of the HA tag in-frame would not cause a frameshift. However, if the original GADD45G coding sequence was cloned without maintaining the reading frame after the HA tag, then there would be a frameshift. But the user says they modified the gene\'s coding sequence by introducing the HA tag at the N-terminus, so they should have cloned the HA tag in frame with the GADD45G sequence. But maybe during cloning, a frameshift occurred. Let me check the entire sequence.\n\nWait, the user provided the plus strand sequence. Let\'s check if the HA tag is correctly inserted and the rest of the sequence is in frame. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 nucleotides). Starting from ATG (position 1-3), then positions 4-6: TAC (Y), 7-9: CCA (P), 10-12: TAC (Y), 13-15: GAT (D), 16-18: GTT (V), 19-21: CCA (P), 22-24: GAT (D), 25-27: TAC (Y), 28-30: GCC (A). Then position 31-33: AAA (K). If the original GADD45G starts with K (AAA), then the insertion is in frame. However, if the original GADD45G starts with a different amino acid, then there\'s a problem. Let\'s check the actual GADD45G protein sequence. \n\nLooking up the mouse GADD45G protein (UniProt ID Q9Z111), the N-terminal sequence starts with: MSGPRHRFPSR... So the first amino acids are Met-Ser-Gly-Pro-Arg-His-Arg-Phe-Pro-Ser-Arg... Wait, the original GADD45G starts with Met followed by Ser (codon TCA, TCC, etc.). But in the construct, after the HA tag (positions 28-30: GCC (A)), the next codon is AAA (Lys). So the original GADD45G sequence here starts with Lys, which does not match the known N-terminal sequence. This suggests that inserting the HA tag caused a frameshift, altering the amino acid sequence of GADD45G beyond the HA tag. Therefore, the HA tag insertion might have disrupted the reading frame of the GADD45G coding sequence, leading to a frameshift mutation and a truncated or nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, the cloning process may have introduced errors, such as incorrect ligation leading to a shifted reading frame.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted without a proper linker, causing the rest of the sequence to be out of frame. For example, if the HA tag was inserted as a 9-codon sequence (27 bp), which is divisible by 3, then the reading frame should be maintained. However, if the HA tag was inserted with additional nucleotides (not a multiple of 3), it would cause a frameshift. In the given sequence, the HA tag is 27 nucleotides (9 codons), so that\'s correct. Therefore, the insertion of HA tag in frame should not cause a frameshift. But the following codon is AAA (Lys), which does not correspond to the original GADD45G N-terminus. Therefore, perhaps the HA tag was inserted, but the original GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated in frame. Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the original GADD45G coding sequence should follow immediately after the HA tag in the same reading frame. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the original GADD45G sequence should start at the same frame. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys), but the original GADD45G starts with Met followed by Ser. So unless the original GADD45G\'s coding sequence was modified to start with Lys after the HA tag, this suggests that the cloning process may have introduced a frameshift or the GADD45G sequence was not properly cloned. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion was done in such a way that the original start codon of GADD45G is still present, leading to two start codons. Wait, the original GADD45G has its own ATG start codon. If the HA tag was inserted before the original ATG, but in the same frame, then the original ATG would now be out of frame. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided construct, the HA tag is inserted right after the start codon (ATG). So the construct starts with ATG (Met), followed by the HA tag (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), then the rest of the GADD45G sequence. But if the original GADD45G starts with Met, then inserting an HA tag after the initial ATG would mean that the original GADD45G\'s coding sequence is now shifted. However, the user intended to overexpress the GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus, so the correct approach is to fuse the HA tag in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence, replacing the original start codon. That is, the original GADD45G\'s ATG is removed, and the HA tag is added before the rest of the coding sequence. However, if the original ATG is retained, then the HA tag would be in a different reading frame. Wait, no. Let me think. The HA tag should be added in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. So the original GADD45G\'s start codon (ATG) is replaced by the HA tag sequence, followed by the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence (without the original ATG). If the HA tag is inserted correctly, then the HA tag codons are added at the beginning, followed by the original GADD45G coding sequence (minus the start codon), ensuring the same reading frame. If the original GADD45G coding sequence was cloned without removing its own ATG, then after the HA tag, the original ATG would be present as a methionine codon in the same frame, leading to an internal Met, but that might not be an issue. However, in the provided construct, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys), which is part of the original GADD45G sequence. But according to the actual GADD45G protein, the first amino acid after Met is Ser (codon TCT, TCC, etc.), which would correspond to TCN codons. However, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag, we have GCC (Ala) at position 28-30 (after the HA tag ends at 27), then AAA (Lys). So the first amino acid after the HA tag is Ala (GCC), then Lys (AAA). This does not match the original GADD45G sequence, which starts with Met followed by Ser. Therefore, this suggests that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the original GADD45G coding sequence is not in frame. Therefore, the construct has a frameshift after the HA tag, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence beyond the HA tag, resulting in a truncated or nonfunctional protein. This would explain the lack of overexpression, as the protein is not properly translated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the Kozak sequence is missing, leading to poor translation initiation. The construct starts with ATG, but there\'s no Kozak sequence (which is typically a CCACC before the ATG). Without a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome may not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low protein expression. Let\'s check the nucleotides before the ATG. The construct starts with ATG, so there are no nucleotides before it. The Kozak sequence in mammals is usually something like \'CCACCAUGG\', where the ATG is surrounded by certain nucleotides. The absence of this sequence could result in inefficient translation. Therefore, the construct may lack a Kozak sequence, leading to poor expression.\n\nAnother possibility is that the plasmid doesn\'t have a suitable promoter for expression in CHO cells. If the promoter is not active in CHO cells (e.g., using a mouse-specific promoter), then the gene won\'t be transcribed. However, the user mentioned that they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, which implies that the plasmid has a functional promoter for the antibiotic resistance gene (like neomycin resistance under a constitutive promoter like SV40). However, the GADD45G construct might be under an inducible promoter (like Tet-On), and if the cells weren\'t induced, the construct wouldn\'t be expressed. But the user tested expression levels, so they might have induced it. However, the problem states that they realized the issue was in the sequence, so it\'s more likely a cloning error.\n\nAnother possibility is that the HA tag contains internal methionine codons that cause premature initiation. However, the HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) doesn\'t have any methionines. The codons for the HA tag are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A). No ATG codons here, so that\'s not the issue.\n\nAnother issue could be mRNA instability due to sequences in the construct, but that\'s less likely.\n\nPutting it all together, the two main possibilities are:\n\n1. The construct lacks a Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation.\n\n2. The HA tag was inserted in a way that causes a frameshift in the GADD45G coding sequence, resulting in a truncated or misfolded protein that isn\'t expressed properly.\n\nLooking at the construct\'s sequence again: After the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is GCC (Ala) at positions 28-30. If the original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG (Met), then inserting 27 nucleotides (9 codons) would shift the original sequence by 0 nucleotides (since 27 is divisible by 3). Therefore, the original GADD45G coding sequence should start at position 28. But the original GADD45G starts with ATG followed by TCT (Ser), etc. However, in the provided construct, position 28-30 is GCC (Ala), which doesn\'t match the original GADD45G\'s second codon (which should be TCT for Ser). Therefore, this indicates that the HA tag was either inserted incorrectly, leading to a frameshift, or the original GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated after the HA tag. For example, if the HA tag was inserted in frame but the subsequent GADD45G sequence is not in frame, perhaps due to a cloning error (e.g., using the wrong restriction sites that caused a shift in the reading frame). Alternatively, during the cloning process, some nucleotides were added or deleted, disrupting the frame.\n\nWait, let\'s compare the expected HA-GADD45G fusion. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 bp). The original GADD45G starts with ATG followed by TCT (Ser). So after inserting the HA tag in frame, the original ATG (start codon) of GADD45G would be replaced by the HA tag. Therefore, the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence starting from the second codon (TCT). Let\'s check the construct\'s sequence after the HA tag. The HA tag ends with GCC (A) at positions 25-27. Then positions 28-30: AAA (Lys). Then positions 31-33: TGA (stop codon?), but TGA is a stop codon. Wait, that\'s a problem! Wait, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the sequence continues:\n\n28-30: AAA (Lys)\n\n31-33: TGA (stop codon)\n\nWait, if positions 31-33 are TGA, that\'s a stop codon. So the coding sequence would terminate right after the HA tag and the Lys. That explains why the protein isn\'t being expressed. The presence of a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag would result in a truncated protein of just 10 amino acids (Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-stop), which is too small to be detected properly, leading to no overexpression of the full-length GADD45G.\n\nTherefore, the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag, which is why the protein isn\'t expressed. The user probably made a cloning error where a TGA stop codon was introduced after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation. This would result in a very short peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein.\n\nLooking at the sequence provided:\n\nAfter the HA tag (positions 1-27: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC), the next part is AAA (28-30), then TGA (31-33). So after the HA tag, the codons are AAA (Lys) and TGA (stop). Therefore, the protein translation would terminate after the Lys residue, resulting in a 10-amino acid peptide (including the initial Met). That\'s the problem. The presence of a premature stop codon prevents the full-length GADD45G from being expressed.\n\nBut why is there a stop codon there? The original GADD45G coding sequence should continue beyond the HA tag. This error likely occurred during the cloning process. For example, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation might have introduced a frameshift or added extra nucleotides leading to a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the subsequent GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated, resulting in a TGA stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the reason the protein isn\'t overexpressed is that the construct contains a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to truncation of the protein.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387324, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4807, prompt_tokens=1057, total_tokens=5864, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic mouse model stems from a **premature stop codon** introduced into the construct immediately after the HA tag sequence. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Key Issue: Premature Stop Codon**
1. **Construct Sequence Analysis**:
   - The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) is correctly encoded at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein (positions 1–27 of the provided sequence).
   - **Immediately after the HA tag**, the sequence contains **AAA (Lys)** at positions 28–30, followed by **TGA** at positions 31–33.
   - **TGA is a stop codon**, causing translation to terminate prematurely. This results in a truncated peptide of only 10 amino acids (Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein.

2. **Consequence**:
   - The truncated peptide is too short to be detected or function as intended, explaining the lack of overexpression observed in the CHO cells.
   - The premature stop codon likely arose from a **cloning error** (e.g., incorrect ligation of the HA tag to the GADD45G coding sequence, introducing frameshifts or unintended nucleotides).

---

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Kozak Sequence**: The construct lacks a Kozak sequence (e.g., `CCACCAUGG`) around the start codon (ATG), which could reduce translation efficiency. However, the primary issue is the premature termination.
- **Reading Frame**: While the HA tag itself is in-frame (27 nucleotides, preserving the reading frame), the subsequent stop codon disrupts the entire downstream sequence.

---

### **Solution**
To resolve this, the **TGA stop codon must be removed**, and the HA tag must be fused in-frame to the full-length GADD45G coding sequence. This requires:
1. **Correcting the Cloning Strategy**: Ensure seamless ligation of the HA tag to the GADD45G sequence without introducing stop codons.
2. **Verifying the Reading Frame**: Confirm that the HA tag and GADD45G coding sequences are in the same reading frame using sequencing or restriction digest analysis.
3. **Adding a Kozak Sequence**: Improve translation initiation efficiency by incorporating a Kozak sequence upstream of the start codon.

By addressing these issues, the construct should express the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein, enabling further studies on its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

So the HA tag is present.

Next, possible issues could be the Kozak sequence. Mammalian expression vectors require a Kozak consensus sequence (CCACCAUGG) around the start codon to ensure efficient initiation of translation. The start codon here is ATG. Looking at the sequence before and after:

The start codon is ATG. The preceding nucleotides are ... (the construct starts with ATG, so there's nothing before). The nucleotides after ATG are TAC. So the sequence is ATG TAC... which is Met-Tyr (the first amino acid after Met would be Tyr). Wait, but the HA tag starts with Tyr (YPYDVPDYA). However, the start codon is ATG (Met), followed by TAC (Tyr). That would mean the recombinant protein starts with Met-Tyr, but the HA tag is supposed to start with Tyr. However, in the construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be a tag added to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct's coding sequence should start with the HA tag, which starts with Tyr (TAC). However, the start codon (ATG) is followed by TAC (Tyr), so the protein would start with Met-Tyr. But the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which starts with Tyr. So the presence of the initial Met is correct (since all proteins start with Met), but then the HA tag follows. However, sometimes tags are added after the initial Met, which is usually cleaved if a signal peptide is present, but in this case, maybe the Met is retained. But maybe the presence of the Met is interfering? Or perhaps the Kozak sequence is not optimal.

Wait, the Kozak sequence in mammals is typically a nucleotide sequence surrounding the start codon that enhances translation initiation. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG (if any) and after. In this construct, the ATG is the very first nucleotides. So the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC... So the start codon is at the beginning. There is no Kozak sequence here. The absence of a Kozak sequence could lead to inefficient translation initiation, resulting in low protein expression. That's a possible reason.

Alternatively, the construct might not have a promoter or other regulatory elements. But the user mentioned that they created a plasmid for inducible overexpression, so the construct should have a promoter (like CMV or another inducible promoter), but maybe the promoter is not functional in CHO cells. However, they transfected CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, implying that the plasmid has a mammalian selection marker (like neomycin resistance), so the promoter for the selection marker is working. But the GADD45G construct's promoter might not be active in CHO cells. However, if the construct is under an inducible promoter (e.g., tetracycline-inducible), they might not have induced it properly. But the problem states that they tested the expression level and couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. If the promoter is inducible, perhaps they didn't include the inducing agent. But the user says they "select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct." Maybe they tested under non-induced conditions. But the problem states that the user realized the sequence is the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is designed with the HA tag but in the wrong reading frame. Wait, the HA tag is correctly inserted. Let's check. The start codon is ATG (Met), then the next codon is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. So the HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA. The HA tag in the construct starts after the Met. So the recombinant protein would be Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A... which adds an extra Met at the N-terminus. However, sometimes the start Met is cleaved off, but that depends on the sequence. If the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus without the Met, then the presence of the Met might interfere. But usually, the HA tag is added as a tag, so the Met would be part of the recombinant protein. However, some vectors are designed to have a Kozak sequence and the start codon followed by the tag. If the Kozak sequence is missing, translation initiation would be inefficient.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the open reading frame of GADD45G. Wait, the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. The original GADD45G coding sequence would start with its own ATG. By inserting the HA tag at the N-terminus, the start codon would be the same as the original, but with HA tag codons added before the original GADD45G sequence. Wait, but in the provided sequence, the HA tag is at the very beginning after the ATG. Let me check the sequence.

The provided sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ... So after the start codon, the HA tag is encoded as TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC, which translates to Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. Then comes AAA (Lys), TGA CTC TGG ... Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA. The sequence here gives Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, which is correct. Then the next amino acid is Lys (AAA), which would be part of the GADD45G sequence. But perhaps the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift in the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, no. If the HA tag was inserted in-frame with the original GADD45G coding sequence, then the rest should be in frame. Let me check. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 nucleotides). The original GADD45G coding sequence would start at nucleotide position 28 (after the HA tag). Let's see: the HA tag ends with GCC (A) at position 27. The next codon is AAA (position 28-30), which is Lys. If the original GADD45G starts with AAA, then the insertion of the HA tag in-frame would not cause a frameshift. However, if the original GADD45G coding sequence was cloned without maintaining the reading frame after the HA tag, then there would be a frameshift. But the user says they modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the HA tag at the N-terminus, so they should have cloned the HA tag in frame with the GADD45G sequence. But maybe during cloning, a frameshift occurred. Let me check the entire sequence.

Wait, the user provided the plus strand sequence. Let's check if the HA tag is correctly inserted and the rest of the sequence is in frame. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 nucleotides). Starting from ATG (position 1-3), then positions 4-6: TAC (Y), 7-9: CCA (P), 10-12: TAC (Y), 13-15: GAT (D), 16-18: GTT (V), 19-21: CCA (P), 22-24: GAT (D), 25-27: TAC (Y), 28-30: GCC (A). Then position 31-33: AAA (K). If the original GADD45G starts with K (AAA), then the insertion is in frame. However, if the original GADD45G starts with a different amino acid, then there's a problem. Let's check the actual GADD45G protein sequence. 

Looking up the mouse GADD45G protein (UniProt ID Q9Z111), the N-terminal sequence starts with: MSGPRHRFPSR... So the first amino acids are Met-Ser-Gly-Pro-Arg-His-Arg-Phe-Pro-Ser-Arg... Wait, the original GADD45G starts with Met followed by Ser (codon TCA, TCC, etc.). But in the construct, after the HA tag (positions 28-30: GCC (A)), the next codon is AAA (Lys). So the original GADD45G sequence here starts with Lys, which does not match the known N-terminal sequence. This suggests that inserting the HA tag caused a frameshift, altering the amino acid sequence of GADD45G beyond the HA tag. Therefore, the HA tag insertion might have disrupted the reading frame of the GADD45G coding sequence, leading to a frameshift mutation and a truncated or nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, the cloning process may have introduced errors, such as incorrect ligation leading to a shifted reading frame.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted without a proper linker, causing the rest of the sequence to be out of frame. For example, if the HA tag was inserted as a 9-codon sequence (27 bp), which is divisible by 3, then the reading frame should be maintained. However, if the HA tag was inserted with additional nucleotides (not a multiple of 3), it would cause a frameshift. In the given sequence, the HA tag is 27 nucleotides (9 codons), so that's correct. Therefore, the insertion of HA tag in frame should not cause a frameshift. But the following codon is AAA (Lys), which does not correspond to the original GADD45G N-terminus. Therefore, perhaps the HA tag was inserted, but the original GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated in frame. Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the original GADD45G coding sequence should follow immediately after the HA tag in the same reading frame. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the original GADD45G sequence should start at the same frame. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys), but the original GADD45G starts with Met followed by Ser. So unless the original GADD45G's coding sequence was modified to start with Lys after the HA tag, this suggests that the cloning process may have introduced a frameshift or the GADD45G sequence was not properly cloned. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion was done in such a way that the original start codon of GADD45G is still present, leading to two start codons. Wait, the original GADD45G has its own ATG start codon. If the HA tag was inserted before the original ATG, but in the same frame, then the original ATG would now be out of frame. Let me check.

Wait, in the provided construct, the HA tag is inserted right after the start codon (ATG). So the construct starts with ATG (Met), followed by the HA tag (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A), then the rest of the GADD45G sequence. But if the original GADD45G starts with Met, then inserting an HA tag after the initial ATG would mean that the original GADD45G's coding sequence is now shifted. However, the user intended to overexpress the GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus, so the correct approach is to fuse the HA tag in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence, replacing the original start codon. That is, the original GADD45G's ATG is removed, and the HA tag is added before the rest of the coding sequence. However, if the original ATG is retained, then the HA tag would be in a different reading frame. Wait, no. Let me think. The HA tag should be added in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. So the original GADD45G's start codon (ATG) is replaced by the HA tag sequence, followed by the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence (without the original ATG). If the HA tag is inserted correctly, then the HA tag codons are added at the beginning, followed by the original GADD45G coding sequence (minus the start codon), ensuring the same reading frame. If the original GADD45G coding sequence was cloned without removing its own ATG, then after the HA tag, the original ATG would be present as a methionine codon in the same frame, leading to an internal Met, but that might not be an issue. However, in the provided construct, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys), which is part of the original GADD45G sequence. But according to the actual GADD45G protein, the first amino acid after Met is Ser (codon TCT, TCC, etc.), which would correspond to TCN codons. However, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag, we have GCC (Ala) at position 28-30 (after the HA tag ends at 27), then AAA (Lys). So the first amino acid after the HA tag is Ala (GCC), then Lys (AAA). This does not match the original GADD45G sequence, which starts with Met followed by Ser. Therefore, this suggests that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the original GADD45G coding sequence is not in frame. Therefore, the construct has a frameshift after the HA tag, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence beyond the HA tag, resulting in a truncated or nonfunctional protein. This would explain the lack of overexpression, as the protein is not properly translated.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the Kozak sequence is missing, leading to poor translation initiation. The construct starts with ATG, but there's no Kozak sequence (which is typically a CCACC before the ATG). Without a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome may not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low protein expression. Let's check the nucleotides before the ATG. The construct starts with ATG, so there are no nucleotides before it. The Kozak sequence in mammals is usually something like 'CCACCAUGG', where the ATG is surrounded by certain nucleotides. The absence of this sequence could result in inefficient translation. Therefore, the construct may lack a Kozak sequence, leading to poor expression.

Another possibility is that the plasmid doesn't have a suitable promoter for expression in CHO cells. If the promoter is not active in CHO cells (e.g., using a mouse-specific promoter), then the gene won't be transcribed. However, the user mentioned that they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, which implies that the plasmid has a functional promoter for the antibiotic resistance gene (like neomycin resistance under a constitutive promoter like SV40). However, the GADD45G construct might be under an inducible promoter (like Tet-On), and if the cells weren't induced, the construct wouldn't be expressed. But the user tested expression levels, so they might have induced it. However, the problem states that they realized the issue was in the sequence, so it's more likely a cloning error.

Another possibility is that the HA tag contains internal methionine codons that cause premature initiation. However, the HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) doesn't have any methionines. The codons for the HA tag are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A). No ATG codons here, so that's not the issue.

Another issue could be mRNA instability due to sequences in the construct, but that's less likely.

Putting it all together, the two main possibilities are:

1. The construct lacks a Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation.

2. The HA tag was inserted in a way that causes a frameshift in the GADD45G coding sequence, resulting in a truncated or misfolded protein that isn't expressed properly.

Looking at the construct's sequence again: After the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is GCC (Ala) at positions 28-30. If the original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG (Met), then inserting 27 nucleotides (9 codons) would shift the original sequence by 0 nucleotides (since 27 is divisible by 3). Therefore, the original GADD45G coding sequence should start at position 28. But the original GADD45G starts with ATG followed by TCT (Ser), etc. However, in the provided construct, position 28-30 is GCC (Ala), which doesn't match the original GADD45G's second codon (which should be TCT for Ser). Therefore, this indicates that the HA tag was either inserted incorrectly, leading to a frameshift, or the original GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated after the HA tag. For example, if the HA tag was inserted in frame but the subsequent GADD45G sequence is not in frame, perhaps due to a cloning error (e.g., using the wrong restriction sites that caused a shift in the reading frame). Alternatively, during the cloning process, some nucleotides were added or deleted, disrupting the frame.

Wait, let's compare the expected HA-GADD45G fusion. The HA tag is 9 codons (27 bp). The original GADD45G starts with ATG followed by TCT (Ser). So after inserting the HA tag in frame, the original ATG (start codon) of GADD45G would be replaced by the HA tag. Therefore, the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence starting from the second codon (TCT). Let's check the construct's sequence after the HA tag. The HA tag ends with GCC (A) at positions 25-27. Then positions 28-30: AAA (Lys). Then positions 31-33: TGA (stop codon?), but TGA is a stop codon. Wait, that's a problem! Wait, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (positions 1-27), the sequence continues:

28-30: AAA (Lys)

31-33: TGA (stop codon)

Wait, if positions 31-33 are TGA, that's a stop codon. So the coding sequence would terminate right after the HA tag and the Lys. That explains why the protein isn't being expressed. The presence of a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag would result in a truncated protein of just 10 amino acids (Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-stop), which is too small to be detected properly, leading to no overexpression of the full-length GADD45G.

Therefore, the construct has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag, which is why the protein isn't expressed. The user probably made a cloning error where a TGA stop codon was introduced after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation. This would result in a very short peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein.

Looking at the sequence provided:

After the HA tag (positions 1-27: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC), the next part is AAA (28-30), then TGA (31-33). So after the HA tag, the codons are AAA (Lys) and TGA (stop). Therefore, the protein translation would terminate after the Lys residue, resulting in a 10-amino acid peptide (including the initial Met). That's the problem. The presence of a premature stop codon prevents the full-length GADD45G from being expressed.

But why is there a stop codon there? The original GADD45G coding sequence should continue beyond the HA tag. This error likely occurred during the cloning process. For example, when inserting the HA tag, the ligation might have introduced a frameshift or added extra nucleotides leading to a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the subsequent GADD45G sequence was not properly ligated, resulting in a TGA stop codon.

Therefore, the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the construct contains a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to truncation of the protein.

But maybe there's a frame shift. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the start codon. The first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So the HA tag is in frame. Then after the HA tag, the rest of the sequence should be in frame with GADD45G. Alternatively, perhaps the Kozak sequence is missing. For efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells, a Kozak sequence (CCACCaugG or similar) is necessary. The original sequence starts with ATG. Let's check the nucleotides before the start codon. Wait, the provided sequence starts at ATG. The plasmid construct might lack a proper Kozak sequence, which is needed for efficient initiation of translation. The Kozak sequence typically includes a purine (A or G) at position -3 relative to the ATG. In the given construct, the ATG is the first three nucleotides. If there's no Kozak sequence before the ATG, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low protein expression. Let me check the sequence again. The construct starts with ATG, so the nucleotides before the start codon would be determined by the plasmid's promoter and cloning sites. If the promoter is in place but the Kozak sequence is missing, that could be the problem. For example, the Kozak sequence is usually something like GCCACC ATG, where the ATG is the start codon. If the construct starts directly with ATG without the preceding GCCACC, the translation initiation might be inefficient, resulting in low expression. Let me check the beginning of the provided coding sequence. The plus strand is given as starting with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA... So the start codon is immediately followed by the HA tag. There's no Kozak sequence before the ATG. Wait, but the Kozak sequence is around the start codon, not necessarily upstream. The Kozak consensus is a nucleotide sequence that helps initiate translation in eukaryotes. The consensus is typically: CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G), and the underlined ATG is the start codon. The critical positions are the -3 (a purine) and +4 (a G). In the given sequence, the start codon is ATG, followed by TAC (Y). The +4 nucleotide is the first base after ATG, which is T in TAC (T is the third base of ATG, then A is the first of TAC). Wait, maybe the positions are as follows: the start codon is nucleotides 1-3 (ATG), then the next codon is TAC (nucleotides 4-6). The +4 position is nucleotide 4, which is T. In the Kozak sequence, the +4 position should be a G for optimal translation. If the +4 nucleotide is T (as in TAC), this might reduce translation efficiency. The Kozak sequence's +4 position is often a G. So if the HA tag starts with TAC (T at position +4), this would not match the Kozak consensus (which prefers G), leading to poor initiation of translation. Let's confirm: the start codon is ATG (positions 1-3). The next codon is TAC (positions 4-6). The +4 nucleotide is position 4, which is T. The Kozak sequence requires that the nucleotide following the ATG (position +4) is a G. If it's a T, as in this case, this could significantly reduce translation efficiency. Therefore, the construct lacks a proper Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation and low protein expression. The researcher might have included the HA tag immediately after the start codon without considering the Kozak sequence requirements. To fix this, they should redesign the construct to include a Kozak sequence (e.g., GCCACC ATG G ...) where the ATG is followed by a G in the +4 position. Alternatively, adjust the HA tag codons so that the +4 position is G. For example, if the HA tag starts with a codon that has G in the first position, but that's part of the HA sequence. Alternatively, insert a Kozak sequence before the start codon. Wait, the start codon is already the first codon. The Kozak sequence is part of the mRNA around the start codon, so the nucleotides before and after the ATG. In this case, the ATG is the very first part of the coding sequence. If the plasmid's promoter and cloning site do not include a Kozak sequence upstream of the ATG, then the translation initiation would be inefficient. Alternatively, if the ATG is preceded by a Kozak sequence (like GCCACC) and then the ATG, but the HA tag is in frame. But in the current construct, the ATG is at the very beginning, so perhaps there's no Kozak sequence, leading to low expression. Therefore, the problem is likely the absence of a Kozak sequence, causing poor translation initiation. The HA tag is correctly placed, but the lack of Kozak sequence prevents efficient protein expression. Another possibility is that the antibiotic selection didn't work, but the user says they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. However, the main issue here is the Kozak sequence. Alternatively, the promoter used for expression isn't active in CHO cells. But the user mentions using an inducible system. Wait, the construct is for a transgenic mouse model, but they're testing expression in CHO cells. Perhaps the promoter used is not compatible with CHO cells. For example, if the promoter is mouse-specific or not functional in CHO cells. For example, if they used a promoter that's only active in mouse cells (like a tissue-specific promoter) and not in CHO cells. Alternatively, the inducible system (e.g., tetracycline-inducible) might require specific transactivators not present in CHO cells. If the plasmid includes an inducible promoter (like Tet-On), but the CHO cells don't have the rtTA transactivator protein, then the promoter won't be active even with the inducer. The user might have forgotten to include the necessary transactivator in the CHO cells, leading to no induction. However, the user says they tested expression levels, implying they induced the system. But if the inducible system isn't functional in CHO cells, that could be the issue. Alternatively, the plasmid might not have a mammalian promoter at all. If the construct was cloned into a plasmid without a suitable promoter for mammalian expression, then the gene won't be expressed. The user used Lipofectamine to transfect CHO cells, which is a mammalian transfection reagent. But if the plasmid lacks a mammalian promoter (e.g., using a prokaryotic promoter), then no expression would occur. Alternatively, the plasmid might have a promoter, but it's not functional in CHO cells. For example, using a CMV promoter, which is strong in many mammalian cells, including CHO. But if the promoter is absent, then no expression. Alternatively, the cloning might have disrupted the promoter. Alternatively, the antibiotic resistance might not be correctly selected. But the user selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, suggesting the plasmid has a functional antibiotic resistance gene. Another possibility: the HA tag might interfere with protein folding or function, leading to protein degradation. However, the user is not detecting the protein, which would be the case if it's not expressed. If the protein is expressed but degraded, Western blotting might show a band, maybe lower in quantity. But the user says they can't overexpress, so likely no expression. Another possibility is that the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon. Let's check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons. The HA tag is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Let's check the entire coding sequence. The first part is HA tag: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ... Then after the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA), the rest of the sequence should be GADD45G. The total sequence is from ATG to TGA at the end. Let's translate the entire sequence to check for premature stops. Starting with ATG (M), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), and so on. Translating the entire sequence (excluding the stop codon at the end) would produce the HA-tagged GADD45G. If there's a frame shift, there would be a premature stop codon. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame (each codon is three nucleotides). Let's take a few more codons after the HA tag. After the HA tag (first 9 amino acids: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K...), the next codons are AAA (K), TGA (stop), CTCTGG (Leu-Trp?) Wait, no, let me parse the nucleotide sequence properly. Let me break the given DNA sequence into triplets starting from ATG:\n\n1. ATG (M)\n2. TAC (Y)\n3. CCA (P)\n4. TAC (Y)\n5. GAT (D)\n6. GTT (V)\n7. CCA (P)\n8. GAT (D)\n9. TAC (Y)\n10. GCC (A)\n11. AAA (K)\n12. TGA (Stop)\nWait, this can't be right. If the sequence after the HA tag (positions 10-12) is GCC AAA TGA, then the amino acids would be A-K-Stop. That would result in a very short protein, just 11 amino acids. But that's not possible because the GADD45G protein is longer. Therefore, this indicates a frame shift. Wait, the initial sequence provided is the plus strand. Let me check the actual nucleotide sequence again. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Wait, after the HA tag, the sequence is GCC AAA TGA. If that's the case, then after the HA tag (positions 1-30 nucleotides, 10 codons), the 11th codon is GCC (A), 12th AAA (K), 13th TGA (Stop). That would terminate translation early. However, the full-length sequence provided by the user is much longer. Let me recount. The entire sequence is:\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nLet me count the nucleotides. The sequence starts with ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), AAA (31-33), TGA (34-36)... Wait, if after the HA tag (which is 9 amino acids, so 27 nucleotides), the next codon is AAA (31-33), then TGA (34-36) is a stop codon. That would terminate the protein after 12 amino acids. But the full-length GADD45G is much longer. Therefore, this indicates that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that it introduced a frame shift, leading to a premature stop codon. However, the HA tag is supposed to be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. Let's check the original cloning strategy. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the HA coding sequence should be inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the rest of the sequence should continue in frame. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag, there's a TGA stop codon. That suggests that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, causing a frame shift. Let me check again. The HA tag is 9 amino acids, which is 27 nucleotides. The original GADD45G coding sequence should start at nucleotide 28. However, in the provided sequence, nucleotide 28-30 is GCC (alanine), then 31-33 is AAA (lysine), 34-36 is TGA (stop). So if the HA tag is in frame, then the GADD45G coding sequence must start at nucleotide 28. But if the original GADD45G sequence, when in frame, doesn't have a stop codon here, then this indicates that the insertion of the HA tag caused a frame shift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted without a proper linker, disrupting the reading frame. Wait, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in frame, but the original GADD45G sequence had a different reading frame. Let's think: the HA tag is added to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG... If the HA tag is inserted right after the start codon, then the HA tag's nucleotides should be inserted in frame, followed by the original GADD45G coding sequence. However, if the HA tag insertion was done without maintaining the reading frame, the following codons would be out of frame. Alternatively, if the HA tag was inserted via a restriction enzyme site that added extra nucleotides, causing a frame shift. Let's assume that the original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG followed by its own codons. By inserting the HA tag (27 nucleotides) after the ATG, the rest of the sequence should be in frame. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag, there's a stop codon. Therefore, the HA tag insertion must have caused a frame shift. Wait, no. If the HA tag is inserted in frame, then after the HA tag, the GADD45G sequence should continue in frame. For example, the original GADD45G starts with ATG XYZ XYZ XYZ..., and inserting HA tag (in frame) would make it ATG HA-tag XYZ XYZ..., but if the HA tag's insertion is in frame, then the GADD45G sequence should follow correctly. However, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (9 codons), there's a stop codon. This suggests that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the GADD45G sequence is out of frame, leading to a premature stop. Therefore, the mistake is that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame relative to the GADD45G coding sequence, causing a frame shift and premature termination. The researcher likely cloned the HA tag without ensuring that the insertion maintained the correct reading frame for the rest of the GADD45G gene. This would result in a truncated protein, which explains the lack of overexpression. To confirm, translating the given DNA sequence: The first 10 codons (after ATG) give the HA tag (Y P Y D V P D Y A), then GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (Stop). So the protein would be M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-A-K-Stop. Only 12 amino acids, which is way shorter than the expected GADD45G protein. Therefore, the HA tag insertion caused a frame shift, leading to a premature stop codon. The error is that the HA tag was inserted in a way that shifted the reading frame of the GADD45G coding sequence, resulting in a truncated protein that cannot be overexpressed as intended.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387509, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3937, prompt_tokens=1422, total_tokens=5359, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic mouse model stems from a **frameshift error introduced during the insertion of the HA tag**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **HA Tag Insertion Caused a Frameshift**:  
   - The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted at the N-terminus of GADD45G. However, the nucleotide sequence encoding the HA tag was not properly aligned in-frame with the subsequent GADD45G coding sequence.  
   - After the HA tag codons (27 nucleotides), the sequence **GCC AAA TGA** (positions 28–36) translates to **Ala-Lys-Stop**, introducing a premature termination codon. This truncates the protein to just 12 amino acids (including the HA tag), preventing full-length GADD45G expression.

2. **Critical Evidence from the Sequence**:  
   - The provided DNA sequence shows that after the HA tag, the next codons (GCC, AAA, TGA) immediately terminate translation. A functional GADD45G protein would require the coding sequence to continue without such a stop codon.  
   - This indicates that the HA tag was cloned in a way that disrupted the reading frame of GADD45G, leading to a non-functional, truncated protein.

3. **Solution**:  
   - Redesign the construct to ensure the HA tag is inserted **in-frame** with the GADD45G coding sequence. This requires precise cloning (e.g., using restriction enzymes or Gibson assembly to maintain the correct reading frame).  
   - Verify the absence of premature stop codons post-insertion via sequencing and in silico translation tools.  
   - Include a **Kozak sequence** (e.g., `CCACC`) upstream of the ATG start codon to enhance translation initiation efficiency in eukaryotic cells.

**Conclusion**: The frameshift caused by improper HA tag insertion led to premature translational termination, explaining the lack of protein overexpression. Correcting the reading frame and ensuring proper cloning alignment will resolve the issue.

If the HA tag is correctly placed, perhaps there's another issue. But maybe there's a frame shift. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame with the start codon. The first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So the HA tag is in frame. Then after the HA tag, the rest of the sequence should be in frame with GADD45G. Alternatively, perhaps the Kozak sequence is missing. For efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells, a Kozak sequence (CCACCaugG or similar) is necessary. The original sequence starts with ATG. Let's check the nucleotides before the start codon. Wait, the provided sequence starts at ATG. The plasmid construct might lack a proper Kozak sequence, which is needed for efficient initiation of translation. The Kozak sequence typically includes a purine (A or G) at position -3 relative to the ATG. In the given construct, the ATG is the first three nucleotides. If there's no Kozak sequence before the ATG, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low protein expression. Let me check the sequence again. The construct starts with ATG, so the nucleotides before the start codon would be determined by the plasmid's promoter and cloning sites. If the promoter is in place but the Kozak sequence is missing, that could be the problem. For example, the Kozak sequence is usually something like GCCACC ATG, where the ATG is the start codon. If the construct starts directly with ATG without the preceding GCCACC, the translation initiation might be inefficient, resulting in low expression. Let me check the beginning of the provided coding sequence. The plus strand is given as starting with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA... So the start codon is immediately followed by the HA tag. There's no Kozak sequence before the ATG. Wait, but the Kozak sequence is around the start codon, not necessarily upstream. The Kozak consensus is a nucleotide sequence that helps initiate translation in eukaryotes. The consensus is typically: CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G), and the underlined ATG is the start codon. The critical positions are the -3 (a purine) and +4 (a G). In the given sequence, the start codon is ATG, followed by TAC (Y). The +4 nucleotide is the first base after ATG, which is T in TAC (T is the third base of ATG, then A is the first of TAC). Wait, maybe the positions are as follows: the start codon is nucleotides 1-3 (ATG), then the next codon is TAC (nucleotides 4-6). The +4 position is nucleotide 4, which is T. In the Kozak sequence, the +4 position should be a G for optimal translation. If the +4 nucleotide is T (as in TAC), this might reduce translation efficiency. The Kozak sequence's +4 position is often a G. So if the HA tag starts with TAC (T at position +4), this would not match the Kozak consensus (which prefers G), leading to poor initiation of translation. Let's confirm: the start codon is ATG (positions 1-3). The next codon is TAC (positions 4-6). The +4 nucleotide is position 4, which is T. The Kozak sequence requires that the nucleotide following the ATG (position +4) is a G. If it's a T, as in this case, this could significantly reduce translation efficiency. Therefore, the construct lacks a proper Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation and low protein expression. The researcher might have included the HA tag immediately after the start codon without considering the Kozak sequence requirements. To fix this, they should redesign the construct to include a Kozak sequence (e.g., GCCACC ATG G ...) where the ATG is followed by a G in the +4 position. Alternatively, adjust the HA tag codons so that the +4 position is G. For example, if the HA tag starts with a codon that has G in the first position, but that's part of the HA sequence. Alternatively, insert a Kozak sequence before the start codon. Wait, the start codon is already the first codon. The Kozak sequence is part of the mRNA around the start codon, so the nucleotides before and after the ATG. In this case, the ATG is the very first part of the coding sequence. If the plasmid's promoter and cloning site do not include a Kozak sequence upstream of the ATG, then the translation initiation would be inefficient. Alternatively, if the ATG is preceded by a Kozak sequence (like GCCACC) and then the ATG, but the HA tag is in frame. But in the current construct, the ATG is at the very beginning, so perhaps there's no Kozak sequence, leading to low expression. Therefore, the problem is likely the absence of a Kozak sequence, causing poor translation initiation. The HA tag is correctly placed, but the lack of Kozak sequence prevents efficient protein expression. Another possibility is that the antibiotic selection didn't work, but the user says they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. However, the main issue here is the Kozak sequence. Alternatively, the promoter used for expression isn't active in CHO cells. But the user mentions using an inducible system. Wait, the construct is for a transgenic mouse model, but they're testing expression in CHO cells. Perhaps the promoter used is not compatible with CHO cells. For example, if the promoter is mouse-specific or not functional in CHO cells. For example, if they used a promoter that's only active in mouse cells (like a tissue-specific promoter) and not in CHO cells. Alternatively, the inducible system (e.g., tetracycline-inducible) might require specific transactivators not present in CHO cells. If the plasmid includes an inducible promoter (like Tet-On), but the CHO cells don't have the rtTA transactivator protein, then the promoter won't be active even with the inducer. The user might have forgotten to include the necessary transactivator in the CHO cells, leading to no induction. However, the user says they tested expression levels, implying they induced the system. But if the inducible system isn't functional in CHO cells, that could be the issue. Alternatively, the plasmid might not have a mammalian promoter at all. If the construct was cloned into a plasmid without a suitable promoter for mammalian expression, then the gene won't be expressed. The user used Lipofectamine to transfect CHO cells, which is a mammalian transfection reagent. But if the plasmid lacks a mammalian promoter (e.g., using a prokaryotic promoter), then no expression would occur. Alternatively, the plasmid might have a promoter, but it's not functional in CHO cells. For example, using a CMV promoter, which is strong in many mammalian cells, including CHO. But if the promoter is absent, then no expression. Alternatively, the cloning might have disrupted the promoter. Alternatively, the antibiotic resistance might not be correctly selected. But the user selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, suggesting the plasmid has a functional antibiotic resistance gene. Another possibility: the HA tag might interfere with protein folding or function, leading to protein degradation. However, the user is not detecting the protein, which would be the case if it's not expressed. If the protein is expressed but degraded, Western blotting might show a band, maybe lower in quantity. But the user says they can't overexpress, so likely no expression. Another possibility is that the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon. Let's check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons. The HA tag is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Let's check the entire coding sequence. The first part is HA tag: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ... Then after the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA), the rest of the sequence should be GADD45G. The total sequence is from ATG to TGA at the end. Let's translate the entire sequence to check for premature stops. Starting with ATG (M), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), and so on. Translating the entire sequence (excluding the stop codon at the end) would produce the HA-tagged GADD45G. If there's a frame shift, there would be a premature stop codon. Let's check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame (each codon is three nucleotides). Let's take a few more codons after the HA tag. After the HA tag (first 9 amino acids: M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K...), the next codons are AAA (K), TGA (stop), CTCTGG (Leu-Trp?) Wait, no, let me parse the nucleotide sequence properly. Let me break the given DNA sequence into triplets starting from ATG:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (V)
7. CCA (P)
8. GAT (D)
9. TAC (Y)
10. GCC (A)
11. AAA (K)
12. TGA (Stop)
Wait, this can't be right. If the sequence after the HA tag (positions 10-12) is GCC AAA TGA, then the amino acids would be A-K-Stop. That would result in a very short protein, just 11 amino acids. But that's not possible because the GADD45G protein is longer. Therefore, this indicates a frame shift. Wait, the initial sequence provided is the plus strand. Let me check the actual nucleotide sequence again. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Wait, after the HA tag, the sequence is GCC AAA TGA. If that's the case, then after the HA tag (positions 1-30 nucleotides, 10 codons), the 11th codon is GCC (A), 12th AAA (K), 13th TGA (Stop). That would terminate translation early. However, the full-length sequence provided by the user is much longer. Let me recount. The entire sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Let me count the nucleotides. The sequence starts with ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), AAA (31-33), TGA (34-36)... Wait, if after the HA tag (which is 9 amino acids, so 27 nucleotides), the next codon is AAA (31-33), then TGA (34-36) is a stop codon. That would terminate the protein after 12 amino acids. But the full-length GADD45G is much longer. Therefore, this indicates that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that it introduced a frame shift, leading to a premature stop codon. However, the HA tag is supposed to be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. Let's check the original cloning strategy. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the HA coding sequence should be inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the rest of the sequence should continue in frame. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag, there's a TGA stop codon. That suggests that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, causing a frame shift. Let me check again. The HA tag is 9 amino acids, which is 27 nucleotides. The original GADD45G coding sequence should start at nucleotide 28. However, in the provided sequence, nucleotide 28-30 is GCC (alanine), then 31-33 is AAA (lysine), 34-36 is TGA (stop). So if the HA tag is in frame, then the GADD45G coding sequence must start at nucleotide 28. But if the original GADD45G sequence, when in frame, doesn't have a stop codon here, then this indicates that the insertion of the HA tag caused a frame shift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted without a proper linker, disrupting the reading frame. Wait, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in frame, but the original GADD45G sequence had a different reading frame. Let's think: the HA tag is added to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG... If the HA tag is inserted right after the start codon, then the HA tag's nucleotides should be inserted in frame, followed by the original GADD45G coding sequence. However, if the HA tag insertion was done without maintaining the reading frame, the following codons would be out of frame. Alternatively, if the HA tag was inserted via a restriction enzyme site that added extra nucleotides, causing a frame shift. Let's assume that the original GADD45G coding sequence starts with ATG followed by its own codons. By inserting the HA tag (27 nucleotides) after the ATG, the rest of the sequence should be in frame. But in the provided sequence, after the HA tag, there's a stop codon. Therefore, the HA tag insertion must have caused a frame shift. Wait, no. If the HA tag is inserted in frame, then after the HA tag, the GADD45G sequence should continue in frame. For example, the original GADD45G starts with ATG XYZ XYZ XYZ..., and inserting HA tag (in frame) would make it ATG HA-tag XYZ XYZ..., but if the HA tag's insertion is in frame, then the GADD45G sequence should follow correctly. However, in the provided sequence, after the HA tag (9 codons), there's a stop codon. This suggests that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the GADD45G sequence is out of frame, leading to a premature stop. Therefore, the mistake is that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame relative to the GADD45G coding sequence, causing a frame shift and premature termination. The researcher likely cloned the HA tag without ensuring that the insertion maintained the correct reading frame for the rest of the GADD45G gene. This would result in a truncated protein, which explains the lack of overexpression. To confirm, translating the given DNA sequence: The first 10 codons (after ATG) give the HA tag (Y P Y D V P D Y A), then GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (Stop). So the protein would be M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-A-K-Stop. Only 12 amino acids, which is way shorter than the expected GADD45G protein. Therefore, the HA tag insertion caused a frame shift, leading to a premature stop codon. The error is that the HA tag was inserted in a way that shifted the reading frame of the GADD45G coding sequence, resulting in a truncated protein that cannot be overexpressed as intended.
