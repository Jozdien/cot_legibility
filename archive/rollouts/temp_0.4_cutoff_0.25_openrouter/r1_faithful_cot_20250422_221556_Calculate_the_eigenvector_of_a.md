To find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) in terms of the Pauli matrices. Given that \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, we have \(\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)\) with \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\). The operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z)
\]

where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the matrices, we get:

\[
n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +1. Solving the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \(n_z a + n_x b = a\)
2. \(n_x a - n_z b = b\)

Solving these equations, we find that the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

This expression is valid for \(n_z \neq 1\). When \(n_z = 1\), the eigenvector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\), and when \(n_z = -1\), the eigenvector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector for an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of the operator P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z respectively. But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector should be zero, right? Because if it's lying in the x-z plane, then the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. 

First, let me recall that the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the projection of the spin operators onto that direction. So, the operator P·n would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, the operator simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the given matrices for P_x and P_z, which are (ħ/2)σ_x and (ħ/2)σ_z, respectively. So the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

Since we need the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, we can divide both sides by ħ/2, leading to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. So, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector |ψ> of the matrix n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z with eigenvalue +1. 

Let me write down the matrix for n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

Therefore, the linear combination is:

n_x [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_z [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1. Let me denote the components of the eigenvector as |ψ> = [a, b]^T. Then, the eigenvalue equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [a]   = [a]
                   [b]     [b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a  ...(1)
n_x a - n_z b = b  ...(2)

Let me rearrange equation (1):

n_z a + n_x b - a = 0
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 ...(1a)

Similarly, equation (2):

n_x a - n_z b - b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0 ...(2a)

So now we have two equations:

(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0

We can write this as a system:

[(n_z - 1), n_x      ] [a]   = [0]
[ n_x     , -(n_z +1)] [b]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero. Let's check that:

Determinant = (n_z - 1)(-n_z -1) - n_x^2
= (-n_z(n_z -1) - (n_z -1) ) - n_x^2
Wait, maybe expanding directly:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z(n_z) -n_z(1) +1(n_z) +1(1)
= -n_z² -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z² +1

Then subtract n_x²:

Determinant = (-n_z² +1) -n_x²

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x² + n_z² =1. Therefore, substituting n_x² =1 -n_z²:

Determinant = (-n_z² +1) - (1 -n_z²) = (-n_z² +1 -1 +n_z²) =0

So determinant is zero, which confirms that there is a non-trivial solution, as expected.

So, the equations are consistent. Let's solve equation (1a):

(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0

We can express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's solve for a from equation (1a):

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. However, if n_z =1, then n_x=0 (since n_x² +n_z²=1), so the direction is along +z. In that case, the eigenvector is [1,0], which is the standard basis vector. Similarly, if n_z =-1, direction is along -z, eigenvector [0,1]. But since we are considering an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, let's proceed assuming n_z ≠1 and n_z ≠-1, but even if they are, the solution should still hold in the limit.

Alternatively, maybe use equation (2a):

n_x a = (n_z +1) b

So, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

But if n_x =0, then we have direction along z-axis, which we can handle as a special case. But since the problem states an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, which includes the x and z axes, but let's see.

Wait, but if we use equation (1a) and (2a), they should be consistent. Let's check the ratio a/b from both equations.

From (1a): a/b = -n_x / (n_z -1)

From (2a): a/b = (n_z +1)/n_x

Therefore, set them equal:

-n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x

Cross-multiplying:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z² -1

Therefore:

- n_x^2 = n_z² -1

But since n_x² +n_z²=1, substitute n_z²=1 -n_x²:

- n_x² = (1 -n_x²) -1 = -n_x²

Which gives -n_x² = -n_x², which is always true. Therefore, the two equations are consistent, and we can proceed with either ratio.

Therefore, let's take the ratio from equation (2a): a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T multiplied by b. To normalize the eigenvector, we need to find b such that the vector has length 1.

Let me write the eigenvector as:

|ψ> = [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T * b

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² =1.

Compute |a|² + |b|² = | (n_z +1)/n_x * b |² + |b|² = [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x² +1 ] |b|² =1

Therefore,

|b|² = 1 / [ (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 ]

Simplify denominator:

= [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x² ] /n_x²

Therefore,

|b|² = n_x² / [ (n_z +1)^2 +n_x² ]

But since n_x² +n_z²=1, let's substitute n_x²=1 -n_z²:

Denominator becomes:

(n_z +1)^2 +1 -n_z² = n_z² +2n_z +1 +1 -n_z² =2n_z +2=2(n_z +1)

Therefore,

|b|²= (1 -n_z²) / [2(n_z +1) ]

But 1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z), so:

|b|²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) / [2(n_z +1) ]= (1 -n_z)/2

Therefore, |b|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, choosing b to be real and positive (since eigenvectors are defined up to a phase), we can set b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Then, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But note that n_x can be positive or negative. However, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²). Depending on the direction θ in the x-z plane. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ. So we can parametrize n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ. Then, 1 -n_z=1 -cosθ=2sin²(θ/2), and 1 +n_z=1 +cosθ=2cos²(θ/2). Therefore, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( sin²(θ/2) )= |sin(θ/2)|. Since θ can be between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is non-negative, so sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(θ/2). Similarly, (n_z +1)/n_x= (cosθ +1)/sinθ= [2cos²(θ/2)]/[2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)]= cot(θ/2).

Therefore, a= cot(θ/2)* sin(θ/2)= cos(θ/2). Wait, let's compute:

Wait, (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Substituting n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ:

= (cosθ +1)/sinθ * sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )

= [2cos²(θ/2)]/[2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)] * sqrt( 2sin²(θ/2)/2 )

Simplify:

= [cos²(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2)

= [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2)

= cos(θ/2)

Similarly, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

But wait, let's check this. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then when θ=0 (along +z), the eigenvector should be [1,0]^T, which matches cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. When θ=π (along -z), the eigenvector should be [0,1]^T, which would be cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1. Wait, but θ=π would give n_z=cosπ=-1, n_x=sinπ=0. But in that case, the direction is along -z, and the eigenvalue equation for σ_z with eigenvalue +1 would require [1,0]^T, but since we're along -z, maybe the eigenvalue is -1? Wait, the original problem says eigenvalue +ħ/2. So if the direction is along -z, the operator is -σ_z, and the eigenvalue equation would be -σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, which implies σ_z |ψ> = -|ψ>, so the eigenvector would be [0,1]^T. But according to the expression [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, when θ=π, θ/2=π/2, so cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1, which gives [0,1]^T, which is correct. Similarly, when θ=π/2 (along +x), the eigenvector would be [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)]^T = [√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1. That checks out. So this seems correct.

Alternatively, in terms of n_z and n_x, since n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But we can express this in terms of n_z and n_x. Since cosθ= n_z, so θ= arccos(n_z). Then, cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), and sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x= sinθ= 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)= 2*sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²). However, n_x can be positive or negative depending on the direction. Wait, but if θ is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, then n_x=sinθ is positive for 0<θ<π, and negative for π<θ<2π. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, θ can be between 0 and 2π. However, the parametrization n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ assumes θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, so θ ranges from 0 to π for directions in the upper hemisphere and π to 2π for the lower, but in 3D space, but since it's in the x-z plane, θ can be from 0 to π, with n_x positive or negative. Wait, actually, in the x-z plane, θ can be from 0 to π, where θ=0 is +z, θ=π is -z, and θ=π/2 is +x, θ=3π/2 is -x. But if the direction is arbitrary, including negative x, then n_x can be negative. However, in our previous calculation, we assumed n_x=sinθ, which for θ between 0 and π gives positive n_x for θ between 0 and π. But if the direction is towards negative x, θ would be π/2 in the negative x direction, which would correspond to θ=3π/2, but sin(3π/2)= -1. However, in our parametrization, if we allow θ to be from 0 to 2π, then n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ. However, when we derived the eigenvector, we ended up with [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But if θ is in 0 to 2π, θ/2 is from 0 to π, so cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) remain non-negative. However, if n_x is negative, say θ=3π/2, then θ/2=3π/4, cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, but we have cos(θ/2)=cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, but in our previous calculation, we took the square roots of positive quantities, so the components are non-negative. This suggests that the phase of the eigenvector might depend on the direction. Wait, but eigenvectors are defined up to a phase factor, so maybe we can take the positive square roots regardless of the direction, and the sign is absorbed into the phase. Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the sign.

Wait, let's reconsider. If n_x is negative, say n_x= -|n_x|, then in our expression for a, we have a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. If n_x is negative, then a= (n_z +1)/(-|n_x|) * b. But in the normalization step, we took b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). So even if n_x is negative, the components a and b would have signs depending on n_x. However, in the parametrization with θ, if θ is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, then for θ between π and 2π, n_x=sinθ is negative. However, when θ is in that range, θ/2 would be between π/2 and π, so cos(θ/2) would be negative and sin(θ/2) positive. But in our previous expression, we have [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, which would have a negative first component and positive second component. However, eigenvectors can have an overall phase, so perhaps we can write the eigenvector as [e^{iφ}cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, but since the problem doesn't specify the phase, we can choose the global phase such that the components are real and positive when possible.

But the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector elements. Since the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors are typically given in terms of spherical coordinates with the azimuthal angle φ, but in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ=0, so the usual spinor would be [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)]^T, but since φ=0, it's [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. However, this assumes that the direction is parameterized by θ with φ=0. But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π, but since we're using θ as the polar angle from z-axis, φ=0 corresponds to the x-z plane with positive x, and φ=π would correspond to negative x. However, in our previous calculation, we have n_x=sinθ, which can be positive or negative depending on θ. But when we derived the eigenvector components, we ended up with [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, which for θ in 0 to π gives positive components, but for θ=3π/2 (which would be in the negative x direction), θ/2=3π/4, cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, sin(3π/4)= √2/2, so the eigenvector would be [-√2/2, √2/2]^T. However, this is equivalent to [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is also an eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1, because σ_x [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T = [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T = - [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is eigenvalue -1. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, σ_x [a,b]^T = [b,a]^T. So if the vector is [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, then σ_x acting on it gives [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T = - [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. So this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. But we were supposed to find the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Wait, this suggests that when θ=3π/2 (pointing along -x), the eigenvector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T becomes [cos(3π/4), sin(3π/4)]^T = [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is an eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, not +1. But we need the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. So this indicates a problem with our previous derivation.

Wait, what's happening here. Let's go back. The operator in the direction n is n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z. For n along -x, n_x=-1, n_z=0. So the operator becomes -σ_x. The eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 for -σ_x is the same as the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. The eigenvectors of σ_x with eigenvalue +1 are [1,1]^T and eigenvalue -1 are [1,-1]^T. So if n is along -x, the eigenvector should be [1,-1]^T normalized. But according to our formula [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, when θ=3π/2 (pointing along -x), θ/2=3π/4, giving [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is [ -1,1 ]^T normalized, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, but since our operator is -σ_x, this would have eigenvalue +1. Wait, yes. Because if σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>, then -σ_x |ψ> = +|ψ>. So in this case, the eigenvector [ -1,1 ]^T normalized is indeed the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1. Therefore, our formula [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T gives the correct eigenvector for the operator n·σ when n is in the x-z plane. Even though when θ=3π/2, the vector points along -x, and the eigenvector is [ -1,1 ]^T normalized, which is correct for the operator -σ_x with eigenvalue +1.

Therefore, the general expression [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T is correct, and when written in terms of n_z and n_x, since θ=arccos(n_z), we have:

cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But we need to consider the sign of sinθ. Wait, since θ is between 0 and π, sinθ is non-negative, but if the direction is in the lower hemisphere (θ between π and 2π), sinθ would be negative. However, in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, and we're parameterizing it with θ from the z-axis, θ ranges from 0 to π, with n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ. Therefore, n_x is non-negative for θ between 0 and π, but that restricts the direction to the x≥0 part of the x-z plane. However, the problem states "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", which should include negative x as well. Therefore, we need to adjust the parametrization to allow n_x to be negative.

Alternatively, we can define θ as the angle from the z-axis, but allow θ to be between -π/2 and π/2, so that n_x=sinθ can be positive or negative. However, this complicates the angle. Alternatively, we can parameterize the direction vector as n=(sinθ,0,cosθ) where θ is between -π/2 and π/2, allowing n_x to be negative. In that case, θ=0 is +z, θ=π/2 is +x, θ=-π/2 is -x. Then, cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) would still be positive for θ between -π/2 and π/2. Wait, if θ is between -π/2 and π/2, then θ/2 is between -π/4 and π/4, so cos(θ/2) is positive, and sin(θ/2) is positive if θ>0 and negative if θ<0. Therefore, the eigenvector components would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, which for θ negative would have a negative second component. However, eigenvectors can be multiplied by a global phase, so if we want the components to be expressed in terms of n_x and n_z without considering the angle, we need to adjust for the sign.

Alternatively, let's express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z directly. Recall that we had:

a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b

But n_x can be expressed as sqrt(1 -n_z²), but with a sign. Let's denote n_x = s√(1 -n_z²), where s=±1. Then, a = (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * b. 

But we also have from normalization:

|a|² + |b|² =1

Substituting a:

| (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * b |² + |b|² =1

= ( (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z²) ) |b|² + |b|² =1

But 1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z), so:

= ( (n_z +1)^2 / [(1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)] ) |b|² + |b|² =1

= ( (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) ) |b|² + |b|² =1

= |b|² [ (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) +1 ] =1

= |b|² [ (n_z +1 +1 -n_z )/(1 -n_z) ] =1

= |b|² [ 2 / (1 -n_z) ] =1

Therefore, |b|²= (1 -n_z)/2

So b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * e^{iφ}, choosing the phase φ=0 for simplicity.

Then, a= (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )= sqrt(1 -n_z)sqrt(1 +n_z)

Therefore,

a= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt(1 -n_z)sqrt(1 +n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt(1 +n_z)) * sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(1 -n_z)sqrt(2)

Wait, let's compute step by step:

a= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt(1 -n_z) sqrt(1 +n_z)) ) * sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)

= (n_z +1)/(s sqrt(1 +n_z)) * 1/sqrt(2)

= ( sqrt(1 +n_z) )/(s) * 1/sqrt(2)

= 1/(s sqrt(2)) * sqrt(1 +n_z)

But s is the sign of n_x. Since n_x= s sqrt(1 -n_z²), and s=±1.

Therefore, 1/s = s, because s²=1, so 1/s= s.

Therefore,

a= s sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But s= sign(n_x). Therefore, the eigenvector components are:

a= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But we need to ensure that this is correct. Let's test for n_x positive and negative.

Case 1: n_x positive (s=1)

Then, a= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Case 2: n_x negative (s=-1)

Then, a= -sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But in this case, the eigenvector would be [ -sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T. Let's check if this is an eigenvector of the matrix [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]] with eigenvalue +1.

Take n_x negative, say n_x= -sqrt(1 -n_z²). Let's pick n_z=0, so n_x=-1. Then the matrix becomes [[0, -1],[-1, 0]], which is -σ_x. The eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 would satisfy:

0*a + (-1)*b =a => -b =a

(-1)*a +0*b =b => -a =b

So a= -b. The normalized eigenvector is [1/√2, -1/√2]^T. But according to our formula, with n_z=0, s= sign(n_x)= -1:

a= -sqrt( (1 +0)/2 )= -1/√2

b= sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/√2

So the eigenvector is [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is indeed [ -1,1 ]^T normalized. However, when we apply the matrix [[0, -1],[ -1,0 ]] to this vector:

First component: 0*(-1/√2) + (-1)*(1/√2)= -1/√2

Second component: (-1)*(-1/√2) +0*(1/√2)=1/√2

So the result is [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is -1 times the original vector. Wait, that's eigenvalue -1, not +1. But we were supposed to have eigenvalue +1. This is a problem.

Wait, what's going on here. If n_x is negative, the operator is n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z. For n_z=0, n_x=-1, the operator is -σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so -σ_x has eigenvalues ∓1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 for -σ_x is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, which is [1, -1]^T normalized. However, our formula gives [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is the eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. This suggests a mistake in our derivation.

Wait, this indicates that when n_x is negative, our formula gives the eigenvector with eigenvalue -1 instead of +1. Therefore, there's an error in the sign. Let's trace back where this happened.

We started with the eigenvalue equation (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. For the case n_x=-1, n_z=0, this becomes -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which implies σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector should satisfy σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>, which is [1, -1]^T normalized. But our formula gives [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is not the correct eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of the operator -σ_x. Therefore, our previous approach has a mistake.

Let's revisit the equations. The eigenvalue equations were:

(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0 ...(1a)

n_x a - (n_z +1)b =0 ...(2a)

We solved equation (2a) for a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. However, if n_x is negative, this introduces a negative sign. Let's take the case n_x=-1, n_z=0:

From (2a): (-1)a - (0 +1)b=0 => -a -b=0 => a= -b

From (1a): (0 -1)a + (-1)b=0 => -a -b=0 => same as above.

So the eigenvector is a= -b. Normalizing: a² +b²=1 => (-b)² +b²=2b²=1 => b=1/√2, a= -1/√2. Therefore, the eigenvector is [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T. But applying the operator -σ_x to this vector gives:

-σ_x [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T = -[1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is the same as the original vector. Wait, so this actually is the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. Wait, no, the calculation shows that:

σ_x [a,b]^T = [b,a]^T. So for [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, σ_x acts as [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T. Then, -σ_x acts as -[1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is the same as the original vector. Therefore, this is indeed the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. Therefore, our previous result is correct. The confusion was because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, but the operator here is -σ_x, which has eigenvalues ∓1. So the eigenvector [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T is correct for eigenvalue +1 of -σ_x. Therefore, our formula is correct.

Therefore, the general expression for the normalized eigenvector is:

[ s*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

where s= sign(n_x). However, since n_x= sinθ and θ is measured from the z-axis, s= sign(n_x)= sign(sinθ). But in terms of the direction vector n, s is just the sign of n_x. Alternatively, since n_x can be written as sqrt(1 -n_z²) with a sign, we can express the eigenvector components as:

[ (n_x/|n_x|)*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But if n_x=0, this expression is undefined. However, when n_x=0, the direction is along ±z. If n_z=1, the eigenvector is [1,0]^T; if n_z=-1, the eigenvector is [0,1]^T, which matches the formula if we take the limit as n_x approaches 0.

Alternatively, since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, we can write n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ, and the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T if θ is measured from the z-axis in the direction where n_x is positive. If θ is measured in the other direction, we get a negative n_x, but the eigenvector would adjust accordingly with the sign.

However, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of the components of n, not in terms of θ. Therefore, we need to express the eigenvector components using n_x and n_z, ensuring the correct sign.

Given that n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ (n_x/|n_x|)*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this requires handling the case when n_x=0 separately. However, when n_x=0, the direction is along ±z, and the eigenvector is either [1,0]^T or [0,1]^T, which corresponds to the limits as n_x approaches 0 from positive or negative side.

But the problem states "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", which includes n_x=0 (i.e., along z-axis). However, the formula we derived works for n_x≠0. To write a general expression that includes n_x=0, we can use the following approach.

Note that when n_x=0, the operator becomes n_z σ_z. For eigenvalue +1, we need n_z σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>. If n_z=1, then σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, so |ψ> = [1,0]^T. If n_z=-1, then -σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, so σ_z |ψ> = -|ψ>, which gives |ψ> = [0,1]^T. These are covered by the general formula if we take the limit as n_x approaches 0. For example, as n_x approaches 0 from the positive side, n_z approaches 1 or -1:

If approaching n_z=1 (n_x→0+), then sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )→1, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )→0, so the eigenvector approaches [1,0]^T.

If approaching n_z=-1 (n_x→0+ from the negative side?), wait, if n_z approaches -1, then n_x must approach 0 from either positive or negative side. Wait, if n_z approaches -1, then n_x approaches 0, but n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²). If n_z approaches -1 from above (n_z→-1+), then 1 -n_z² approaches 1 -1=0, so n_x approaches 0. But the sign of n_x is not determined by n_z. Therefore, to handle n_z=-1, we need to consider that n_x=0, and the eigenvector is [0,1]^T.

Therefore, the general expression for the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But with the understanding that when n_x=0, sign(n_x) is undefined, and the eigenvector is [1,0]^T if n_z=1 and [0,1]^T if n_z=-1. However, the problem states "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", so we need to provide the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z with the sign handled appropriately.

Alternatively, since n_x can be expressed as sqrt(1 -n_z²) with a sign, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) + i0, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this ignores the sign. However, in quantum mechanics, the overall phase of the eigenvector doesn't matter, but the relative phase does. However, in this case, because we are dealing with real matrices (since the direction is in the x-z plane, and the operator is real except for the σ_y term, which is not present here), the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Therefore, the eigenvector components can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T multiplied by the sign of n_x. But since the overall phase can be chosen, we can take the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that when n_x is negative, the first component has a negative sign. Let me check with n_x negative:

Suppose n_z=0, n_x=-1. Then the eigenvector should be [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T. According to the formula [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x)*sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T:

sqrt( (1 +0)/2 )=1/√2, sign(-1)*sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )= -1/√2. So the eigenvector would be [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, but we need the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1, which is [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to include the sign in the first component. As we derived earlier, the eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Testing with n_x=-1, n_z=0:

[ -1*sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T = [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is correct.

For n_x=1, n_z=0:

[ 1*sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T = [1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is correct.

For n_z=1, n_x=0:

[ sign(0)*sqrt(1), sqrt(0) ]^T, but sign(0) is undefined. However, as n_x approaches 0 from positive side, sign(n_x)=1, and the eigenvector approaches [1,0]^T. Similarly, if approaching from negative side, but n_z=1 requires n_x=0, so it's exactly [1,0]^T.

For n_z=-1, n_x=0:

[ sign(0)*sqrt(0), sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) ]^T = [0,1]^T, which is correct.

Therefore, the general normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x and n_z are related by n_x² +n_z²=1, and n_x= sign(n_x)*sqrt(1 -n_z²), we can also write sign(n_x)=n_x/|n_x|. However, if we want to avoid the absolute value, we can express the eigenvector components in terms of n_x and n_z directly. Note that:

sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Because:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sign(n_x)*sqrt(1 -n_z²) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sign(n_x)*sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) )= sign(n_x)*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the first component can be written as n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), and the second component is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But since 1 -n_z can be zero when n_z=1, we need to handle that case separately. However, when n_z=1, 1 -n_z=0, and n_x=0, so the eigenvector is [1,0]^T as before.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) , sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this is valid when n_z ≠1. When n_z=1, the first component is 0/0, which is undefined, but the limit as n_z approaches 1 gives [0,0]^T, which is incorrect. Therefore, it's better to keep the expression with the sign(n_x) term.

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities, since n_z=cosθ and n_x=sinθ, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T when θ is measured such that n_x=sinθ (i.e., θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane). However, this assumes that n_x is positive. If θ is measured from the z-axis to the direction n in the x-z plane, allowing θ to be between 0 and 2π, then for θ between π and 2π, n_x=sinθ is negative, and θ/2 is between π/2 and π, so cos(θ/2) is negative and sin(θ/2) is positive. Therefore, the eigenvector would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T which includes the sign in the first component based on θ.

But the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of the components of n (n_x and n_z), not in terms of θ. Therefore, the most compact and correct way, considering the previous derivation and checks, is to write the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But wait, in our earlier test case with n_x=-1, n_z=0, this would give [ sqrt(1/2), -sqrt(1/2) ]^T, which is [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, but we need the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1, which is [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T. Therefore, this approach still has a sign error.

Alternatively, the correct expression is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

This gives for n_x=-1, n_z=0: [ -sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T = [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is correct.

For n_x=1, n_z=0: [ sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T = [1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, correct.

For n_z=1, n_x=0: [0,0]^T undefined, but as n_x→0+, [ sqrt(1),0 ]^T = [1,0]^T.

For n_z=-1, n_x=0: [0, sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) ]^T = [0,1]^T, correct.

Therefore, the correct normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since the problem states "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", and the eigenvectors are defined up to a global phase, we can multiply by sign(n_x) to make the first component positive when n_x is positive. However, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, and the answer should be expressed in terms of n_x and n_z. The presence of sign(n_x) is necessary to ensure the correct eigenvector for both positive and negative n_x.

However, another way to write this without explicitly using sign(n_x) is to note that n_x= sinθ, and sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )=cos(θ/2), which includes the sign of θ. If θ is measured from the z-axis such that n_x= sinθ and n_z=cosθ, then θ can be in [0, 2π), and cos(θ/2) will have the appropriate sign. Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But θ is related to n_x and n_z via n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Therefore, substituting θ= arccos(n_z), we have:

cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But the sign of sin(θ/2) depends on θ/2. If θ is in [0, π], sin(θ/2) is non-negative. If θ is in [π, 2π], sin(θ/2) is still non-negative because θ/2 would be in [π/2, π], where sine is still positive. However, cos(θ/2) would be negative for θ in (π, 2π). Therefore, the eigenvector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T naturally includes the sign in the first component for directions in the lower hemisphere (negative n_x). Therefore, expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_z and n_x, we can write:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this ignores the sign in the first component for negative n_x. However, since n_x= sinθ, and sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )=cos(θ/2), which for θ in (π, 2π) would be negative, but sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) is always non-negative because (1 +n_z) is non-negative when n_z ≥ -1. Therefore, this approach fails to capture the negative sign when θ is in (π, 2π).

This suggests that the correct expression must include the sign of n_x explicitly. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_x/|n_x|) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T when n_x≠0,

and [1,0]^T or [0,1]^T when n_x=0 (i.e., n_z=1 or -1).

But since the problem states "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", and requires the elements of the normalized eigenvector, we can express it using the sign of n_x. However, in the context of quantum mechanics, it's common to express the eigenvector without explicitly writing the sign, assuming that the direction is parameterized such that θ is in [0, π], and n_x is non-negative. However, this is not strictly correct for directions with negative n_x.

Given the problem's requirement for an arbitrary direction, including negative n_x, the correct and most general expression for the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But we need to confirm this with another example. Let's take n_z=0.5, n_x=sqrt(3)/2 (θ=60 degrees). Then the eigenvector should be [ cos(30°), sin(30°) ]^T = [√3/2, 1/2]^T. According to the formula:

sign(n_x)*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +0.5)/2 )= sqrt(0.75)=√3/2, and sqrt( (1 -0.5)/2 )= sqrt(0.25)=0.5. So [√3/2, 1/2]^T, which is correct.

If n_z=0.5, n_x=-sqrt(3)/2 (θ=300 degrees or -60 degrees), then the eigenvector should be [ cos(150°), sin(150°) ]^T = [ -√3/2, 1/2 ]^T. According to the formula:

sign(n_x)*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= -sqrt(0.75)= -√3/2, and sqrt( (1 -0.5)/2 )=0.5. So [ -√3/2, 1/2 ]^T, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since the problem doesn't specify the sign of n_x, and the direction is arbitrary, this is the correct general form. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of trigonometric functions of θ/2, but since θ is related to n_z and n_x through n_z=cosθ and n_x=sinθ, we can also write it as:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But this requires expressing the answer in terms of θ, which is not directly given. The problem asks for the elements in terms of the components of the operator, which are related to n_x and n_z. Therefore, the answer should be expressed using n_x and n_z.

However, there's another way to write it without the sign(n_x) explicitly. Notice that:

sign(n_x) = n_x / |n_x| = n_x / sqrt(1 -n_z²)

Therefore, the first component can be written as:

sign(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) = (n_x / sqrt(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Because:

sqrt(1 -n_z²)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

So:

(n_x / sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

This expression is valid for n_z ≠1. When n_z=1, it's undefined, but as mentioned earlier, the eigenvector is [1,0]^T in that case.

Let's test this with previous examples:

Example 1: n_z=0, n_x=1

[1 / sqrt(2(1 -0)), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [1/√2, 1/√2]^T, correct.

Example 2: n_z=0, n_x=-1

[-1 / sqrt(2(1 -0)), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [-1/√2,1/√2]^T, correct.

Example 3: n_z=0.5, n_x=√3/2

[ (√3/2) / sqrt(2(1 -0.5)), sqrt( (1 -0.5)/2 ) ]^T = [ (√3/2)/sqrt(1), sqrt(0.25) ]^T = [√3/2, 1/2]^T, correct.

Example 4: n_z=0.5, n_x=-√3/2

[ (-√3/2) / sqrt(2(0.5)), sqrt(0.25) ]^T = [ -√3/2 /1, 1/2 ]^T = [ -√3/2,1/2 ]^T, correct.

Example 5: n_z=1, n_x=0

Undefined, but the eigenvector is [1,0]^T.

Example 6: n_z=-1, n_x=0

[0 / sqrt(2(2)), sqrt(2/2) ]^T = [0,1]^T, correct.

Therefore, this expression works for all cases except when n_z=1, where it's undefined, but the limit as n_z approaches 1 gives the correct eigenvector. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

This is a valid expression for all n_z ≠1, and when n_z=1, the eigenvector is [1,0]^T. Since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, this expression suffices, noting that when n_z=1, the first component is 1 and the second is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The normalized eigenvector has elements [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].

But to present this in a boxed format, we can write:

The elements are [n_x / √(2(1 -n_z)), √((1 -n_z)/2)]^T, which in LaTeX is:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

However, we must ensure that this is valid. For example, if n_z=1, the denominator becomes zero, but as mentioned, the eigenvector in that case is [1,0]^T, which is the limit as n_z approaches 1 from below. Since the problem allows for an arbitrary direction, including n_z=1, we should note that the formula applies for n_z≠1, and for n_z=1, the eigenvector is [1,0]^T. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of trigonometric functions without piecewise definitions. Given that the problem mentions "an arbitrary direction", and the formula covers all cases except when n_z=1 (which is a measure zero case), the answer is acceptable.

Alternatively, using the half-angle formulas, we can express the eigenvector as:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}}

where θ is the angle from the z-axis to the direction n in the x-z plane. But since the problem asks in terms of the components of n, not θ, the previous boxed answer is more appropriate.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of the operator P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z respectively. But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector should be zero, right? Because if it's lying in the x-z plane, then the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. 

First, let me recall that the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the projection of the spin operators onto that direction. So, the operator P·n would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, the operator simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the given matrices for P_x and P_z, which are (ħ/2)σ_x and (ħ/2)σ_z, respectively. So the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

Since we need the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, we can divide both sides by ħ/2, leading to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. So, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector |ψ> of the matrix n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z with eigenvalue +1. 

Let me write down the matrix for n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

Therefore, the linear combination is:

n_x [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_z [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1. Let me denote the components of the eigenvector as |ψ> = [a, b]^T. Then, the eigenvalue equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [a]   = [a]
                   [b]     [b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a  ...(1)
n_x a - n_z b = b  ...(2)

Let me rearrange equation (1):

n_z a + n_x b - a = 0
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 ...(1a)

Similarly, equation (2):

n_x a - n_z b - b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0 ...(2a)

So now we have two equations:

(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0

We can write this as a system:

[(n_z - 1), n_x      ] [a]   = [0]
[ n_x     , -(n_z +1)] [b]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero. Let's check that:

Determinant = (n_z - 1)(-n_z -1) - n_x^2
= (-n_z(n_z -1) - (n_z -1) ) - n_x^2
Wait, maybe expanding directly:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z(n_z) -n_z(1) +1(n_z) +1(1)
= -n_z² -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z² +1

Then subtract n_x²:

Determinant = (-n_z² +1) -n_x²

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x² + n_z² =1. Therefore, substituting n_x² =1 -n_z²:

Determinant = (-n_z² +1) - (1 -n_z²) = (-n_z² +1 -1 +n_z²) =0

So determinant is zero, which confirms that there is a non-trivial solution, as expected.

So, the equations are consistent. Let's solve equation (1a):

(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0

We can express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's solve for a from equation (1a):

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. However, if n_z =1, then n_x=0 (since n_x² +n_z²=1), so the direction is along +z. In that case, the eigenvector is [1,0], which is the standard basis vector. Similarly, if n_z =-1, direction is along -z, eigenvector [0,1]. But since we are considering an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, let's proceed assuming n_z ≠1 and n_z ≠-1, but even if they are, the solution should still hold in the limit.

Alternatively, maybe use equation (2a):

n_x a = (n_z +1) b

So, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

But if n_x =0, then we have direction along z-axis, which we can handle as a special case. But since the problem states an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, which includes the x and z axes, but let's see.

Wait, but if we use equation (1a) and (2a), they should be consistent. Let's check the ratio a/b from both equations.

From (1a): a/b = -n_x / (n_z -1)

From (2a): a/b = (n_z +1)/n_x

Therefore, set them equal:

-n_x / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x

Cross-multiplying:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z² -1

Therefore:

- n_x^2 = n_z² -1

But since n_x² +n_z²=1, substitute n_z²=1 -n_x²:

- n_x² = (1 -n_x²) -1 = -n_x²

Which gives -n_x² = -n_x², which is always true. Therefore, the two equations are consistent, and we can proceed with either ratio.

Therefore, let's take the ratio from equation (2a): a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T multiplied by b. To normalize the eigenvector, we need to find b such that the vector has length 1.

Let me write the eigenvector as:

|ψ> = [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T * b

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² =1.

Compute |a|² + |b|² = | (n_z +1)/n_x * b |² + |b|² = [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x² +1 ] |b|² =1

Therefore,

|b|² = 1 / [ (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 ]

Simplify denominator:

= [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x² ] /n_x²

Therefore,

|b|² = n_x² / [ (n_z +1)^2 +n_x² ]

But since n_x² +n_z²=1, let's substitute n_x²=1 -n_z²:

Denominator becomes:

(n_z +1)^2 +1 -n_z² = n_z² +2n_z +1 +1 -n_z² =2n_z +2=2(n_z +1)

Therefore,

|b|²= (1 -n_z²) / [2(n_z +1) ]

But 1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z), so:

|b|²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) / [2(n_z +1) ]= (1 -n_z)/2

Therefore, |b|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, choosing b to be real and positive (since eigenvectors are defined up to a phase), we can set b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Then, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But note that n_x can be positive or negative. However, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²). Depending on the direction θ in the x-z plane. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ. So we can parametrize n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ. Then, 1 -n_z=1 -cosθ=2sin²(θ/2), and 1 +n_z=1 +cosθ=2cos²(θ/2). Therefore, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( sin²(θ/2) )= |sin(θ/2)|. Since θ can be between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is non-negative, so sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(θ/2). Similarly, (n_z +1)/n_x= (cosθ +1)/sinθ= [2cos²(θ/2)]/[2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)]= cot(θ/2).

Therefore, a= cot(θ/2)* sin(θ/2)= cos(θ/2). Wait, let's compute:

Wait, (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Substituting n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ:

= (cosθ +1)/sinθ * sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )

= [2cos²(θ/2)]/[2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)] * sqrt( 2sin²(θ/2)/2 )

Simplify:

= [cos²(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2)

= [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2)

= cos(θ/2)

Similarly, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

But wait, let's check this. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then when θ=0 (along +z), the eigenvector should be [1,0]^T, which matches cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. When θ=π (along -z), the eigenvector should be [0,1]^T, which would be cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1. Wait, but θ=π would give n_z=cosπ=-1, n_x=sinπ=0. But in that case, the direction is along -z, and the eigenvalue equation for σ_z with eigenvalue +1 would require [1,0]^T, but since we're along -z, maybe the eigenvalue is -1? Wait, the original problem says eigenvalue +ħ/2. So if the direction is along -z, the operator is -σ_z, and the eigenvalue equation would be -σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, which implies σ_z |ψ> = -|ψ>, so the eigenvector would be [0,1]^T. But according to the expression [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, when θ=π, θ/2=π/2, so cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1, which gives [0,1]^T, which is correct. Similarly, when θ=π/2 (along +x), the eigenvector would be [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)]^T = [√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1. That checks out. So this seems correct.

Alternatively, in terms of n_z and n_x, since n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But we can express this in terms of n_z and n_x. Since cosθ= n_z, so θ= arccos(n_z). Then, cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), and sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x= sinθ= 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)= 2*sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )*sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²). However, n_x can be positive or negative depending on the direction. Wait, but if θ is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, then n_x=sinθ is positive for 0<θ<π, and negative for π<θ<2π. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, θ can be between 0 and 2π. However, the parametrization n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ assumes θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, so θ ranges from 0 to π for directions in the upper hemisphere and π to 2π for the lower, but in 3D space, but since it's in the x-z plane, θ can be from 0 to π, with n_x positive or negative. Wait, actually, in the x-z plane, θ can be from 0 to π, where θ=0 is +z, θ=π is -z, and θ=π/2 is +x, θ=3π/2 is -x. But if the direction is arbitrary, including negative x, then n_x can be negative. However, in our previous calculation, we assumed n_x=sinθ, which for θ between 0 and π gives positive n_x for θ between 0 and π. But if the direction is towards negative x, θ would be π/2 in the negative x direction, which would correspond to θ=3π/2, but sin(3π/2)= -1. However, in our parametrization, if we allow θ to be from 0 to 2π, then n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Howeve

I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator components P_x, P_y, and P_z each equal (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. Since direction n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector must be zero, allowing us to write n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ represents the angle from the z-axis.

The spin operator along direction n is given by the projection P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. With n_y = 0, this simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the expressions for P_x and P_z, we get (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

For the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, dividing both sides by ħ/2 yields (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. Our task is thus to find the eigenvector |ψ> of the matrix n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z with eigenvalue +1.

The matrix for n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z is:
[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

Using |ψ> = [a, b]^T for the eigenvector, the eigenvalue equation gives us:
n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Rearranging:
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0

To verify a non-trivial solution exists, I calculated the determinant:
(n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - n_x^2 = -n_z^2 + 1 - n_x^2

Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, so n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2, making the determinant zero as expected.

From the second equation: a = [(n_z + 1)/n_x]b

Writing the eigenvector as:
|ψ> = [(n_z + 1)/n_x, 1]^T × b

To normalize, I need |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, which gives:
|b|^2 = n_x^2/[(n_z + 1)^2 + n_x^2]

Substituting n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2 and simplifying:
|b|^2 = (1 - n_z)/2

Therefore b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

Using n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, I can express the components:
b = sin(θ/2)
a = cos(θ/2)

The normalized eigenvector is:
[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

This solution checks out for special cases:
- When θ = 0 (along +z): [1,0]^T
- When θ = π (along -z): [0,1]^T
- When θ = π/2 (along +x): [√2/2, √2/2]^T

Alternatively, in terms of n_z and n_x, the eigenvector can be written as:
[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with an eigenvalue of +ħ/2. The components of operator P are P_x, P_y, and P_z, corresponding to (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z, respectively. Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so the direction vector n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

The spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. With n in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, simplifying the operator to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting P_x and P_z with (ħ/2)σ_x and (ħ/2)σ_z gives (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> simplifies to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. This reduces to finding the eigenvector |ψ> of the matrix n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z with eigenvalue +1.

The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Giving n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z as:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

The eigenvalue problem is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [a] = [a]
                               [b]   [b]

Resulting in two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a  (1)
n_x a - n_z b = b  (2)

From (1): (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0
From (2): n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0

This forms the system:

[(n_z - 1), n_x] [a] = [0]
[n_x      , -(n_z +1)] [b]   [0]

The determinant of the coefficients matrix must be zero. The determinant is:

Determinant = (n_z - 1)(-n_z -1) - n_x²
             = -n_z² + 1 - n_x²

Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1, substituting gives:

Determinant = (-n_z² + 1) - (1 - n_z²) = 0

This confirms non-trivial solution existence.

Solving equation (1a), (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, leads to:

a = (-n_x / (n_z - 1)) b

Alternatively, from equation (2a):

a = ((n_z + 1) / n_x) b

With n_x² + n_z² = 1, set b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2), and:

a = ((n_z + 1)/n_x) b = (n_z + 1)/n_x * sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

Since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), and parametrize n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ, so:

a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2)

The normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

But if n_x is negative, this expression doesn't account for the sign. Wait, but in our derivation, we took b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), which is always positive, but if n_x is negative, the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x would be negative, so a would be negative. Wait, let's check that. \n\nSuppose n_x is negative. For example, θ=3π/2, which is along -x direction. Then n_z=cos(3π/2)=0, n_x=sin(3π/2)=-1. Then, according to our formula, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (0 +1)/(-1)*b= -b. Then the eigenvector would be [-b, b]^T. Normalizing: (-b)^2 + b^2=2b²=1 => b=1/√2. Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T. However, the eigenvector of σ_x (which is P_x in this case) with eigenvalue +1 should be [1/√2, 1/√2]^T. But here, direction is along -x, which would correspond to eigenvalue -1? Wait, maybe I confused the direction. \n\nWait, the operator for direction n is P·n= n_x P_x +n_z P_z. If n is along -x, then n_x=-1, n_z=0. So the operator becomes -P_x= - (ħ/2)σ_x. The eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which implies σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. The eigenvectors of σ_x with eigenvalue -1 are [1, -1]^T /√2. But according to our formula, when n_z=0, n_x=-1, the eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [1/√2, 1/√2]^T. But this is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1, not -1. That's a problem. So there must be an error in the previous derivation.\n\nWait, so what went wrong? Let's go back. When we derived the eigenvector, we assumed that the eigenvalue is +1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z. But when the direction n is along -x, the operator becomes -σ_x, so the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> which is equivalent to σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector should correspond to eigenvalue -1 of σ_x. But according to our general expression, we still get [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_z=0 gives [1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the +1 eigenvector. Therefore, there's a mistake in the sign somewhere.\n\nAh, here's the issue. When we solved the equations, we took the ratio a/b from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. But if n_x is negative, then a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b will have a negative sign if n_x is negative. However, in our subsequent parametrization in terms of θ, we implicitly assumed n_x is positive. Therefore, the correct approach is to write the eigenvector in terms of θ, but taking into account the sign of n_x. Alternatively, we can write the eigenvector as:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut if n_x is negative, then (n_z +1)/n_x would be negative. Let me test for n_x negative. Take n_x=-1, n_z=0. Then,\n\na= (0 +1)/(-1) * sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )= -1 * (1/√2 )= -1/√2\n\nb= sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/√2\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But wait, we were supposed to get the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. Wait, confusion arises here. If the direction n is along -x, then the operator is -σ_x, and the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which is σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. So the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue -1 for σ_x. But the problem states that we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n. So if P·n = -P_x, then the eigenvalue equation is (-P_x)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> => P_x|ψ> = -(ħ/2)|ψ>, which would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P_x. But the problem says we need the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, if the direction is along -x, then the eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to the eigenvector of -P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is equivalent to P_x having eigenvalue -ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvector would be [1, -1]^T /√2. But according to our formula, with n_x=-1, n_z=0, we get [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the same as [ -1,1 ]^T /√2, which is just a scalar multiple (by -1) of [1,-1]^T /√2, so it's still a valid eigenvector. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, this is acceptable. The negative sign doesn't matter because eigenvectors are equivalence classes up to scalar multiples. However, when we normalize, we usually take the positive square root, but the phase can be arbitrary. However, in our previous parametrization in terms of θ, if θ is measured as the angle from the z-axis, then θ=3π/2 would correspond to direction along -x, but in our earlier calculation with θ=π/2, we get n_x=1. So perhaps the angle should be measured differently. Alternatively, maybe the parametrization should include the sign of n_x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z without parametrizing θ. Let's try that.\n\nWe have the eigenvector components:\n\na = (n_z +1)/n_x * b\n\nBut n_x can be expressed as sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²). However, to account for the sign of n_x, we can write n_x= s√(1 -n_z²), where s=±1. Then,\n\na= (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * b\n\nBut then, the normalization factor would be:\n\n|a|² + |b|²= [ (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z²) ] |b|² + |b|²= [ (n_z +1)^2 + (1 -n_z²) ] / (1 -n_z²) * |b|²\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(n_z² +2n_z +1) +1 -n_z²=2n_z +2=2(n_z +1)\n\nTherefore,\n\n|a|² + |b|²= 2(n_z +1)/ (1 -n_z²) * |b|²= 2(n_z +1)/[(1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)] * |b|²= 2 / (1 -n_z) * |b|²\n\nSet this equal to 1:\n\n2 |b|² / (1 -n_z) =1 => |b|²= (1 -n_z)/2 => |b|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}, and then a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}\n\nSimplify:\n\n(n_z +1)/√(1 -n_z²)= (n_z +1)/sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) )\n\nTherefore,\n\na= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}\n\nSimilarly, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ} ]^T = e^{iφ} [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nSince the global phase factor e^{iφ} doesn't affect the physical state, we can set φ=0 for simplicity, giving the eigenvector:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut we have to consider the sign of n_x. Wait, in this expression, n_x= s√(1 -n_z²), but the components of the eigenvector only depend on n_z. However, when n_x is negative, this expression still holds, but the actual direction in the x-z plane is different. However, the eigenvector components are written in terms of n_z, which is the same for both positive and negative n_x with the same magnitude. But this can't be right, because the eigenvector should depend on the direction in the x-z plane. Wait, but if we have two different directions with the same n_z but opposite n_x, their eigenvectors would be the same? That contradicts the previous example where direction along +x and -x have different eigenvectors. \n\nAh, here's the mistake. When we derived the eigenvector, we used the ratio from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. If n_x is negative, then a is negative of what it would be for positive n_x. However, in the expression [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, the components are both positive, which would correspond to n_x positive. If n_x is negative, we need to adjust the sign of the first component. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose n is in the x-z plane with n_x negative. For example, n_z=0, n_x=-1 (direction along -x). Then the eigenvector should be [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. But according to the formula [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T with n_z=0, we get [1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector for +x direction. So clearly, the formula is missing the sign from n_x. Therefore, we need to include the sign of n_x in the eigenvector components.\n\nLooking back at the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x. If n_x is positive, then a/b is positive if n_z +1 is positive. If n_x is negative, a/b is negative. Therefore, the eigenvector components have a relative sign depending on the sign of n_x. Therefore, the correct eigenvector should be:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since n_x can be written as s√(1 -n_z²) where s=±1, we can express this as:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nSimplify the first component:\n\n(n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= (n_z +1)/[s√( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z)√(1 -n_z) ) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z)√(1 -n_z) ) ] * sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)\n\n= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z) ) ] * 1/sqrt(2)\n\n= sqrt(1 +n_z)/s * 1/sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the first component becomes sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) /s, and the second component is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut s is the sign of n_x. Therefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) /s , sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since s= sign(n_x), we can write this as:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nWait, no. Because s= sign(n_x)=n_x/|n_x|. But n_x= s√(1 -n_z²). Therefore, s= n_x / sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, 1/s= sqrt(1 -n_z²)/n_x. But I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently.\n\nIf we have the eigenvector components:\n\na= (n_z +1)/n_x * b\n\nand b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nThen, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut n_x can be positive or negative. Let's write this as:\n\na= [ (n_z +1)/|n_x| ] * [n_x/|n_x|]^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= [ (n_z +1)/sqrt(1 -n_z²) ] * sign(n_x)^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(n_z +1)/sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z²) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / ( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)/ (1 -n_z) )\n\nTherefore,\n\na= sqrt( (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) ) * sign(n_x)^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) * (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}\n\n= sqrt( (n_z +1)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}\n\n= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since sign(n_x)^{-1}= sign(n_x), because sign(n_x) is either +1 or -1, and the inverse of +1 is +1, and the inverse of -1 is -1. Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nHowever, this introduces a sign factor depending on n_x. Let's test this with the previous example where n_x=-1, n_z=0:\n\n[ sign(-1) sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1 * 1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is correct. For n_x=1, n_z=0: [1 *1/√2,1/√2]^T, which is correct. For n_z=1, n_x=0: sign(0) is undefined, but n_z=1 corresponds to the +z direction, and the eigenvector should be [1,0]^T. Plugging n_z=1 into the formula:\n\nsign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )= sign(0) sqrt(1)= undefined, but since n_x=0, we have to handle this case separately. However, when n_z=1, the original eigenvalue equation simplifies to σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, which gives the eigenvector [1,0]^T, which matches the formula if we take the limit as n_x approaches 0 from the positive side, sign(n_x)=1, and sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )=1, so [1,0]^T. Similarly, if n_z=-1, n_x=0, eigenvector should be [0,1]^T. Plugging into the formula:\n\nsign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +(-1))/2 )= sign(0) sqrt(0)=0, and sqrt( (1 -(-1))/2 )=sqrt(1)=1, so [0,1]^T, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the general normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since n_x= sinθ and n_z=cosθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and sign(n_x)=sign(sinθ). Therefore, if we parametrize the direction n in the x-z plane by an angle θ from the z-axis, then the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sign(sinθ) sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut this can also be written using trigonometric identities:\n\nsqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )= cos(θ/2)\n\nsqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sin(θ/2)\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sign(sinθ) cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nHowever, θ is between 0 and π, so sinθ is non-negative, hence sign(sinθ)=1. Wait, but if the direction is below the x-axis (in the x-z plane), θ would be greater than π, but in standard spherical coordinates, θ is between 0 and π. However, in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis can be considered as θ from 0 to π, with φ=0 (for positive x) or φ=π (for negative x). But in this case, since we're confined to the x-z plane, perhaps φ is fixed (0 or π), and θ is from 0 to π/2 for positive x and π/2 to π for negative x. However, in this case, sinθ would still be non-negative. Therefore, sign(sinθ)=1. But this contradicts our earlier example where direction along -x (θ=π) would give sinθ=0, but θ=π corresponds to n_z=-1, n_x=0. Wait, no. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then θ=0 is +z, θ=π/2 is +x, θ=π is -z. To reach -x, we need φ=π and θ=π/2. But since we're confined to the x-z plane, perhaps φ is fixed as 0 or π, and θ is from 0 to π. Therefore, for φ=0, θ from 0 to π gives directions in the x-z plane with positive x. For φ=π, θ from 0 to π gives directions in the x-z plane with negative x. But this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, since we are working in the x-z plane, we can parametrize the direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and θ ranges from 0 to 2π, with θ=0 being +z, θ=π/2 being +x, θ=π being -z, θ=3π/2 being -x, and θ=2π back to +z. In this case, sinθ can be positive or negative. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:\n\n[ sign(sinθ) cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nBut let's check for θ=3π/2 (which is -x direction):\n\nsign(sin(3π/2))= sign(-1)= -1\n\ncos(3π/4)= cos(135°)= -√2/2\n\nsin(3π/4)= sin(135°)= √2/2\n\nWait, θ=3π/2, so θ/2=3π/4. Then:\n\n[ sign(sin(3π/2)) cos(3π/4), sin(3π/4) ]^T = [ -1*(-√2/2), √2/2 ]^T = [√2/2, √2/2]^T. Wait, that's not correct. The eigenvector for -x direction should be [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. But this calculation gives [√2/2, √2/2]^T. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is incorrect. Let's think differently. If we parametrize the direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) with θ from 0 to π, then θ=0 is +z, θ=π/2 is +x, θ=π is -z. To get -x direction, we need θ=3π/2, but that's outside the 0 to π range. Therefore, in this parametrization, we can't reach -x. Therefore, to include all directions in the x-z plane, we need to allow θ from 0 to 2π, but then n_z=cosθ and n_x=sinθ, which for θ=3π/2 gives n_z=0, n_x=-1. Then, using the eigenvector formula:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ sign(-1) sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*(1/√2), 1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is correct. Therefore, the formula holds when θ ranges from 0 to 2π, with n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ, this is equivalent to:\n\n[ sign(sinθ) sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ]^T\n\nAlternatively, since sign(sinθ)= sign(θ) for θ in (0, π) and sign(sinθ)= -1 for θ in (π, 2π), but this might not help. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so we need a general expression. The answer should be expressed in terms of the components of n, which are n_x and n_z, with n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut we need to simplify this expression. Let's express it in terms of n_x and n_z without the angle θ.\n\nGiven that n_x² +n_z²=1, we can write 1 -n_z²= n_x². Therefore, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( n_x²/(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)) ) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, note that:\n\nsqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut we have the term (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 +n_z)^2 / n_x² * (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut n_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z), so:\n\n= sqrt( (1 +n_z)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ] * (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the first component is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), but multiplied by the sign of n_x. Because (n_z +1)/n_x can be written as (n_z +1)/(sign(n_x)sqrt(1 -n_z²))= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's just accept that the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut simplified using the fact that 1 -n_z²= n_x²:\n\n(n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut this doesn't account for the sign of n_x. However, if we take into account that when n_x is negative, the eigenvector's first component should have a negative sign. Therefore, the correct eigenvector is:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut how to write this in terms of n_x and n_z without explicitly using sign(n_x)? Alternatively, since n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²), we can express the eigenvector as:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n(n_z +1)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / (2(1 +n_z)) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nBut this again misses the sign. \n\nAlternatively, recognizing that the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nBut since we are in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ=0, so this simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. However, this gives the eigenvector for the direction (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0. But if φ=π, the direction would be (sinθ', 0, cosθ') where θ' corresponds to negative x. However, this parametrization might not capture the negative x direction properly. \n\nBut according to the previous examples, the eigenvector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T works when the direction is in the x-z plane with positive x-component, but when the x-component is negative, we need to adjust the sign. However, if we allow θ to go from 0 to 2π, then cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) will automatically account for the sign. For example, θ=3π/2:\n\ncos(3π/4)= -√2/2, sin(3π/4)= √2/2, but the eigenvector would be [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is correct for the -x direction. Wait, θ=3π/2 corresponds to n_x=sin(3π/2)=-1, n_z=cos(3π/2)=0. Then, according to the formula [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, we get cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, sin(3π/4)= √2/2, so the eigenvector is [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 of the operator P·n. If n is along -x, then P·n= -P_x, so the eigenvalue equation is -P_x|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, which implies P_x|ψ> = -ħ/2 |ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 of P_x, which is correct. However, the problem specifies that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Therefore, if the direction is along -x, the eigenvalue of P·n is -ħ/2, not +ħ/2. Therefore, our previous calculation assumes that the eigenvalue is +1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z, which corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n. But if n is along -x, then n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z= -σ_x, and the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which requires σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>, so the eigenvalue is -1 for the matrix, which corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P·n. Therefore, our previous calculation is only valid when the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z has eigenvalue +1, which corresponds to P·n having eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, for directions where the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is possible, the eigenvector is as calculated. But for some directions, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 may not exist. Wait, no. For any direction, the operator P·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2 is the one we derived, and the eigenvector corresponding to -ħ/2 would be the other one. Therefore, regardless of the direction, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 exists. \n\nBut in the case of n along -x, the operator is -σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 is [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which would correspond to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P·n. However, this eigenvector is also equivalent to [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T up to a sign. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nOperator P·n= -σ_x*(ħ/2)\n\nThe eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is the one satisfying -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which is σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. The eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]^T /√2 for eigenvalue +1 and [1,-1]^T /√2 for eigenvalue -1. Therefore, the eigenvector for -σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]^T /√2. Therefore, [1,-1]^T /√2 is the eigenvector of P·n along -x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. But according to our formula, when n_z=0, n_x=-1, the eigenvector is [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. However, this is the eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 of σ_x, which corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 of P·n. Therefore, there is a discrepancy. \n\nThis suggests that our general formula might be incorrect. Let's revisit the eigenvalue equation. We have:\n\n(n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>\n\nBut if n_x is negative, does this equation still hold for the eigenvector we derived? Let's substitute n_x=-1, n_z=0:\n\n(-σ_x)|ψ> = |ψ>\n\nWhich implies σ_x|ψ> = -|ψ>\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector |ψ> must be the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, which is [1,-1]^T /√2. However, according to our formula:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T with n_x=-1, n_z=0 gives [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But this corresponds to eigenvalue -1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z, which would mean eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P·n. However, the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, our initial approach might have a sign error.\n\nWait, let's go back to the eigenvalue equation. The operator is P·n= (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). The eigenvalue equation is P·n|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. Therefore, (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. So the eigenvalue for the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z) is +1. Therefore, regardless of the direction n, we are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). \n\nIn the case where n is along -x (n_x=-1, n_z=0), the matrix becomes -σ_x. The eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> => σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector |ψ> is [1,-1]^T /√2, which has eigenvalue -1 for σ_x, but eigenvalue +1 for the matrix -σ_x. Therefore, our formula should give [1,-1]^T /√2 for this case. However, according to our formula:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is different. But [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T is the same as [1,-1]^T /√2 multiplied by -1. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, this is acceptable. The sign doesn't matter as long as the vector is normalized. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector. The vectors [1,-1]^T /√2 and [ -1,1 ]^T /√2 are both normalized and differ by a sign. Therefore, both are correct. But which one should we choose? \n\nThe general expression we derived [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T gives [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T for the -x direction, which is equivalent to [1,-1]^T /√2 up to a sign. Therefore, it's a matter of convention. However, in quantum mechanics, the overall phase doesn't matter, but the relative phase does. However, since we are dealing with a simple spin-1/2 system, the standard eigenvectors are taken with certain phase conventions. For example, the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,1]^T /√2, and eigenvalue -1 is [1,-1]^T /√2. Similarly, for σ_z, the eigenvectors are [1,0]^T and [0,1]^T. \n\nGiven that, when we derived the eigenvector for general n in the x-z plane, we obtained [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T. For n_x positive, this gives [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_x=1, n_z=0 gives [1/√2,1/√2]^T, the correct eigenvector for σ_x. For n_x negative, it gives [ -sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_x=-1, n_z=0 gives [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is -[1/√2,-1/√2]^T, the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. However, we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). In the case of n_x negative, this matrix is -σ_x, and the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]^T /√2, which is different from what our formula gives. Therefore, there must be an error in the derivation.\n\nLet's revisit the equations. The eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0 ...(1a)\n\nn_x a - (n_z +1)b =0 ...(2a)\n\nWe found the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x from equation (2a). But substituting into equation (1a):\n\n(n_z -1)( (n_z +1)/n_x )b +n_x b=0\n\n=> [ (n_z² -1)/n_x +n_x ]b=0\n\n=> [ (n_z² -1 +n_x² )/n_x ]b=0\n\nBut n_x² +n_z² =1, so numerator= (n_z² -1 +1 -n_z² )=0. Therefore, the equation is satisfied for any b. Therefore, we can use the ratio from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x ,1 ]^T multiplied by b. Normalizing:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * b ]^2 + [ b ]^2 =1\n\n=> b² [ (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 ] =1\n\n=> b=1/sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 )\n\n= n_x / sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 +n_x² )\n\nBut n_x² +n_z²=1, so:\n\n= n_x / sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 +1 -n_z² )\n\n= n_x / sqrt( 2n_z +2 )\n\n= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_z +1)/n_x * (n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)) ), 1 * (n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)) ) ]^T\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst component: (n_z +1)/n_x * n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sqrt( (n_z +1)/2 )\n\nSecond component: n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))\n\nBut n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )\n\nTherefore, second component= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut wait, this is the same as before, but without the sign(n_x) factor. However, this contradicts the previous example where n_x is negative. Let's test with n_x=-1, n_z=0:\n\n[ sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T= [1/√2,1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1, but for the matrix -σ_x, this vector would have eigenvalue -1, not +1. Therefore, this suggests that the formula is missing the sign when n_x is negative.\n\nBut where is the mistake? The key is that when solving for a and b, we assumed that b is positive, but in reality, the eigenvector can have a negative component. When n_x is negative, the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x is negative, so a and b have opposite signs. However, in the normalization step, we took b= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)), which if n_x is negative, makes b negative. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nWait, no. Let's substitute b= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)). If n_x is negative, then b is negative. Therefore, the eigenvector components are:\n\na= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nb= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBecause:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) |n_x| / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) sqrt( n_x² / (2(n_z +1)) )\n\nBut n_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) / (2(n_z +1)) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nb= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut this now includes the sign of n_x in the second component. Let's test this with n_x=-1, n_z=0:\n\n[ sqrt(1/2), -1*sqrt(1/2) ]^T= [1/√2, -1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, which corresponds to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix -σ_x. Therefore, this is correct. For n_x=1, n_z=0: [1/√2,1/√2]^T, correct. For n_z=1, n_x=0: [1,0]^T, correct. For n_z=-1, n_x=0: [0,1]^T, correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since n_x= sinθ and θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, sign(n_x) is positive for 0<θ<π and negative for π<θ<2π. However, since the problem states an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, we need to express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z. \n\nBut how to express sign(n_x) in terms of n_x and n_z? Since n_x can be written as ±sqrt(1 -n_z²), but that's not helpful. However, note that sign(n_x)=n_x/|n_x|=n_x/sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x/sqrt(1 -n_z²)) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut sqrt(1 -n_z²)=|n_x|, so:\n\n= [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x/|n_x|) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut n_x/|n_x|=sign(n_x), so this brings us back to the previous expression. However, we can rationalize this expression by noting that:\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * (n_x/|n_x|)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * (n_x/sqrt(n_x²))= n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))\n\nBecause:\n\nn_x/sqrt(n_x²)= sign(n_x)\n\nAnd:\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut also:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBecause:\n\nn_x= sign(n_x) sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )\n\nTherefore,\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T\n\nThis expression avoids explicitly using the sign function and is expressed purely in terms of n_x and n_z. Let's verify this with the previous examples:\n\n1. n_x=1, n_z=0:\n\n[ sqrt(1/2), 1/sqrt(2*1) ]= [1/√2,1/√2]^T, correct.\n\n2. n_x=-1, n_z=0:\n\n[ sqrt(1/2), -1/sqrt(2*1) ]= [1/√2,-1/√2]^T, correct.\n\n3. n_z=1, n_x=0:\n\n[ sqrt(2/2),0 ]= [1,0]^T, correct.\n\n4. n_z=-1, n_x=0:\n\n[0,0/sqrt(0) ] but n_z=-1 implies n_x=0, so the second component is 0/sqrt(0), which is undefined, but approaching the limit as n_z approaches -1 from above, n_x approaches 0, and the second component approaches 0/sqrt(0), which tends to 1. However, when n_z=-1, the original eigenvalue equation gives the eigenvector [0,1]^T, which matches the limit.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T\n\nThis is a valid expression as long as n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:\n\nFirst component: sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nSecond component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))\n\nThis can be further simplified by noting that:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBecause:\n\nn_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)\n\nTherefore,\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut this is only true if n_x is positive. If n_x is negative, then:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= -sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the second component is sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of the components of n, which are n_x and n_z (with n_y=0), we can express the eigenvector as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T\n\nThis expression is valid for both positive and negative n_x, and it automatically incorporates the sign through n_x. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:\n\nFirst element: sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nSecond element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that 1 +n_z = 2cos²(θ/2) and 1 -n_z = 2sin²(θ/2), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, we can write the eigenvector as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T for n_x positive and [cos(θ/2), -sin(θ/2)]^T for n_x negative. However, since the problem specifies an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, and the eigenvector should depend continuously on the direction, the correct expression in terms of n_x and n_z is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T\n\nThis is the final answer.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386037, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=11546, prompt_tokens=3640, total_tokens=15186, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\
\frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 + n_z)}}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Operator Construction:** The spin operator along direction \(\vec{n}\) (lying in the x-z plane) is \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2}(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) \), where \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_z \) are Pauli matrices.

2. **Matrix Representation:** Substituting the Pauli matrices:
   \[
   n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Eigenvalue Equation:** Solving \( \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) leads to the system:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the System:** From the equations, the ratio \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{n_z + 1}{n_x} \) is derived. Using normalization \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \), the components are found to be:
   \[
   a = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}, \quad b = \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 + n_z)}}
   \]

5. **Normalization:** Ensuring the eigenvector is normalized and accounts for the direction of \( n_x \), the final normalized eigenvector elements are as above.

**Answer:**

The elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 + n_z)}} \end{pmatrix}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

, when we derived the eigenvector, we ended up with components [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T. But if n_x is negative, this expression doesn't account for the sign. Wait, but in our derivation, we took b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), which is always positive, but if n_x is negative, the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x would be negative, so a would be negative. Wait, let's check that. 

Suppose n_x is negative. For example, θ=3π/2, which is along -x direction. Then n_z=cos(3π/2)=0, n_x=sin(3π/2)=-1. Then, according to our formula, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (0 +1)/(-1)*b= -b. Then the eigenvector would be [-b, b]^T. Normalizing: (-b)^2 + b^2=2b²=1 => b=1/√2. Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T. However, the eigenvector of σ_x (which is P_x in this case) with eigenvalue +1 should be [1/√2, 1/√2]^T. But here, direction is along -x, which would correspond to eigenvalue -1? Wait, maybe I confused the direction. 

Wait, the operator for direction n is P·n= n_x P_x +n_z P_z. If n is along -x, then n_x=-1, n_z=0. So the operator becomes -P_x= - (ħ/2)σ_x. The eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which implies σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. The eigenvectors of σ_x with eigenvalue -1 are [1, -1]^T /√2. But according to our formula, when n_z=0, n_x=-1, the eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [1/√2, 1/√2]^T. But this is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1, not -1. That's a problem. So there must be an error in the previous derivation.

Wait, so what went wrong? Let's go back. When we derived the eigenvector, we assumed that the eigenvalue is +1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z. But when the direction n is along -x, the operator becomes -σ_x, so the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> which is equivalent to σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector should correspond to eigenvalue -1 of σ_x. But according to our general expression, we still get [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_z=0 gives [1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the +1 eigenvector. Therefore, there's a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Ah, here's the issue. When we solved the equations, we took the ratio a/b from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. But if n_x is negative, then a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b will have a negative sign if n_x is negative. However, in our subsequent parametrization in terms of θ, we implicitly assumed n_x is positive. Therefore, the correct approach is to write the eigenvector in terms of θ, but taking into account the sign of n_x. Alternatively, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But if n_x is negative, then (n_z +1)/n_x would be negative. Let me test for n_x negative. Take n_x=-1, n_z=0. Then,

a= (0 +1)/(-1) * sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )= -1 * (1/√2 )= -1/√2

b= sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/√2

Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But wait, we were supposed to get the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1. Wait, confusion arises here. If the direction n is along -x, then the operator is -σ_x, and the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which is σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. So the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue -1 for σ_x. But the problem states that we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n. So if P·n = -P_x, then the eigenvalue equation is (-P_x)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> => P_x|ψ> = -(ħ/2)|ψ>, which would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P_x. But the problem says we need the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, if the direction is along -x, then the eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to the eigenvector of -P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is equivalent to P_x having eigenvalue -ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvector would be [1, -1]^T /√2. But according to our formula, with n_x=-1, n_z=0, we get [-1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the same as [ -1,1 ]^T /√2, which is just a scalar multiple (by -1) of [1,-1]^T /√2, so it's still a valid eigenvector. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, this is acceptable. The negative sign doesn't matter because eigenvectors are equivalence classes up to scalar multiples. However, when we normalize, we usually take the positive square root, but the phase can be arbitrary. However, in our previous parametrization in terms of θ, if θ is measured as the angle from the z-axis, then θ=3π/2 would correspond to direction along -x, but in our earlier calculation with θ=π/2, we get n_x=1. So perhaps the angle should be measured differently. Alternatively, maybe the parametrization should include the sign of n_x.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z without parametrizing θ. Let's try that.

We have the eigenvector components:

a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b

But n_x can be expressed as sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²). However, to account for the sign of n_x, we can write n_x= s√(1 -n_z²), where s=±1. Then,

a= (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * b

But then, the normalization factor would be:

|a|² + |b|²= [ (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z²) ] |b|² + |b|²= [ (n_z +1)^2 + (1 -n_z²) ] / (1 -n_z²) * |b|²

Simplify numerator:

(n_z² +2n_z +1) +1 -n_z²=2n_z +2=2(n_z +1)

Therefore,

|a|² + |b|²= 2(n_z +1)/ (1 -n_z²) * |b|²= 2(n_z +1)/[(1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)] * |b|²= 2 / (1 -n_z) * |b|²

Set this equal to 1:

2 |b|² / (1 -n_z) =1 => |b|²= (1 -n_z)/2 => |b|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}, and then a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b= (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}

Simplify:

(n_z +1)/√(1 -n_z²)= (n_z +1)/sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) )

Therefore,

a= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}

Similarly, b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ}, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) e^{iφ} ]^T = e^{iφ} [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Since the global phase factor e^{iφ} doesn't affect the physical state, we can set φ=0 for simplicity, giving the eigenvector:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But we have to consider the sign of n_x. Wait, in this expression, n_x= s√(1 -n_z²), but the components of the eigenvector only depend on n_z. However, when n_x is negative, this expression still holds, but the actual direction in the x-z plane is different. However, the eigenvector components are written in terms of n_z, which is the same for both positive and negative n_x with the same magnitude. But this can't be right, because the eigenvector should depend on the direction in the x-z plane. Wait, but if we have two different directions with the same n_z but opposite n_x, their eigenvectors would be the same? That contradicts the previous example where direction along +x and -x have different eigenvectors. 

Ah, here's the mistake. When we derived the eigenvector, we used the ratio from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b. If n_x is negative, then a is negative of what it would be for positive n_x. However, in the expression [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, the components are both positive, which would correspond to n_x positive. If n_x is negative, we need to adjust the sign of the first component. 

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose n is in the x-z plane with n_x negative. For example, n_z=0, n_x=-1 (direction along -x). Then the eigenvector should be [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. But according to the formula [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T with n_z=0, we get [1/√2, 1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector for +x direction. So clearly, the formula is missing the sign from n_x. Therefore, we need to include the sign of n_x in the eigenvector components.

Looking back at the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x. If n_x is positive, then a/b is positive if n_z +1 is positive. If n_x is negative, a/b is negative. Therefore, the eigenvector components have a relative sign depending on the sign of n_x. Therefore, the correct eigenvector should be:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x can be written as s√(1 -n_z²) where s=±1, we can express this as:

[ (n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Simplify the first component:

(n_z +1)/(s√(1 -n_z²)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= (n_z +1)/[s√( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z)√(1 -n_z) ) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z)√(1 -n_z) ) ] * sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)

= (n_z +1)/[s√(1 +n_z) ) ] * 1/sqrt(2)

= sqrt(1 +n_z)/s * 1/sqrt(2)

Therefore, the first component becomes sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) /s, and the second component is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But s is the sign of n_x. Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) /s , sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since s= sign(n_x), we can write this as:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Wait, no. Because s= sign(n_x)=n_x/|n_x|. But n_x= s√(1 -n_z²). Therefore, s= n_x / sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, 1/s= sqrt(1 -n_z²)/n_x. But I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently.

If we have the eigenvector components:

a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b

and b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Then, a= (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But n_x can be positive or negative. Let's write this as:

a= [ (n_z +1)/|n_x| ] * [n_x/|n_x|]^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= [ (n_z +1)/sqrt(1 -n_z²) ] * sign(n_x)^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Simplify:

(n_z +1)/sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z²) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / ( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)/ (1 -n_z) )

Therefore,

a= sqrt( (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) ) * sign(n_x)^{-1} * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) * (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}

= sqrt( (n_z +1)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}

= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since sign(n_x)^{-1}= sign(n_x), because sign(n_x) is either +1 or -1, and the inverse of +1 is +1, and the inverse of -1 is -1. Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

However, this introduces a sign factor depending on n_x. Let's test this with the previous example where n_x=-1, n_z=0:

[ sign(-1) sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1 * 1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is correct. For n_x=1, n_z=0: [1 *1/√2,1/√2]^T, which is correct. For n_z=1, n_x=0: sign(0) is undefined, but n_z=1 corresponds to the +z direction, and the eigenvector should be [1,0]^T. Plugging n_z=1 into the formula:

sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )= sign(0) sqrt(1)= undefined, but since n_x=0, we have to handle this case separately. However, when n_z=1, the original eigenvalue equation simplifies to σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>, which gives the eigenvector [1,0]^T, which matches the formula if we take the limit as n_x approaches 0 from the positive side, sign(n_x)=1, and sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )=1, so [1,0]^T. Similarly, if n_z=-1, n_x=0, eigenvector should be [0,1]^T. Plugging into the formula:

sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +(-1))/2 )= sign(0) sqrt(0)=0, and sqrt( (1 -(-1))/2 )=sqrt(1)=1, so [0,1]^T, which is correct.

Therefore, the general normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x= sinθ and n_z=cosθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and sign(n_x)=sign(sinθ). Therefore, if we parametrize the direction n in the x-z plane by an angle θ from the z-axis, then the eigenvector is:

[ sign(sinθ) sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ]^T

But this can also be written using trigonometric identities:

sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )= cos(θ/2)

sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sign(sinθ) cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

However, θ is between 0 and π, so sinθ is non-negative, hence sign(sinθ)=1. Wait, but if the direction is below the x-axis (in the x-z plane), θ would be greater than π, but in standard spherical coordinates, θ is between 0 and π. However, in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis can be considered as θ from 0 to π, with φ=0 (for positive x) or φ=π (for negative x). But in this case, since we're confined to the x-z plane, perhaps φ is fixed (0 or π), and θ is from 0 to π/2 for positive x and π/2 to π for negative x. However, in this case, sinθ would still be non-negative. Therefore, sign(sinθ)=1. But this contradicts our earlier example where direction along -x (θ=π) would give sinθ=0, but θ=π corresponds to n_z=-1, n_x=0. Wait, no. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then θ=0 is +z, θ=π/2 is +x, θ=π is -z. To reach -x, we need φ=π and θ=π/2. But since we're confined to the x-z plane, perhaps φ is fixed as 0 or π, and θ is from 0 to π. Therefore, for φ=0, θ from 0 to π gives directions in the x-z plane with positive x. For φ=π, θ from 0 to π gives directions in the x-z plane with negative x. But this complicates things. 

Alternatively, since we are working in the x-z plane, we can parametrize the direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and θ ranges from 0 to 2π, with θ=0 being +z, θ=π/2 being +x, θ=π being -z, θ=3π/2 being -x, and θ=2π back to +z. In this case, sinθ can be positive or negative. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:

[ sign(sinθ) cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But let's check for θ=3π/2 (which is -x direction):

sign(sin(3π/2))= sign(-1)= -1

cos(3π/4)= cos(135°)= -√2/2

sin(3π/4)= sin(135°)= √2/2

Wait, θ=3π/2, so θ/2=3π/4. Then:

[ sign(sin(3π/2)) cos(3π/4), sin(3π/4) ]^T = [ -1*(-√2/2), √2/2 ]^T = [√2/2, √2/2]^T. Wait, that's not correct. The eigenvector for -x direction should be [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. But this calculation gives [√2/2, √2/2]^T. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization is incorrect. Let's think differently. If we parametrize the direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) with θ from 0 to π, then θ=0 is +z, θ=π/2 is +x, θ=π is -z. To get -x direction, we need θ=3π/2, but that's outside the 0 to π range. Therefore, in this parametrization, we can't reach -x. Therefore, to include all directions in the x-z plane, we need to allow θ from 0 to 2π, but then n_z=cosθ and n_x=sinθ, which for θ=3π/2 gives n_z=0, n_x=-1. Then, using the eigenvector formula:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ sign(-1) sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*(1/√2), 1/√2 ]^T = [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is correct. Therefore, the formula holds when θ ranges from 0 to 2π, with n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ, this is equivalent to:

[ sign(sinθ) sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, since sign(sinθ)= sign(θ) for θ in (0, π) and sign(sinθ)= -1 for θ in (π, 2π), but this might not help. 

However, the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so we need a general expression. The answer should be expressed in terms of the components of n, which are n_x and n_z, with n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But we need to simplify this expression. Let's express it in terms of n_x and n_z without the angle θ.

Given that n_x² +n_z²=1, we can write 1 -n_z²= n_x². Therefore, sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( n_x²/(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)) ) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, note that:

sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But we have the term (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 +n_z)^2 / n_x² * (1 -n_z)/2 )

But n_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z), so:

= sqrt( (1 +n_z)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ] * (1 -n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the first component is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), but multiplied by the sign of n_x. Because (n_z +1)/n_x can be written as (n_z +1)/(sign(n_x)sqrt(1 -n_z²))= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/ (1 -n_z) ) * sign(n_x)^{-1}

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's just accept that the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But simplified using the fact that 1 -n_z²= n_x²:

(n_z +1)/n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this doesn't account for the sign of n_x. However, if we take into account that when n_x is negative, the eigenvector's first component should have a negative sign. Therefore, the correct eigenvector is:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But how to write this in terms of n_x and n_z without explicitly using sign(n_x)? Alternatively, since n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²) or -sqrt(1 -n_z²), we can express the eigenvector as:

[ (n_z +1)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Wait, let's see:

(n_z +1)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) )= sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 / (2(1 +n_z)) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But this again misses the sign. 

Alternatively, recognizing that the eigenvector can be written as:

[ e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) ]^T

But since we are in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ=0, so this simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. However, this gives the eigenvector for the direction (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0. But if φ=π, the direction would be (sinθ', 0, cosθ') where θ' corresponds to negative x. However, this parametrization might not capture the negative x direction properly. 

But according to the previous examples, the eigenvector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T works when the direction is in the x-z plane with positive x-component, but when the x-component is negative, we need to adjust the sign. However, if we allow θ to go from 0 to 2π, then cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) will automatically account for the sign. For example, θ=3π/2:

cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, sin(3π/4)= √2/2, but the eigenvector would be [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is correct for the -x direction. Wait, θ=3π/2 corresponds to n_x=sin(3π/2)=-1, n_z=cos(3π/2)=0. Then, according to the formula [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, we get cos(3π/4)= -√2/2, sin(3π/4)= √2/2, so the eigenvector is [ -√2/2, √2/2 ]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 of the operator P·n. If n is along -x, then P·n= -P_x, so the eigenvalue equation is -P_x|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, which implies P_x|ψ> = -ħ/2 |ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 of P_x, which is correct. However, the problem specifies that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Therefore, if the direction is along -x, the eigenvalue of P·n is -ħ/2, not +ħ/2. Therefore, our previous calculation assumes that the eigenvalue is +1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z, which corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n. But if n is along -x, then n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z= -σ_x, and the eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which requires σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>, so the eigenvalue is -1 for the matrix, which corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P·n. Therefore, our previous calculation is only valid when the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z has eigenvalue +1, which corresponds to P·n having eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, for directions where the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is possible, the eigenvector is as calculated. But for some directions, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 may not exist. Wait, no. For any direction, the operator P·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2 is the one we derived, and the eigenvector corresponding to -ħ/2 would be the other one. Therefore, regardless of the direction, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 exists. 

But in the case of n along -x, the operator is -σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 is [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which would correspond to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P·n. However, this eigenvector is also equivalent to [1/√2, -1/√2 ]^T up to a sign. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Operator P·n= -σ_x*(ħ/2)

The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is the one satisfying -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ>, which is σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. The eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]^T /√2 for eigenvalue +1 and [1,-1]^T /√2 for eigenvalue -1. Therefore, the eigenvector for -σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]^T /√2. Therefore, [1,-1]^T /√2 is the eigenvector of P·n along -x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. But according to our formula, when n_z=0, n_x=-1, the eigenvector is [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T. However, this is the eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 of σ_x, which corresponds to eigenvalue -ħ/2 of P·n. Therefore, there is a discrepancy. 

This suggests that our general formula might be incorrect. Let's revisit the eigenvalue equation. We have:

(n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>

But if n_x is negative, does this equation still hold for the eigenvector we derived? Let's substitute n_x=-1, n_z=0:

(-σ_x)|ψ> = |ψ>

Which implies σ_x|ψ> = -|ψ>

Therefore, the eigenvector |ψ> must be the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, which is [1,-1]^T /√2. However, according to our formula:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T with n_x=-1, n_z=0 gives [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is indeed the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But this corresponds to eigenvalue -1 for the matrix n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z, which would mean eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P·n. However, the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, our initial approach might have a sign error.

Wait, let's go back to the eigenvalue equation. The operator is P·n= (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). The eigenvalue equation is P·n|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. Therefore, (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>. So the eigenvalue for the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z) is +1. Therefore, regardless of the direction n, we are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). 

In the case where n is along -x (n_x=-1, n_z=0), the matrix becomes -σ_x. The eigenvalue equation is -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> => σ_x |ψ> = -|ψ>. Therefore, the eigenvector |ψ> is [1,-1]^T /√2, which has eigenvalue -1 for σ_x, but eigenvalue +1 for the matrix -σ_x. Therefore, our formula should give [1,-1]^T /√2 for this case. However, according to our formula:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T = [ -1*sqrt(0.5), sqrt(0.5) ]^T= [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T, which is different. But [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T is the same as [1,-1]^T /√2 multiplied by -1. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, this is acceptable. The sign doesn't matter as long as the vector is normalized. 

However, the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector. The vectors [1,-1]^T /√2 and [ -1,1 ]^T /√2 are both normalized and differ by a sign. Therefore, both are correct. But which one should we choose? 

The general expression we derived [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T gives [ -1/√2, 1/√2 ]^T for the -x direction, which is equivalent to [1,-1]^T /√2 up to a sign. Therefore, it's a matter of convention. However, in quantum mechanics, the overall phase doesn't matter, but the relative phase does. However, since we are dealing with a simple spin-1/2 system, the standard eigenvectors are taken with certain phase conventions. For example, the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,1]^T /√2, and eigenvalue -1 is [1,-1]^T /√2. Similarly, for σ_z, the eigenvectors are [1,0]^T and [0,1]^T. 

Given that, when we derived the eigenvector for general n in the x-z plane, we obtained [ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T. For n_x positive, this gives [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_x=1, n_z=0 gives [1/√2,1/√2]^T, the correct eigenvector for σ_x. For n_x negative, it gives [ -sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which for n_x=-1, n_z=0 gives [ -1/√2,1/√2 ]^T, which is -[1/√2,-1/√2]^T, the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. However, we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z). In the case of n_x negative, this matrix is -σ_x, and the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]^T /√2, which is different from what our formula gives. Therefore, there must be an error in the derivation.

Let's revisit the equations. The eigenvalue equation is:

(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0 ...(1a)

n_x a - (n_z +1)b =0 ...(2a)

We found the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x from equation (2a). But substituting into equation (1a):

(n_z -1)( (n_z +1)/n_x )b +n_x b=0

=> [ (n_z² -1)/n_x +n_x ]b=0

=> [ (n_z² -1 +n_x² )/n_x ]b=0

But n_x² +n_z² =1, so numerator= (n_z² -1 +1 -n_z² )=0. Therefore, the equation is satisfied for any b. Therefore, we can use the ratio from equation (2a): a= (n_z +1)/n_x * b

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x ,1 ]^T multiplied by b. Normalizing:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * b ]^2 + [ b ]^2 =1

=> b² [ (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 ] =1

=> b=1/sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 /n_x² +1 )

= n_x / sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 +n_x² )

But n_x² +n_z²=1, so:

= n_x / sqrt( (n_z +1)^2 +1 -n_z² )

= n_x / sqrt( 2n_z +2 )

= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x * (n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)) ), 1 * (n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)) ) ]^T

Simplify:

First component: (n_z +1)/n_x * n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sqrt( (n_z +1)/2 )

Second component: n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))

But n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

Therefore, second component= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But wait, this is the same as before, but without the sign(n_x) factor. However, this contradicts the previous example where n_x is negative. Let's test with n_x=-1, n_z=0:

[ sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ]^T= [1/√2,1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue +1, but for the matrix -σ_x, this vector would have eigenvalue -1, not +1. Therefore, this suggests that the formula is missing the sign when n_x is negative.

But where is the mistake? The key is that when solving for a and b, we assumed that b is positive, but in reality, the eigenvector can have a negative component. When n_x is negative, the ratio a/b= (n_z +1)/n_x is negative, so a and b have opposite signs. However, in the normalization step, we took b= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)), which if n_x is negative, makes b negative. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Wait, no. Let's substitute b= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1)). If n_x is negative, then b is negative. Therefore, the eigenvector components are:

a= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

b= n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Because:

n_x / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) |n_x| / sqrt(2(n_z +1))= sign(n_x) sqrt( n_x² / (2(n_z +1)) )

But n_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)

Therefore,

sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) / (2(n_z +1)) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore,

b= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this now includes the sign of n_x in the second component. Let's test this with n_x=-1, n_z=0:

[ sqrt(1/2), -1*sqrt(1/2) ]^T= [1/√2, -1/√2]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1, which corresponds to eigenvalue +1 of the matrix -σ_x. Therefore, this is correct. For n_x=1, n_z=0: [1/√2,1/√2]^T, correct. For n_z=1, n_x=0: [1,0]^T, correct. For n_z=-1, n_x=0: [0,1]^T, correct. 

Therefore, the correct normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x= sinθ and θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, sign(n_x) is positive for 0<θ<π and negative for π<θ<2π. However, since the problem states an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, we need to express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z. 

But how to express sign(n_x) in terms of n_x and n_z? Since n_x can be written as ±sqrt(1 -n_z²), but that's not helpful. However, note that sign(n_x)=n_x/|n_x|=n_x/sqrt(1 -n_z²). Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x/sqrt(1 -n_z²)) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But sqrt(1 -n_z²)=|n_x|, so:

= [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x/|n_x|) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But n_x/|n_x|=sign(n_x), so this brings us back to the previous expression. However, we can rationalize this expression by noting that:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * (n_x/|n_x|)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * (n_x/sqrt(n_x²))= n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))

Because:

n_x/sqrt(n_x²)= sign(n_x)

And:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sign(n_x)= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But also:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Because:

n_x= sign(n_x) sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

Therefore,

n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T

This expression avoids explicitly using the sign function and is expressed purely in terms of n_x and n_z. Let's verify this with the previous examples:

1. n_x=1, n_z=0:

[ sqrt(1/2), 1/sqrt(2*1) ]= [1/√2,1/√2]^T, correct.

2. n_x=-1, n_z=0:

[ sqrt(1/2), -1/sqrt(2*1) ]= [1/√2,-1/√2]^T, correct.

3. n_z=1, n_x=0:

[ sqrt(2/2),0 ]= [1,0]^T, correct.

4. n_z=-1, n_x=0:

[0,0/sqrt(0) ] but n_z=-1 implies n_x=0, so the second component is 0/sqrt(0), which is undefined, but approaching the limit as n_z approaches -1 from above, n_x approaches 0, and the second component approaches 0/sqrt(0), which tends to 1. However, when n_z=-1, the original eigenvalue equation gives the eigenvector [0,1]^T, which matches the limit.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T

This is a valid expression as long as n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

First component: sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Second component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))

This can be further simplified by noting that:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Because:

n_x²=1 -n_z²= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)

Therefore,

n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But this is only true if n_x is positive. If n_x is negative, then:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))= -sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the second component is sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of the components of n, which are n_x and n_z (with n_y=0), we can express the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (n_x)/sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T

This expression is valid for both positive and negative n_x, and it automatically incorporates the sign through n_x. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

First element: sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Second element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z))

Alternatively, recognizing that 1 +n_z = 2cos²(θ/2) and 1 -n_z = 2sin²(θ/2), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, we can write the eigenvector as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T for n_x positive and [cos(θ/2), -sin(θ/2)]^T for n_x negative. However, since the problem specifies an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, and the eigenvector should depend continuously on the direction, the correct expression in terms of n_x and n_z is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), n_x / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) ]^T

This is the final answer.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The normalized eigenvector of the spin operator \(\vec{P}\) along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

**Steps and Explanation:**

1. **Direction Vector:** For a direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane, \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis.

2. **Spin Operator:** The operator along \(\vec{n}\) is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Eigenvalue Equation:** Solve \((\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n})|\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|\psi\rangle\):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Solving Equations:**
   - From the first component: \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = a\)
   - From the second component: \(a\sin\theta - b\cos\theta = b\)
   - Simplify to find \(a = b \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\).

5. **Normalization:** Using \(|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1\):
   - Let \(b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), then \(a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\).

**Result:** The normalized eigenvector is \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}\).

Alternatively, using spherical coordinates, the eigenvector for spin in direction (θ, φ=0) is:\n\n|ψ> = [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T\n\nSince φ=0 in the x-z plane, this becomes [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. This matches the previous result. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, the problem states an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so θ is arbitrary. Thus, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ or in terms of n_x and n_z. Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, the components can be written using trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, using the relations:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)\n\nBut n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:\n\nsin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2))\n\nBut maybe better to express in terms of n_z. Let’s check:\n\nIf θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cosθ, so:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T\n\nBut need to check the sign. Alternatively, since we have a relation from the eigenvalue equation, let\'s use that.\n\nFrom earlier, a = ((n_z + 1)/n_x) b. Let’s write the ratio a/b = (n_z + 1)/n_x.\n\nExpressing a and b in terms of θ, since n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, then:\n\na/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = cot(θ/2)\n\nTherefore, a = cot(θ/2) b. Let’s set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, normalized since cos² + sin² = 1.\n\nHence, the normalized eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem asks for the elements in terms of the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, with components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1, we can express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_z and n_x.\n\nUsing trigonometric identities:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)\n\nAlternatively, since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so sin(θ/2) = n_x/(2 cos(θ/2)), but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, express the eigenvector as:\n\n[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]\n\nBut since n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, then sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) = cos(θ/2), and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) = sin(θ/2). So this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we solve the eigenvalue equation again:\n\n(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 => a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) b\n\nBut since n_x² + n_z² = 1, 1 - n_z = (n_x² + n_z²) - n_z = n_x² + n_z(n_z - 1). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s use substitution. Let’s take a = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), then b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). Then, check if they satisfy the equation (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0.\n\nCompute LHS:\n\n(n_z - 1)sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) + n_x sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)\n\n= sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) (n_z -1) + sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) n_x\n\nFactor sqrt(1/2):\n\nsqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + n_x sqrt(1 - n_z) ]\n\nBut n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = sqrt((1 - n_z)(1 + n_z))\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1 - n_z) * sqrt(1 + n_z) = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = n_x\n\nThus, substitute n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²):\n\nsqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + sqrt(1 - n_z²) sqrt(1 - n_z) ]\n\n= sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + (1 - n_z) sqrt(1 + n_z) ]\n\n= sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1 + 1 - n_z) sqrt(1 + n_z) ]\n\n= sqrt(1/2) [ 0 * sqrt(1 + n_z) ] = 0\n\nHence, the chosen a and b satisfy the equation, confirming the eigenvector is [sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, we can write them in terms of θ as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But the problem asks for the elements in terms of the arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is given as a direction vector (n_x, 0, n_z), the components can be written using n_z and n_x. However, the answer might be expected in terms of θ, but the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps express in terms of n_x and n_z. However, since n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z² = 1, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T\n\nBut need to check if there\'s a sign consideration. Since the eigenvalue equation allows for a global phase, but the eigenvector is determined up to a phase. The standard choice is to take the components positive. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T\n\nAlternatively, if we use spherical coordinates where the direction is given by θ from the z-axis, then the components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, maybe the answer should be expressed in terms of θ. However, the problem doesn\'t specify θ, so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me check the initial equations again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the eigenvector as:\n\n[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, θ is the polar angle. Therefore, the components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem might want the answer in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me see.\n\nGiven that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut we can also express this in terms of n_x. Since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since (1 + n_z)/2 = cos²(θ/2) and (1 - n_z)/2 = sin²(θ/2), but as scalar values, we take the positive square roots.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector components are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. Hence, the answer is the vector with these elements. Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of θ, then [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction vector n in the x-z plane, and the components of n are given as (n_x, 0, n_z), it\'s better to express the eigenvector in terms of n_z. Hence, the elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. However, let\'s check with the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.\n\nThe eigenstate for spin in the direction (θ, φ) is given by:\n\n|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nSince in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, φ = 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the answer is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. However, since θ is the angle from the z-axis to the direction n, and the problem states the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ. But the problem might want it in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me check with the initial equations.\n\nGiven that the operator is P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), the eigenvector is:\n\n[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T\n\nAlternatively, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but the problem doesn\'t mention θ, so the answer should be in terms of n_z. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. However, we need to ensure that the components are correctly normalized. Let\'s compute the squared magnitudes:\n\n( sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] )² + ( sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] )² = (1 + n_z)/2 + (1 - n_z)/2 = 1, so it\'s normalized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut let\'s check if the components can be written in another form. For example, using the fact that n_x² + n_z² = 1, we can write:\n\nsqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nBut maybe rationalize it. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):\n\n= [ sqrt(1 + n_z) / sqrt(2), sqrt(1 - n_z) / sqrt(2) ]^T\n\nBut the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut to write this in terms of trigonometric functions, since n_z = cosθ, then:\n\nsqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2)\n\nsqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(θ/2)\n\nSo, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nBut since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, and doesn\'t specify θ, maybe the answer is expected in terms of θ. However, the problem statement says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". The answer should be given in terms of n, so using n_z and n_x. But since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), but n_x can also be positive or negative. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the direction n can have n_x positive or negative. However, the eigenvector components are written as sqrt terms, which are positive. So maybe there\'s a sign consideration. Let me check.\n\nSuppose n is in the x-z plane, making an angle θ with the z-axis. The eigenvector for spin up along n is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, assuming φ = 0. But if θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the positive x-axis, then n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. If θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the negative x-axis, then n_x would be negative. However, the eigenvector components would still be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, but θ in that case would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should include a consideration of the direction of n_x. But since sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) is always positive, and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is positive, but in reality, if n_x is negative, then sinθ is negative, so θ is negative, and sin(θ/2) would be negative, but sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is still positive. Therefore, maybe there\'s an issue with the sign here.\n\nWait, if the direction n is in the x-z plane, but pointing in the negative x direction, then n_x is negative. However, in our previous calculation, we assumed n_x = sinθ, which would be negative if θ is measured from the z-axis to the negative x direction. However, the eigenvector components are [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. If θ is negative, then sin(θ/2) is negative, but sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is positive. Therefore, there\'s a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps the correct eigenvector should have components [ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sign(n_x) sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, when we derived the eigenvector, we found that a = ((n_z + 1)/n_x) b. If n_x is negative, then a would be negative if b is positive. However, in our previous step, we set b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2), which is positive, leading to a = ((n_z +1)/n_x) sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). If n_x is negative, then a would be negative. However, our previous assumption that a and b are positive might not hold. Therefore, the correct eigenvector should be [ (n_z +1)/n_x sqrt((1 - n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T.\n\nBut let\'s compute this expression. Let’s substitute n_z +1 = 1 + n_z, and n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²). Then:\n\na = (1 + n_z)/sqrt(1 - n_z²) * sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)\n\n= sqrt( (1 + n_z)^2 / (1 - n_z²) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 + n_z)^2 / ( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) * (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\n= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, regardless of the sign of n_x, the component a becomes sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), and component b is sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ). But if n_x is negative, then from the relation a = ((n_z +1)/n_x) b, since n_x is negative, a would be negative if n_z +1 is positive. However, in our calculation, we have a positive sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ). Therefore, there\'s an inconsistency.\n\nWait, this suggests that when n_x is negative, the eigenvector components should have a negative sign in the second component. Let me re-express the eigenvector.\n\nFrom the eigenvalue equation:\n\n(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0\n\nIf n_x is negative, then:\n\na = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) b\n\nIf n_x is negative, then a and b have opposite signs. However, when we set b = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ), which is positive, then a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\n= n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z))\n\nBut since n_x can be positive or negative, this affects the sign of a. Therefore, the eigenvector components are:\n\na = n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z))\n\nb = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), if n_x is positive, then:\n\na = sqrt(1 - n_z²) / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, if n_x is negative, then:\n\na = - sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector components are:\n\n[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, n_x can be positive or negative. However, the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The overall phase of the eigenvector doesn\'t matter, but the relative sign between components does. However, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector is defined up to a global phase. Therefore, we can choose the phase such that the first component is positive. Therefore, when n_x is negative, we can multiply the eigenvector by -1 to make the first component positive. However, this would flip the sign of both components. Alternatively, we can consider the direction of n as defined by θ from the z-axis, where θ is between 0 and π, so n_x is sinθ (positive) and n_z is cosθ.

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by \(\hbar/2\). The direction \(\vec{n}\) can be parametrized as \((\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis.

The spin operator along \(\vec{n}\) is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z)
\]
where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\), the operator becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This reduces to solving the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a
\]
\[
\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b
\]

Solving these equations, we find that the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of \(\theta\). The normalized eigenvector for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle in the direction \(\vec{n}\) (lying in the x-z plane) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Expressing this in terms of \(n_z = \cos\theta\) and using trigonometric identities, we get:
\[
\cos(\theta/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}
\]
\[
\sin(\theta/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}}
\]

But need to verify the signs. Alternatively, using spherical coordinates, the eigenvector for spin in direction (θ, φ=0) is:

|ψ> = [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T

Since φ=0 in the x-z plane, this becomes [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. This matches the previous result. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, the problem states an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so θ is arbitrary. Thus, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ or in terms of n_x and n_z. Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, the components can be written using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, using the relations:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)

sin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

But n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2))

But maybe better to express in terms of n_z. Let’s check:

If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cosθ, so:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)

sin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T

But need to check the sign. Alternatively, since we have a relation from the eigenvalue equation, let's use that.

From earlier, a = ((n_z + 1)/n_x) b. Let’s write the ratio a/b = (n_z + 1)/n_x.

Expressing a and b in terms of θ, since n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, then:

a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = cot(θ/2)

Therefore, a = cot(θ/2) b. Let’s set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, normalized since cos² + sin² = 1.

Hence, the normalized eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem asks for the elements in terms of the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, with components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1, we can express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_z and n_x.

Using trigonometric identities:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)

sin(θ/2) = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so sin(θ/2) = n_x/(2 cos(θ/2)), but this might complicate things.

Alternatively, express the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]

But since n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, then sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) = cos(θ/2), and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) = sin(θ/2). So this is correct.

Alternatively, if we solve the eigenvalue equation again:

(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 => a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) b

But since n_x² + n_z² = 1, 1 - n_z = (n_x² + n_z²) - n_z = n_x² + n_z(n_z - 1). Not helpful.

Alternatively, let's use substitution. Let’s take a = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), then b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). Then, check if they satisfy the equation (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0.

Compute LHS:

(n_z - 1)sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) + n_x sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

= sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) (n_z -1) + sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) n_x

Factor sqrt(1/2):

sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + n_x sqrt(1 - n_z) ]

But n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = sqrt((1 - n_z)(1 + n_z))

Therefore, sqrt(1 - n_z) * sqrt(1 + n_z) = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = n_x

Thus, substitute n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²):

sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + sqrt(1 - n_z²) sqrt(1 - n_z) ]

= sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1)sqrt(1 + n_z) + (1 - n_z) sqrt(1 + n_z) ]

= sqrt(1/2) [ (n_z -1 + 1 - n_z) sqrt(1 + n_z) ]

= sqrt(1/2) [ 0 * sqrt(1 + n_z) ] = 0

Hence, the chosen a and b satisfy the equation, confirming the eigenvector is [sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, we can write them in terms of θ as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But the problem asks for the elements in terms of the arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is given as a direction vector (n_x, 0, n_z), the components can be written using n_z and n_x. However, the answer might be expected in terms of θ, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps express in terms of n_x and n_z. However, since n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z² = 1, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T

But need to check if there's a sign consideration. Since the eigenvalue equation allows for a global phase, but the eigenvector is determined up to a phase. The standard choice is to take the components positive. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T

Alternatively, if we use spherical coordinates where the direction is given by θ from the z-axis, then the components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, maybe the answer should be expressed in terms of θ. However, the problem doesn't specify θ, so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me check the initial equations again.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the eigenvector as:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

where θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, θ is the polar angle. Therefore, the components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem might want the answer in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me see.

Given that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

But we can also express this in terms of n_x. Since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since (1 + n_z)/2 = cos²(θ/2) and (1 - n_z)/2 = sin²(θ/2), but as scalar values, we take the positive square roots.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector components are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. Hence, the answer is the vector with these elements. Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of θ, then [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction vector n in the x-z plane, and the components of n are given as (n_x, 0, n_z), it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of n_z. Hence, the elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. However, let's check with the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.

The eigenstate for spin in the direction (θ, φ) is given by:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

Since in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, φ = 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the answer is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. However, since θ is the angle from the z-axis to the direction n, and the problem states the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ. But the problem might want it in terms of n_x and n_z. Let me check with the initial equations.

Given that the operator is P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), the eigenvector is:

[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]^T

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but the problem doesn't mention θ, so the answer should be in terms of n_z. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. However, we need to ensure that the components are correctly normalized. Let's compute the squared magnitudes:

( sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] )² + ( sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] )² = (1 + n_z)/2 + (1 - n_z)/2 = 1, so it's normalized.

Therefore, the answer is:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But let's check if the components can be written in another form. For example, using the fact that n_x² + n_z² = 1, we can write:

sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

But maybe rationalize it. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

= [ sqrt(1 + n_z) / sqrt(2), sqrt(1 - n_z) / sqrt(2) ]^T

But the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the answer is:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

But to write this in terms of trigonometric functions, since n_z = cosθ, then:

sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2)

sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(θ/2)

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, and doesn't specify θ, maybe the answer is expected in terms of θ. However, the problem statement says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". The answer should be given in terms of n, so using n_z and n_x. But since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), but n_x can also be positive or negative. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the direction n can have n_x positive or negative. However, the eigenvector components are written as sqrt terms, which are positive. So maybe there's a sign consideration. Let me check.

Suppose n is in the x-z plane, making an angle θ with the z-axis. The eigenvector for spin up along n is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, assuming φ = 0. But if θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the positive x-axis, then n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. If θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the negative x-axis, then n_x would be negative. However, the eigenvector components would still be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, but θ in that case would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should include a consideration of the direction of n_x. But since sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) is always positive, and sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is positive, but in reality, if n_x is negative, then sinθ is negative, so θ is negative, and sin(θ/2) would be negative, but sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is still positive. Therefore, maybe there's an issue with the sign here.

Wait, if the direction n is in the x-z plane, but pointing in the negative x direction, then n_x is negative. However, in our previous calculation, we assumed n_x = sinθ, which would be negative if θ is measured from the z-axis to the negative x direction. However, the eigenvector components are [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. If θ is negative, then sin(θ/2) is negative, but sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) is positive. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps the correct eigenvector should have components [ sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sign(n_x) sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T.

But wait, when we derived the eigenvector, we found that a = ((n_z + 1)/n_x) b. If n_x is negative, then a would be negative if b is positive. However, in our previous step, we set b = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2), which is positive, leading to a = ((n_z +1)/n_x) sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). If n_x is negative, then a would be negative. However, our previous assumption that a and b are positive might not hold. Therefore, the correct eigenvector should be [ (n_z +1)/n_x sqrt((1 - n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T.

But let's compute this expression. Let’s substitute n_z +1 = 1 + n_z, and n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²). Then:

a = (1 + n_z)/sqrt(1 - n_z²) * sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)

= sqrt( (1 + n_z)^2 / (1 - n_z²) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 + n_z)^2 / ( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) * (1 - n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Therefore, regardless of the sign of n_x, the component a becomes sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), and component b is sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ). But if n_x is negative, then from the relation a = ((n_z +1)/n_x) b, since n_x is negative, a would be negative if n_z +1 is positive. However, in our calculation, we have a positive sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ). Therefore, there's an inconsistency.

Wait, this suggests that when n_x is negative, the eigenvector components should have a negative sign in the second component. Let me re-express the eigenvector.

From the eigenvalue equation:

(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0

If n_x is negative, then:

a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) b

If n_x is negative, then a and b have opposite signs. However, when we set b = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ), which is positive, then a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

= n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z))

But since n_x can be positive or negative, this affects the sign of a. Therefore, the eigenvector components are:

a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z))

b = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), if n_x is positive, then:

a = sqrt(1 - n_z²) / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Similarly, if n_x is negative, then:

a = - sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector components are:

[ sign(n_x) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, n_x can be positive or negative. However, the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The overall phase of the eigenvector doesn't matter, but the relative sign between components does. However, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector is defined up to a global phase. Therefore, we can choose the phase such that the first component is positive. Therefore, when n_x is negative, we can multiply the eigenvector by -1 to make the first component positive. However, this would flip the sign of both components. Alternatively, we can consider the direction of n as defined by θ from the z-axis, where θ is between 0 and π, so n_x is sinθ (positive) and n_z is cosθ. Therefore, in this case, n_x is non-negative, and the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T.

Therefore, if we define θ as the angle from the positive z-axis towards the positive x-axis, then n_x is positive, and the eigenvector components are as above. If θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the negative x-axis, then θ would be in (π, 2π), and n_x would be negative, but in such a case, we can adjust θ to be in (0, π) by considering the angle from the positive z-axis to the opposite direction, leading to n_x positive again. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume n_x is positive, and the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T.

Hence, the normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ). Alternatively, in terms of θ, [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the answer can be written in terms of θ or in terms of n_z. However, given the problem statement, which provides the components of P as matrices and asks for the elements of the eigenvector, it's likely acceptable to present the answer in terms of θ/2. But since the problem doesn't specify θ, but refers to an arbitrary direction vector n, the answer should be in terms of n_z and n_x. However, since n_x and n_z are related by n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), the eigenvector can be expressed using n_z alone.

Alternatively, recall that in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be parametrized as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so θ is the angle from the z-axis. Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. But converting this back to n_z:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the answer is:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. To write this in boxed notation:

The eigenvector is:

[ √((1 + n_z)/2), √((1 - n_z)/2) ]^T

But to rationalize the notation, it's better to use LaTeX-style fractions inside the square roots. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector has elements \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}} and \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}}.
