# Original Question

The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

To find the probability of getting 0 for observable P and -1 for observable Q when measured sequentially, we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix for P is:
     \[
     P = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 0, -1) \).

2. **Projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector**:
   - The initial state is \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The inner product \( \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle = 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 = -2
     \]
   - The norm squared of \( \mathbf{v} \) is \( 2 \), so the projection of \( \psi \) onto \( \mathbf{v} \) is:
     \[
     \text{Projection} = \frac{-2}{2} \mathbf{v} = (-1, 0, 1)
     \]
   - The norm squared of this projection is \( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 2 \). The probability of measuring P=0 is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

3. **Probability of measuring Q=-1 after collapsing to the eigenstate of P**:
   - The normalized projected state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1) \).
   - The eigenstate of Q corresponding to -1 is \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The inner product of the normalized projected state with this eigenstate is:
     \[
     \left\langle \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1) \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The probability is the squared magnitude of this inner product:
     \[
     \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

4. **Total probability**:
   - The combined probability is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

Thus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the probability of getting 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when measured immediately after. The system is initially in the state given by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). 

First, I need to recall how quantum measurements work. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable's operator, with a probability determined by the projection of the initial state onto that eigenstate. Then, if you measure another observable immediately after, the system is already in the eigenstate from the first measurement, so the second measurement's probability depends on that collapsed state.

But here, both observables P and Q are represented by matrices. So, first, I need to make sure I have the matrices for P and Q correctly. Let me write them down.

The matrix for P is given as:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, in matrix form, that's:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And the matrix for Q is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. That makes sense; Q is already diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors.

But for P, the matrix isn't diagonal. So, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we need to diagonalize P or at least find its eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 because the first measurement is of P, and we want the probability of getting 0.

Wait, the problem says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, first measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. The combined probability is the probability of collapsing to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, then from that state, collapsing to the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenstates of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
2. The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). We need to project this initial state onto each of the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0 to find the probability of collapsing into each. Since the question just asks for the probability of getting 0 for P, regardless of which eigenstate it is, but if there are multiple eigenstates with eigenvalue 0, we need to consider all of them. Then, after the collapse, measure Q and get -1.

Wait, but if there are multiple eigenstates for P with eigenvalue 0, then after measurement, the state collapses into one of them, but the probability of each eigenstate is given by the squared magnitude of the projection. Then, when measuring Q, the probability would depend on which eigenstate of P we collapsed to. But if the eigenvalue 0 for P is degenerate (i.e., multiple eigenstates), then the total probability would be the sum over all eigenstates with eigenvalue 0 of the probability of collapsing to that eigenstate times the probability of measuring -1 for Q from that eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe we can first find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0, project the initial state onto the subspace spanned by these eigenstates, then express this projected state as a combination of the eigenstates of Q, and find the probability of getting -1. Hmm, but actually, the process is sequential: first measure P, collapse to an eigenstate of P (with eigenvalue 0), then measure Q on that eigenstate.

But if the eigenvalue 0 of P has a multi-dimensional eigenspace (i.e., more than one eigenvector), then after measuring P and getting 0, the state is projected onto that eigenspace. However, the measurement process in quantum mechanics, when the eigenspace is multi-dimensional, typically involves the system being in a state that is a linear combination of the basis vectors of that eigenspace. Wait, no. Actually, when you measure an observable and the eigenvalue is degenerate, the state collapses into the projection of the original state onto the eigenspace, normalized. Then, if you measure another observable, you have to consider that normalized projected state as the initial state for the next measurement.

Wait, let me recall. The measurement postulate says that if the measurement of an observable A yields a value a, the system is left in the eigenstate corresponding to a. If the eigenspace for a is multi-dimensional, then the state collapses to the projection of the original state onto that eigenspace, normalized. So, the resulting state is the normalized projection. Therefore, when you measure Q after that, you have to calculate the probability of getting -1 given that the state is the normalized projection onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. Find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Let's call this subspace S.

2. Project the initial state |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) onto S, resulting in |ψ_P>.

3. Normalize |ψ_P> to get the state after measurement, which is |ψ_P_normalized> = |ψ_P> / ||ψ_P||.

4. Then, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q on |ψ_P_normalized>. This is done by taking the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ_P_normalized> onto the eigenspace of Q with eigenvalue -1.

But Q is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the eigenspace for Q=-1 is spanned by (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability is just the squared magnitude of the third component of |ψ_P_normalized>.

Therefore, the total probability is [Norm of projection of |ψ> onto S]^2 multiplied by [squared magnitude of third component of normalized projection].

But wait, actually, no. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the normalized projection of |ψ> onto S. Then, when you measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of this normalized state onto the eigenspace of Q=-1.

So, the total probability is:

Probability = ||projection of |ψ> onto S||^2 * ||projection of (normalized projection) onto Q=-1 eigenspace||^2

But since the normalized projection is |ψ_P> / ||ψ_P||, the probability becomes:

||projection of |ψ> onto S||^2 * |<e_Q=-1 | ψ_P / ||ψ_P|| >|^2

Which simplifies to |<e_Q=-1 | ψ_P>|^2

Because ||ψ_P||^2 * |<e_Q=-1 | ψ_P / ||ψ_P|| >|^2 = |<e_Q=-1 | ψ_P>|^2

Therefore, total probability is |<e_Q=-1 | ψ_P>|^2

But ψ_P is the projection of ψ onto S. So, we can compute that.

So, first, need to find S, the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

To find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0, we solve (P - 0*I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.

So, writing out the equations:

First row: (1/√2) v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

Third row: (1/√2) v2 = 0

So, from first and third equations: v2 = 0

From second equation: v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenspace S is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1) (since a can be any scalar, but we can take a=1 for the basis). Wait, but let's check.

Wait, if v1 = -v3, then setting v1 = 1, v3 = -1, and v2 = 0, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Therefore, S is spanned by (1, 0, -1). Therefore, the projection of the initial state onto S is the component of the initial state along this vector.

Therefore, let's compute that.

The initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). Let's call the eigenvector |e_P> = (1, 0, -1).

The projection of |ψ> onto |e_P> is given by <e_P | ψ> / <e_P | e_P> * |e_P>

First, compute the inner product <e_P | ψ>:

(1*)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2

Then, <e_P | e_P> = 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the projection of |ψ> onto S is (-2 / 2) |e_P> = -|e_P> = (-1, 0, 1)

Wait, but actually, the projection is the vector (-1, 0, 1). The norm squared of this projection is ||projection||^2 = (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is ||projection||^2 divided by ||ψ||^2. Wait, but in the standard formula, the probability is |<e_P | ψ>|^2. Wait, but since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the probability is |<e_P | ψ>|^2 / <e_P | e_P> ?

Wait, no. Wait, if the eigenstates are not normalized, then the probability is |<e_P | ψ>|^2 / <e_P | e_P>. But in our case, |e_P> is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm squared of 2. So, if we normalize |e_P>, it would be (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, the probability is |<e_P_normalized | ψ>|^2.

But let's compute both ways.

First, <e_P | ψ> = -2 as above.

If we compute the normalized eigenvector: |e_P_normalized> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

Then, <e_P_normalized | ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2

Then, the probability is | -√2 |^2 = 2.

But that can't be, since probabilities can't exceed 1. Therefore, I must have messed up.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the total norm squared is 6. Therefore, the maximum probability for any outcome is 1. Therefore, clearly, the previous approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the projection. Let me clarify.

In general, the probability of collapsing to an eigenstate |e> is |<e | ψ>|^2, provided that |e> is normalized. If |e> is not normalized, then it's |<e | ψ>|^2 / <e | e>.

In our case, the eigenvector is |e_P> = (1, 0, -1), which is not normalized. Its norm squared is 2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is |e_P_normalized> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Therefore, the probability is |<e_P_normalized | ψ>|^2.

Compute that inner product:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2

Then, the squared magnitude is (-√2)^2 = 2. But wait, the total probability can't be 2. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is not normalized either. Wait, the state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Is this supposed to be normalized? In quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but the problem doesn't specify. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state.

Wait, hold on. The problem states: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." It doesn't mention normalization. Therefore, we need to check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute its norm:

||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But in the problem, when they say "the state is given by the column matrix...", do we assume it's normalized? In physics, usually yes, but sometimes problems give non-normalized vectors. However, in this case, the question is about probabilities, which require normalized states. Therefore, I think we have to normalize the state first.

But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we should proceed with the given vector as the actual state, even if it's not normalized. Wait, but probabilities are computed based on squared magnitudes divided by the norm squared. So, if the vector isn't normalized, the probabilities are calculated by |<e | ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2.

But in this case, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). So, its norm squared is 6. Therefore, when we compute the probability of collapsing to |e_P_normalized>, it's |<e_P_normalized | ψ>|^2.

But <e_P_normalized | ψ> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2

Then, |<e_P_normalized | ψ>|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2

But then, the probability would be 2 / ||ψ||^2 = 2 / 6 = 1/3

Wait, that makes sense. Because the probability is |inner product|^2 divided by the product of the norms squared? Wait, no. Wait, if the state is not normalized, the probability is |<e | ψ>|^2 / (||e||^2 ||ψ||^2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let's recall.

In general, if you have a state vector |ψ> (not necessarily normalized) and an eigenvector |e> (not necessarily normalized), the probability of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to |e> is given by |<e | ψ>|^2 / (||e||^2 ||ψ||^2). Wait, no, actually, the standard formula is:

If the eigenstates |e_i> form an orthonormal basis, then the probability is |<e_i | ψ_normalized>|^2 where ψ_normalized is ψ / ||ψ||.

But if the eigenstates are not normalized, then you have to adjust accordingly.

But in our case, the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by |e_P> = (1, 0, -1). To compute the probability, we can normalize both the state and the eigenvector.

So, first, normalize the initial state:

|ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)

Then, normalize the eigenvector |e_P>:

|e_P_normalized> = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1)

Then, the probability is |<e_P_normalized | ψ_normalized>|^2

Compute the inner product:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = -2/√12 = -1/√3

Then, the probability is |-1/√3|^2 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Okay, that makes sense. So, the first step gives us a probability of 1/3 for measuring P=0.

Then, after collapsing to |e_P_normalized> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), we need to measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

As mentioned earlier, Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenstate corresponding to -1 is (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of |e_P_normalized> onto (0, 0, 1).

Compute the inner product:

(0)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = -1/√2

Thus, the probability is |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6

Wait, but is that correct? Let me check again.

Wait, no. Because when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |e_P_normalized>, and then we measure Q. The probability of getting -1 is 1/2 as calculated. Therefore, the total probability is the probability of first measuring P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of measuring Q=-1 given that the state is |e_P_normalized> (1/2), so total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But let me verify this with another approach to be sure.

Alternative approach: The combined probability can also be calculated by considering the projection operators.

First, the projection operator for P=0 is |e_P_normalized><e_P_normalized|. Then, the projection operator for Q=-1 is |e_Q><e_Q| where |e_Q> = (0, 0, 1).

The combined process is: project the initial state onto P=0, then project that result onto Q=-1. The probability is || |e_Q><e_Q| |e_P_normalized><e_P_normalized| |ψ_normalized> ||^2

But since the operations are sequential measurements, it's equivalent to:

|<e_Q | e_P_normalized>|^2 * |<e_P_normalized | ψ_normalized>|^2

Which is exactly (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6

Alternatively, using the non-normalized vectors:

The projection of |ψ> onto S is (-1, 0, 1). Then, normalize this to get (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2). Then, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is |<0,0,1 | (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2>|^2 = |1/√2|^2 = 1/2. Then, multiply by the probability of getting P=0, which is ||projection||^2 / ||ψ||^2 = 2 / 6 = 1/3. So, total probability is again 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, both methods give the same result. So, the answer should be 1/6.

But let me double-check all steps once more to be absolutely sure.

First, confirm the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0:

We had the equations:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1

3. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ same as first equation

Thus, eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So, correct.

Projection of initial state (-1, 2, 1) onto (1, 0, -1):

Dot product: (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. The norm squared of (1,0,-1) is 2. So, the projection vector is (-2 / 2)*(1,0,-1) = (-1, 0, 1). The norm squared of this projection is (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2. The norm squared of the original state is 6. Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. Correct.

Then, the normalized projected state is (-1, 0, 1) divided by √2, which is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2). The probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the third component, which is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, total probability 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. Correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the probability of getting 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when measured immediately after. The system is initially in the state given by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). 

First, I need to recall how quantum measurements work. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable's operator, with a probability determined by the projection of the initial state onto that eigenstate. Then, if you measure another observable immediately after, the system is already in the eigenstate from the first measurement, so the second measurement's probability depends on that collapsed state.

But here, both observables P and Q are represented by matrices. So, first, I need to make sure I have the matrices for P and Q correctly. Let me write them down.

The matrix for P is given as:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, in matrix form, that's:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And the matrix for Q is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. That makes sense; Q is already diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors.

But for P, the matrix isn't diagonal. So, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we need to diagonalize P or at least find its eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 because the first measurement is of P, and we want the probability of getting 0.

Wait, the problem says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, first measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. The combined probability is the probability of collapsing to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, then from that state, collapsing to the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenstates of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
2. The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). We need to project this initial state onto each of the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0 to find the probability of collapsing into each. Since the question just asks for the probability of getting 0 for P, regardless of which eigenstate it is, but if there are multiple eigenstates with eigenvalue 0, we need to consider all of them. Then, after the collapse, measure Q and get -1.

Wait, but if there are multiple eigenstates for P with eigenvalue 0, then after measurement, the state collapses into one of them, but the probability of each eigenstate is given by the squared magnitude of the projection. Then, when measuring Q, the probability would depend on which eigenstate of P we collapsed to. But if the eigenvalue 0 for P is degenerate (i.e., multiple eigenstates), then the total probability would be the sum over all eigenstates with eigenvalue 0 of the probability of collapsing to that eigenstate times the probability of measuring -1 for Q from that eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe we can first find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0, project the initial state onto the subspace spanned by these eigenstates, then express this projected state as a combination of the eigenstates of Q, and find the probability of getting -1. Hmm, but actually, the process is sequential: first measure P, collapse to an eigenstate of P (with eigenvalue 0), then measure Q on that eigenstate.

However, the measurement process in quantum mechanics, when the eigenspace is multi-dimensional, typically involves the system being in a state that is a linear combination of the basis vectors of that eigenspace. Wait, no. Actually, when you measure an observable and the eigenvalue is degenerate, the state collapses into the projection o

# Anthropic completion

I'll approach this quantum measurement problem methodically. I'm examining the probability of measuring 0 for observable P followed immediately by -1 for observable Q when the system begins in state (-1, 2, 1).

In quantum mechanics, measuring an observable causes the system to collapse into one of the observable's eigenstates, with probability determined by projecting the initial state onto that eigenstate. A subsequent measurement's probability depends on this collapsed state.

Let me identify the matrices representing observables P and Q:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Q = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, -1]
]

Q is already in diagonal form with eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, corresponding to the standard basis vectors. However, P isn't diagonal, so I need to find its eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, since we want the probability of measuring P=0.

To solve this problem, I need to:
1. Find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0
2. Calculate the probability of the initial state (-1, 2, 1) collapsing to these eigenstates
3. For each eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, determine the probability of subsequently measuring Q=-1

If P has multiple eigenstates with eigenvalue 0 (degenerate eigenvalue), the total probability would be the sum across all such eigenstates: (probability of collapsing to that eigenstate) × (probability of measuring Q=-1 from that eigenstate).

Alternatively, I could find P's eigenstates with eigenvalue 0, project the initial state onto the subspace spanned by these eigenstates, express this projected state as a combination of Q's eigenstates, and find the probability of getting -1. But the sequential nature of the measurements means I first measure P, collapse to an eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, then measure Q on that collapsed state.

If eigenvalue 0 of P has a multi-dimensional eigenspace, after measuring P=0, the state is projected onto that eigenspace. In quantum mechanics, when measuring an observable with a degenerate eigenvalue, the state collapses into the projection of the original state onto that eigenspace.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me tackle this problem in a methodical manner. The question involves calculating the probability of first obtaining 0 for the observable P and subsequently -1 for the observable Q when measured immediately after. The system initially exists in the state represented by the column vector (-1, 2, 1).

To start, I must recall the principles of quantum measurement. Observing an observable causes the system to collapse into one of the observable's operator's eigenstates. The likelihood of this occurrence is determined by projecting the initial state onto that eigenstate. If a second observable is measured right after, the system is already in the first measurement’s eigenstate, affecting the second measurement's probability based on the initial collapse.

In this scenario, the observables P and Q are represented by matrices. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the matrices for P and Q are correctly identified. Let me denote them.

The matrix for P is as follows:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, in matrix form, P is:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
      [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
      [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

The matrix for Q is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Thus, Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. This implies that Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, with standard basis vectors as corresponding eigenvectors.

However, P's matrix is not diagonal. To determine its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we need to diagonalize P, or at least identify its eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0, as the first measurement involves P, and the goal is to find the probability of obtaining 0.

The problem seeks the probability of obtaining 0 for P and -1 for Q during the respective measurements. First, measure P and obtain 0, then measure Q and obtain -1. The combined probability requires the probability of collapsing to P's eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, followed by collapsing to Q's eigenstate with eigenvalue -1.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Determine P's eigenstates for eigenvalue 0.
2. The initial state is given as the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Project this initial state onto the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0 to find the probability of collapsing into each. The question asks for the probability of obtaining 0 for P, regardless of the specific eigenstate. Yet, if there are multiple eigenstates with eigenvalue 0, all must be considered. After collapsing, measure Q to get -1.

If P has multiple eigenstates for eigenvalue 0, the state collapses into one, with each eigenstate’s probability determined by the squared magnitude of its projection. However, in measuring Q, the probability depends on which P eigenstate was settled into. If P's eigenvalue 0 is degenerate, the total probability aggregates the probability of collapsing to each P eigenstate with the probability of measuring -1 for Q from each of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, find P's eigenstates with eigenvalue 0, project the initial state onto their spanned subspace, express this as a combination of Q's eigenstates, and determine the probability of obtaining -1. Yet, the procedure is sequential: first measure P, collapse into a P eigenstate (with eigenvalue 0), then measure Q on that state.

If P's eigenvalue 0 possesses a multi-dimensional eigenspace, post-P measurement, the state projects onto that subspace. With a degenerate eigenvalue measurement, the system typically resorts to a state that linearly combines that eigenspace’s basis vectors. Nonetheless, measuring an observable with a degenerate eigenvalue results in a state collapse into the corresponding projection.

Find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n2. Project the initial state onto this eigenspace and normalize it (if necessary) to get the collapsed state after measurement.\n3. Then, find the probability that measuring Q on this collapsed state yields -1.\n\nBut actually, in terms of probability, the total probability is the squared norm of the projection of the initial state onto the intersection of the P=0 eigenspace and the Q=-1 eigenspace? Wait, no. Because the measurements are sequential. First, you project onto P=0 eigenspace, then from there, project onto Q=-1 eigenspace. So the total probability is the product of the probability of collapsing to P=0 times the probability of collapsing to Q=-1 from that P=0 state.\n\nBut let me check that.\n\nSuppose we have state |ψ>. Measure P, get 0 with probability ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||², where Π_P0 is the projection onto P=0 eigenspace. Then, the state becomes Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||. Then, measure Q on this state, probability of getting -1 is ||Π_Q-1 (Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||) ||². So the total probability is ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||² * ||Π_Q-1 (Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||) ||² = ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ> ||².\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> first onto P=0 and then onto Q=-1. Which is equivalent to projecting directly onto the intersection of those eigenspaces, but only if the projectors commute? Hmm, maybe not. But in this case, since the measurements are sequential, it's the product of the two probabilities.\n\nBut maybe in this case, since after the first measurement, the state is in the P=0 eigenspace, then the second measurement's probability is calculated within that subspace. So, the total probability is the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ>.\n\nBut to compute this, we need to compute Π_P0 |ψ> first, then apply Π_Q-1 to that, then take the squared norm.\n\nAlternatively, since Π_P0 and Π_Q-1 are projectors, the combined operator is Π_Q-1 Π_P0 Π_Q-1, but maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for sequential measurements: the probability is ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. Because first you project with Π_P0, then Π_Q-1. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. That's equivalent to the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. Because ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ ||².\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total probability is the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nFirst, find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, express the initial state in terms of those eigenstates. The probability of collapsing to P=0 is the squared norm of that component. Then, for each eigenstate of P=0, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1. Then, the total probability is the sum over each eigenstate of P=0 of |⟨ψ | P0_i⟩|² * |⟨ Q=-1 | P0_i ⟩|².\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since after measuring P=0, the state is a normalized vector in the P=0 eigenspace. Then, the probability of Q=-1 is the squared norm of the projection of this normalized state onto Q=-1 eigenspace.\n\nBut perhaps first, let me find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo, to find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0, we need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.\n\nSo, writing out the matrix equation:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0         [v1       [0\n1/√2, 0, 1/√2   *  v2    =  0\n0, 1/√2, 0]         v3]       0]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1. (1/√2) v2 = 0\n2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0\n3. (1/√2) v2 = 0\n\nFrom equations 1 and 3: v2 = 0.\n\nFrom equation 2: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T. So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1)^T (since v1 can be any scalar, but we can take the basis vector as (1, 0, -1)^T).\n\nWait, but let me check. If v1 is arbitrary, then the general solution is v1*(1, 0, -1)^T. So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Therefore, there is only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) for eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, the projection of the initial state onto the P=0 eigenspace is just the component of the initial state along (1, 0, -1)^T.\n\nSo, first, let's compute this projection.\n\nThe initial state is given as a column vector:\n\n|ψ> = [-1,\n         2,\n         1]\n\nSo, written as a vector: (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThe eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1). Let's denote this as |p0>.\n\nFirst, we need to normalize |p0> if necessary. The norm of |p0> is sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenstate is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nBut since we are projecting |ψ> onto |p0>, the projection is ⟨p0 | ψ⟩ |p0⟩.\n\nBut let's compute ⟨p0 | ψ⟩. Since |p0> is (1, 0, -1)^T, the inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.\n\nWait, but wait, if |p0> is not normalized, then the projection is (⟨p0 | ψ⟩ / ⟨p0 | p0⟩) |p0⟩. Since ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2, the projection vector is (-2 / 2) |p0⟩ = -1 * |p0⟩ = (-1, 0, 1)^T.\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the normalized |p0> for calculating probabilities. Let's do that.\n\nNormalized |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.\n\nThen, ⟨p0 | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.\n\nTherefore, the projection of |ψ> onto |p0> is (-√2) |p0> = (-√2)(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T = (-1, 0, 1)^T.\n\nThe norm squared of this projection is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² = (√2)² = 2.\n\nBut the total probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² = 2. Wait, but the norm squared of the initial state is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, but hold on. The projection's norm squared is 2, so the probability is 2 divided by the norm squared of the original state, which is 6. So, 2/6 = 1/3. That's the probability of measuring P=0.\n\nBut let's verify this:\n\nThe initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The eigenstate |p0> is (1, 0, -1). The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. The norm squared of |p0> is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = |(-2)|² / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2. But wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ * ⟨ψ | ψ⟩). Wait, no, actually, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩, but only if |p0> is normalized. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nIf the eigenstates are not normalized, then the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩). But if the eigenstates are normalized, then the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩. So, in our case, since |p0> is not normalized, ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩) ) = ( (-2)^2 ) / (2 * 6 ) = 4 / 12 = 1/3. Which matches the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if we first normalize |p0> to have unit length, then the normalized vector is |p0_normalized> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. Then, the inner product ⟨p0_normalized | ψ⟩ is (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. Then, the probability is |⟨p0_normalized | ψ⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2, but divided by the norm squared of |ψ>, which is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after the measurement, the state collapses to the normalized projection, which is (-1, 0, 1)^T divided by its norm. The norm of (-1, 0, 1)^T is sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}. So, the collapsed state is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T.\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this collapsed state. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). So, to measure Q=-1, the eigenstate is (0,0,1)^T. The probability of getting -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the collapsed state onto (0,0,1)^T.\n\nThe collapsed state is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T. The third component is 1/√2. Therefore, the projection onto (0,0,1) is (0,0,1/√2)^T, and the squared magnitude is |1/√2|^2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after having measured P=0 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 (probability of P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (probability of Q=-1 given P=0), which is 1/6.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, actually, when you measure P=0, the state collapses to (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T, and then measuring Q on that state gives -1 with probability |1/√2|² = 1/2. Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, 1/6 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check again step by step to make sure.\n\nFirst, initial state: (-1, 2, 1). Norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. The eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,-1). The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. Since the eigenvector is not normalized, we have to normalize it. The norm squared of (1,0,-1) is 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩) = (4)/(2*6) = 4/12 = 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen, after measurement, the state is (⟨p0 | ψ⟩ / ⟨p0 | p0⟩ ) |p0⟩ = (-2 / 2) (1,0,-1) = (-1, 0, 1). Then, normalized, it's (-1,0,1)/√2. So, (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2).\n\nNow, Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The probability of measuring -1 is the squared modulus of the third component of the collapsed state, since the third basis vector corresponds to eigenvalue -1. The third component is 1/√2, so squared is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/6.\n\nWait, but before finalizing, let me check if there's another approach or if I made a mistake in the eigenvector for P=0.\n\nGiven P's matrix:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nWe set up (P - 0I)v = 0:\n\n1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0\n\n2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1\n\n3. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0\n\nSo, the solution is v1 = t, v2 = 0, v3 = -t. So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) scaled by t. So, yes, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). So that part is correct.\n\nAnother check: When I calculated the inner product ⟨p0 | ψ⟩, with p0 as (1,0,-1) and ψ as (-1,2,1), got -1*1 + 0*2 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. Correct.\n\nProjection of ψ onto p0 is (-2)/(2) * p0 = -1*p0 = (-1,0,1). Then normalized, divide by sqrt(2), giving (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2). Then the probability for Q=-1 is |1/√2|² = 1/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, the answer should be 1/6.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it using the formula ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ ||² / || |ψ⟩ ||².\n\nFirst, Π_P0 is the projection onto the eigenstate (1,0,-1). The projection matrix is |p0⟩⟨p0| / ⟨p0 | p0⟩. Since |p0⟩ is (1,0,-1), ⟨p0| is (1,0,-1), so |p0⟩⟨p0| is a 3x3 matrix:\n\n[1*1, 1*0, 1*(-1);\n\n0*1, 0*0, 0*(-1);\n\n(-1)*1, (-1)*0, (-1)*(-1)]\n\nWhich is:\n\n[1, 0, -1;\n\n0, 0, 0;\n\n-1, 0, 1]\n\nThen, divided by ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2, so Π_P0 = (1/2)*[1,0,-1; 0,0,0; -1,0,1]\n\nThen, multiply Π_P0 by |ψ⟩ = (-1,2,1):\n\nFirst component: (1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = -1\n\nSecond component: 0\n\nThird component: (1/2)(-1*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1) = (1/2)(1 +1) = 1\n\nSo, Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (-1, 0, 1)^T, which matches our previous result.\n\nThen, Π_Q-1 is the projection onto the third basis vector (0,0,1). The projection matrix is:\n\n[0,0,0;\n\n0,0,0;\n\n0,0,1]\n\nSo, applying Π_Q-1 to Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (-1,0,1)^T:\n\n[0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,1] * (-1,0,1)^T = (0,0,1)^T * 1 = (0,0,1)^T. Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication:\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nSecond component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1\n\nTherefore, Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (0,0,1)^T. The norm squared of this is 1² = 1. But then, the original state |ψ⟩ has norm squared 6, so the total probability is ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩||² / || |ψ⟩ ||² = 1 / 6. Which matches the previous result of 1/6.\n\nTherefore, this confirms that the probability is 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390495, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5083, prompt_tokens=1176, total_tokens=6259, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the probability of getting 0 for observable \( P \) and -1 for observable \( Q \) when measured sequentially, we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenstates of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix for \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 0, -1)^T \). Normalizing this eigenvector gives \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \).

2. **Projection of the initial state onto the eigenstate of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The initial state is \( | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1)^T \).
   - The inner product with the normalized eigenstate \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \) is:
     \[
     \left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \bigg| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is:
     \[
     \left| -\sqrt{2} \right|^2 / 6 = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

3. **Collapsed state after measuring \( P = 0 \)**:
   - The collapsed state is \( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^T \).

4. **Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) from the collapsed state**:
   - The operator \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvector for -1 is \( (0, 0, 1)^T \).
   - The third component of the collapsed state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), so the probability is:
     \[
     \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

5. **Total probability**:
   - The combined probability is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

Thus, the probability of getting 0 for \( P \) and -1 for \( Q \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

f the original state onto the eigenspace, normalized. Then, if you measure another observable, you need to calculate the probability based on that projected state.

But in this problem, since after measuring P and getting 0, the state is in the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0. Then, when measuring Q, the probability of getting -1 would be the squared norm of the projection of this collapsed state onto the eigenspace of Q corresponding to -1.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
2. Project the initial state onto this eigenspace and normalize it (if necessary) to get the collapsed state after measurement.
3. Then, find the probability that measuring Q on this collapsed state yields -1.

But actually, in terms of probability, the total probability is the squared norm of the projection of the initial state onto the intersection of the P=0 eigenspace and the Q=-1 eigenspace? Wait, no. Because the measurements are sequential. First, you project onto P=0 eigenspace, then from there, project onto Q=-1 eigenspace. So the total probability is the product of the probability of collapsing to P=0 times the probability of collapsing to Q=-1 from that P=0 state.

But let me check that.

Suppose we have state |ψ>. Measure P, get 0 with probability ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||², where Π_P0 is the projection onto P=0 eigenspace. Then, the state becomes Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||. Then, measure Q on this state, probability of getting -1 is ||Π_Q-1 (Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||) ||². So the total probability is ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||² * ||Π_Q-1 (Π_P0 |ψ> / ||Π_P0 |ψ> ||) ||² = ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ> ||².

Therefore, the total probability is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> first onto P=0 and then onto Q=-1. Which is equivalent to projecting directly onto the intersection of those eigenspaces, but only if the projectors commute? Hmm, maybe not. But in this case, since the measurements are sequential, it's the product of the two probabilities.

But maybe in this case, since after the first measurement, the state is in the P=0 eigenspace, then the second measurement's probability is calculated within that subspace. So, the total probability is the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ>.

But to compute this, we need to compute Π_P0 |ψ> first, then apply Π_Q-1 to that, then take the squared norm.

Alternatively, since Π_P0 and Π_Q-1 are projectors, the combined operator is Π_Q-1 Π_P0 Π_Q-1, but maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, using the formula for sequential measurements: the probability is ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. Because first you project with Π_P0, then Π_Q-1. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. That's equivalent to the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩. Because ⟨ψ| Π_P0 Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ ||².

Yes, that's correct. So the total probability is the squared norm of Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩.

But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, express the initial state in terms of those eigenstates. The probability of collapsing to P=0 is the squared norm of that component. Then, for each eigenstate of P=0, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1. Then, the total probability is the sum over each eigenstate of P=0 of |⟨ψ | P0_i⟩|² * |⟨ Q=-1 | P0_i ⟩|².

But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since after measuring P=0, the state is a normalized vector in the P=0 eigenspace. Then, the probability of Q=-1 is the squared norm of the projection of this normalized state onto Q=-1 eigenspace.

But perhaps first, let me find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0.

So, to find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0, we need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.

So, writing out the matrix equation:

[0, 1/√2, 0         [v1       [0
1/√2, 0, 1/√2   *  v2    =  0
0, 1/√2, 0]         v3]       0]

So, the equations are:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0
2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0
3. (1/√2) v2 = 0

From equations 1 and 3: v2 = 0.

From equation 2: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T. So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1)^T (since v1 can be any scalar, but we can take the basis vector as (1, 0, -1)^T).

Wait, but let me check. If v1 is arbitrary, then the general solution is v1*(1, 0, -1)^T. So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Therefore, there is only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) for eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the projection of the initial state onto the P=0 eigenspace is just the component of the initial state along (1, 0, -1)^T.

So, first, let's compute this projection.

The initial state is given as a column vector:

|ψ> = [-1,
         2,
         1]

So, written as a vector: (-1, 2, 1).

The eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1). Let's denote this as |p0>.

First, we need to normalize |p0> if necessary. The norm of |p0> is sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenstate is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

But since we are projecting |ψ> onto |p0>, the projection is ⟨p0 | ψ⟩ |p0⟩.

But let's compute ⟨p0 | ψ⟩. Since |p0> is (1, 0, -1)^T, the inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Wait, but wait, if |p0> is not normalized, then the projection is (⟨p0 | ψ⟩ / ⟨p0 | p0⟩) |p0⟩. Since ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2, the projection vector is (-2 / 2) |p0⟩ = -1 * |p0⟩ = (-1, 0, 1)^T.

But maybe it's better to use the normalized |p0> for calculating probabilities. Let's do that.

Normalized |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Then, ⟨p0 | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the projection of |ψ> onto |p0> is (-√2) |p0> = (-√2)(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T = (-1, 0, 1)^T.

The norm squared of this projection is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² = (√2)² = 2.

But the total probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² = 2. Wait, but the norm squared of the initial state is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, but hold on. The projection's norm squared is 2, so the probability is 2 divided by the norm squared of the original state, which is 6. So, 2/6 = 1/3. That's the probability of measuring P=0.

But let's verify this:

The initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The eigenstate |p0> is (1, 0, -1). The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. The norm squared of |p0> is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = |(-2)|² / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2. But wait, no. Wait, the standard formula is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ * ⟨ψ | ψ⟩). Wait, no, actually, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩, but only if |p0> is normalized. Wait, let's clarify.

If the eigenstates are not normalized, then the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩). But if the eigenstates are normalized, then the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩. So, in our case, since |p0> is not normalized, ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩) ) = ( (-2)^2 ) / (2 * 6 ) = 4 / 12 = 1/3. Which matches the previous result.

Alternatively, if we first normalize |p0> to have unit length, then the normalized vector is |p0_normalized> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. Then, the inner product ⟨p0_normalized | ψ⟩ is (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. Then, the probability is |⟨p0_normalized | ψ⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2, but divided by the norm squared of |ψ>, which is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3. Same result.

Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to the normalized projection, which is (-1, 0, 1)^T divided by its norm. The norm of (-1, 0, 1)^T is sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}. So, the collapsed state is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T.

Now, we need to measure Q on this collapsed state. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). So, to measure Q=-1, the eigenstate is (0,0,1)^T. The probability of getting -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the collapsed state onto (0,0,1)^T.

The collapsed state is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T. The third component is 1/√2. Therefore, the projection onto (0,0,1) is (0,0,1/√2)^T, and the squared magnitude is |1/√2|^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after having measured P=0 is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 (probability of P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (probability of Q=-1 given P=0), which is 1/6.

But wait, wait. Wait, actually, when you measure P=0, the state collapses to (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T, and then measuring Q on that state gives -1 with probability |1/√2|² = 1/2. Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, 1/6 is the answer.

But let me check again step by step to make sure.

First, initial state: (-1, 2, 1). Norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. The eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,-1). The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. Since the eigenvector is not normalized, we have to normalize it. The norm squared of (1,0,-1) is 2. So, the probability is |⟨p0 | ψ⟩|² / (⟨p0 | p0⟩ ⟨ψ | ψ⟩) = (4)/(2*6) = 4/12 = 1/3. Correct.

Then, after measurement, the state is (⟨p0 | ψ⟩ / ⟨p0 | p0⟩ ) |p0⟩ = (-2 / 2) (1,0,-1) = (-1, 0, 1). Then, normalized, it's (-1,0,1)/√2. So, (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2).

Now, Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The probability of measuring -1 is the squared modulus of the third component of the collapsed state, since the third basis vector corresponds to eigenvalue -1. The third component is 1/√2, so squared is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

Wait, but before finalizing, let me check if there's another approach or if I made a mistake in the eigenvector for P=0.

Given P's matrix:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

We set up (P - 0I)v = 0:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1

3. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

So, the solution is v1 = t, v2 = 0, v3 = -t. So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) scaled by t. So, yes, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). So that part is correct.

Another check: When I calculated the inner product ⟨p0 | ψ⟩, with p0 as (1,0,-1) and ψ as (-1,2,1), got -1*1 + 0*2 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. Correct.

Projection of ψ onto p0 is (-2)/(2) * p0 = -1*p0 = (-1,0,1). Then normalized, divide by sqrt(2), giving (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2). Then the probability for Q=-1 is |1/√2|² = 1/2. Correct.

Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, the answer should be 1/6.

But just to make sure, let me compute it using the formula ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ ||² / || |ψ⟩ ||².

First, Π_P0 is the projection onto the eigenstate (1,0,-1). The projection matrix is |p0⟩⟨p0| / ⟨p0 | p0⟩. Since |p0⟩ is (1,0,-1), ⟨p0| is (1,0,-1), so |p0⟩⟨p0| is a 3x3 matrix:

[1*1, 1*0, 1*(-1);

0*1, 0*0, 0*(-1);

(-1)*1, (-1)*0, (-1)*(-1)]

Which is:

[1, 0, -1;

0, 0, 0;

-1, 0, 1]

Then, divided by ⟨p0 | p0⟩ = 2, so Π_P0 = (1/2)*[1,0,-1; 0,0,0; -1,0,1]

Then, multiply Π_P0 by |ψ⟩ = (-1,2,1):

First component: (1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = -1

Second component: 0

Third component: (1/2)(-1*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1) = (1/2)(1 +1) = 1

So, Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (-1, 0, 1)^T, which matches our previous result.

Then, Π_Q-1 is the projection onto the third basis vector (0,0,1). The projection matrix is:

[0,0,0;

0,0,0;

0,0,1]

So, applying Π_Q-1 to Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (-1,0,1)^T:

[0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,1] * (-1,0,1)^T = (0,0,1)^T * 1 = (0,0,1)^T. Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication:

First component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0

Second component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1

Therefore, Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩ = (0,0,1)^T. The norm squared of this is 1² = 1. But then, the original state |ψ⟩ has norm squared 6, so the total probability is ||Π_Q-1 Π_P0 |ψ⟩||² / || |ψ⟩ ||² = 1 / 6. Which matches the previous result of 1/6.

Therefore, this confirms that the probability is 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

Let me check.\n\nFirst, let\'s find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nThis is a symmetric matrix (Hermitian, as required for an observable), so it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.\n\nTo find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n| -λ        1/√2      0        |\n|1/√2      -λ       1/√2     | = 0\n|0         1/√2     -λ        |\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n\n-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0[...] = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/√2)[ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2\n\nThird term: 0\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ(λ² - 1) = 0\n\nSo eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. So the eigenvalue 0 is non-degenerate (as the matrix is 3x3 and we have three distinct eigenvalues). Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional. So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the unique eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) corresponding to λ=0.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTo find the eigenvector for λ=0, solve (P - 0I)v = 0 → Pv = 0.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v2 = 0\n\nRow 2: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as row 1, so v2 = 0\n\nFrom row 2: v1 = -v3\n\nSo eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Let\'s take v1 = 1 for simplicity, so eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2. So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nTherefore, the eigenstate corresponding to P=0 is |p0> = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2].\n\nNow, the initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). However, in quantum mechanics, physical states are normalized, so I assume that the given state is a vector in Hilbert space, but perhaps not normalized. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state. Wait, but perhaps the problem states the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1), which may or may not be normalized. The problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so perhaps they mean the actual vector, regardless of normalization. But in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. However, probabilities are calculated using squared magnitudes divided by the norm squared of the original vector. Wait, maybe the problem expects us to consider the vector as already normalized. Let me check the norm.\n\nThe norm squared of (-1, 2, 1) is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. Therefore, when calculating probabilities, we need to take into account the normalization. However, in some contexts, the state vectors are allowed to be non-normalized, and probabilities are computed by taking the squared modulus divided by the norm squared. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...". Typically, in such problems, unless specified, the state is assumed to be normalized. However, given that the components are integers and the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1, perhaps the problem expects us to work with the vector as given, but in that case, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize it. Let me proceed under the assumption that the state is not normalized and that we need to compute probabilities using the normalized version.\n\nTherefore, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nNow, the probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ> onto |p0>.\n\nThe projection is <p0|ψ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) · ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ) = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) - 1/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/3). Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nAfter the measurement, the state collapses to |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenstate corresponding to Q=-1 is the third standard basis vector (0, 0, 1), since Q\'s third diagonal element is -1.\n\nWait, let\'s confirm. The matrix Q is:\n\nQ = diag(1, 0, -1). Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1 (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -1 (third). Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to Q=-1 is e3 = (0, 0, 1).\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the collapsed state |p0> is the squared magnitude of the projection of |p0> onto e3.\n\nCompute <e3|p0> = (0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2.\n\nMagnitude squared is (1/2).\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after having measured P=0 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you perform successive measurements, the first measurement collapses the state into the eigenstate, and the second measurement\'s probability is based on that collapsed state. Therefore, the total probability is indeed the probability of collapsing to |p0> times the probability of collapsing to Q=-1 from |p0>.\n\nAlternatively, since after collapsing to |p0>, the state is |p0>, and then the probability of Q=-1 is |<e3|p0>|² = 1/2.\n\nThus, total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the steps to ensure no mistakes.\n\nFirst, the initial state |ψ> is (-1,2,1) with norm sqrt(6), so normalized to (1/√6)(-1,2,1). Then, the eigenstate |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The inner product <p0|ψ> is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/√3. The magnitude squared is (1/3), correct.\n\nThen, the collapsed state is |p0>, so when we measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is |<e3|p0>|² = |(-1/√2)|² = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability is indeed 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach where you first project the state onto the P=0 eigenstate, then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that projection. But since after measurement, the state is exactly |p0>, then the Q measurement is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, some might model it as the joint probability, but since the measurements are sequential, it\'s indeed the product of the two probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the projection operator. The probability could be written as:\n\n|<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>\n\nBut since we\'re dealing with normalized states, the total probability would be |<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|². But this would actually be (|<p0|ψ>|²) * (|<e3|p0>|²), which is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for sequential measurements: the probability is the expectation of the projection operator for Q=-1 after applying the projection operator for P=0. So, it would be || Π_Q=-1 Π_P=0 |ψ> ||² / || |ψ> ||², where Π denotes projection operators. But since we\'re dealing with normalized states, the denominator would be 1 if the state is normalized. Wait, but in this case, the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the initial state is given as (-1,2,1), which has norm sqrt(6).

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for observable \( P \) and then -1 for observable \( Q \), we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:
   - The matrix \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \).
   - The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue \( 0 \) is found by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). This gives the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \).

2. **Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:
   - The initial state is \( \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \) (normalized).
   - The projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is the magnitude squared of this projection: \( \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)**:
   - The collapsed state after measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \).
   - The matrix \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is \( (0, 0, 1) \).
   - The projection of \( \mathbf{v} \) onto this eigenvector is:
     \[
     \langle (0, 0, 1) | \mathbf{v} \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The probability is the magnitude squared of this projection: \( \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the product of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

Thus, the probability of getting 0 for \( P \) and -1 for \( Q \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).

Then, the subsequent measurement of Q is performed on this projected state.

But perhaps in this case, the eigenvalue 0 for P is non-degenerate. Let me check.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

This is a symmetric matrix (Hermitian, as required for an observable), so it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

The characteristic equation is:

| -λ        1/√2      0        |
|1/√2      -λ       1/√2     | = 0
|0         1/√2     -λ        |

Expanding the determinant:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0[...] = 0

Simplify term by term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2)[ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2

Third term: 0

Thus, the equation becomes:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ(λ² - 1) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. So the eigenvalue 0 is non-degenerate (as the matrix is 3x3 and we have three distinct eigenvalues). Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional. So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the unique eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) corresponding to λ=0.

So first, find the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0.

To find the eigenvector for λ=0, solve (P - 0I)v = 0 → Pv = 0.

So:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as row 1, so v2 = 0

From row 2: v1 = -v3

So eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Let's take v1 = 1 for simplicity, so eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.

The norm squared is 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2. So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Therefore, the eigenstate corresponding to P=0 is |p0> = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2].

Now, the initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). However, in quantum mechanics, physical states are normalized, so I assume that the given state is a vector in Hilbert space, but perhaps not normalized. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state. Wait, but perhaps the problem states the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1), which may or may not be normalized. The problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so perhaps they mean the actual vector, regardless of normalization. But in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. However, probabilities are calculated using squared magnitudes divided by the norm squared of the original vector. Wait, maybe the problem expects us to consider the vector as already normalized. Let me check the norm.

The norm squared of (-1, 2, 1) is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. Therefore, when calculating probabilities, we need to take into account the normalization. However, in some contexts, the state vectors are allowed to be non-normalized, and probabilities are computed by taking the squared modulus divided by the norm squared. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...". Typically, in such problems, unless specified, the state is assumed to be normalized. However, given that the components are integers and the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1, perhaps the problem expects us to work with the vector as given, but in that case, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize it. Let me proceed under the assumption that the state is not normalized and that we need to compute probabilities using the normalized version.

Therefore, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

Now, the probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ> onto |p0>.

The projection is <p0|ψ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) · ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ) = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) - 1/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.

The magnitude squared is (1/3). Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

After the measurement, the state collapses to |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenstate corresponding to Q=-1 is the third standard basis vector (0, 0, 1), since Q's third diagonal element is -1.

Wait, let's confirm. The matrix Q is:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1). Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1 (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -1 (third). Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to Q=-1 is e3 = (0, 0, 1).

Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the collapsed state |p0> is the squared magnitude of the projection of |p0> onto e3.

Compute <e3|p0> = (0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2.

Magnitude squared is (1/2).

Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after having measured P=0 is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you perform successive measurements, the first measurement collapses the state into the eigenstate, and the second measurement's probability is based on that collapsed state. Therefore, the total probability is indeed the probability of collapsing to |p0> times the probability of collapsing to Q=-1 from |p0>.

Alternatively, since after collapsing to |p0>, the state is |p0>, and then the probability of Q=-1 is |<e3|p0>|² = 1/2.

Thus, total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, let me recheck the steps to ensure no mistakes.

First, the initial state |ψ> is (-1,2,1) with norm sqrt(6), so normalized to (1/√6)(-1,2,1). Then, the eigenstate |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The inner product <p0|ψ> is:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/√3. The magnitude squared is (1/3), correct.

Then, the collapsed state is |p0>, so when we measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is |<e3|p0>|² = |(-1/√2)|² = 1/2.

Therefore, the combined probability is indeed 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But let me check if there's another approach where you first project the state onto the P=0 eigenstate, then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that projection. But since after measurement, the state is exactly |p0>, then the Q measurement is straightforward.

Alternatively, some might model it as the joint probability, but since the measurements are sequential, it's indeed the product of the two probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps using the projection operator. The probability could be written as:

|<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>

But since we're dealing with normalized states, the total probability would be |<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|². But this would actually be (|<p0|ψ>|²) * (|<e3|p0>|²), which is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Alternatively, using the formula for sequential measurements: the probability is the expectation of the projection operator for Q=-1 after applying the projection operator for P=0. So, it would be || Π_Q=-1 Π_P=0 |ψ> ||² / || |ψ> ||², where Π denotes projection operators. But since we're dealing with normalized states, the denominator would be 1 if the state is normalized. Wait, but in this case, the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the initial state is given as (-1,2,1), which has norm sqrt(6). So, the total probability would be || Π_Q=-1 Π_P=0 |ψ> ||² divided by || |ψ> ||².

But let's compute this.

First, project |ψ> onto P=0. The projection operator Π_P=0 is |p0><p0|. Then, apply Π_Q=-1, which is |e3><e3|. Then, the vector is |e3><e3|p0><p0|ψ>.

The norm squared of this vector is |<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|². So the probability is |<e3|p0>|² * |<p0|ψ>|² divided by <ψ|ψ>.

Which is (1/2) * (1/3) divided by (6/6) = (1/6)/1 = 1/6.

But since the initial state's norm squared is 6, if we don't normalize it, the calculation would be:

|<e3|p0><p0|ψ>|² = |(-1/√2)(-1/√3)|² Wait, let me compute:

Wait, <p0|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2 -1/√2)/√6? Wait, perhaps I confused the normalization.

Wait, let's redo this without normalizing the initial state. Let the initial state be |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). Then, the projection onto |p0> is <p0|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2. Then, the norm squared of this projection is | -√2 |² = 2. The norm squared of |ψ> is 6. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 2/6 = 1/3, which matches the previous result.

Then, after collapsing to |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), the projection onto Q=-1 (i.e., e3) is <e3|p0> = -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. Therefore, total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So regardless of whether we normalize the state first or account for normalization in the probabilities, we arrive at the same answer.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

However, in such case, if the eigenspace is multi-dimensional, the state after measurement is not uniquely determined but is a vector within that eigenspace.

The total probability is the product of the probabilities from steps 3 and 6.\n\nWait, actually, the process is sequential. First, the probability of getting 0 for P is step 3. Then, given that we have collapsed to the eigenstate of P, the probability of measuring -1 for Q is step 6. Therefore, the total probability is the product of these two probabilities.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. The first probability is the probability of collapsing to the eigenstate of P (0) from the initial state. Then, given that the system is in that eigenstate, the probability of measuring Q as -1 is the squared modulus of the projection of that eigenstate onto the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1. Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since after collapsing to P\'s eigenstate, the probability of Q being -1 is just the inner product squared between P\'s eigenstate (normalized) and Q\'s eigenstate (for -1).

So, they can be written as (a, 0, -a), where a is a scalar.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1) (taking a=1). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let\'s check:\n\nFirst, compute the norm of (1, 0, -1). The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, so norm is √2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nTherefore, if we measure P and get 0, the system collapses to this vector.\n\nNow, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let\'s compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector.\n\nThe projection coefficient is the inner product of the initial state and the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo, inner product c = (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2.\n\nTherefore, the projection vector is c times the normalized eigenvector: (-√2)(1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = (-1, 0, 1).\n\nThe squared norm of this projection is |c|² = (-√2)^2 = 2. However, the squared norm of the initial state is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is |c|² / ||initial state||²? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the probability is |c|² divided by the squared norm of the initial state. Wait, but the initial state is given as a column vector. However, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. But here, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let\'s check its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state is not normalized. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized. But here, the state is given as a non-normalized vector. However, when computing probabilities, we need to use the normalized state. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the state vector, but not normalized. Wait, but in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1), and we need to normalize it first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where the state is not necessarily normalized, and the probabilities are computed as |<eigenstate|state>|^2 / |state|^2. But in standard quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the state vector, and we need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, but the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", so in that case, the state is a vector, but it\'s not normalized. So, first, we need to normalize it.\n\nTherefore, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut let\'s check this. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is √6. Therefore, yes, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut in the problem statement, when they say "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", do they mean that the state is this vector, and we need to use it as is, or normalize it? This is a crucial point. If the vector is already normalized, then probabilities are calculated directly. If not, we need to normalize it first.\n\nBut since the problem says "the state of a system", in quantum mechanics, states are required to be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the normalized state. But wait, the norm squared is 6, so unless the problem is in a different convention, perhaps not. However, in physics, state vectors must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given vector as the state vector, regardless of its norm, but when calculating probabilities, we have to divide by its norm squared.\n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps check standard practice. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized. If a state is given as a non-normalized vector, the probabilities are calculated by taking the squared modulus of the projection divided by the squared norm of the vector.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, since the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is not normalized, when calculating probabilities, we need to compute the projection onto the eigenstate, take the squared modulus, and divide by the squared norm of the original state (which is 6). Alternatively, first, normalize the state vector, and then compute the inner product with the eigenstate.\n\nWait, let\'s think again. If the state is given as a vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1), then the probability of measuring eigenvalue p is |<p|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>, where <p|ψ> is the inner product of the eigenstate |p> with |ψ>, and <ψ|ψ> is the norm squared of |ψ>.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since the state is not normalized, we have to divide by <ψ|ψ> = 6.\n\nAlternatively, if we normalize the state first, then compute |<p|ψ_normalized>|².\n\nEither way, the result is the same. Let\'s proceed with that.\n\nSo, first, compute the inner product between the given state and the normalized eigenstate of P=0.\n\nThe normalized eigenstate of P=0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nGiven state is (-1, 2, 1). The inner product is:\n\n(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2.\n\nTherefore, the squared modulus of this inner product is (√2)^2 = 2.\n\nBut since the original state is not normalized, the probability is this squared modulus divided by the norm squared of the original state, which is 6. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if we first normalize the state vector:\n\nNormalized state: (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)\n\nInner product with eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):\n\n(1/√6)(-1)(1/√2) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1/√2) = ( -1/(√6√2) ) + 0 + ( -1/(√6√2) ) = -2/(√12) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nSquared modulus is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Hence, the probability is 1/3. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of whether we normalize first or not, as long as we handle the normalization correctly, we get the same probability.\n\nTherefore, probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nThe operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue 1 corresponds to (1, 0, 0), eigenvalue 0 corresponds to (0, 1, 0), and eigenvalue -1 corresponds to (0, 0, 1).\n\nTherefore, the eigenstate for Q=-1 is the vector (0, 0, 1). So, to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the system is in the state (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), we take the inner product of this state with (0, 0, 1), then square the modulus.\n\nThe inner product is (1/√2)(0) + 0*0 + (-1/√2)(1) = -1/√2. The squared modulus is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the probability of first measuring P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of measuring Q=-1 given the state collapsed to P=0\'s eigenstate (1/2). Therefore, total probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\nBut let me verify this step again.\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the system is in the state (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). The probability is |<Q=-1| P=0 eigenstate>|² = |(0,0,1)·(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)|² = | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. Therefore, yes, the probability is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the measurements are sequential, perhaps we can model the combined process. However, in quantum mechanics, the probability of two successive measurements is the product of the probabilities, given that the first measurement collapses the state. Therefore, the answer should indeed be 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the projection operators. The projection operator for P=0 is |v><v|, where v is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The projection operator for Q=-1 is |w><w|, where w is (0,0,1). The combined process is applying the Q projection after the P projection. Therefore, the combined probability is || |w><w| |v><v| |ψ> ||² / || |v><v| |ψ> ||² * || |v><v| |ψ> ||² / || |ψ> ||².\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, since after measuring P=0, the state is |v>, then the probability of Q=-1 is |<w|v>|². Therefore, the total probability is |<v|ψ>|² * |<w|v>|² / |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||²? Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nThe probability is given by the squared norm of the vector obtained by first projecting onto P=0 and then onto Q=-1. That is:\n\nProbability = || Proj_Q=-1 Proj_P=0 |ψ> ||²\n\nBut since Proj_P=0 is |v><v| and Proj_Q=-1 is |w><w|, then the combined projection is |w><w|v><v|ψ>. The squared norm is |<w|v><v|ψ>|² = |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|².\n\nTherefore, the total probability is |<v|ψ>|² * |<w|v>|².\n\nBut in terms of the state being normalized or not, if |ψ> is not normalized, then the total probability is (|<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||²) * (|<w|v>|²). Wait, but in this case, after the first projection, the state is |v><v|ψ>, which is not normalized. The norm squared of that is |<v|ψ>|². Then, projecting onto |w> gives |<w|v><v|ψ>|². Therefore, the total probability is |<w|v><v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||², which is |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². However, if we first normalize |ψ>, then it\'s |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ_normalized>|².\n\nBut in our case, since the initial state is not normalized, we have:\n\nTotal probability = |<w|v><v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>\n\nWhich is equal to |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>\n\nWhich is the same as (|<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>) * |<w|v>|²\n\nWhich is (probability of P=0) * (probability of Q=-1 given state |v>)\n\nWhich is exactly the same as before: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\nBut let me check all steps once again to be sure.\n\n1. Normalize the initial state: given as (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\n2. Find eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0: solved earlier, it\'s (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\n3. Compute inner product between normalized initial state and P=0 eigenstate:\n\n(1/√6)(-1)(1/√2) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1/√2) = (-1)/(√6√2) + 0 + (-1)/(√6√2) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.\n\nSquared modulus: (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. So, probability of P=0 is 1/3.\n\n4. After collapse, the state is the eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\n5. Compute inner product of this eigenstate with Q=-1 eigenstate (0,0,1):\n\n(1/√2)(0) + 0*0 + (-1/√2)(1) = -1/√2. Squared modulus: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So, probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\n6. Multiply the two probabilities: (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn\'t normalize the initial state, but used the given vector as is:\n\n1. Compute inner product of (-1, 2, 1) with P=0 eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):\n\n(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/√2) = -√2.\n\nSquared modulus: 2.\n\n2. Divide by the norm squared of the initial state (6): 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n3. Then, the same as before: probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\n4. Total probability: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of normalization approach, the answer is 1/6.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390905, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5626, prompt_tokens=1049, total_tokens=6675, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q, we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of P**:
   - The matrix for P is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is found by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \):
     - The eigenvector is \( \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Projection of Initial State onto P=0 Eigenvector**:
   - The initial state is \( \mathbf{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The normalized initial state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The inner product of the normalized initial state with the eigenvector of P=0 is:
     \[
     \left\langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{\psi} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( -1 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 1 \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability of measuring P=0 is the squared modulus of this inner product:
     \[
     \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

3. **Probability of Measuring Q=-1 after P=0**:
   - The eigenstate for Q=-1 is \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The collapsed state after measuring P=0 is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The inner product of this collapsed state with the eigenstate of Q=-1 is:
     \[
     \left\langle \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \bigg| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared modulus of this inner product:
     \[
     \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

4. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the product of the probabilities of measuring P=0 and Q=-1:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

The probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

However, for the purposes of subsequent measurements, the state after the first measurement is the normalized projection onto the eigenspace. Thus, to compute the probability of the second measurement, we can consider the state after the first measurement as being in that subspace. However, depending on the order, perhaps we need to consider the projection onto the eigenstate of P first, then onto the eigenstate of Q.

But perhaps step-by-step:

1. Find the eigenstate(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenstate(s).

3. The probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared norm of this projection.

4. Then, the state collapses into the normalized projection (i.e., the eigenstate(s) of P with eigenvalue 0, normalized).

5. Then, measure Q on this collapsed state. The probability of getting -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of this collapsed state onto the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.

But if the eigenvalue 0 of P is degenerate (i.e., multiple eigenstates), the projection would be a subspace, and the collapsed state is a normalized vector within that subspace. However, in such case, if the eigenspace is multi-dimensional, the state after measurement is not uniquely determined but is a vector within that eigenspace. Therefore, when calculating the subsequent measurement of Q, we need to consider the entire subspace.

However, perhaps in this problem, the eigenvalue 0 for P is non-degenerate. Let me check that.

First, let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Given the matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, to find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

Compute the characteristic equation:

| -λ         1/√2        0         |
|1/√2       -λ        1/√2        |
| 0         1/√2       -λ          |

The determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0[ ... ]

Wait, expanding the determinant:

= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] + 0

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2)

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2)

= -λ³ + λ

Therefore, the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0

Which factors as -λ(λ² - 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1

Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

So, the eigenvalue 0 is non-degenerate (since in 3x3 matrix, we have three distinct eigenvalues here). Therefore, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional.

Therefore, when we measure P and get 0, the system collapses to the unique eigenstate associated with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Compute the projection of the initial state (-1, 2, 1) onto this eigenvector.

3. The probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared norm of this projection.

4. Then, the collapsed state is the normalized eigenvector.

5. Compute the projection of this normalized eigenvector onto the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1.

6. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the squared norm of this projection.

7. The total probability is the product of the probabilities from steps 3 and 6.

Wait, actually, the process is sequential. First, the probability of getting 0 for P is step 3. Then, given that we have collapsed to the eigenstate of P, the probability of measuring -1 for Q is step 6. Therefore, the total probability is the product of these two probabilities.

But wait, actually, no. The first probability is the probability of collapsing to the eigenstate of P (0) from the initial state. Then, given that the system is in that eigenstate, the probability of measuring Q as -1 is the squared modulus of the projection of that eigenstate onto the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1. Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities.

Alternatively, since after collapsing to P's eigenstate, the probability of Q being -1 is just the inner product squared between P's eigenstate (normalized) and Q's eigenstate (for -1). Therefore, total probability is (prob of P=0) * (prob of Q=-1 given state is P=0 eigenstate).

But let me verify.

First, find the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.

So, solve (P - 0I)v = 0 => Pv = 0.

So, the equations are:

Row 1: (0)v1 + (1/√2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + (0)v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Row 3: (0)v1 + (1/√2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0 => same as row 1: redundant.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. So, they can be written as (a, 0, -a), where a is a scalar.

Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1) (taking a=1). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let's check:

First, compute the norm of (1, 0, -1). The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, so norm is √2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Therefore, if we measure P and get 0, the system collapses to this vector.

Now, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector.

The projection coefficient is the inner product of the initial state and the normalized eigenvector.

So, inner product c = (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the projection vector is c times the normalized eigenvector: (-√2)(1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = (-1, 0, 1).

The squared norm of this projection is |c|² = (-√2)^2 = 2. However, the squared norm of the initial state is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is |c|² / ||initial state||²? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the probability is |c|² divided by the squared norm of the initial state. Wait, but the initial state is given as a column vector. However, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. But here, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's check its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state is not normalized. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

But in the problem statement, it says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized. But here, the state is given as a non-normalized vector. However, when computing probabilities, we need to use the normalized state. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the state vector, but not normalized. Wait, but in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1), and we need to normalize it first.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where the state is not necessarily normalized, and the probabilities are computed as |<eigenstate|state>|^2 / |state|^2. But in standard quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the state vector, and we need to normalize it first.

Wait, but the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", so in that case, the state is a vector, but it's not normalized. So, first, we need to normalize it.

Therefore, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

But let's check this. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is √6. Therefore, yes, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

But in the problem statement, when they say "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", do they mean that the state is this vector, and we need to use it as is, or normalize it? This is a crucial point. If the vector is already normalized, then probabilities are calculated directly. If not, we need to normalize it first.

But since the problem says "the state of a system", in quantum mechanics, states are required to be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is already the normalized state. But wait, the norm squared is 6, so unless the problem is in a different convention, perhaps not. However, in physics, state vectors must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given vector as the state vector, regardless of its norm, but when calculating probabilities, we have to divide by its norm squared.

But to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps check standard practice. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized. If a state is given as a non-normalized vector, the probabilities are calculated by taking the squared modulus of the projection divided by the squared norm of the vector.

Therefore, in this problem, since the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is not normalized, when calculating probabilities, we need to compute the projection onto the eigenstate, take the squared modulus, and divide by the squared norm of the original state (which is 6). Alternatively, first, normalize the state vector, and then compute the inner product with the eigenstate.

Wait, let's think again. If the state is given as a vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1), then the probability of measuring eigenvalue p is |<p|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>, where <p|ψ> is the inner product of the eigenstate |p> with |ψ>, and <ψ|ψ> is the norm squared of |ψ>.

Therefore, in this case, since the state is not normalized, we have to divide by <ψ|ψ> = 6.

Alternatively, if we normalize the state first, then compute |<p|ψ_normalized>|².

Either way, the result is the same. Let's proceed with that.

So, first, compute the inner product between the given state and the normalized eigenstate of P=0.

The normalized eigenstate of P=0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Given state is (-1, 2, 1). The inner product is:

(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the squared modulus of this inner product is (√2)^2 = 2.

But since the original state is not normalized, the probability is this squared modulus divided by the norm squared of the original state, which is 6. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 2/6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if we first normalize the state vector:

Normalized state: (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)

Inner product with eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):

(1/√6)(-1)(1/√2) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1/√2) = ( -1/(√6√2) ) + 0 + ( -1/(√6√2) ) = -2/(√12) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3

Squared modulus is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Hence, the probability is 1/3. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of whether we normalize first or not, as long as we handle the normalization correctly, we get the same probability.

Therefore, probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting -1.

The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue 1 corresponds to (1, 0, 0), eigenvalue 0 corresponds to (0, 1, 0), and eigenvalue -1 corresponds to (0, 0, 1).

Therefore, the eigenstate for Q=-1 is the vector (0, 0, 1). So, to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the system is in the state (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), we take the inner product of this state with (0, 0, 1), then square the modulus.

The inner product is (1/√2)(0) + 0*0 + (-1/√2)(1) = -1/√2. The squared modulus is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the probability of first measuring P=0 (1/3) multiplied by the probability of measuring Q=-1 given the state collapsed to P=0's eigenstate (1/2). Therefore, total probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

But let me verify this step again.

After measuring P=0, the system is in the state (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). The probability is |<Q=-1| P=0 eigenstate>|² = |(0,0,1)·(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)|² = | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. Therefore, yes, the probability is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, since the measurements are sequential, perhaps we can model the combined process. However, in quantum mechanics, the probability of two successive measurements is the product of the probabilities, given that the first measurement collapses the state. Therefore, the answer should indeed be 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Alternatively, if we consider the projection operators. The projection operator for P=0 is |v><v|, where v is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The projection operator for Q=-1 is |w><w|, where w is (0,0,1). The combined process is applying the Q projection after the P projection. Therefore, the combined probability is || |w><w| |v><v| |ψ> ||² / || |v><v| |ψ> ||² * || |v><v| |ψ> ||² / || |ψ> ||².

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, since after measuring P=0, the state is |v>, then the probability of Q=-1 is |<w|v>|². Therefore, the total probability is |<v|ψ>|² * |<w|v>|² / |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||²? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

The probability is given by the squared norm of the vector obtained by first projecting onto P=0 and then onto Q=-1. That is:

Probability = || Proj_Q=-1 Proj_P=0 |ψ> ||²

But since Proj_P=0 is |v><v| and Proj_Q=-1 is |w><w|, then the combined projection is |w><w|v><v|ψ>. The squared norm is |<w|v><v|ψ>|² = |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|².

Therefore, the total probability is |<v|ψ>|² * |<w|v>|².

But in terms of the state being normalized or not, if |ψ> is not normalized, then the total probability is (|<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||²) * (|<w|v>|²). Wait, but in this case, after the first projection, the state is |v><v|ψ>, which is not normalized. The norm squared of that is |<v|ψ>|². Then, projecting onto |w> gives |<w|v><v|ψ>|². Therefore, the total probability is |<w|v><v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||², which is |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². However, if we first normalize |ψ>, then it's |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ_normalized>|².

But in our case, since the initial state is not normalized, we have:

Total probability = |<w|v><v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>

Which is equal to |<w|v>|² |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>

Which is the same as (|<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>) * |<w|v>|²

Which is (probability of P=0) * (probability of Q=-1 given state |v>)

Which is exactly the same as before: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/6.

But let me check all steps once again to be sure.

1. Normalize the initial state: given as (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

2. Find eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0: solved earlier, it's (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

3. Compute inner product between normalized initial state and P=0 eigenstate:

(1/√6)(-1)(1/√2) + (1/√6)(2)(0) + (1/√6)(1)(-1/√2) = (-1)/(√6√2) + 0 + (-1)/(√6√2) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3.

Squared modulus: (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. So, probability of P=0 is 1/3.

4. After collapse, the state is the eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

5. Compute inner product of this eigenstate with Q=-1 eigenstate (0,0,1):

(1/√2)(0) + 0*0 + (-1/√2)(1) = -1/√2. Squared modulus: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So, probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

6. Multiply the two probabilities: (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Therefore, the final answer is 1/6.

Alternatively, if we didn't normalize the initial state, but used the given vector as is:

1. Compute inner product of (-1, 2, 1) with P=0 eigenstate (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):

(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/√2) = -√2.

Squared modulus: 2.

2. Divide by the norm squared of the initial state (6): 2/6 = 1/3.

3. Then, the same as before: probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

4. Total probability: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So, same result.

Therefore, regardless of normalization approach, the answer is 1/6.

Hence, the probability is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
