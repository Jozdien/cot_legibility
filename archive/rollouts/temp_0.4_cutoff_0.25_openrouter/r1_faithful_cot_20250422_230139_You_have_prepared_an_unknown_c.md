# Original Question

You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.

The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Suggests an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid. However, the molecular formula C₆H₁₂O₂ (carboxylic acid) only allows one degree of unsaturation, conflicting with the requirement for both a C=O and C=C. Thus, this peak might instead arise from another source (e.g., hydrogen bonding in a conjugated system).
   - **Peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹**: Indicate a carbonyl group (C=O, likely ester) and a conjugated C=C bond, respectively.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Vinyl hydrogens**: Confirm the presence of a double bond (C=C), contributing to the second degree of unsaturation.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - **Fragment at m/z = 45**: Corresponds to CH₃CH₂O⁺ (ethoxy group), supporting the presence of an ester functional group.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - For **C₆H₁₀O₂**: (2×6 + 2 − 10)/2 = 2. This accounts for both the C=O (ester) and C=C bonds.

5. **Structural Rationale**:
   - The compound is likely an **α,β-unsaturated ester** (e.g., ethyl propenoate derivative), where the conjugated C=C and ester carbonyl explain the IR peaks. The ethoxy group accounts for the m/z = 45 fragment. The broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-H stretches in the conjugated system or residual solvent, as esters lack O-H groups.

**Conclusion**: The chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A broad peak around that region usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests it's a strong hydrogen bond, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid rather than an alcohol because carboxylic acids have stronger hydrogen bonding. But wait, the problem mentions it's a very broad absorption. Alcohols can have broad peaks too, especially if they're in a concentrated solution or if there's a lot of hydrogen bonding. But carboxylic acids typically have a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. However, the options given don't include a carboxylic acid unless one of the formulas is a carboxylic acid. Let me check:

C6H12O would be something like an alcohol or ether. The molecular formula for a carboxylic acid with 6 carbons would be C6H12O2 (since carboxylic acids are RCOOH, so general formula CnH2nO2). For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the other strong absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the O-H stretch. So that fits. But then there's another peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. That's lower than the typical carbonyl. 1650 cm⁻¹ could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe an ester? Wait, esters also have carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. But if there's another peak at 1650, maybe a C=C stretch. The C=C stretch in alkenes is around 1640-1680 cm⁻¹. So if there's a peak at 1650, that might indicate a double bond. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid) and a double bond.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are hydrogens attached to a double bond. So that supports the presence of a C=C group. So combining the IR data: O-H (broad at 3000), C=O (1700), and C=C (1650). Wait, but the 1650 could also be an aromatic ring? If there's an aromatic ring, the C=C stretching in aromatic rings is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, so maybe not. The 1650 is more likely an isolated double bond. So maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like acrylic acid but with more carbons. But the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, which would fit a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. For each formula:

C6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, or a triple bond.

C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Same as above.

C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

But wait, the compound has a double bond (from NMR vinyl Hs) and a carbonyl group (from IR 1700). Each double bond is one degree of unsaturation. So two double bonds would be two degrees. But the O in the formula doesn't affect degrees of unsaturation. So let's check:

If the compound has a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C, that's two degrees of unsaturation. So the molecular formula must have two degrees. Let's see which formulas have two degrees:

C6H10O: Degrees=2

C6H10O2: Degrees=2

C6H12O: Degrees=1

C6H12O2: Degrees=1

So the compound must be either C6H10O or C6H10O2. Wait, but wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H. If it's a carboxylic acid (which would require two oxygens, O2), then the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 would be (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. But we need two degrees (C=O and C=C). That would require the formula to have two degrees, which would be C6H10O2 (degrees= (14-10)/2=2). So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. But wait, carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. For n=5, it would be C5H10O2, but the formula here is C6H10O2. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with 6 carbons. For example, 2-pentenoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's 6 carbons? Let's see: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH is 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H8O2. Wait, no. Let me count: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. That's 6 carbons. The COOH is -COOH, which is two oxygens. The formula would be C6H8O2. But the options are C6H10O2. Hmm. Maybe the compound is a cyclic carboxylic acid with a double bond? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Let's think again.

The broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol. But then the O-H stretch for alcohols is usually broad but maybe not as broad as carboxylic acids. However, if the alcohol is in a situation with strong hydrogen bonding, maybe it's a phenol. Phenols have O-H stretches around 3300-3500, but they can be broad. But the peak here is at 3000, which is lower. Wait, maybe it's an -NH group? But the problem doesn't mention nitrogen in the formulas. The options are all C, H, O. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is an -OH from a carboxylic acid, which would require two oxygens. So the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 is 1. But we need two degrees (C=O and C=C). That's a problem. So maybe the compound has a ring and a carbonyl? For example, a cyclic ketone. But then the IR would have a carbonyl at ~1700, and the ring might have C-H stretches. But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, not a ring. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, requiring two degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, the formula must have two degrees of unsaturation, which would be C6H10O or C6H10O2.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment at m/z=45. Common fragments at 45 could be COOH (which is 45, but COOH is 45: C=O-OH is 12 +16 +16 +1=45? Wait, COOH is a carboxylic acid group. The molecular weight of COOH is 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) +1 (H) = 45. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, losing the rest of the molecule would leave a COOH+ fragment? But wait, in mass spectrometry, the molecular ion might lose a fragment. For example, if the compound is RCOOH, then a common fragment is the loss of the alkyl group, giving the COOH+ ion at 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3CH2O+ (if it's an ester), but that's 45 as well. Wait, CH2CH2O+ would be 45? Let's calculate: CH3CH2O+ would be 12*2 +1*5 +16 =24+5+16=45. So if there's an ethyl ester group, maybe. But the presence of a fragment at 45 could indicate either a carboxylic acid (COOH) or an ester (like OCH2CH3). But if the IR shows a broad O-H, that would support the carboxylic acid. So if the fragment is COOH (45), then the compound is a carboxylic acid, which would have the formula C6H12O2. But wait, earlier we thought that the degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 is 1, but we need two (C=O and C=C). So there's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹) and no O-H, so the broad peak at 3000 would have to be something else. But esters don't have O-H. Wait, unless there's another hydroxyl group. But the options don't include three oxygens. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with a double bond and an alcohol group. But then the formula would need three oxygens? Let me check the options again: the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So maximum two oxygens. So if it's a ketone (C=O) and an alcohol (O-H), that would be two oxygens. Then the formula would have a ketone and an alcohol and a double bond. Let's see: degrees of unsaturation would be 1 (C=O) +1 (C=C) =2. So formula needs two degrees. The options with two degrees are C6H10O and C6H10O2. If it's C6H10O2, that's two oxygens. For example, a ketone and an alcohol and a double bond. But that might be possible. But how does that fit with the mass spec fragment at 45?

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester (RCOOR'), the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750, which matches. The ester oxygen would have an O, but no O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 would have to be something else. Maybe it's an impurity? Or maybe I'm wrong about the O-H. Wait, the problem says "very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers". That's lower than the typical O-H stretch. O-H in carboxylic acids is usually around 2500-3300, but centered higher. Wait, 3000 is the upper end. Maybe it's an alcohol O-H. But alcohols typically have O-H around 3300 cm⁻¹. If it's a broad peak at 3000, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then the formula would need to be C6H12O2. But then degrees of unsaturation would be 1, which conflicts with having a C=O and a C=C (total two degrees). So perhaps there's a ring plus a carbonyl? For example, a cyclic ketone. But then the NMR would show ring protons, not vinyl hydrogens. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. Therefore, the compound must have a double bond and a carbonyl, so two degrees. Therefore, the formula must be either C6H10O or C6H10O2.

Now, looking at the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. If the compound is C6H10O2, possible fragments could be COOH (45) as mentioned before, which would suggest a carboxylic acid. But C6H10O2 would have degrees of unsaturation 2, which allows for a carbonyl and a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Let's take hex-2-enoic acid: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H8O2. But the option is C6H10O2. Hmm, so that's two hydrogens short. Maybe it's a dihydroxy compound with a double bond? Or maybe it's a cyclic ester? Alternatively, maybe the compound is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester. Wait, let's think of another approach.

If the fragment at m/z=45 is from the molecular ion losing a large fragment, leaving a small ion. For example, if the compound has an ethyl group (CH2CH3), losing that could leave a fragment with m/z=45. But ethyl is 29 (C2H5+). Alternatively, if there's a fragment like CH2=CH-O-... maybe. Alternatively, the 45 could correspond to the acetyl ion (CH3CO+), which is 43. Not quite. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3CH2O+ (45), which would suggest an ethoxy group. If the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, like RCOOCH2CH3. Then, the molecular formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. The total formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: RCOOCH2CH3. If R is C4H7, then RCOOCH2CH3 would be C4H7COOCH2CH3 = C6H10O2. That works. So if it's an ester, the IR would show the carbonyl at ~1700-1750, which matches. The other peak at 1650 would be the C=C. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the ethoxy group (CH2CH3O+), which is 12*2 +1*5 +16 =24+5+16=45. So that fits. Also, the ester wouldn't have an O-H, so the broad peak at 3000 must be something else. Wait, but the problem states there's a very broad absorption at 3000. If it's an ester, there's no O-H. So maybe the initial assumption about the O-H is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an ester and an alcohol group. But that would require three oxygens, which isn't in the options. So maybe the broad peak is not O-H. What else could cause a broad peak around 3000?

Alternatively, maybe it's an N-H stretch. But the formulas don't include nitrogen. Or maybe it's a C-H stretch from an aromatic ring. But aromatic C-H is usually around 3000-3100, and not very broad. A broad peak might be due to overlapping peaks. But the problem says "very broad", which is more characteristic of O-H. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- FTIR: Broad peak ~3000 (O-H?), strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C)
- NMR: Vinyl hydrogens (so double bond present)
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 (possibly COOH or CH2CH3O+)
- Possible formulas: C6H10O2 (two degrees of unsaturation: C=O and C=C)

If the compound is an ester (C6H10O2), then:

- C=O at 1700
- C=C at 1650
- Ethoxy fragment at 45 (CH2CH3O+)
- No O-H, so the broad peak at 3000 must be something else. But that contradicts.

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid (C6H12O2), then:

- O-H broad peak at 3000
- C=O at 1700
- C=C at 1650
- Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2=1. But we need two (C=O and C=C). So that's a problem. Unless there's a ring. Wait, if it's a cyclic carboxylic acid with a double bond? For example, cyclohexene carboxylic acid. But then the formula would be C7H10O2, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound has a triple bond? No, because the IR doesn't show a triple bond stretch (~2200). So not that.

Alternatively, maybe the C=O and the C=C are conjugated, reducing the wavenumber of the C=O. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. In such cases, the C=O stretch is around 1700, and the C=C around 1650. So that fits the IR. The ester would have a carbonyl and a double bond, so two degrees of unsaturation, which matches C6H10O2. The fragment at m/z=45 could be the ethoxy group. Then, the broad peak at 3000 would need to be explained. Wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid after all. But that would require C6H12O2 with two degrees of unsaturation, which isn't possible unless there's a ring. Wait, let's calculate degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 again:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. But we need two (C=O and C=C). So that's impossible. Therefore, C6H12O2 cannot have both a C=O and a C=C. So the compound must be C6H10O2, which has two degrees. Therefore, the structure must have a C=O and a C=C.

But then, the broad peak at 3000 must be something else. Wait, maybe it's not O-H. Could it be a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch even though the formula is C6H10O2? Wait, no. A carboxylic acid has the formula CnH2nO2. For n=5, it's C5H10O2. For n=6, it's C6H12O2. So if the compound is C6H10O2, it can't be a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the O-H must be from something else. But the options don't have three oxygens. Therefore, maybe the broad peak is not O-H. What else could give a broad peak around 3000? Maybe NH2 stretch, but no N in formula. Maybe water as an impurity? But the problem states it's the compound's spectrum. Alternatively, maybe it's a very broad C-H stretch. But C-H stretches are usually sharp. This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something with an -OH group. For example, a cyclic hemiacetal would have an -OH. But that would require more oxygens. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with a carbonyl and a double bond. But again, oxygens would add up. Let's check the formulas again:

If the compound is C6H10O2, two oxygens. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond. For example, ethyl propenoate (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3). The formula would be C5H8O2. Not C6H10O2. Wait, maybe it's something like pent-2-enoic acid ethyl ester. Wait, pent-2-enoic acid is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The ethyl ester would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3, which is C7H10O2. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester. For example, but-2-enoic acid methyl ester: CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. That's C6H8O2. Still not C6H10O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a ring and a carbonyl. For example, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, but no double bond. If it's cyclopentanone with a double bond, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. If it's 45, possible fragments are:

- COOH+ (45)
- CH2CH2O+ (45)
- Maybe other possibilities like CH3OCH2+ (but that's 59), or CH2OH+ (33).

If it's COOH+, then the compound must have a carboxylic acid group. But as discussed, that would require the formula C6H12O2, which doesn't have enough degrees of unsaturation. But maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a ring and a double bond? Wait, a ring is one degree, a double bond is another, and the carbonyl is another. That's three degrees. But the formula C6H12O2 has only one degree. So that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the fragment at 45 is not COOH+.

If it's CH2CH2O+ (45), then it's an ethoxy group. So the compound could be an ester with an ethoxy group. For example, ethyl something. Let's try to build a structure. Suppose the compound is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's propyl propenoate. The formula would be C6H10O2. Yes! Because propenoate is CH2=CHCOO-, and propyl group is CH2CH2CH3. Wait, propenoic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. The propyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Let's count: CH2=CHCOO- is 4 carbons (CH2-CH2-COO-?), wait, no. Propenoic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. The ester would be CH2=CHCOO-R. If R is propyl (C3H7), then total carbons: 3 (from R) + 3 (from CH2=CHCOO-) = 6. So formula is C6H10O2. Yes. In that case:

- FTIR: C=O at 1700 (ester), C=C at 1650. The broad peak at 3000 could be from the ester's alkyl C-H stretches? But C-H stretches are around 2800-3000 and not usually very broad. Alternatively, maybe there's an impurity or a mistake in the problem. But the problem states the compound has that peak. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a vinyl ester, which might have some broad O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. This is confusing.

Wait, but the problem says the FTIR shows a very broad absorption at 3000. If that's not O-H, what else? Maybe it's a carboxylic acid after all, but then the formula must be C6H12O2, which only has one degree of unsaturation. That's a contradiction. Unless there's a ring. For example, cyclohexane carboxylic acid. The formula would be C7H12O2. Not an option. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a gamma-lactone (cyclic ester), which would have a carbonyl and a ring. But a lactone would have the formula C6H10O2 if it's a five-membered ring. For example, a gamma-lactone from a five-membered ring (like butyrolactone is C4H6O2). If it's a six-membered lactone, maybe C5H8O2. Not matching C6H10O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone and an alcohol with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCH(OH)CH2COCH3. But that's getting complex, and the formula would need to be C6H10O2. Let's count: CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH2-CO-CH3. That's 6 carbons. Oxygens: one from alcohol, one from ketone. Total O=2. Hydrogens: Let's count. Each double bond subtracts two hydrogens. The structure has one double bond, one ring (if any), but here it's a straight chain. Let's see: CH2=CH has 2 H on CH2, 1 H on CH. Then -CH(OH)- would have 2 H on CH(OH). Then -CH2- (2 H), CO (no H), CH3 (3 H). Plus the OH. Total H: 2+1+2+2+3=10. Plus the OH hydrogen, which is already counted in the formula. Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. So yes, that would fit. But does this structure have a carbonyl (the ketone at 1700) and a double bond (1650)? The ketone's C=O would be around 1700, the C=C around 1650. The O-H from the alcohol would give a broad peak around 3000-3500. But the problem says the broad peak is at 3000. Maybe it's a broad peak shifted lower due to conjugation or something. But this is speculative. However, the degrees of unsaturation here would be two: one from C=O and one from C=C. So the formula C6H10O2 fits. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be the CH2CH2O+ from a broken ester, but in this case, it's a ketone and an alcohol. Alternatively, the fragment could be from the alcohol part. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the CH3CO+ (43) plus something else. Not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to summarize:

- The compound must have a carbonyl (1700), a double bond (1650 and vinyl H in NMR), and possibly an O-H (broad 3000).
- The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests either COOH or CH2CH2O+.
- The possible formulas are C6H10O2 (two degrees) or C6H12O2 (one degree).

If we go with C6H10O2, which allows two degrees (C=O and C=C), and the fragment at 45 being CH2CH2O+, then it's likely an ester with an ethoxy group. For example, ethyl propenoate (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3). The formula is C6H8O2. Wait, that's only 8 hydrogens. But the formula needs to be C6H10O2. So maybe it's something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's pent-3-enoic acid ethyl ester. The formula would be C7H10O2. Still not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone with a double bond. For example, a six-membered lactone with a double bond. The formula would depend on the structure. For example, a delta-lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's take but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Formula is C5H8O2. Not C6H10O2. To get to C6H10O2, we need two more carbons. Maybe hex-2-enoic acid ethyl ester: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That's C8H12O2. No.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester? No, that would require more oxygens. Or maybe it's an ester with a branched chain. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH(CH2CH3)2. But that would add more carbons.

This approach isn't working. Let's think differently. The mass spec fragment at 45 is key. If it's COOH+, then the compound must be a carboxylic acid with formula C6H12O2. But that formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which must account for both the C=O and the C=C. That's impossible unless there's a ring. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group. The formula would be C6H8O2. Not matching. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the fragment at 45 is not COOH but something else, like CH2CH2O+, then the compound could be an ester. Let's assume that. Then the formula is C6H10O2, which has two degrees (C=O and C=C). The structure would be something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, that's an ester with the double bond adjacent to the oxygen. For example, vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. The formula is C4H6O2. Not matching. But if R is longer, say CH2CH2CH3, then CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Yes. The structure would be vinyl propanoate: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, vinyl propanoate would be CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. The formula is C6H10O2. In this case:

- FTIR: C=O at 1700, C=C at 1650. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-O-) would have C=C stretch at 1650. The ester carbonyl at 1700. The broad peak at 3000 is unexplained. Unless there's an O-H somewhere, but the formula doesn't allow it. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a methyl vinyl ketone with an ester group. But that would require more oxygens. Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for the most plausible answer based on the given data.

The presence of a broad O-H peak suggests a carboxylic acid. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would need to be C6H10O2 (since C6H12O2 would have only one degree of unsaturation). But wait, wait. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2:

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: one from C=O and one from C=C. That works. But the formula for a carboxylic acid with a double bond would be C6H10O2. For example, pent-2-enoic acid is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, which has the formula C6H8O2. So two hydrogens short. To get C6H10O2, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a single double bond and a ring? For example, cyclohexene carboxylic acid. But that would have the formula C7H10O2. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a branched carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, 3-pentenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH. That's C6H8O2. Still not enough hydrogens.

This is perplexing. Maybe the correct answer is C6H10O2, even if the O-H peak can't be explained. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is not O-H but something else, and the compound is an ester with C=O and C=C, and the fragment at 45 is the ethoxy group.

Given the options, and the data:

- Two degrees of unsaturation (C=O and C=C) → C6H10O2
- Fragment at 45 → likely ethoxy group (CH2CH2O+)
- IR peaks at 1700 (ester C=O) and 1650 (C=C)
- NMR vinyl Hs

Therefore, the compound is likely an ester with a double bond, formula C6H10O2.

But what about the broad peak at 3000? Maybe it's a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an alcohol and an ester. Wait, that would require three oxygens. Not possible with the given formulas.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from water contamination. But the problem states it's the compound's spectrum.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Given the information and the options, the most consistent answer is C6H10O2.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A broad peak around that region usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests it's a strong hydrogen bond, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid rather than an alcohol because carboxylic acids have stronger hydrogen bonding. But wait, the problem mentions it's a very broad absorption. Alcohols can have broad peaks too, especially if they're in a concentrated solution or if there's a lot of hydrogen bonding. But carboxylic acids typically have a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. However, the options given don't include a carboxylic acid unless one of the formulas is a carboxylic acid. Let me check:

C6H12O would be something like an alcohol or ether. The molecular formula for a carboxylic acid with 6 carbons would be C6H12O2 (since carboxylic acids are RCOOH, so general formula CnH2nO2). For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the other strong absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the O-H stretch. So that fits. But then there's another peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. That's lower than the typical carbonyl. 1650 cm⁻¹ could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe an ester? Wait, esters also have carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. But if there's another peak at 1650, maybe a C=C stretch. The C=C stretch in alkenes is around 1640-1680 cm⁻¹. So if there's a peak at 1650, that might indicate a double bond. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid) and a double bond.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are hydrogens attached to a double bond. So that supports the presence of a C=C group. So combining the IR data: O-H (broad at 3000), C=O (1700), and C=C (1650). Wait, but the 1650 could also be an aromatic ring? If there's an aromatic ring, the C=C stretching in aromatic rings is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, so maybe not. The 1650 is more likely an isolated double bond. So maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like acrylic acid but with more carbons. But the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, which would fit a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. For each formula:

C6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, or a triple bond.

C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Same as above.

C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

But wait, the compound has a double bond (from NMR vinyl Hs) and a carbonyl group (from IR 1700). Each double bond is one degree of unsaturation. So two double bonds would be two degrees. But the O in the formula doesn't affect degrees of unsaturation. So let's check:

If the compound has a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C, that's two degrees of unsaturation. So the molecular formula must have two degrees. Let's see which formulas have two degrees:

C6H10O: Degrees=2

C6H10O2: Degrees=2

C6H12O: Degrees=1

C6H12O2: Degrees=1

So the compound must be either C6H10O or C6H10O2. Wait, but wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H. If it's a carboxylic acid (which would require two oxygens, O2), then the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 would be (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. But we need two degrees (C=O and C=C). That would require the formula to have two degrees, which would be C6H10O2 (degrees= (14-10)/2=2). So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. But wait, carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. For n=5, it would be C5H10O2, but the formula here is C6H10O2. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with 6 carbons. For example, 2-pentenoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's 6 carbons? Let's see: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH is 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H8O2. Wait, no. Let me count: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. That's 6 carbons. The COOH is -COOH, which is two oxygens. The formula would be C6H8O2. But the options are C6H10O2. Hmm. Maybe the compound is a cyclic carboxylic acid with a double bond? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Let's think again.

The broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol. But then the O-H stretch for alcohols is usually broad but maybe not as broad as carboxylic acids. However, if the alcohol is in a situation with strong hydrogen bonding, maybe it's a phenol. Phenols have O-H stretches around 3300-3500, but they can be broad. But the peak here is at 3000, which is lower. Wait, maybe it's an -NH group? But the problem doesn't mention nitrogen in the formulas. The options are all C, H, O. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is an -OH from a carboxylic acid, which would require two oxygens. So the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C6H12O2 is 1. But we need two degrees (C=O and C=C). That's a problem. So maybe the compound has a ring and a carbonyl? For example, a cyclic ketone. But then the IR would have a carbonyl at ~1700, and the ring might have C-H stretches. But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, not a ring. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, requiring two degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, the formula must have two degrees of unsaturation, which would be C6H10O or C6H10O2.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data. The choices are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me analyze the data methodically.

The FTIR spectrum displays a very broad absorption at 3000 wavenumbers, which typically indicates an O-H stretch. This could be from an alcohol or carboxylic acid, with the broadness suggesting strong hydrogen bonding, more characteristic of carboxylic acids. The spectrum also shows strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak likely indicates a C=C stretch, common in alkenes.

The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, which are attached to carbon-carbon double bonds. This supports the presence of a C=C group in the molecule.

Calculating the degrees of unsaturation for each formula:
- C6H12O: (2×6+2-12)/2 = 1 degree of unsaturation
- C6H10O: (2×6+2-10)/2 = 2 degrees of unsaturation
- C6H10O2: (2×6+2-10)/2 = 2 degrees of unsaturation
- C6H12O2: (2×6+2-12)/2 = 1 degree of unsaturation

Since the spectroscopic data indicates both a C=O and a C=C (each accounting for one degree of unsaturation), the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation total. This limits our options to C6H10O or C6H10O2.

If the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is indeed from a carboxylic acid OH group, then the formula would need to include two oxygen atoms. This would point to C6H10O2 as the likely formula, potentially representing an unsaturated carboxylic acid with a C=C bond.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the provided spectroscopic data. The choices are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. I'll analyze each piece of information meticulously.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum, there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Such a peak usually indicates an O-H stretch, typical of alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broad nature points to strong hydrogen bonding, more in line with carboxylic acids since they form stronger hydrogen bonds. Additionally, carboxylic acids typically show a very broad peak from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. Given this, it might be a carboxylic acid, so let's examine the potential formulas.

The formula C6H12O might represent an alcohol or ether, while the formula for a 6-carbon carboxylic acid would be C6H12O2, following the pattern RCOOH or CnH2nO2. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula should be C6H12O2. However, there are additional significant absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with carboxylic acids. Yet, the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is unusual for a standard carbonyl. This peak could signify a conjugated carbonyl, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, or possibly an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could indicate the presence of an ester, with carbonyl peaks around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹, and a potential C=C stretch, which appears in the 1640-1680 cm⁻¹ range for alkenes. Thus, a 1650 cm⁻¹ peak may point to a double bond within the compound, implying both a carbonyl group (as in ketones or carboxylic acids) and a double bond.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are present in double bonds, reinforcing the presence of a C=C group. So, combining the IR data: there's an O-H stretch (broad at 3000 cm⁻¹), a C=O stretch (1700 cm⁻¹), and a C=C stretch (1650 cm⁻¹). But the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could also belong to an aromatic ring. However, the C=C stretching for aromatic rings usually occurs around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, so it's less likely. More probably, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak describes an isolated double bond. Thus, the compound might be an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, similar to acrylic acid but with more carbons, fitting C6H10O2 for a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Considering the degrees of unsaturation for each formula:

- C6H12O: Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2 = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1.
- C6H10O: Degrees = (2*6 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2.
- C6H10O2: Degrees = (2*6 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2.
- C6H12O2: Degrees = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1.

But we observe a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens in NMR) and a carbonyl group (from the IR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹). Each double bond denotes one degree of unsaturation. Hence, the compound should reflect two degrees of unsaturation. The correct molecular formula must include two degrees:

- C6H10O: Has 2 degrees.
- C6H10O2: Has 2 degrees.

Given the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, possibly an O-H group, if it's a carboxylic acid (requiring two oxygens, O2), then the formula must be C6H12O2. But wait, C6H12O2 has only one degree of unsaturation, while we need two. The compound likely comprises both a ring and a carbonyl, such as in a cyclic ketone, but NMR displays vinyl hydrogens, pointing towards a double bond, not a ring. Therefore, with a carbonyl and a double bond, two degrees of unsaturation are necessary, making C6H10O or C6H10O2 the potential formulas.

Common fragments at 45 could be the COOH+ group (if it's a carboxylic acid), but COOH is 45 (12+16*2+1=45). Wait, COOH is 45. So if the molecular ion loses a fragment to leave COOH+, that would give a peak at 45. Alternatively, other fragments: 45 could be CH3CH2O+ (ethyl group, but that's 45? Let me check: C2H5O+ would be (2*12)+(5*1)+16=24+5+16=45. Yes. So maybe an ethyl group attached to oxygen. Or maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O+? Wait, maybe. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, like ethyl acetate, but in that case, the ester would have a carbonyl. But the molecular formula here would need to fit. Alternatively, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the molecular ion might lose the R group (like if it's RCOOH, losing R gives COOH+ at 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H11COOH (hexanoic acid, C6H12O2), then losing C5H11 would give COOH+ at 45. So that's possible. But hexanoic acid's molecular formula is C6H12O2. Wait, but hexanoic acid has the formula C6H12O2, which has degrees of unsaturation 1 (one carboxylic acid group, which is a double bond). But according to the IR, there's another peak at 1650, which would suggest another double bond. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, then it would have two double bonds (the C=O and the C=C), which would require two degrees of unsaturation. But the formula C6H10O2 would have (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2 degrees, which matches. So if the formula is C6H10O2, that would fit. For example, pent-2-enoic acid would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Wait, let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH is 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H8O2. But that's only 8 hydrogens, but the formula here is C6H10O2. So maybe it's a dihydroxy compound or something else. Wait, maybe the compound has a ring and a carbonyl. For example, cyclohexanone with an alcohol group? But then the degrees of unsaturation would be 1 (ring) +1 (carbonyl) = 2, which would fit C6H10O (if it's cyclohexanone, but cyclohexanone is C6H10O). But cyclohexanone doesn't have an O-H group. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a carbonyl and a ring. The formula for a lactone would be C6H10O2 if it's a five-membered ring (like gamma-lactone from pentanoic acid). Wait, gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2. So a six-membered lactone would be C6H10O2. That could fit. The IR would have the carbonyl at 1700 and possibly some C-O stretches. But then where does the 1650 cm⁻¹ come in? If there's a conjugated double bond in the lactone, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, vinyl acetate would have a carbonyl and a double bond. Let me check: vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. The formula is C4H6O2. But we need C6H10O2. So maybe a larger ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1740, but the problem says 1700, which is a bit lower, maybe due to conjugation with the double bond. The double bond (C=C) would give a peak around 1650. The ester would have an O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 must be something else. Wait, but the problem says a very broad absorption at 3000. If it's an ester, there's no O-H. So maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which would require the formula to be C6H12O2 (since carboxylic acids are RCOOH, which is O2). But then, as before, if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would need to be C6H10O2. But wait, RCOOH is CnH2nO2. If there's a double bond in R, then the formula would be CnH2n-2O2. For n=6, that's C6H10O2. So yes, that works. So for example, 3-hexenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCH2COOH. Wait, let me count the carbons: CH3CH2CH=CHCH2COOH. That's 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2. That fits. The IR would show the O-H stretch (broad at ~3000), the carbonyl at 1700, and the C=C at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl protons from the double bond. The mass spec would have a fragment at m/z=45, which could be the COOH+ ion (45). So this seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the compound is an ester with a double bond and an alcohol, but esters don't have O-H. So the O-H must be from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. If it's an alcohol, then the formula could be C6H12O. But then where is the carbonyl? The IR shows a peak at 1700, which would require a carbonyl. So an alcohol with a carbonyl would be a ketone or aldehyde. But aldehydes have a carbonyl around 1720-1740, and the O-H from an alcohol would be broad. But the problem mentions a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650. If it's a ketone with a double bond, like 3-penten-2-one, the formula would be C5H8O. Not matching the options. Maybe a cyclic ketone with a double bond, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. Possible fragments with m/z=45 include:\n\n- COOH+ (45)\n- CH3CH2O+ (45)\n- CH2CHOH+ (but that would be 45 as well: C2H5O is 45)\n- Maybe other possibilities.\n\nIf the compound is a carboxylic acid, losing the R group (as a radical) would leave COOH+, which is 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H9COOH (which is C6H10O2), then losing C5H9• would give COOH+ at 45. That makes sense. So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- FTIR: O-H (carboxylic acid) at ~3000, C=O at 1700, C=C at 1650.\n- NMR: vinyl hydrogens from the double bond.\n- Mass spec: fragment at 45 (COOH+).\n- Degrees of unsaturation: 2 (C=O and C=C), so formula must have 2 degrees, which is C6H10O or C6H10O2.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

um: a fragment at m/z=45. Common fragments at 45 could be the COOH+ group (if it's a carboxylic acid), but COOH is 45 (12+16*2+1=45). Wait, COOH is 45. So if the molecular ion loses a fragment to leave COOH+, that would give a peak at 45. Alternatively, other fragments: 45 could be CH3CH2O+ (ethyl group, but that's 45? Let me check: C2H5O+ would be (2*12)+(5*1)+16=24+5+16=45. Yes. So maybe an ethyl group attached to oxygen. Or maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O+? Wait, maybe. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, like ethyl acetate, but in that case, the ester would have a carbonyl. But the molecular formula here would need to fit. Alternatively, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the molecular ion might lose the R group (like if it's RCOOH, losing R gives COOH+ at 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H11COOH (hexanoic acid, C6H12O2), then losing C5H11 would give COOH+ at 45. So that's possible. But hexanoic acid's molecular formula is C6H12O2. Wait, but hexanoic acid has the formula C6H12O2, which has degrees of unsaturation 1 (one carboxylic acid group, which is a double bond). But according to the IR, there's another peak at 1650, which would suggest another double bond. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, then it would have two double bonds (the C=O and the C=C), which would require two degrees of unsaturation. But the formula C6H10O2 would have (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2 degrees, which matches. So if the formula is C6H10O2, that would fit. For example, pent-2-enoic acid would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Wait, let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH is 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H8O2. But that's only 8 hydrogens, but the formula here is C6H10O2. So maybe it's a dihydroxy compound or something else. Wait, maybe the compound has a ring and a carbonyl. For example, cyclohexanone with an alcohol group? But then the degrees of unsaturation would be 1 (ring) +1 (carbonyl) = 2, which would fit C6H10O (if it's cyclohexanone, but cyclohexanone is C6H10O). But cyclohexanone doesn't have an O-H group. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a carbonyl and a ring. The formula for a lactone would be C6H10O2 if it's a five-membered ring (like gamma-lactone from pentanoic acid). Wait, gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2. So a six-membered lactone would be C6H10O2. That could fit. The IR would have the carbonyl at 1700 and possibly some C-O stretches. But then where does the 1650 cm⁻¹ come in? If there's a conjugated double bond in the lactone, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, vinyl acetate would have a carbonyl and a double bond. Let me check: vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. The formula is C4H6O2. But we need C6H10O2. So maybe a larger ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1740, but the problem says 1700, which is a bit lower, maybe due to conjugation with the double bond. The double bond (C=C) would give a peak around 1650. The ester would have an O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 must be something else. Wait, but the problem says a very broad absorption at 3000. If it's an ester, there's no O-H. So maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which would require the formula to be C6H12O2 (since carboxylic acids are RCOOH, which is O2). But then, as before, if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would need to be C6H10O2. But wait, RCOOH is CnH2nO2. If there's a double bond in R, then the formula would be CnH2n-2O2. For n=6, that's C6H10O2. So yes, that works. So for example, 3-hexenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCH2COOH. Wait, let me count the carbons: CH3CH2CH=CHCH2COOH. That's 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2. That fits. The IR would show the O-H stretch (broad at ~3000), the carbonyl at 1700, and the C=C at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl protons from the double bond. The mass spec would have a fragment at m/z=45, which could be the COOH+ ion (45). So this seems to fit.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a double bond and an alcohol, but esters don't have O-H. So the O-H must be from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. If it's an alcohol, then the formula could be C6H12O. But then where is the carbonyl? The IR shows a peak at 1700, which would require a carbonyl. So an alcohol with a carbonyl would be a ketone or aldehyde. But aldehydes have a carbonyl around 1720-1740, and the O-H from an alcohol would be broad. But the problem mentions a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650. If it's a ketone with a double bond, like 3-penten-2-one, the formula would be C5H8O. Not matching the options. Maybe a cyclic ketone with a double bond, but again, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. Possible fragments with m/z=45 include:

- COOH+ (45)
- CH3CH2O+ (45)
- CH2CHOH+ (but that would be 45 as well: C2H5O is 45)
- Maybe other possibilities.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, losing the R group (as a radical) would leave COOH+, which is 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H9COOH (which is C6H10O2), then losing C5H9• would give COOH+ at 45. That makes sense. So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

Putting it all together:

- FTIR: O-H (carboxylic acid) at ~3000, C=O at 1700, C=C at 1650.
- NMR: vinyl hydrogens from the double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 (COOH+).
- Degrees of unsaturation: 2 (C=O and C=C), so formula must have 2 degrees, which is C6H10O or C6H10O2. But since there's a carboxylic acid (needs O2), the formula is C6H10O2.

Therefore, the answer should be C6H10O2.

A carboxylic acid is RCOOH. The general formula is CnH2nO2. If there's a double bond in the R group, the formula becomes CnH2n-2O2. So, for n=6, that would be C6H10O2. Therefore, if the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (like pentenoic acid with 6 carbons), the formula would be C6H10O2.
