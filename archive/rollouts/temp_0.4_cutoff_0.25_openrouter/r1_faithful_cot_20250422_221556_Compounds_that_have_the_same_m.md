# Original Question

Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).

**Answer:**

**A. Compound that does not show tautomerism: Benzoquinone**  
Benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups due to its conjugated aromatic structure. This prevents keto-enol tautomerism as disrupting the aromatic system would be energetically unfavorable. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups, enabling enolization and tautomerism.

**B. Compound that shows optical isomerism: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon (bonded to -OH, -CH₃, -COOCH₃, and -H), resulting in enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate, despite its trans double bond, lacks chiral centers and has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. 

**Final Answer:**  
A = Benzoquinone  
B = Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  

\boxed{A} \text{ is Benzoquinone and } \boxed{B} \text{ is Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism. First, I need to recall what tautomerism and optical isomerism are. 

Starting with tautomerism: Tautomers are isomers that can interconvert by relocating a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it needs to have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (like an alpha hydrogen). This allows the formation of an enol form. So, if a compound doesn't have such a structure, it might not show tautomerism.

Now, the first part asks between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione which does not show tautomerism (compound A). Let me look at their structures. 

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can exist in different positions. The common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. But regardless, quinones are conjugated with the aromatic ring. The question is, can they undergo keto-enol tautomerism? Well, in keto-enol tautomerism, the enol form has an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the aromatic ring. The aromatic stabilization might make the keto form more stable, and maybe there's no possibility for enol formation because moving a hydrogen would disrupt the aromaticity. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. Now, each ketone group is adjacent to two other carbonyl groups. Wait, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group? Let me visualize: cyclohexane ring with ketones at 1,3,5 positions. So the structure would be like O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-... wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,3,5 are each separated by two carbons. So the structure would have three ketone groups on alternate carbons. That would mean each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH2 groups. For example, the structure would be a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups. But wait, maybe each carbonyl is directly connected to two adjacent carbons? Hmm, no, in a six-membered ring, positions 1,3,5 are not adjacent. Each is two carbons apart. So each ketone is separated by two CH2 groups. Wait, but if the ring is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure would be O=C-C-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-C in the ring. So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, each adjacent to two CH2 groups. Therefore, each ketone has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl) which can participate in keto-enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have multiple sites for enolization, leading to tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because of the aromatic stabilization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. So compound A (which does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. Let's look at both compounds.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The parent acid is lactic acid (CH3CH(OH)COOH), so the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OCH3)COOCH3? Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So the methyl ester would replace the -COOH's acidic hydrogen with a methyl group. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's check the structure. The central carbon (the second carbon) is CH(OH)-. So the groups attached to that carbon are: one hydroxyl (OH), one methyl (CH3), one carbonyl group (COOCH3), and one hydrogen. Wait, wait, actually, the structure is:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The methyl ester would be the ester of this acid, so the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: -OH, -CH3 (from the first carbon), -COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. Let's check if that's four different groups. The groups are: -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3, and -H. Yes, all four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound should have optical isomerism. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exist as two enantiomers.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with trans configuration. So the ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no. The correct structure would be (E)-1,4-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH becomes (E)-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on the ends of a trans double bond. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The central part is CH=CH. Each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, the structure is OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3, but with trans configuration. Wait, but each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H. Since the double bond is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But in terms of the molecule's structure, does it have any chiral centers? Each carbon in the double bond is connected to COOCH3, H, and the other CH. Wait, the carbons in the double bond are each connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the other CH). Wait, actually, the structure is OCOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 if it's fumarate? No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of 1,2-dicarboxylate. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Let's get this right. Maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid, and fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in the middle. So fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the trans configuration. Now, looking at each carbon in the molecule. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Carbon 2 is connected to COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the double bond. Carbon 3 is connected to COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the double bond. But in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, each of those carbons (2 and 3) are each connected to two identical groups? Let's see: Carbon 2 has COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (but wait, actually, in the structure CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, the carbons in the double bond (the CH=CH part) are each connected to one COOCH3 group and one H. So each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) have the following substituents: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (but wait, maybe not). Let me draw it out. 

Structure of dimethyl fumarate: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, no. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So for each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond), the substituents are: COOCH3, H, and two single bonds to the adjacent carbons. Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is CH, so each has a COOCH3, a H, and two carbons (the adjacent ones). Wait, but each of those adjacent carbons are part of the double bond, so the substituents would be COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (but actually, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons, but in this case, each is bonded to one COOCH3 and one H. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the structure again. The molecule is (E)-dimethyl but-2-enedioate. So the structure is OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OCH3. Wait, no. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)-OCH3. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The actual structure is:

Positions 1 to 4: OCH3-O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O-OCH3. But no, for fumarate, it's OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OCH3 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (if we number from the ester groups). So the two central carbons are each connected to a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3) and a hydrogen. But in the trans configuration, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides. However, each of those central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has substituents: COOCH3, H, and the other CH. Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is bonded to COOCH3, H, and the other carbon (which is part of the double bond). So each has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and CH (the adjacent carbon). But since the double bond is between them, each has two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and two bonds to the other carbon. Therefore, those carbons are not chiral centers because they have only three substituents (COOCH3, H, and two bonds to the adjacent carbon). Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the double bond has four bonds. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond (let's say C2 and C3) has the following bonds:

C2: double bond to C3, single bond to C1 (which is part of the carbonyl group O=C-OCH3), and a single bond to a hydrogen.

C3: double bond to C2, single bond to C4 (which is part of the carbonyl group O=C-OCH3), and a single bond to a hydrogen.

So for each of these carbons (C2 and C3), the substituents are: COOCH3, H, and two carbons (each part of the double bond). Wait, but each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to two other carbons (C1 and C4 via the carbonyl groups, and each other via the double bond), plus a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me correct. The structure is:

OCH3-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-OCH3 for the saturated version, but fumarate is the trans-dioate. So the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is OCH3-O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-OCH3 with the double bond in the middle (positions 2 and 3) and trans configuration. So each of the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) is connected to:

For C2: a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond to C3.

For C3: a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond to C2.

But since the double bond is trans, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides. However, each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the other carbon (C3 or C2). But each of those carbons has only three substituents, right? Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has four bonds. Let's consider the structure:

The actual bonds for C2 would be:

- One double bond to C3 (two bonds)

- One single bond to the carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3)

- One single bond to a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's three substituents plus the double bond. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has three substituents and one double bond. So in terms of geometry, each has three groups around them: COOCH3, H, and the other CH (from the double bond). But since the double bond is a planar structure with trigonal geometry, each carbon in the double bond has three groups: COOCH3, H, and the adjacent carbon (with its own substituents). 

But regardless, for a chiral center, we need four different substituents. In the case of C2 and C3 in dimethyl fumarate, each is connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the adjacent one via double bond and the one in the carbonyl). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think of the actual substituents. For C2:

- One bond to O=C-OCH3 (which is a carbonyl group connected to an ester)

- One bond to H

- Two bonds to C3 (since it's a double bond)

But valence-wise, each carbon has four bonds. So C2 is double-bonded to C3, single-bonded to O=C-OCH3, and single-bonded to H. So substituents are: O=C-OCH3, H, and C3 (with its substituents). However, when considering the groups around C2, since it's part of a double bond, the actual substituents are O=C-OCH3, H, and two times C3 (from the double bond). But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's better to think that each carbon in the double bond has three substituents: two from the double bond (each carbon has a substituent on either side) and one from the rest. Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because all the carbons with potential are either part of the ester groups or the double bond. The ester groups (OCH3) are on the ends, and the double bond carbons don't have four different groups. Each of the double bond carbons has COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the adjacent ones). But since the double bond is trans, the arrangement is fixed. However, even if there were a chiral center, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine the molecule, it's symmetrical along the double bond axis. So any potential chiral centers would be mirrored, making the molecule meso or not chiral overall. But in this case, since the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a clear chiral center at the second carbon (the one attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a stereogenic center, leading to optical isomerism. Therefore, compound B (which shows optical isomerism) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So summarizing:

A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism)

B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism)

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism. First, I need to recall what tautomerism and optical isomerism are. 

Starting with tautomerism: Tautomers are isomers that can interconvert by relocating a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it needs to have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (like an alpha hydrogen). This allows the formation of an enol form. So, if a compound doesn't have such a structure, it might not show tautomerism.

Now, the first part asks between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione which does not show tautomerism (compound A). Let me look at their structures. 

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can exist in different positions. The common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. But regardless, quinones are conjugated with the aromatic ring. The question is, can they undergo keto-enol tautomerism? Well, in keto-enol tautomerism, the enol form has an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the aromatic ring. The aromatic stabilization might make the keto form more stable, and maybe there's no possibility for enol formation because moving a hydrogen would disrupt the aromaticity. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. Now, each ketone group is adjacent to two other carbonyl groups. Wait, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group? Let me visualize: cyclohexane ring with ketones at 1,3,5 positions. So the structure would be like O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-... wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,3,5 are each separated by two carbons. So the structure would have three ketone groups on alternate carbons. That would mean each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH2 groups. For example, the structure would be a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups. But wait, maybe each carbonyl is directly connected to two adjacent carbons? Hmm, no, in a six-membered ring, positions 1,3,5 are not adjacent. Each is two carbons apart. So each ketone is separated by two CH2 groups. Wait, but if the ring is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure would be O=C-C-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-C in the ring. So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, each adjacent to two CH2 groups. Therefore, each ketone has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl) which can participate in keto-enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have multiple sites for enolization, leading to tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because of the aromatic stabilization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. So compound A (which does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. Let's look at both compounds.

Let me approach this problem methodically. I'll first examine what tautomerism and optical isomerism entail.

Tautomerism involves isomers that can interconvert through the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most prevalent type. For tautomerism to occur, a compound needs a carbonyl group (such as ketone or aldehyde) positioned next to a carbon containing a hydrogen (like an alpha hydrogen), enabling the formation of an enol.

Looking at the first part about which compound doesn't exhibit tautomerism (compound A), I need to analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone contains two ketone groups on a benzene ring (O=C6H4=O). It can exist as 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the aromatic ring. For keto-enol tautomerism, an enol form requires an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond. However, in benzoquinone, the aromatic stabilization likely makes the keto form more stable, and enol formation might be impossible as moving a hydrogen would disrupt aromaticity. This suggests benzoquinone may not undergo tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione features three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. In this six-membered ring, each carbonyl is situated between two CH2 groups. Therefore, each ketone has alpha hydrogens (from the adjacent CH2 groups) that can participate in keto-enol tautomerism. This means cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione likely has multiple sites for enolization, leading to tautomerism.

Therefore, compound A (which doesn't exhibit tautomerism) is probably benzoquinone due to its aromatic stabilization preventing enol formation.

For part B, I need to determine which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's approach this problem methodically. The focus is on tautomerism and optical isomerism. First, it's crucial to understand the concepts of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

Starting with tautomerism: Tautomers are isomers that can transform into each other by relocating a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The most common example is keto-enol tautomerism. For tautomerism to occur in a compound, it must have a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or aldehyde) next to a carbon that has a hydrogen atom (an alpha hydrogen). This is necessary for the compound to form an enol. If a compound lacks this kind of structure, it generally won’t display tautomerism.

Now, the initial question asks which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not exhibit tautomerism (compound A). Let's examine their structures.

Benzoquinone possesses two ketone groups on a benzene ring with the structure O=C6H4=O. Benzoquinone can exist in different positions, such as 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone, but in any form, quinones are conjugated with the aromatic ring. The key question is whether they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In keto-enol tautomerism, enol forms usually consist of an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond. In benzoquinone, however, the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic system. The aromatic stabilization likely renders the keto form more stable, and altering a hydrogen might disrupt this aromaticity, thereby preventing enol formation. Hence, benzoquinone might not demonstrate tautomerism.

Conversely, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione features three ketone groups within a cyclohexane ring. These groups are located at the 1,3,5 positions. Each ketone is separated by CH2 groups. Visualizing this: a six-membered ring with ketones at 1,3,5 positions implies each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups. For instance, the structural representation would be a ring with three carbonyl groups at alternating positions (1,3,5), each adjacent to two CH2 groups. Since each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl), keto-enol tautomerism is possible, enabling enolization in multiple sites. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione could exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone likely does not due to its aromatic stability. The non-tautomeric compound, therefore, would be benzoquinone.

Next, addressing part B: determining which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate demonstrates optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. Let's assess each compound.

So the parent acid is lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group). When esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH3O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl ester. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, but wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the COOH becomes COOCH3. So structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, wait, let\'s count. The propanoate ester is three carbons: the first is the ester group (COOCH3), the second is the CH(OH), and the third is the methyl (CH3). Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, maybe I\'m getting confused here. Let\'s write the structure properly.\n\nPropanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The "2-hydroxy" would be on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So it\'s CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule is:\n\nCOOCH3 is the ester group. The carbon adjacent to the COOCH3 is the second carbon, which has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from the original CH3), the COOCH3 group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let\'s see: the parent chain is three carbons. The first carbon is the COOCH3 (carboxylic acid ester), the second carbon is CH(OH)-, and the third carbon is CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:\n\nPropanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH (but actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but numbering starts from the COOH group. So the COOH is carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that\'s not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: COOH (C1), CH2 (C2), CH3 (C3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the ester would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but when you make an ester from a carboxylic acid, you replace the -OH of the COOH with an OR group. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the COOH is converted to COOCH3, and the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon. So structure: OCH3 is attached to the carbonyl, then the next carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3\n|\nCH(OH)CH3\n\nWait, maybe better written as CH3C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, I\'m getting confused. Let\'s use the IUPAC name. The parent is propanoic acid, which is three carbons. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure becomes COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: the COOCH3 group (on carbon 1), a hydroxyl group (on carbon 2), a methyl group (on carbon 3), and a hydrogen. Wait, but carbon 2 would have four substituents: the COOCH3 is on carbon 1, which is adjacent? Wait, maybe I need to draw this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s better to consider the structure as follows: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: a methyl group (from CH3), a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl oxygen (from the ester), and another CH3 from the adjacent carbon. Wait, no. Let me try again. The propanoic acid has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3\n   |\n   CH(OH)-CH3\n\nSo the carbon adjacent to the ester group (the first carbon) is connected to the ester oxygen, then the second carbon has the hydroxyl and a CH3. Wait, but that would make the second carbon have groups: hydroxyl, two CH2 groups, and the connection to the first carbon. Hmm, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. Let me check the actual structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is three carbons. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nSo the full structure is: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, the carbon at position 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:\n\n- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)\n- OH\n- CH3 (from carbon 3)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nWait, no. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it\'s connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)\n- OH group\n- Carbon 3 (CH3)\n- And one hydrogen.\n\nSo the groups around carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Are these four different groups? Let\'s see: COOCH3 is a carbonyl ester, which is a different group than OH, CH3, and H. Then OH, CH3, and H. But wait, the hydrogen is just a single hydrogen, while the others are larger groups. So the four groups attached to carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of trans-butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in trans configuration. Now, does this compound have a chiral center? Let\'s see. The molecule is symmetrical, with two ester groups on either end of a trans double bond. The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. For a chiral center, each carbon must have four different groups. In the case of the double bond in fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the other carbon in the double bond. But because the double bond is trans, the two carbons each have two identical groups (COOCH3 and H on opposite sides). However, the central carbons are each connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (but the double bond restricts rotation). Wait, actually, each carbon in the double bond has groups: COOCH3, H, and two adjacent carbons (each connected via double bond). But since the double bond is planar, there\'s no possibility of chirality here. The molecule is symmetrical along the central axis. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, maybe there\'s another possibility. If the molecule had a different arrangement, but in this case, fumarate is trans, so it\'s a planar molecule with symmetry, so no chiral centers. \n\nTherefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not. \n\nSo putting it all together: A is benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism), B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385568, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2182, prompt_tokens=992, total_tokens=3174, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

**Answer:**

**A. Compound that does not show tautomerism: Benzoquinone**  
Benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens necessary for keto-enol tautomerism due to its conjugated aromatic structure, which stabilizes the keto form. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups, enabling enolization and tautomerism.

**B. Compound that shows optical isomerism: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center at the second carbon (bonded to -OH, -COOCH₃, -CH₃, and -H), allowing for optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, however, is a symmetrical trans-diester with no chiral centers and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Final Answer:**  
A = Benzoquinone, B = Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
\boxed{A} \text{ is Benzoquinone and } \boxed{B} \text{ is Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the parent acid is lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group). When esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH3O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl ester. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, but wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the COOH becomes COOCH3. So structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, wait, let's count. The propanoate ester is three carbons: the first is the ester group (COOCH3), the second is the CH(OH), and the third is the methyl (CH3). Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's write the structure properly.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The "2-hydroxy" would be on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule is:

COOCH3 is the ester group. The carbon adjacent to the COOCH3 is the second carbon, which has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from the original CH3), the COOCH3 group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let's see: the parent chain is three carbons. The first carbon is the COOCH3 (carboxylic acid ester), the second carbon is CH(OH)-, and the third carbon is CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH (but actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but numbering starts from the COOH group. So the COOH is carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: COOH (C1), CH2 (C2), CH3 (C3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the ester would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but when you make an ester from a carboxylic acid, you replace the -OH of the COOH with an OR group. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the COOH is converted to COOCH3, and the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon. So structure: OCH3 is attached to the carbonyl, then the next carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, maybe better written as CH3C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's use the IUPAC name. The parent is propanoic acid, which is three carbons. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure becomes COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: the COOCH3 group (on carbon 1), a hydroxyl group (on carbon 2), a methyl group (on carbon 3), and a hydrogen. Wait, but carbon 2 would have four substituents: the COOCH3 is on carbon 1, which is adjacent? Wait, maybe I need to draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the structure as follows: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: a methyl group (from CH3), a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl oxygen (from the ester), and another CH3 from the adjacent carbon. Wait, no. Let me try again. The propanoic acid has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
   CH(OH)-CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the ester group (the first carbon) is connected to the ester oxygen, then the second carbon has the hydroxyl and a CH3. Wait, but that would make the second carbon have groups: hydroxyl, two CH2 groups, and the connection to the first carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the actual structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is three carbons. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So the full structure is: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, the carbon at position 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH
- CH3 (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)
- OH group
- Carbon 3 (CH3)
- And one hydrogen.

So the groups around carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Are these four different groups? Let's see: COOCH3 is a carbonyl ester, which is a different group than OH, CH3, and H. Then OH, CH3, and H. But wait, the hydrogen is just a single hydrogen, while the others are larger groups. So the four groups attached to carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. 

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of trans-butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in trans configuration. Now, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is symmetrical, with two ester groups on either end of a trans double bond. The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. For a chiral center, each carbon must have four different groups. In the case of the double bond in fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the other carbon in the double bond. But because the double bond is trans, the two carbons each have two identical groups (COOCH3 and H on opposite sides). However, the central carbons are each connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (but the double bond restricts rotation). Wait, actually, each carbon in the double bond has groups: COOCH3, H, and two adjacent carbons (each connected via double bond). But since the double bond is planar, there's no possibility of chirality here. The molecule is symmetrical along the central axis. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, maybe there's another possibility. If the molecule had a different arrangement, but in this case, fumarate is trans, so it's a planar molecule with symmetry, so no chiral centers. 

Therefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not. 

So putting it all together: A is benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism), B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Wait, let\'s draw this. The formula is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-. The central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl ester (COOCH3), a methyl (CH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, but wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (from the COOCH3 end) is CH2(OH), so the central carbon (the middle carbon) is CH2. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Let me check the formula. Propanoic acid has three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2, so it\'s attached to two CH2 groups (one with OH, one connected to COOCH3), and two hydrogens. Thus, no chiral center here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. The structure would be: COOR is on the third carbon. So, the three carbons are: first (CH2), second (CH(OH)), third (COOCH3). Wait, that would be HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3. But that\'s 3-methoxycarbonylpropane-1-ol. Then the central carbon (second) is CH2, so again, no chiral center. Hmm, maybe I\'m missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the correct structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is lactic acid. Wait, lactic acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, that\'s four different groups: -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3, and -H. Therefore, that carbon would be a chiral center. So this compound would have optical isomerism.\n\nBut wait, dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) with methanol. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-butenedioate. The structure is CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans. Now, looking for chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. The molecule is symmetrical. The central double bond (trans) means that the two ester groups are on opposite sides. The molecule is planar and symmetrical. There\'s no chiral center here because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (each end has two COOCH3 groups in the case of dimethyl fumarate? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons is CH-COOCH3. Wait, the structure is OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3. But each of the double bond carbons is connected to one OCOCH3 and one H. Therefore, each of those carbons has groups: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. Since double bonds have restricted rotation, but the molecule is symmetrical. However, there\'s no chiral center here because the carbons in the double bond each have two identical groups (each has COOCH3 and H, but the double bond prevents free rotation. However, the molecule is planar and symmetrical, so there\'s no chirality. Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn\'t have a chiral center.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let\'s think again. For a chiral center, a carbon must have four different substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond carbons each have a COOCH3, a H, and two carbons from the double bond. But each double bond carbon is connected to two carbons (the other double bond carbon and the COOCH3 group) and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, each double bond carbon in fumarate is connected to COOCH3, H, and two adjacent carbons (but since it\'s a double bond, each has two bonds to the other carbon). So each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. But the double bond is a double bond, so each carbon is connected to two other carbons. Therefore, each double bond carbon in dimethyl fumarate is bonded to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (as part of the double bond). Wait, perhaps each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the other two bonds are part of the double bond (so they count as a single substituent). Therefore, each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and a double bond. But for a chiral center, we need four different groups. Since the double bond is part of the structure, perhaps those carbons are not chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn\'t have any chiral centers, so it can\'t exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nOn the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it\'s the methyl ester of lactic acid, would have a chiral center at the second carbon. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) has a chiral center, so its ester should retain that. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. However, wait, the structure I thought earlier: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second one) is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That\'s four different groups, so yes, a chiral center. Hence, it would show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, compound B (which shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nWait, but the user mentions "methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate". Let me confirm.\n\nDimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to COOCH3 and H. But as I thought earlier, these carbons don\'t have four different groups. Therefore, no chiral centers. Hence, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it\'s the ester of lactic acid, would have a chiral center. Therefore, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, in that structure, the second carbon is CH2(OH), which is attached to two CH2 groups (the first carbon is CH2(OH), the second is CH2 connected to COOCH3). Wait, no, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me clarify:\n\nPropanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the carbons are:\n\n1: COOH\n\n2: CH2\n\n3: CH3\n\nSo 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the second carbon (from the COOCH3 end) is CH2, which is attached to two CH2 groups (one with OH, one connected to COOCH3) and two hydrogens. Therefore, that carbon is CH2, so no chiral center here. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the numbering. If the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be:\n\nCOOCH3 is the third carbon. The second carbon would have the hydroxyl. So:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2(OH)\n\nCarbon 2: CH2\n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3\n\nWait, that can\'t be. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. This structure has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with OH). Here, the groups attached are:\n\n- CH3 (from the first carbon)\n\n- OH\n\n- COOCH3 (ester group)\n\n- H (since the second carbon is CH(OH))\n\nWait, the second carbon would be attached to:\n\n- CH3 (from the first carbon)\n\n- OH\n\n- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)\n\n- And the hydrogen.\n\nSo that\'s four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism. So yes, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, hence optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nA: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\nB: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\nI need to verify once more.\n\nFor benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone), the structure has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. Since the ring is aromatic, any enol form would disrupt aromaticity, making the keto form much more stable. Hence, tautomerism is not feasible here.\n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a non-aromatic ring. Each ketone is adjacent to two CH2 groups, providing alpha hydrogens.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure: the central carbon (C2) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl ester group (COOCH3), a methyl group (CH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, let's draw this. The formula is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-. The central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl ester (COOCH3), a methyl (CH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, but wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl). Let's see: the groups attached to that carbon are: -OH, -CH3 (from the first carbon), -COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. So structure would be: COOCH3 is the ester group on the third carbon. The second carbon has the hydroxyl. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, that's 3-(methoxycarbonyl)propane-1-ol? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3, but esterified. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the second carbon (from the COOCH3 end) is CH2(OH), so the central carbon (the middle carbon) is CH2. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Let me check the formula. Propanoic acid has three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2, so it's attached to two CH2 groups (one with OH, one connected to COOCH3), and two hydrogens. Thus, no chiral center here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. The structure would be: COOR is on the third carbon. So, the three carbons are: first (CH2), second (CH(OH)), third (COOCH3). Wait, that would be HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3. But that's 3-methoxycarbonylpropane-1-ol. Then the central carbon (second) is CH2, so again, no chiral center. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is lactic acid. Wait, lactic acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four different groups: -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3, and -H. Therefore, that carbon would be a chiral center. So this compound would have optical isomerism.

But wait, dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) with methanol. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-butenedioate. The structure is CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans. Now, looking for chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. The molecule is symmetrical. The central double bond (trans) means that the two ester groups are on opposite sides. The molecule is planar and symmetrical. There's no chiral center here because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (each end has two COOCH3 groups in the case of dimethyl fumarate? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons is CH-COOCH3. Wait, the structure is OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3. But each of the double bond carbons is connected to one OCOCH3 and one H. Therefore, each of those carbons has groups: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. Since double bonds have restricted rotation, but the molecule is symmetrical. However, there's no chiral center here because the carbons in the double bond each have two identical groups (each has COOCH3 and H, but the double bond prevents free rotation. However, the molecule is planar and symmetrical, so there's no chirality. Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. For a chiral center, a carbon must have four different substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond carbons each have a COOCH3, a H, and two carbons from the double bond. But each double bond carbon is connected to two carbons (the other double bond carbon and the COOCH3 group) and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, each double bond carbon in fumarate is connected to COOCH3, H, and two adjacent carbons (but since it's a double bond, each has two bonds to the other carbon). So each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. But the double bond is a double bond, so each carbon is connected to two other carbons. Therefore, each double bond carbon in dimethyl fumarate is bonded to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (as part of the double bond). Wait, perhaps each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the other two bonds are part of the double bond (so they count as a single substituent). Therefore, each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and a double bond. But for a chiral center, we need four different groups. Since the double bond is part of the structure, perhaps those carbons are not chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it's the methyl ester of lactic acid, would have a chiral center at the second carbon. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) has a chiral center, so its ester should retain that. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. However, wait, the structure I thought earlier: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second one) is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That's four different groups, so yes, a chiral center. Hence, it would show optical isomerism.

Therefore, compound B (which shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but the user mentions "methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate". Let me confirm.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to COOCH3 and H. But as I thought earlier, these carbons don't have four different groups. Therefore, no chiral centers. Hence, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it's the ester of lactic acid, would have a chiral center. Therefore, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, I should double-check the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, in that structure, the second carbon is CH2(OH), which is attached to two CH2 groups (the first carbon is CH2(OH), the second is CH2 connected to COOCH3). Wait, no, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me clarify:

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the carbons are:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH3

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the second carbon (from the COOCH3 end) is CH2, which is attached to two CH2 groups (one with OH, one connected to COOCH3) and two hydrogens. Therefore, that carbon is CH2, so no chiral center here. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the numbering. If the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is the third carbon. The second carbon would have the hydroxyl. So:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. This structure has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with OH). Here, the groups attached are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)

- OH

- COOCH3 (ester group)

- H (since the second carbon is CH(OH))

Wait, the second carbon would be attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)

- OH

- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)

- And the hydrogen.

So that's four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism. So yes, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, hence optical isomerism.

Therefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So summarizing:

A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

I need to verify once more.

For benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone), the structure has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. Since the ring is aromatic, any enol form would disrupt aromaticity, making the keto form much more stable. Hence, tautomerism is not feasible here.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a non-aromatic ring. Each ketone is adjacent to two CH2 groups, providing alpha hydrogens. These can tautomerize to enol forms, possibly leading to conjugated enol structures, allowing for tautomerism.

For optical isomerism in B:

Dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond but no chiral centers. Its structure is symmetrical, so it doesn't have enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (if structured as the ester of lactic acid) has a chiral center and thus can exist as two enantiomers, showing optical isomerism.

Thus, the answers are:

A: Benzoquinone

B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

Let's break down the structure. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3-C(OH)-COOH. When esterified with a methyl group, the structure becomes CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, but the central carbon here is connected to the following: looking at 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure would be:

O
|
CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps I need to correct that. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: -OH, -CH3 (from the first carbon), -COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. Let's list the substituents:

- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- One methyl group (CH3)
- One ester group (COOCH3)
- One hydrogen (H)

So, does this carbon have four different groups? Let's see: COOCH3 is an ester group. The other groups are CH3, OH, and H. Wait, but the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH (on C2)
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- H (on C2)

Yes, all four substituents are different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the compound capable of optical isomerism (enantiomers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of 1,2-dicarboxylate. Wait, correction: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's check. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The esterification would replace the hydroxyls with OCH3. So, structure would be OCH2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me structure it properly. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond in trans. The ester would replace the acidic hydrogens with methyl groups. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The central part is the trans double bond. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's examine each carbon. The carbons in the double bond (the two central carbons) each have two substituents: each is connected to a carbonyl group (COOCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, the structure is OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OCH3. Wait, perhaps more accurately:

The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)-OCH3. The two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans). Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to a carbonyl group and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons has two substituents: one carbonyl and one hydrogen. The other two bonds are the double bond. Therefore, neither of these carbons is a chiral center. The other carbons are part of the ester groups (OCH3), which are connected to oxygen, not carbon. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. Hence, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) shows optical isomerism (B), while dimethyl fumarate does not.

To confirm, let's recheck. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The middle carbon (CHOH) is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four different groups, so yes, a chiral center. Therefore, optical isomerism exists. 

Dimethyl fumarate: The central double bond (trans) means there's no possibility for different substituents on the double bond carbons. Each double bond carbon has one COOCH3 and one H. Since the double bond is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, but each carbon in the double bond has only two different groups (COOCH3 and H), so they can't be chiral centers. The rest of the molecule (the ester groups) don't have any chiral centers either. So, no optical isomerism here.

Therefore, the answers are:

A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

**Final Answer**
The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{A} (benzoquinone) and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{B} (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).
