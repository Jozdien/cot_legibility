# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To find the relative speed and the total energy of the system of two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds of \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively, we proceed as follows:

### Relative Speed Calculation
Using the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the relative speed of the faster astronaut from the perspective of the slower astronaut:
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
where \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):
\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

Summing the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}\).

Okay, so I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system with two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. Hmm, let's start with the relative speed first. 

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because when things are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't use the simple Galilean addition. Instead, you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, is that applicable here? Because the velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities between different reference frames. So if one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, what's their relative speed?

Let me think. If I'm in the rest frame, both are moving to the right at 0.6c and 0.5c. So from the perspective of the slower astronaut (0.5c), how fast is the faster one (0.6c) moving? To find the relative speed, I need to switch to the rest frame of the slower astronaut and see what the speed of the faster astronaut is in that frame.

So the formula for relativistic velocity addition is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²)

Where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (0.6c), and v is the velocity of the moving frame (0.5c) relative to the original frame. So u' would be the velocity of the faster astronaut in the slower astronaut's frame.

Plugging in the numbers:

u = 0.6c

v = 0.5c

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²)

Simplify numerator: 0.1c

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c

So approximately 0.1429c, which is about 1/7th the speed of light. That seems reasonable. So the relative speed is around 0.1429c. Hmm, let me check the calculation again. 

Wait, 0.6 minus 0.5 is 0.1, right. Then denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 0.3, so 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is indeed approximately 0.142857. So that's correct. So the relative speed is (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.1429c. So that's the first part.

Now, the total energy of the system. In special relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Since they're moving in the same direction, but their velocities are different, we need to calculate each one's energy separately and then add them.

The formula for relativistic energy is:

E = γmc²

Where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c:

γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

So E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5m c²

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c:

γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

So E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641m c²

Therefore, total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5m c² + 3.4641m c² ≈ 5.9641m c²

So approximately 5.964 m c². Let me check these gamma factors again.

First astronaut: 0.6c. 0.6 squared is 0.36, 1 - 0.36 is 0.64, square root of 0.64 is 0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. That's correct. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5m c².

Second astronaut: 0.5c. 0.5 squared is 0.25, 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is approximately 0.8660, reciprocal is approximately 1.1547. Multiply by 3m gives 3.4641m c². Sum is 5.9641m c². If we want an exact form for the second gamma, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2, so 1/sqrt(3/4) is 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So 2/sqrt(3) times 3m c² is (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2*sqrt(3) m c². Since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2*1.732 ≈ 3.464. So exact expression would be 2.5 m c² + 2√3 m c². But maybe they want it in terms of exact fractions or decimals?

Alternatively, 2.5 is 5/2, and 2√3 is approximately 3.464. So maybe the answer should be left in terms of exact expressions. Let's see.

So 2.5 m c² is 5/2 m c², and 2√3 m c². So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) m c². If we combine these terms, that's the exact value. Alternatively, if they want a decimal, approximately 5.964 m c², which could be rounded to 6.0 m c². But maybe we need to keep it exact.

Alternatively, check if the problem expects the rest masses plus kinetic energies. But no, in relativity, total energy is the sum of each particle's total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic). So we have to sum their total energies.

So the answer for total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Let me compute 5/2 + 2√3 numerically. 5/2 is 2.5, 2√3 is approximately 3.464. So 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964. So approximately 5.964 m c². Depending on what the problem expects, maybe they want an exact form or a decimal. The problem says "total energy of the system," so probably exact expressions are okay.

But let me check the problem statement again. It says "two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?"

So relative speed we found as (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.1429c. And total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². But maybe I should write it as exact fractions.

Wait, let's re-express the total energy:

First astronaut: γ = 1.25 = 5/4. So energy is 2m c² * 5/4 = (10/4)m c² = (5/2)m c².

Second astronaut: γ = 2/√3. So energy is 3m c² * 2/√3 = (6/√3)m c² = 2√3 m c².

So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². That is exact.

Alternatively, if we rationalize 2√3, but it's probably okay to leave it as is.

So the final answers would be:

Relative speed: c/7 ≈ 0.1429c

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c² ≈ 5.964m c²

But let me check if the problem expects the total energy in terms of m c² with exact coefficients. The problem mentions "the total energy of the system," so unless specified, they might want the exact expression. So I think writing both in exact terms is better.

So to recap:

Relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7.

Total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c².

Therefore, those are the answers.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

Plugging in the numbers:

u = 0.6c

v = 0.5c

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²)

Simplify numerator: 0.1c

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the relative speed and the total energy of a system with two astronauts. The astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m, and they're traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. I'll begin by calculating the relative speed.

In special relativity, we can't simply subtract the two speeds like in classical mechanics because of relativistic effects. Instead, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The question is about finding how fast the faster astronaut appears to be moving from the perspective of the slower one.

To determine this, I need to transform to the reference frame of the slower astronaut (moving at 0.5c) and calculate how fast the faster astronaut (moving at 0.6c) appears to be moving in that frame.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²)

Where:
- u is the velocity of the faster astronaut in the original frame (0.6c)
- v is the velocity of the slower astronaut's frame relative to the original frame (0.5c)
- u' will give us the velocity of the faster astronaut in the slower astronaut's frame

Substituting the values:

u = 0.6c
v = 0.5c

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c × 0.5c)/c²)

Simplifying the numerator: 0.1c

I need to calculate the relative speed and total energy of a system involving two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, with velocities of 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. First, let's determine the relative speed.

In special relativity, determining relative speed isn't as simple as subtracting the two velocities, since we can't apply basic Galilean addition at relativistic speeds. Instead, we use the velocity addition formula. But is this the right approach here? The velocity addition formula is used to convert velocities between different reference frames. So, if we have one astronaut moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, what’s their relative speed?

I need to consider myself in a rest frame where both astronauts are moving to the right at 0.6c and 0.5c. From the slower astronaut's perspective (0.5c), I need to find the speed of the faster one (0.6c). To calculate the relative speed, I should shift to the rest frame of the slower astronaut to see how fast the faster astronaut moves in that frame.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²)

Here, u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (0.6c), and v is the velocity of the moving frame (0.5c) relative to the original frame. So u' represents the speed of the faster astronaut in the frame of the slower astronaut.

Now, inserting the values:

u = 0.6c

v = 0.5c

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²)

Simplifying the numerator gives us: 0.1c

That seems low, but given relativistic effects, maybe. Let me check again.\n\nYes, because velocities don\'t add linearly. So even though in classical mechanics, the relative speed would be 0.1c, in relativity, it\'s less due to the denominator. So that\'s correct. So the relative speed is (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c.\n\nOkay, so that\'s the relative speed. Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Since they are moving in the same direction, but their energies are calculated in the same rest frame, right? Because total energy is frame-dependent. The problem doesn\'t specify a frame, but since both velocities are given in the positive x-direction, I assume we\'re working in the rest frame where these velocities are measured. So we just calculate each astronaut\'s energy in that frame and add them up.\n\nThe relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So for each astronaut:\n\nFirst astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c\n\nγ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5mc²\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c\n\nγ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547\n\nSo E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²\n\nTotal energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc²\n\nHmm, so approximately 5.964mc². Let me check the exact value for precision.\n\nFirst astronaut: 2.5mc² is exact because 1.25 * 2 = 2.5.\n\nSecond astronaut: sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254...\n\nSo γ₂ = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547005...\n\nThus, E₂ = 3m * c² * 2 / sqrt(3) = (6 / sqrt(3)) mc² = 2 * sqrt(3) mc² ≈ 3.4641016mc²\n\nTherefore, total energy is 2.5mc² + 2*sqrt(3)mc² ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641016 ≈ 5.9641016mc²\n\nSo if we write it more precisely, maybe we can leave it in terms of sqrt(3) for exactness. Let\'s see:\n\n2.5 is 5/2, and 2*sqrt(3) is 2√3. So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) mc². Alternatively, factor out mc²: (5/2 + 2√3) mc². But maybe the question expects a decimal approximation? The problem says "total energy of the system," so probably either exact form or approximate is okay, but let\'s check.\n\nWait, the problem says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So they might accept an exact expression. For the relative speed, we had (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.1428c. So exact value is c/7. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7, right? 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So relative speed is c/7. So that\'s exact. So maybe we can write that as (1/7)c.\n\nFor the total energy, 2.5mc² + 2√3 mc². Let\'s see, 2.5 is 5/2, so combining terms:\n\nTotal energy = (5/2 + 2√3) mc²\n\nAlternatively, factor out mc²: E_total = mc²(5/2 + 2√3). That\'s an exact form. Alternatively, if they want a decimal, approximately 5.964 mc². But the problem might prefer exact terms. Let me check if 5/2 + 2√3 can be simplified more. Probably not, so that\'s the exact answer. Alternatively, writing both terms with denominator 2:\n\n5/2 + (4√3)/2 = (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². That might be a neater way. Let me compute 5 + 4√3 over 2.\n\nYes, so (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects that. Alternatively, they might want the decimal approximation. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says "total energy of the system," without specifying. Since the velocities are given as decimals (0.6c and 0.5c), maybe they expect a decimal approximation. Let\'s confirm the approximate value:\n\n5/2 is 2.5, 4√3 is approximately 4*1.732 = 6.928, so 2.5 + 6.928 = 9.428, divided by 2 is 4.714. Wait, wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5/2 + 2√3 is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964. So if I write (5 + 4√3)/2, that would be (5 + 6.928)/2 = 11.928/2 = 5.964. Yes, correct. So both forms are equivalent.\n\nSo, either exact form (5 + 4√3)/2 mc² or approximately 5.964 mc².\n\nBut since in the velocity addition we had an exact answer (c/7), maybe the problem expects exact expressions. Let me check the problem statement again. The masses are given as 2m and 3m, which are exact, and velocities 0.6c and 0.5c. So maybe the answer should be in terms of c and m, with exact coefficients. For the relative speed, c/7 is exact. For the total energy, (5/2 + 2√3) mc² is exact. Alternatively, combining over a common denominator as (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². Either way is fine, but perhaps the first form is simpler.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of gamma factors multiplied by the rest masses. Let me check. For the first astronaut, 2m, gamma is 1.25, so 1.25*2m c² = 2.5mc². Second astronaut, gamma is 2/sqrt(3), so 3m * 2/sqrt(3) * c² = 6/sqrt(3) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c². So total energy is 2.5 + 2 sqrt(3) times mc², which is the same as before.\n\nSo I think writing it as (5/2 + 2√3) mc² is the exact answer, and the relative speed is c/7.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nRelative speed: c/7\n\nTotal energy: (5/2 + 2√3) mc² ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. For the total energy, since energy is additive in relativity (in a given frame), so yes, just sum the individual relativistic energies. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the rest mass of the system, that would be more complicated, but it\'s asking for total energy in the given frame, which is straightforward.\n\nSo I think that\'s all. Let me recap:\n\nRelative speed calculated via velocity addition formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7.\n\nTotal energy: sum of each astronaut\'s relativistic energy. First astronaut: 2.5 mc², second astronaut: 2√3 mc² ≈ 3.464 mc². Total ≈ 5.964 mc². Exact form: (5/2 + 2√3) mc².\n\nTherefore, the answers should be c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3) mc².\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe relative speed is \\boxed{\\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{5}{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} \\right) mc^2}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745387002, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2681, prompt_tokens=472, total_tokens=3153, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the relative speed and the total energy of the system of two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively, we proceed as follows:

1. **Relative Speed Calculation**:
   - Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
     \[
     u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
     \]
   - Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut). Plugging in the values:
     \[
     u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
     \]
   - The relative speed is \(\frac{c}{7}\).

2. **Total Energy Calculation**:
   - The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor.
   - For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
     \[
     \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
     \]
     \[
     E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
     \]
   - For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
     \[
     \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c

Wait, so the relative speed is approximately 0.1428 times the speed of light? That seems low, but given relativistic effects, maybe. Let me check again.

Yes, because velocities don't add linearly. So even though in classical mechanics, the relative speed would be 0.1c, in relativity, it's less due to the denominator. So that's correct. So the relative speed is (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c.

Okay, so that's the relative speed. Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Since they are moving in the same direction, but their energies are calculated in the same rest frame, right? Because total energy is frame-dependent. The problem doesn't specify a frame, but since both velocities are given in the positive x-direction, I assume we're working in the rest frame where these velocities are measured. So we just calculate each astronaut's energy in that frame and add them up.

The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So for each astronaut:

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c

γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

So E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5mc²

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c

γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

So E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²

Total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc²

Hmm, so approximately 5.964mc². Let me check the exact value for precision.

First astronaut: 2.5mc² is exact because 1.25 * 2 = 2.5.

Second astronaut: sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254...

So γ₂ = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547005...

Thus, E₂ = 3m * c² * 2 / sqrt(3) = (6 / sqrt(3)) mc² = 2 * sqrt(3) mc² ≈ 3.4641016mc²

Therefore, total energy is 2.5mc² + 2*sqrt(3)mc² ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641016 ≈ 5.9641016mc²

So if we write it more precisely, maybe we can leave it in terms of sqrt(3) for exactness. Let's see:

2.5 is 5/2, and 2*sqrt(3) is 2√3. So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) mc². Alternatively, factor out mc²: (5/2 + 2√3) mc². But maybe the question expects a decimal approximation? The problem says "total energy of the system," so probably either exact form or approximate is okay, but let's check.

Wait, the problem says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So they might accept an exact expression. For the relative speed, we had (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.1428c. So exact value is c/7. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7, right? 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So relative speed is c/7. So that's exact. So maybe we can write that as (1/7)c.

For the total energy, 2.5mc² + 2√3 mc². Let's see, 2.5 is 5/2, so combining terms:

Total energy = (5/2 + 2√3) mc²

Alternatively, factor out mc²: E_total = mc²(5/2 + 2√3). That's an exact form. Alternatively, if they want a decimal, approximately 5.964 mc². But the problem might prefer exact terms. Let me check if 5/2 + 2√3 can be simplified more. Probably not, so that's the exact answer. Alternatively, writing both terms with denominator 2:

5/2 + (4√3)/2 = (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². That might be a neater way. Let me compute 5 + 4√3 over 2.

Yes, so (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the problem expects that. Alternatively, they might want the decimal approximation. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says "total energy of the system," without specifying. Since the velocities are given as decimals (0.6c and 0.5c), maybe they expect a decimal approximation. Let's confirm the approximate value:

5/2 is 2.5, 4√3 is approximately 4*1.732 = 6.928, so 2.5 + 6.928 = 9.428, divided by 2 is 4.714. Wait, wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5/2 + 2√3 is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964. So if I write (5 + 4√3)/2, that would be (5 + 6.928)/2 = 11.928/2 = 5.964. Yes, correct. So both forms are equivalent.

So, either exact form (5 + 4√3)/2 mc² or approximately 5.964 mc².

But since in the velocity addition we had an exact answer (c/7), maybe the problem expects exact expressions. Let me check the problem statement again. The masses are given as 2m and 3m, which are exact, and velocities 0.6c and 0.5c. So maybe the answer should be in terms of c and m, with exact coefficients. For the relative speed, c/7 is exact. For the total energy, (5/2 + 2√3) mc² is exact. Alternatively, combining over a common denominator as (5 + 4√3)/2 mc². Either way is fine, but perhaps the first form is simpler.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of gamma factors multiplied by the rest masses. Let me check. For the first astronaut, 2m, gamma is 1.25, so 1.25*2m c² = 2.5mc². Second astronaut, gamma is 2/sqrt(3), so 3m * 2/sqrt(3) * c² = 6/sqrt(3) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c². So total energy is 2.5 + 2 sqrt(3) times mc², which is the same as before.

So I think writing it as (5/2 + 2√3) mc² is the exact answer, and the relative speed is c/7.

Therefore, the final answers are:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3) mc² ≈ 5.964 mc²

But let me check if there's another approach. For the total energy, since energy is additive in relativity (in a given frame), so yes, just sum the individual relativistic energies. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the rest mass of the system, that would be more complicated, but it's asking for total energy in the given frame, which is straightforward.

So I think that's all. Let me recap:

Relative speed calculated via velocity addition formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7.

Total energy: sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. First astronaut: 2.5 mc², second astronaut: 2√3 mc² ≈ 3.464 mc². Total ≈ 5.964 mc². Exact form: (5/2 + 2√3) mc².

Therefore, the answers should be c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3) mc².

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts, we start by calculating the relative speed using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
where \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy is given by \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

The total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

Therefore, u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1429c

So the relative speed between the two astronauts is approximately 0.1429 times the speed of light.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

First, calculate the gamma factor for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

So energy E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5mc²

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

Energy E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²

Total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc²

So the total energy is approximately 5.964mc². Depending on the required precision, this can be approximated as 5.96mc² or 6.0mc², but since the problem might expect exact expressions, perhaps we can write it in exact terms.

Wait, let's check the exact values for γ₂. Since 0.75 is 3/4, sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Then γ₂ = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So exact expression for E₂ is 3m c² * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c². However, combining with E₁ which is 2.5 m c², the exact total energy would be 2.5 m c² + 6 / sqrt(3) m c². But maybe we can rationalize it. Alternatively, leave it as 5.9641 m c².

Alternatively, if we need exact forms, perhaps factor out m c²:

Total energy = (2.5 + 6 / sqrt(3)) m c². But 6/sqrt(3) is 2*sqrt(3), so:

2.5 + 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c². So yes, that's the exact expression. Depending on the problem's requirements, maybe they just want the numerical value. Let's check the problem statement again. It says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So, the relative speed is (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc², which is approximately 5.96mc². But perhaps we can write it as exact fractions and radicals. Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal answers, then 0.1429c and 5.96mc². Alternatively, maybe the exact relative velocity is (0.1/0.7)c = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c. So 1/7 c.

Therefore, the relative speed is (1/7)c, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total energy to be computed as sum of each astronaut's energy, each calculated with their respective gamma factors, which we have done. So maybe the answer is 0.1429c for relative speed and 5.96mc² for total energy. Alternatively, if exact, (1/7)c and (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

Alternatively, check if the problem wants the answer in terms of fractions:

1/7 c is exact, so that's better. For the energy:

2.5 is 5/2, and 2√3 is approximately 3.464. So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Alternatively, factor out m c² and write as (5/2 + 2√3) m c². That would be the exact answer. Alternatively, if we combine the terms over a common denominator, but that might not be necessary. So perhaps the answer is relative speed: c/7, and total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Let me verify the calculations again.

First astronaut:

Speed 0.6c, mass 2m.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. So 1.25*2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

Second astronaut:

Speed 0.5c, mass 3m.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So 3m c² * 2 / sqrt(3) = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c². Correct.

Therefore, total energy is 2.5 m c² + 2 sqrt(3) m c². So, 2.5 is 5/2, and 2 sqrt(3) is as is. So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) m c². If we rationalize, 5/2 is 2.5, and 2√3 is approximately 3.464, sum is approximately 5.964, which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Alternatively, if the problem wants the total energy in terms of exact radicals, then (5/2 + 2√3) m c² is precise, but if they want a decimal, then approximately 5.96 m c². The problem doesn't specify, but since the speeds are given as decimals (0.6c and 0.5c), maybe they expect decimal answers. However, the relative speed was exact as 1/7 c. So perhaps present both answers in exact forms where possible.

So final answers:

Relative speed: (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)mc² ≈ 5.96mc²

Alternatively, depending on the problem's requirement. But since the problem states "relativistic speeds" and asks for "relative speed and total energy", it's possible that both answers should be given in exact terms. Let me check the calculation of the relative speed again.

Using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/10)c / (7/10) = (1/7)c. So exact value is c/7. So that's exact. For the energy, 5/2 + 2√3 is exact. So perhaps present both in exact terms.

Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Alternatively, if the problem prefers decimal approximations, 0.1429c and 5.96mc².

But in physics problems, especially in exams or textbooks, exact forms are preferred unless specified otherwise. So maybe we should write the exact expressions.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

So approximately 0.1429 times the speed of light. Let me check the calculation again. 0.6 - 0.5 is 0.1, divided by 1 - (0.3) which is 0.7. Yes, 0.1 / 0.7 is about 0.142857. So, the relative speed is approximately 0.1429c. So, that\'s the relative speed between the two astronauts.\n\nNow, moving on to the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute the Lorentz factors for each astronaut.\n\nFor the first astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c:\n\nγ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v₁²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo, energy E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5m c²\n\nFor the second astronaut with mass 3m and velocity 0.5c:\n\nγ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547\n\nTherefore, energy E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641m c²\n\nTotal energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5m c² + 3.4641m c² ≈ 5.9641m c²\n\nApproximately 5.964m c². Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst astronaut: 0.6c, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. So 1.25*2m c² = 2.5m c². Correct.\n\nSecond astronaut: 0.5c, 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660, reciprocal ≈1.1547. 1.1547*3 = 3.4641. So total ≈5.9641m c².\n\nAlternatively, if we need an exact expression for the total energy, we can write sqrt(0.75) as sqrt(3)/2, so γ₂ = 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547. Therefore, E₂ = 3m c² * (2/sqrt(3)) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3)m c² ≈3.464m c². Then total energy is 2.5m c² + 2sqrt(3)m c². But maybe they want a numerical value? The question says "total energy of the system", so perhaps combining both energies. So, 5.9641m c². But since the question might prefer an exact expression, let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, for exact terms:\n\nE₁ = (5/4) * 2m c² = (5/2)m c²\n\nE₂ = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3))m c² = 2sqrt(3)m c²\n\nSo total energy E_total = (5/2 + 2sqrt(3))m c². If we rationalize, 5/2 is 2.5, 2sqrt(3) ≈3.464, so total ≈5.964m c². So, depending on the required form, exact or approximate. The problem doesn\'t specify, but since velocities are given as decimals (0.6 and 0.5), maybe approximate is acceptable. However, sometimes in physics problems, exact expressions are preferred. Let me check if the problem mentions anything. The problem says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" No specific instruction, so maybe either is okay, but to be precise, maybe present both exact and approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of m c², so (5/2 + 2√3)m c², which is exact. Alternatively, maybe as a decimal.\n\nBut let\'s check the relative speed again. The relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈0.142857c. So, 1/7 c ≈0.142857c, so exact value is (1/7)c. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7. Because 0.1 / 0.7 = (1/10)/(7/10) = 1/7. So actually, the exact value is (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.142857c. So that\'s exact. So, the relative speed is (1/7)c. That\'s a better way to present it. So, exact answer is c/7, which is approximately 0.1428c.\n\nSimilarly, for the total energy, exact answer would be (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Let\'s compute that:\n\n5/2 is 2.5, 2√3 ≈3.4641, so total ≈5.9641 m c². Alternatively, if we need to write it as a single fraction, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of exact radicals. So, maybe leave it as (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, if combined over a common denominator, but that might complicate. Alternatively, in decimal form. Let me check if the problem gives m as a variable, so the answer would be in terms of m and c.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nRelative speed: c/7 ≈0.1429c\n\nTotal energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c² ≈5.964m c²\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the total energy to be calculated in the rest frame where their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c, which is the case here. So, yes, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut\'s relativistic energy. So that\'s correct.\n\nWait, but in relativity, when calculating the total energy of a system, do we need to consider the system\'s rest mass energy or the sum of individual energies? Because in relativity, the total energy is indeed the sum of the individual relativistic energies, even if they are moving relative to each other. So, even though the astronauts are moving relative to each other, in the given frame (the rest frame of the observer who sees them moving at 0.6c and 0.5c), their total energy is indeed the sum of their individual relativistic energies. So, that calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to compute the invariant mass of the system, that would be a different quantity, but the problem asks for the total energy, which in the given frame is the sum of their energies.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Let me compute the numerical value again for the energy:\n\n5/2 = 2.5\n\n2√3 ≈3.464101615\n\nAdding them gives 2.5 + 3.464101615 ≈5.964101615 m c². So, approximately 5.964 m c². If we need to round to three decimal places, it\'s 5.964 m c².\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\nRelative speed: c/7 or approximately 0.1429c\n\nTotal energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c² or approximately 5.964m c²\n\nThe problem might prefer exact forms, so c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations, perhaps 0.143c and 5.96m c². But the question says "the relative speed and the total energy of the system" without specifying, so both exact and approximate could be acceptable. But since c/7 is exact and preferable, and for energy, the exact expression is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in some other form, but I think these are the correct expressions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem wants the numerical coefficient in terms of m c², then 5.964m c². Wait, but 5/2 + 2√3 is exactly equal to (5 + 4√3)/2, which is another way to write it, but perhaps not simpler.\n\nAlternatively, if we rationalize:\n\n2√3 is approximately 3.464, so 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, so 5.964m c².\n\nSo, unless the problem expects a specific form, both answers are acceptable, but since the relative speed is a clean fraction (1/7)c, and the total energy is a combination of fractions and radicals, it\'s better to present them in exact terms.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c².

To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system involving two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively, we proceed as follows:

### Relative Speed Calculation:
Using the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the relative speed of the faster astronaut (0.6c) from the perspective of the slower astronaut (0.5c):
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):
\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

### Total Energy Calculation:
The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor.

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3} \cdot m c^2
\]

Summing the energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 2\sqrt{3}m c^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}\).

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So, u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.1429c. So approximately 0.1429 times the speed of light. Let me check the calculation again. 0.6 - 0.5 is 0.1, divided by 1 - (0.3) which is 0.7. Yes, 0.1 / 0.7 is about 0.142857. So, the relative speed is approximately 0.1429c. So, that's the relative speed between the two astronauts.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

First, let's compute the Lorentz factors for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c:

γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v₁²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

So, energy E₁ = γ₁ * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5m c²

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and velocity 0.5c:

γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

Therefore, energy E₂ = γ₂ * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641m c²

Total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5m c² + 3.4641m c² ≈ 5.9641m c²

Approximately 5.964m c². Let me check the calculations again.

First astronaut: 0.6c, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. So 1.25*2m c² = 2.5m c². Correct.

Second astronaut: 0.5c, 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660, reciprocal ≈1.1547. 1.1547*3 = 3.4641. So total ≈5.9641m c².

Alternatively, if we need an exact expression for the total energy, we can write sqrt(0.75) as sqrt(3)/2, so γ₂ = 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547. Therefore, E₂ = 3m c² * (2/sqrt(3)) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3)m c² ≈3.464m c². Then total energy is 2.5m c² + 2sqrt(3)m c². But maybe they want a numerical value? The question says "total energy of the system", so perhaps combining both energies. So, 5.9641m c². But since the question might prefer an exact expression, let's see.

Alternatively, for exact terms:

E₁ = (5/4) * 2m c² = (5/2)m c²

E₂ = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3))m c² = 2sqrt(3)m c²

So total energy E_total = (5/2 + 2sqrt(3))m c². If we rationalize, 5/2 is 2.5, 2sqrt(3) ≈3.464, so total ≈5.964m c². So, depending on the required form, exact or approximate. The problem doesn't specify, but since velocities are given as decimals (0.6 and 0.5), maybe approximate is acceptable. However, sometimes in physics problems, exact expressions are preferred. Let me check if the problem mentions anything. The problem says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" No specific instruction, so maybe either is okay, but to be precise, maybe present both exact and approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of m c², so (5/2 + 2√3)m c², which is exact. Alternatively, maybe as a decimal.

But let's check the relative speed again. The relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈0.142857c. So, 1/7 c ≈0.142857c, so exact value is (1/7)c. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7. Because 0.1 / 0.7 = (1/10)/(7/10) = 1/7. So actually, the exact value is (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.142857c. So that's exact. So, the relative speed is (1/7)c. That's a better way to present it. So, exact answer is c/7, which is approximately 0.1428c.

Similarly, for the total energy, exact answer would be (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Let's compute that:

5/2 is 2.5, 2√3 ≈3.4641, so total ≈5.9641 m c². Alternatively, if we need to write it as a single fraction, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of exact radicals. So, maybe leave it as (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, if combined over a common denominator, but that might complicate. Alternatively, in decimal form. Let me check if the problem gives m as a variable, so the answer would be in terms of m and c.

So summarizing:

Relative speed: c/7 ≈0.1429c

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c² ≈5.964m c²

Alternatively, if the problem expects the total energy to be calculated in the rest frame where their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c, which is the case here. So, yes, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. So that's correct.

Wait, but in relativity, when calculating the total energy of a system, do we need to consider the system's rest mass energy or the sum of individual energies? Because in relativity, the total energy is indeed the sum of the individual relativistic energies, even if they are moving relative to each other. So, even though the astronauts are moving relative to each other, in the given frame (the rest frame of the observer who sees them moving at 0.6c and 0.5c), their total energy is indeed the sum of their individual relativistic energies. So, that calculation is correct.

Alternatively, if we were to compute the invariant mass of the system, that would be a different quantity, but the problem asks for the total energy, which in the given frame is the sum of their energies.

Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Let me compute the numerical value again for the energy:

5/2 = 2.5

2√3 ≈3.464101615

Adding them gives 2.5 + 3.464101615 ≈5.964101615 m c². So, approximately 5.964 m c². If we need to round to three decimal places, it's 5.964 m c².

So, the final answers are:

Relative speed: c/7 or approximately 0.1429c

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c² or approximately 5.964m c²

The problem might prefer exact forms, so c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations, perhaps 0.143c and 5.96m c². But the question says "the relative speed and the total energy of the system" without specifying, so both exact and approximate could be acceptable. But since c/7 is exact and preferable, and for energy, the exact expression is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in some other form, but I think these are the correct expressions.

Alternatively, if the problem wants the numerical coefficient in terms of m c², then 5.964m c². Wait, but 5/2 + 2√3 is exactly equal to (5 + 4√3)/2, which is another way to write it, but perhaps not simpler.

Alternatively, if we rationalize:

2√3 is approximately 3.464, so 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, so 5.964m c².

So, unless the problem expects a specific form, both answers are acceptable, but since the relative speed is a clean fraction (1/7)c, and the total energy is a combination of fractions and radicals, it's better to present them in exact terms.

Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². Alternatively, written as (5 + 4√3)/2 m c². But perhaps the problem expects the answer in decimal form. Let me check the original problem again.

The original problem states: "Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?"

No specific instructions on the form of the answer, so likely, exact expressions are preferred. Therefore:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c²

Alternatively, combining the terms:

(5 + 4√3)/2 m c²

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of combined radicals. Wait, 5/2 + 2√3 is the same as (5 + 4√3)/2. So, that's another way to write it. But both are correct.

Alternatively, if there's a need to rationalize the denominator for the energy terms, but in this case, denominators are already rational. So, either form is okay.

Therefore, the answers are:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c²

Or, written as:

Relative speed: \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}

Total energy: \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}

Alternatively, if decimal approximations are acceptable, but since the problem uses exact fractions (0.6c, 0.5c), perhaps the exact form is better.

Yes, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}.
