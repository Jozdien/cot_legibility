# Original Question

You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to the **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** in the receptor-eGFP construct, which is not recognized by Cre recombinase expressed under the SOX10 promoter. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand (fused to mCherry) has a **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette, while the receptor (fused to eGFP) has a **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette.
   - **Cre recombinase from SOX10-Cre mice** specifically acts on **loxP sites**, excising the stop codon in the ligand-mCherry construct. This allows mCherry expression in SOX10-expressing cells (neural crest derivatives).
   - **lox2272** is a mutant variant incompatible with Cre recombinase. The stop codon in the receptor-eGFP construct remains intact, preventing eGFP expression.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The use of **lox2272** for the receptor ensures that only the ligand-mCherry fusion is activated by Cre. The receptor-eGFP stop cassette persists, blocking translation of the fluorescent tag despite Cre activity.

3. **Why Other Explanations Fail**:
   - The IRES element and CBA promoter function correctly, as evidenced by Western blot detection of ligand/receptor proteins (without fluorescent tags) in transfected astrocytes.
   - SOX10-Cre activity is not the issue, as it successfully removes the loxP-stop-loxP cassette (mCherry would be expressed if monitored).

**Conclusion**: The receptor's lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not excised by Cre, leaving the eGFP untranslated. This design choice explains the lack of green fluorescence.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about why there's no green fluorescence (eGFP) observed in the offspring when they cross the transgenic mouse with the SOX10-Cre mice. Let's start by understanding the setup.

First, the construct they created is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, right? The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. The promoter for the ligand is CBA, which I think is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under an IRES element. IRES allows for the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic vector without needing a separate promoter, so both genes can be expressed from the same mRNA, but the second one (receptor here) is translated less efficiently usually.

Now, between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These lox sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop codons are in between, so normally, the stop cassette would prevent the expression of the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) unless Cre is present to excise the stop cassette.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes and did a Western blot. The total proteins showed a signal proportional to actin, which probably means they normalized the loading. The antibodies detected the overexpressed proteins. Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, so the Cre should be active in those cells. The offspring would inherit the construct and the Cre. But when they look under the microscope, there's no green signal. The question is why.

Possible reasons:

1. The Cre isn't active in the cells they're looking at. But SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest derivatives. If the offspring are born, maybe the Cre was active during development. But maybe the cells they're looking at in the born offspring don't express SOX10 anymore? Wait, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which give rise to various cell types like glia, melanocytes, etc. Astrocytes might be derived from neural crest in some regions, but primary astrocytes in culture might not have Cre activity. Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection into primary astrocytes, which might not be the same as the in vivo experiment. The mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, so in the offspring, any cell that expresses SOX10 would have Cre, which would excise the stop cassettes. But if the construct is only active in neural crest cells, and maybe the receptor's expression depends on Cre recombination.

Wait, the construct has two stop cassettes with different lox sites: loxP and lox2272. Cre recombinase acts on loxP sites. lox2272 is a mutant variant that's incompatible with loxP; Cre can't recombine lox2272. Wait, noâ€”if the Cre is from SOX10-Cre, then it should only act on loxP sites, not lox2272. So the loxP-stop-loxP cassette in the ligand-mCherry would be excised by Cre, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette in the receptor-eGFP would not be affected by Cre, because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP would remain with the stop codon in place, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain why there's no green signal. But wait, the question says they used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, maybe the construct is designed so that both cassettes are loxP? But the problem states that the receptor has a lox2272 cassette. If that's the case, then Cre (which acts on loxP) can't remove the stop cassette in the receptor-eGFP. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed, hence no green signal. However, the ligand-mCherry would have the loxP-stop-loxP, which would be excised by Cre, so mCherry would be expressed. But the question says they don't observe green. So if the receptor's stop cassette is using lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre, then even in the presence of Cre, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. That's probably the answer.

But wait, why would they use lox2272 for the receptor? Maybe the idea is to have independent control over the two cassettes. For example, if they wanted to use a different Cre that recognizes lox2272 for the receptor. But in this case, they only used SOX10-Cre, which uses regular Cre. So the receptor's stop cassette isn't excised, hence eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the lack of green signal is because the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre. That's the most likely reason.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES element is not working, but the Western blot in transfected astrocytes showed expression. Wait, the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection. The plasmid would have the CBA promoter driving the ligand, then IRES driving the receptor. But in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would block mCherry and eGFP. Wait, but the problem says they overexpressed the proteins and used antibodies against them. So maybe in the Western blot, they saw the ligand and receptor proteins (without the fluorescent tags) because the stop cassettes are present. But when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, the stop cassettes would prevent the fluorescent proteins from being expressed unless Cre is present. But the Western blot detected the proteins, so maybe the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor proteins, not the fluorescent tags. So the construct allows expression of ligand and receptor (since their ORFs are before the stop cassettes), but the fluorescent tags are only expressed if Cre is present. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The ORF for the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So the mRNA would be: ligand ORF -> stop codon (flanked by loxP) -> mCherry. So in the absence of Cre, the stop codon is present, so the ligand is translated, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, receptor ORF is followed by a stop codon (lox2272) and then eGFP. So receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the problem says the ligand is under the CBA promoter and the receptor is under IRES. So the mRNA is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (with stop before mCherry) -> IRES -> receptor ORF (with stop before eGFP). So in transfected cells, without Cre, the ligand is expressed (without mCherry), and the receptor is expressed (without eGFP). The Western blot would detect the ligand and receptor proteins (using their antibodies), which are present. The fluorescent proteins are not expressed because the stops are in place. But when Cre is present, the stops are excised, so mCherry and eGFP would be fused to the ligand and receptor, respectively. But in the mouse experiment, they used SOX10-Cre. So in cells where SOX10 is active, Cre is expressed, which should excise the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites are not affected. Therefore, in those cells, the ligand would be fused to mCherry (since the loxP-stop is removed), and the receptor would still have the lox2272-stop, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the green signal (eGFP) wouldn't be observed because the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre. Therefore, the answer is that the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is not functional in the mice, but the Western blot showed expression in transfected cells. Since the receptor is after IRES, in the construct, but in the Western blot, they might have seen the receptor protein (without eGFP) because the stop is in place. But the problem states that the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins, so they detected ligand and receptor. The fluorescent tags are separate. Therefore, in the mice, when Cre is active, the ligand-mCherry fusion is expressed (since loxP is recombined), but the receptor-eGFP remains with the stop, so no GFP. Therefore, the reason for no green signal is the use of lox2272 for the receptor's stop cassette, which isn't recognized by Cre. So the answer is that the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by SOX10-Cre, so eGFP is not expressed.

Let me analyze this problem systematically. This question investigates the absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in offspring resulting from crossing transgenic mice with SOX10-Cre mice. I'll examine the experimental design carefully.

The researchers created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector containing two genes. The 5' position holds the ligand ORF fused to mCherry, while the 3' position contains the receptor ORF fused to eGFP. The ligand is controlled by the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is regulated by an IRES element, which enables translation of the second gene from the same mRNA transcript, though typically with reduced efficiency compared to the first gene.

Importantly, a loxP-stop-loxP cassette is positioned between the ligand ORF and mCherry. Similarly, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette sits between the receptor and eGFP. These lox sites are specifically recognized by Cre recombinase. The stop codons within these cassettes normally prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre recombinase is present to remove the stop cassettes.

In their experiments, the researchers transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes and performed Western blot analysis. The total protein signals appeared proportional to actin, suggesting proper loading normalization. The antibodies successfully detected the overexpressed proteins. Subsequently, they developed a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background and crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Since SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, Cre should be active in these cell populations. The offspring would inherit both the construct and Cre recombinase. However, microscopic examination revealed no green fluorescence signal.

Potential explanations include:

1. Cre recombinase may not be active in the examined cells, though SOX10-Cre should be expressed in neural crest derivatives. If the offspring survived, perhaps the Cre was active but...

# OpenAI completion

Sure, I'll work through the problem step by step to figure out why there's no green fluorescence (eGFP) seen in the offspring when they cross the transgenic mouse with SOX10-Cre mice. Let's first break down what's happening.

Initially, we need to understand the construct, which is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means there are two genes in the construct. The ligand ORF is located at the 5' end and is fused to mCherry, while the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The promoter controlling the ligand is CBA, presumably a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor's expression is regulated by an IRES element, which facilitates the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic setup without a separate promoter, allowing both genes to be expressed from the same mRNA, albeit with generally lower efficiency for the second gene (receptor in this case).

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These lox sites serve as Cre recombinase recognition sites. The stop codons usually block the expression of mCherry and eGFP unless Cre recombinase is present to remove the stop cassette.

In their experiment, they transfected this plasmid into primary astrocytes and conducted a Western blot. Total protein levels were normalized to actin, indicating that they likely adjusted the loading accordingly. Antibodies detected the proteins that were overexpressed. They then developed a mouse model homozygous for the construct within a wild-type background and crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Since SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, Cre should be active in these cells, meaning the offspring should carry both the construct and Cre. However, under the microscope, there's no green fluorescence observed. The question is why.

Possible explanations include:

1. Cre may not be active in the cells being examined. However, SOX10-Cre is expected to be active in derivatives of neural crest cells. If the offspring are viable, it suggests that the Cre might have been active at some point.

So the Western blot using antibodies against the ligand and receptor would detect them, but the fluorescent proteins would not be expressed. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they could detect the ligand and receptor proteins (without the fluorescent tags) because the stop cassettes block the fluorescent proteins. Then, when they make the mouse model, the construct is present. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in cells where SOX10 is active (neural crest-derived cells). So in those cells, the mCherry and eGFP would be expressed. But in the offspring, they don\'t see green. So maybe only the mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP. Why? Because the receptor\'s stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre. Cre only acts on loxP sites. Therefore, the receptor\'s stop cassette (lox2272) remains, so eGFP is not expressed. The ligand\'s stop cassette (loxP) is excised by Cre, so mCherry is expressed. But the question says they don\'t observe green. So the answer is that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre, so the receptor\'s stop cassette isn\'t removed, preventing eGFP expression. That makes sense. The key is that loxP and lox2272 are different variants. Cre recombinase acts on loxP, but not on lox2272. Therefore, the receptor\'s stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn\'t expressed, hence no green signal. The ligand\'s stop is loxP, which is excised, so mCherry is expressed. But the question says they don\'t see green. Therefore, the answer is that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not excised by Cre, so the receptor remains fused to eGFP but the stop codon is still present, preventing eGFP expression. Alternatively, the presence of the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP prevents the eGFP from being translated unless the stop is removed. Since Cre doesn\'t act on lox2272, the stop remains, so no eGFP. That\'s the most likely reason.

So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they could detect the ligand and receptor proteins (without the fluorescent tags) because the stop cassettes block the fluorescent proteins. Then, when they make the mouse model, the construct is present. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in cells where SOX10 is active (neural crest-derived cells). So in those cells, the mCherry and eGFP would be expressed. But in the offspring, they don't see green. So maybe only the mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP. Why? Because the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre. Cre only acts on loxP sites. Therefore, the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) remains, so eGFP is not expressed. The ligand's stop cassette (loxP) is excised by Cre, so mCherry is expressed. But the question says they don't observe green. So the answer is that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre, so the receptor's stop cassette isn't removed, preventing eGFP expression. That makes sense. The key is that loxP and lox2272 are different variants. Cre recombinase acts on loxP, but not on lox2272. Therefore, the receptor's stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal. The ligand's stop is loxP, which is excised, so mCherry is expressed. But the question says they don't see green. Therefore, the answer is that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not excised by Cre, so the receptor remains fused to eGFP but the stop codon is still present, preventing eGFP expression. Alternatively, the presence of the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP prevents the eGFP from being translated unless the stop is removed. Since Cre doesn't act on lox2272, the stop remains, so no eGFP. That's the most likely reason. So the answer is that the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by SOX10-Cre, hence the eGFP is not expressed.

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to the **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remaining intact**, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP but separated by a **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette**.  
   - Cre recombinase specifically targets **loxP** sites, not the mutant **lox2272** variant, which has a different spacer sequence.  

2. **Cre Activity**:  
   - SOX10-Cre drives recombination in neural crest-derived cells, excising **loxP** cassettes.  
   - The ligand-mCherry fusion (controlled by a **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette) would have its stop codon removed, allowing mCherry expression.  
   - The **lox2272** cassette upstream of the receptor-eGFP is unaffected by Cre, leaving the stop codon in place and blocking eGFP translation.  

3. **Outcome**:  
   - Red fluorescence (mCherry) would be observed if Cre is active, but green fluorescence (eGFP) remains absent due to the intact lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  

**Conclusion**: The lox2272 cassette is incompatible with Cre recombinase, preventing receptor-eGFP expression despite successful Cre-loxP recombination for the ligand-mCherry.

So the answer would be that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette isn\'t recombined by Cre (which acts on loxP), so the eGFP remains silenced. Therefore, the correct explanation is that the receptor\'s stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre, and thus the eGFP isn\'t expressed. The Cre in the SOX10-Cre mice can only act on loxP, not lox2272. Thus, the mCherry (ligand) would have the loxP-stop-loxP excised, so mCherry is expressed, but the receptor\'s eGFP is still under the lox2272-stop, which isn\'t removed, so no GFP.

But when they made the mouse model, and crossed with Cre, the GFP isn\'t observed.

Unless the plasmid was co-transfected with Cre, but the problem doesn\'t say that. Wait, the Western blot is after plasmid transfection. The construct has stop cassettes. Unless the astrocytes have Cre, the proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) wouldn\'t be expressed. But the problem says they "use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading." So maybe in the plasmid, the stop cassettes are present, but when transfected into cells without Cre, the proteins shouldn\'t be expressed. But the Western blot detected the proteins. That suggests that maybe in the plasmid, the stop cassettes are not properly blocking expression. Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in a way that allows some leaky expression. However, the problem states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them for Western blot. So maybe they transfected the construct into cells along with Cre to excise the stops, allowing expression. But the problem doesn\'t mention Cre in the transfection. Alternatively, the stop cassettes are in introns, but the question states "between the ligand ORF and mCherry" and "between the receptor and the eGFP", so it\'s likely that the stop cassettes are in the coding sequence. Therefore, without Cre, the stop codons would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. But they saw signals on Western blot, so perhaps the construct in the plasmid was designed without the stop cassettes, or maybe they used a different method. Wait, maybe the description is that the stop is in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the stop codon is present, preventing the mCherry and eGFP from being translated.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid was transfected along with Cre, leading to excision of the stops, allowing expression for antibody production. But the problem states that the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins. Then when they test the construct in Western blot after transfection (without Cre?), but if the stops are present, the proteins wouldn\'t be expressed.

Then, without Cre, the stop codon would be present, so the ligand is expressed (since the stop is after the ligand ORF), and mCherry is not. Wait, no. The fusion is "ligand ORF at the 5\' position, fused to mCherry; ... between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette." So the construct is: ligand ORF followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. So the mRNA would be ligand ORF, then a stop codon, then mCherry. Therefore, without Cre, the translation would stop after the ligand ORF, and mCherry wouldn\'t be translated. So the ligand would be expressed (as a separate protein), and mCherry is not. But if Cre is present, the loxP sites recombine, excising the stop, so the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. Similarly for the receptor: receptor ORF followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. Without Cre, the receptor is expressed (since the stop is after the receptor ORF), and eGFP is not. With Cre, if the lox sites are compatible, the stop is removed, and receptor is fused to eGFP. However, in their Western blot after plasmid transfection into astrocytes, they saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps they transfected the plasmid into cells without Cre, leading to expression of ligand and receptor (without the fluorescent tags), which are detected by antibodies.
