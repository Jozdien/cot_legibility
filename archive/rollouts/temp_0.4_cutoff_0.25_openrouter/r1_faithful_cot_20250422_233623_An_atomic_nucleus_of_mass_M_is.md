The atomic nucleus with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV undergoes fission into two fragments with rest masses in the ratio 2:1. The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. The goal is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values of the more massive fragment.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initial rest mass energy, \( M c^2 = 300 \) GeV.
   - Total rest mass of fragments: \( 0.99M = 297 \) GeV.
   - Rest masses of fragments: \( m_1 = 198 \) GeV/\(c^2\) (more massive), \( m_2 = 99 \) GeV/\(c^2\) (less massive).
   - Total kinetic energy released: \( 3 \) GeV.

2. **Relativistic Calculation:**
   - Conservation of energy: \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \) GeV.
   - Conservation of momentum: \( |p_1| = |p_2| \).
   - Using relativistic energy-moment relation: \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \).
   - Solving for \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):
     - \( E_1 - E_2 = \frac{(m_1^2 - m_2^2)c^4}{300 \text{ GeV}} = 98.01 \) GeV.
     - \( E_1 = 199.005 \) GeV, \( E_2 = 100.995 \) GeV.
   - Kinetic energies: \( T_1 = E_1 - m_1 c^2 = 1.005 \) GeV, \( T_2 = E_2 - m_2 c^2 = 1.995 \) GeV.

3. **Classical Calculation:**
   - Momentum conservation: \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \Rightarrow v_2 = 2v_1 \).
   - Total kinetic energy: \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \) GeV.
   - Solving for \( T_1 \):
     - \( 3m_2 v_1^2 = 3 \) GeV \(\Rightarrow m_2 v_1^2 = 1 \) GeV.
     - \( T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \) GeV.

4. **Difference:**
   - Relativistic \( T_1 \): 1.005 GeV.
   - Classical \( T_1 \): 1 GeV.
   - Difference: \( 1.005 \text{ GeV} - 1 \text{ GeV} = 0.005 \text{ GeV} = 5 \text{ MeV} \).

\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation of T1 for the more massive fragment after a spontaneous fission. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the atomic nucleus is initially at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, the initial mass is M = 300 GeV/c². After fission, the total rest mass of the fragments is 0.99M. That means some mass has been converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, the mass deficit is converted into energy according to E=mc². But here, since it's fission, the total rest mass of the products is less than the original, so the difference is the kinetic energy released.

But wait, actually, the total energy is conserved. The initial rest mass energy is Mc². After fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, and they also have kinetic energies. The sum of their rest masses is 0.99M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99M. But the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) should equal the initial rest mass energy, right? So, the kinetic energy of both fragments comes from the mass deficit of 0.01M. Therefore, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 0.01M c². But since we are dealing with GeV units, maybe c² is already factored in? Let me check. The rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV. Therefore, the total kinetic energy released would be 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But the problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So m1 = 2m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Therefore, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M. So m2 = 0.33M, and m1 = 0.66M. Wait, 0.99/3 is 0.33, yes. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M. So their rest masses are 0.66*300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c² and 0.33*300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c². Wait, but 198 + 99 is 297 GeV/c², which is 0.99*300, correct.

Now, the nucleus splits into these two fragments, and we need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So first, let's recall that in any decay or fission where the initial object is at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Because momentum is conserved. So the initial momentum is zero, so the final momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. So |p1| = |p2|.

But since their masses are different, their velocities and kinetic energies will be different. To find their kinetic energies, we need to apply conservation of energy and momentum, considering relativistic equations.

But in the classical approximation, we can use the non-relativistic formulas. The difference between the two will be the answer.

First, let's do the relativistic calculation.

Let me denote:

M_initial = 300 GeV/c²

m1 = 0.66M_initial = 198 GeV/c²

m2 = 0.33M_initial = 99 GeV/c²

Total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (as calculated before)

But in reality, the total energy is the sum of the rest masses plus kinetic energies. Wait, actually, the rest mass energy of the products is 0.99M_initial c², and the total energy should be equal to the initial rest mass energy, which is M_initial c². Therefore, the kinetic energy is (M_initial c² - (m1 + m2)c²) = (300 - 297) GeV = 3 GeV. So yes, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So for fragment 1: E1 = m1 c² + T1, and similarly E2 = m2 c² + T2. Then, E1 + E2 = M_initial c². So (m1 + m2)c² + T1 + T2 = M_initial c². Therefore, T1 + T2 = (M_initial - m1 - m2)c² = 3 GeV, as before.

But we need to find T1. To do this, we can use conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments must be equal. So |p1| = |p2|.

In relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But energy is E = γmc². So we can write p = γmv = (E/(c²)) v. Therefore, p1 = (E1 / c²) v1 and p2 = (E2 / c²) v2. Since |p1| = |p2|, then (E1 / c²) |v1| = (E2 / c²) |v2|. Therefore, E1 v1 = E2 v2. But velocities are in opposite directions.

Alternatively, since momentum is a vector, p1 + p2 = 0. So p1 = -p2. Therefore, their magnitudes are equal.

So, let's express p1 and p2 in terms of their energies and masses.

In relativity, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So for each fragment:

E1² = (p1 c)² + (m1 c²)²

E2² = (p2 c)² + (m2 c²)²

But since p1 = -p2, then |p1| = |p2| = p. Let's denote p1 = p, p2 = -p.

Therefore:

E1² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²

E2² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²

We also know that E1 + E2 = M_initial c² = 300 GeV

So we have two equations:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1² - E2² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)² - [(p c)² + (m2 c²)²] = (m1² - m2²)c^4

But E1² - E2² = (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = (m1² - m2²)c^4 / c² = (m1² - m2²)c²

Wait, let's compute E1² - E2²:

E1² - E2² = (p²c² + m1²c^4) - (p²c² + m2²c^4) = (m1² - m2²)c^4

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, so:

(E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = (m1² - m2²)c^4

Therefore, E1 - E2 = [(m1² - m2²)c^4] / (300 GeV)

But c² is in units of GeV/(GeV/c²) )? Wait, let me check the units.

Actually, if we have m1 and m2 in GeV/c², then m1²c^4 is (GeV²/c^4) * c^4 = GeV². So E1 and E2 are in GeV, so E1² - E2² is in GeV². Similarly, (m1² - m2²)c^4 would be (GeV²/c^4)c^4 = GeV². So units are consistent.

Therefore, E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)c^4 / (300 GeV c²)? Wait, no. Wait, let's see:

Wait, in the equation:

(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1² - m2²)c^4

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

So (E1 - E2) = (m1² - m2²)c^4 / (E1 + E2)

But E1 + E2 is 300 GeV. So:

E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)c^4 / (300 GeV)

But m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Let's substitute the values.

m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c²

So m1² - m2² = (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99 * 297 = 29403 (GeV²/c^4)

Therefore, (m1² - m2²)c^4 = 29403 GeV²/c^4 * c^4 = 29403 GeV²

So E1 - E2 = 29403 GeV² / 300 GeV = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV

Therefore, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

We have two equations:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding them:

2E1 = 398.01 GeV => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Subtracting them:

2E2 = 300 - 98.01 = 201.99 GeV => E2 = 100.995 GeV

Therefore, the energies of the two fragments are approximately 199.005 GeV and 100.995 GeV.

But their rest mass energies are m1 c² = 198 GeV and m2 c² = 99 GeV. Therefore, their kinetic energies are:

T1 = E1 - m1 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 c² = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

So T1 is 1.005 GeV, T2 is 1.995 GeV. Let me check if their sum is 3 GeV. 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation. Good.

Now, for the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum is mv. Since momentum conservation still holds, so m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Therefore, |m1 v1| = |m2 v2|. So v2 = (m1/m2) v1. Since m1 = 2m2, then v2 = 2v1.

But total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2 (2v1)^2 = m2 v1² + (1/2)m2 * 4v1² = m2 v1² + 2m2 v1² = 3m2 v1²

But T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So 3m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². Wait, but in classical terms, mass is in GeV/c²? Wait, actually, in non-relativistic physics, the rest mass is just the mass. But here, the units are given in GeV/c². So m2 is 99 GeV/c².

But kinetic energy in GeV would be (1/2)m v². But m in GeV/c², and v in terms of c. Let's see.

Wait, let's convert m2 to kg for clarity? Maybe not, perhaps we can work with units.

Wait, m2 = 99 GeV/c². If we want to compute kinetic energy classically, T = (1/2)m v².

But to get T in GeV, we need m in GeV/c² and v in terms of c. Let's see:

If m is in GeV/c², and v is in terms of c (i.e., v = βc), then:

T = (1/2) * m * v² = (1/2) * (GeV/c²) * (β² c²) = (1/2) GeV β².

Therefore, T in GeV is (1/2) m (in GeV/c²) * β² c², which is (1/2) m (GeV/c²) * β² c² = (1/2) m β² c² (GeV/c² * c²) = (1/2) m β² GeV.

Wait, maybe this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps we can use natural units where c=1. Then, m2 = 99 GeV, and T = (1/2)m2 v², where v is in units of c. But actually, in natural units (c=1), velocity is dimensionless (v is in terms of c), so T = (1/2)m v², but m is in GeV, and T is in GeV. So if m2 = 99 GeV, then T2 = (1/2)*99*v2² GeV. Similarly for T1.

But in the problem, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So let's proceed.

In classical physics:

From momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since m1 = 2m2, then 2m2 v1 = m2 v2 => v2 = 2v1.

Then total kinetic energy:

T1 + T2 = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2 v1² + (1/2)m2*4v1² = m2 v1² + 2m2 v1² = 3m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

Therefore, 3m2 v1² = 3 GeV. So m2 v1² = 1 GeV. Since m2 = 99 GeV/c², then:

v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1/99) c². Therefore, v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c / 9.949 ≈ 0.1005c.

Then, T1 = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² = m2 v1² = 1 GeV. Wait, but T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, so T2 must be 2 GeV. Let me check:

T2 = (1/2)m2 v2². Since v2 = 2v1, then T2 = (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = (1/2)m2*4v1² = 2m2 v1² = 2*(1 GeV) = 2 GeV. So indeed, T1 =1 GeV and T2=2 GeV. Their sum is 3 GeV. So in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, T1 was 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV. Which is 5 MeV. Wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

But let me confirm the numbers again.

Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV

Classical T1: 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But let me check the calculation again.

Relativistic calculation:

We had E1 = 199.005 GeV, m1 c² = 198 GeV, so T1 = 1.005 GeV.

Classical calculation:

T1 = 1 GeV.

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But wait, is this correct? Let me check the steps again.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes out to be 1.005 GeV for the more massive fragment, and in the classical case, it's 1 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me check if there are any miscalculations.

First, relativistic calculation:

m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².

Total energy: 300 GeV.

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)c^4 / (300 GeV). Wait, but m1 and m2 are in GeV/c², so m1² is (198)^2 (GeV²/c^4), m2² is (99)^2 (GeV²/c^4). Then m1² - m2² = (198^2 - 99^2) GeV²/c^4 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) GeV²/c^4 = 99*297 GeV²/c^4. Then (m1² - m2²)c^4 = 99*297 GeV². Therefore, E1 - E2 = (99*297 GeV²)/(300 GeV) = (99*297)/300 GeV. Let's compute that:

99*297: 100*297 = 29700, minus 1*297 = 297, so 29700 - 297 = 29403.

Then 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV. Therefore, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV.

Then solving E1 + E2 = 300, E1 - E2 = 98.01:

Adding equations: 2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV.

Subtracting: 2E2 = 300 - 98.01 = 201.99 => E2 = 100.995 GeV.

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

T2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.

Classical case:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Given m1 = 2m2, so 2m2 v1 = m2 v2 => v2 = 2v1.

Total kinetic energy: (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2 v1² + 2m2 v1² = 3m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

Therefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV. Since m2 = 99 GeV/c², then v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1/99) c². Therefore, v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c.

Then T1 = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)(1/99 c²) = m2*(1/99 c²). But m2 is 99 GeV/c², so T1 = (99 GeV/c²)*(1/99 c²) = 1 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, relativistic is 1.005 GeV. Difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Because 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.

Therefore, the difference is 5 MeV.

But let me check if there's a mistake in units somewhere. For example, when we calculated E1 - E2, we had (m1² - m2²)c^4 divided by 300 GeV. But since m1 and m2 are in GeV/c², then m1² is (GeV²/c^4), so (m1² - m2²)c^4 is GeV². Then dividing by 300 GeV gives GeV. So the units are correct.

Yes, everything checks out. Therefore, the difference is 5 MeV.

**Final Answer**
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values is \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

Okay, so I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation of T1 for the more massive fragment after a spontaneous fission. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the atomic nucleus is initially at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, the initial mass is M = 300 GeV/c². After fission, the total rest mass of the fragments is 0.99M. That means some mass has been converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, the mass deficit is converted into energy according to E=mc². But here, since it's fission, the total rest mass of the products is less than the original, so the difference is the kinetic energy released.

But wait, actually, the total energy is conserved. The initial rest mass energy is Mc². After fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, and they also have kinetic energies. The sum of their rest masses is 0.99M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99M. But the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) should equal the initial rest mass energy, right? So, the kinetic energy of both fragments comes from the mass deficit of 0.01M. Therefore, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 0.01M c². But since we are dealing with GeV units, maybe c² is already factored in? Let me check. The rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so M c² = 300 GeV. Therefore, the total kinetic energy released would be 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But the problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So m1 = 2m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Therefore, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M. So m2 = 0.33M, and m1 = 0.66M. Wait, 0.99/3 is 0.33, yes. So m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M. So their rest masses are 0.66*300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c² and 0.33*300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c². Wait, but 198 + 99 is 297 GeV/c², which is 0.99*300, correct.

Now, the nucleus splits into these two fragments, and we need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So first, let's recall that in any decay or fission where the initial object is at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Because momentum is conserved. So the initial momentum is zero, so the final momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. So |p1| = |p2|.

But since their masses are different, their velocities and kinetic energies will be different. To find their kinetic energies, we need to apply conservation of energy and momentum, considering relativistic equations.

But in the classical approximation, we can use the non-relativistic formulas. The difference between the two will be the answer.

First, let's do the relativistic calculation.

Let me denote:

M_initial = 300 Ge

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I need to determine the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation of T1 for the heavier fragment following a spontaneous fission.

The initial scenario involves an atomic nucleus at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Upon fission, it divides into two fragments, with one being twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The combined rest masses of these fragments equals 99% of the original mass M. So, the initial mass is M = 300 GeV/c². After fission, the fragments' total rest mass is 0.99M, indicating some mass has transformed into kinetic energy, consistent with Einstein's E=mc² equation.

Energy conservation principles apply here. The initial rest mass energy is Mc². Post-fission, we have fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, plus their kinetic energies. Since m1 + m2 = 0.99M, the mass deficit of 0.01M accounts for the total kinetic energy of both fragments: T1 + T2 = 0.01M c². In GeV units, this equals 0.01 × 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Given that one fragment has twice the mass of the other, m1 = 2m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99M, we can solve: 3m2 = 0.99M, giving m2 = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M. Their rest masses are therefore 198 GeV/c² and 99 GeV/c², which sums to 297 GeV/c² (0.99 × 300 GeV/c²).

In any fission where the initial object is at rest, conservation of momentum requires the fragments to move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. So |p1| = |p2|. However, due to their different masses, their velocities and kinetic energies will differ.

To find the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment (T1), I need to apply both energy and momentum conservation laws using relativistic equations, and then compare with the classical approximation to find the difference.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's find the variation between the accurate relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation for the more massive fragment that arises from spontaneous fission. We'll tackle this by breaking down the problem sequentially.

Initially, the atomic nucleus is stationary, possessing rest mass energy of 300 GeV. This nucleus divides into two fragments, with one fragment having twice the rest mass of the other. The total rest mass of these fragments constitutes 99% of the initial mass \( M \), where \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Post-fission, the sum of their rest masses equals 0.99M, implying some matter has transformed into kinetic energy. This aligns with the principle of mass-energy equivalence, \( E=mc^2 \). In fission, since the fragmented rest masses sum to less than the original mass, this difference must represent the released kinetic energy.

However, it's crucial to recognize that total energy remains conserved. The original rest mass energy is \( Mc^2 \). Post-fission, fragments have rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) plus kinetic energy. Given their combined rest mass of 0.99M, \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), the total energy should thus equal the initial rest mass energy. The fragments' total kinetic energy stems from the 0.01M mass deficit, translating to \( T_1 + T_2 = 0.01M c^2 \). In GeV units, where c² is already accounted for, the rest mass energy given as 300 GeV implies a kinetic release of \( 0.01 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), hence \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

Given one fragment's mass is double the other's, \( m_1 = 2m_2 \). Also, \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). Hence, \( 2m_2 + m_2 = 3m_2 = 0.99M \), leading to \( m_2 = 0.33M \) and \( m_1 = 0.66M \). Thus, their rest masses are \( 0.66 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( 0.33 \times 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), correctly adding up to 297 GeV/c², or 0.99 × 300.

Following the nucleus’s division into these fragments, focus shifts to determining the more massive fragment’s kinetic energy, \( T_1 \), and then calculating the discrepancy between its relativistic and classical kinetic approximations.

Recall, in decay or fission events with the initial object at rest, fragments move oppositely with equal but opposite momenta, maintaining momentum conservation. The initial momentum being zero obliges zero final momentum, rendering fragments’ momenta equal and opposite, or \( |p_1| = |p_2| \).

Since their masses vary, their velocities and kinetic energies differ, necessitating conservation of energy and momentum using relativistic formulae for accuracy.

In contrast, for the classical approximation, non-relativistic equations suffice. The resultant difference provides the desired answer.

To illustrate, consider the relativistic calculations further …

So p1 = -p2.\n\nLet me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p.\n\nSo for each fragment, their total relativistic energy is:\n\nE1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )\n\nE2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )\n\nAnd the sum of these energies must be equal to the initial total energy, which is M_initial c² = 300 GeV.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ) = M_initial c²\n\nBut m1 and m2 are known in terms of M_initial. Let\'s substitute m1 = 0.66 M_initial and m2 = 0.33 M_initial.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (0.66 M_initial c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (0.33 M_initial c²)^2 ) = M_initial c²\n\nLet me divide both sides by M_initial c² to make it dimensionless:\n\nsqrt( (p c / (M_initial c²))² + (0.66)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c / (M_initial c²))² + (0.33)^2 ) = 1\n\nLet me define x = (p c) / (M_initial c²) = p / (M_initial c). Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( x² + 0.66² ) + sqrt( x² + 0.33² ) = 1\n\nSo we need to solve for x. Then, once we have x, we can find p, and then compute the kinetic energies.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can solve for x.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(x² + 0.66²) and B = sqrt(x² + 0.33²). Then A + B = 1. Let\'s square both sides:\n\n(A + B)^2 = 1\n\nA² + 2AB + B² = 1\n\nBut A² = x² + 0.66² and B² = x² + 0.33². Therefore:\n\n(x² + 0.66²) + 2AB + (x² + 0.33²) = 1\n\nCombine terms:\n\n2x² + 0.66² + 0.33² + 2AB = 1\n\nCalculate 0.66²: 0.4356\n\n0.33²: 0.1089\n\nSo:\n\n2x² + 0.4356 + 0.1089 + 2AB = 1\n\n2x² + 0.5445 + 2AB = 1\n\n2x² + 2AB = 1 - 0.5445 = 0.4555\n\nBut AB = sqrt(x² + 0.66²) * sqrt(x² + 0.33²)\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there\'s another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can set variables or make a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider the problem in terms of velocities. But maybe that\'s not easier.\n\nAlternatively, since the kinetic energy is T = (gamma - 1) m c², so for each fragment:\n\nT1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²\n\nT2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c²\n\nTotal kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nAlso, since p1 = p2 = p, we have:\n\ngamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2\n\nBut in relativity, momentum p = gamma m v. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = p2 = gamma2 m2 v2\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, but the magnitudes are equal. So |p1| = |p2|.\n\nSo gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2\n\nBut v1 and v2 are the speeds of each fragment.\n\nAlternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express v in terms of p and m.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let\'s go back to the equation:\n\nsqrt( x² + 0.66² ) + sqrt( x² + 0.33² ) = 1\n\nLet me let y = x². Then:\n\nsqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1\n\nLet me denote S = sqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1\n\nLet me isolate one of the square roots:\n\nsqrt(y + 0.4356) = 1 - sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nNow square both sides:\n\ny + 0.4356 = 1 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089) + y + 0.1089\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: y + 0.4356\n\nRight side: 1 + y + 0.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nSubtract y from both sides:\n\n0.4356 = 1 + 0.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nCalculate 1 + 0.1089 = 1.1089\n\nSo:\n\n0.4356 = 1.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nSubtract 1.1089:\n\n0.4356 - 1.1089 = -2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nCalculate left side: -0.6733 = -2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n0.33665 = sqrt(y + 0.1089)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n0.113333 = y + 0.1089\n\nTherefore, y = 0.113333 - 0.1089 = 0.004433\n\nSo y = x² = 0.004433\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(0.004433) ≈ 0.0666\n\nRecall that x = p / (M_initial c)\n\nSo p = x M_initial c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c² * c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c\n\nWait, units: M_initial is 300 GeV/c², so multiplying by c gives 300 GeV/c. Then x is dimensionless, so p = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.98 GeV/c ≈ 20 GeV/c\n\nSo the momentum of each fragment is approximately 20 GeV/c.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy T1 for the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV/c²) is:\n\nT1 = E1 - m1 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) - m1 c²\n\nSimilarly for T2.\n\nLet me compute E1:\n\nE1 = sqrt( (20 GeV/c * c)^2 + (198 GeV/c² * c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (198 GeV)^2 )\n\nCalculate (20)^2 = 400, (198)^2 = 39204\n\nSo sqrt(400 + 39204) = sqrt(39604) = 199.007 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = 199.007 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.007 GeV\n\nSimilarly, E2 = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (99 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(400 + 9801) = sqrt(10201) = 101 GeV\n\nThus, T2 = 101 GeV - 99 GeV = 2 GeV\n\nCheck total kinetic energy: 1.007 + 2 = 3.007 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV, which matches the expected total from the 1% mass deficit. Close enough considering rounding.\n\nSo T1 (relativistic) is approximately 1.007 GeV.\n\nNow, let\'s compute the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m). Since the momenta are equal and opposite, and in the non-relativistic case, p1 = -p2, so |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\nBut wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = p²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2 )\n\nBut we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (from the mass deficit). Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, how do we compute p?\n\nWait, actually, in the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is T = (1/2) m v², and momentum p = m v. So T = p²/(2m). Therefore, if we have two particles with momentum p and -p, their kinetic energies are p²/(2m1) and p²/(2m2). So total kinetic energy is p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = (p²/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV.\n\nBut we can solve for p² here.\n\nSo p² = 2 * 3 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2 )\n\nBut m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Wait, units might be tricky here.\n\nWait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But if we express m in GeV/c² and v in terms of c, then:\n\nT = (1/2) m c² (v²/c²) = (1/2) (m c²) (v²/c²)\n\nBut since m c² is in GeV, then T is in GeV*(v²/c²). But p = m v, so p c = m v c = (m c²) (v / c). Therefore, p c has units of GeV*(v/c). Therefore, p² c² = (m c²)^2 (v²/c²). Therefore, T = (1/2) (m c²) (v²/c²) = (1/2) (p² c²)/(m c²) ) = (p² c²)/(2 m c²) = p²/(2 m c²) * c² = p²/(2 m)\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, let\'s check units.\n\nIf m is in GeV/c², then p = m v, with v in m/s or whatever. But in natural units where c=1, p is in GeV/c * c = GeV. Wait, maybe I should use natural units where c=1. Let\'s do that to avoid confusion.\n\nIn natural units (c=1), energy, mass, and momentum have the same units. So m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV. The total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nIn non-relativistic case, T1 = p²/(2m1), T2 = p²/(2m2). Therefore, total T = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = p²/(2) (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV\n\nSo p² = 2 * 3 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 6 GeV / ( (1/198 + 1/99) GeV^{-1} )\n\nCalculate denominator: 1/198 + 1/99 = 1/198 + 2/198 = 3/198 = 1/66 GeV^{-1}\n\nTherefore, p² = 6 GeV / (1/66 GeV^{-1}) = 6 * 66 GeV²\n\np² = 396 GeV²\n\nTherefore, p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈ 19.9 GeV\n\nWhich is close to the relativistic value we found earlier (≈20 GeV). So in the non-relativistic case, p ≈ 19.9 GeV.\n\nThen, T1 (non-relativistic) = p²/(2m1) = 396 GeV² / (2*198 GeV) = 396 / 396 GeV = 1 GeV\n\nSimilarly, T2 = 396 / (2*99) = 396 / 198 = 2 GeV. So total is 1 + 2 = 3 GeV, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, in the non-relativistic approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.\n\nBut in the relativistic case, T1 was approximately 1.007 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation is 1.007 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.007 GeV, which is 7 MeV.\n\nBut wait, 0.007 GeV is 7 MeV. Is that correct? Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, in the relativistic calculation, we had T1 ≈ 1.007 GeV, and non-relativistic is 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.007 GeV, which is 7 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if the relativistic calculation was precise enough. When we calculated E1, we had:\n\nE1 = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (198 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(400 + 39204) = sqrt(39604) = 199.007 GeV. Therefore, T1 = 199.007 - 198 = 1.007 GeV. That seems precise.\n\nBut the momentum was approximated as 20 GeV/c, but actually, in the relativistic calculation, we found x ≈ 0.0666, which gives p = x * M_initial c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c = 19.98 GeV/c ≈ 20 GeV/c. So the exact value of p is 19.98 GeV/c. Let\'s use the exact value.\n\nCompute E1 exactly:\n\np = 19.98 GeV/c\n\nm1 c² = 198 GeV\n\nSo E1 = sqrt( (19.98)^2 + (198)^2 ) GeV\n\nCalculate 19.98^2 = (20 - 0.02)^2 = 400 - 0.8 + 0.0004 ≈ 399.2004\n\nSo E1 = sqrt(399.2004 + 39204) = sqrt(39603.2004)\n\nCompute sqrt(39603.2004). Since 199^2 = 39601, so sqrt(39603.2004) ≈ 199.005 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV\n\nSo more precisely, T1 (relativistic) ≈ 1.005 GeV\n\nNon-relativistic T1 is exactly 1 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1.000 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nWait, so depending on rounding, it\'s either 5 or 7 MeV. But in the initial calculation, we had x ≈ 0.0666, which gave p ≈ 19.98 GeV/c, leading to E1 ≈ 199.007 GeV. But with more precise calculation of p, we found E1 ≈ 199.005 GeV. So actually, perhaps the exact difference is around 5 MeV. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let\'s do it more accurately. Let\'s use the exact value of x.\n\nFrom earlier steps, we had y = x² = 0.004433, so x = sqrt(0.004433) ≈ 0.066583\n\nTherefore, p = x * M_initial c = 0.066583 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c\n\nSo p ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c\n\nThen E1 = sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + (198)^2 )\n\nCompute (19.9749)^2:\n\n19.9749^2 = (20 - 0.0251)^2 = 400 - 2*20*0.0251 + (0.0251)^2 ≈ 400 - 1.004 + 0.00063 ≈ 398.9966\n\nTherefore, E1 = sqrt(398.9966 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.9966)\n\nCompute sqrt(39602.9966). Since 199^2 = 39601, so sqrt(39602.9966) ≈ 199 + (39602.9966 - 39601)/(2*199) ≈ 199 + 1.9966/398 ≈ 199 + 0.005016 ≈ 199.005016 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = 199.005016 - 198 = 1.005016 GeV\n\nSo relativistic T1 ≈ 1.005 GeV\n\nNon-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV\n\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check again if the non-relativistic calculation gives exactly 1 GeV. Let\'s confirm:\n\np² = 396 GeV² (from before)\n\nm1 = 198 GeV/c²\n\nTherefore, T1 = p²/(2m1) = 396 / (2*198) = 396 / 396 = 1 GeV. Yes, exactly 1 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut in the problem, the answer needs to be in GeV, probably. Let me check the question again:\n\n"What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"\n\nSo the answer is 0.005 GeV. But maybe they want it in MeV? The problem says "Ignore the electrons." But units are not specified. The initial rest mass energy is in GeV, so the answer is likely expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, let me check if my calculation is precise enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an approximation in solving for x. Let me check the exact solution.\n\nWe had:\n\nsqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1\n\nWe found y = 0.004433. Let me verify this.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.004433 + 0.4356) + sqrt(0.004433 + 0.1089)\n\n= sqrt(0.440033) + sqrt(0.113333)\n\n≈ 0.6633 + 0.3366 = 0.9999 ≈ 1. So that\'s correct. So y = 0.004433 is accurate.\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(y) ≈ 0.066583\n\nTherefore, p = 0.066583 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c\n\nThen, E1 is sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + 198^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (approx 19.975)^2 + 198^2 )\n\nBut 19.975^2 = approx 399.0\n\nSo sqrt(399 + 39204) = sqrt(39603) ≈ 199.005\n\nTherefore, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV\n\nTherefore, difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is 0.005 GeV, but maybe we need to calculate it more precisely. Let\'s do that.\n\nCompute E1 more precisely:\n\np = 19.9749 GeV/c\n\nSo (p c)^2 = (19.9749 GeV)^2 ≈ 19.9749^2 = let\'s calculate it:\n\n19.9749 * 19.9749\n\n= (20 - 0.0251)^2\n\n= 400 - 2*20*0.0251 + (0.0251)^2\n\n= 400 - 1.004 + 0.00063001\n\n= 398.99663001 GeV²\n\nThen (m1 c²)^2 = (198 GeV)^2 = 39204 GeV²\n\nSo E1 = sqrt(398.99663001 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.99663001)\n\nNow, sqrt(39602.99663) = ?\n\nWe know that 199^2 = 39601\n\nSo, let\'s write 39602.99663 = 39601 + 1.99663\n\nThen, sqrt(39601 + 1.99663) ≈ 199 + (1.99663)/(2*199) - (1.99663)^2/(8*199^3) + ...\n\nFirst term: 199 + 1.99663/(398) ≈ 199 + 0.0050166 ≈ 199.0050166\n\nSecond term: subtract (1.99663)^2 / (8*199^3)\n\n(1.99663)^2 ≈ 3.9865\n\n8*199^3 = 8*(7880599) ≈ 63044792\n\nSo 3.9865 / 63044792 ≈ 6.32e-8\n\nSo sqrt(39602.99663) ≈ 199.0050166 - 6.32e-8 ≈ 199.0050165 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = 199.0050165 - 198 = 1.0050165 GeV\n\nSo up to this precision, T1 (relativistic) is approximately 1.0050165 GeV\n\nNon-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV\n\nTherefore, the difference is 1.0050165 - 1 = 0.0050165 GeV, which is approximately 0.00502 GeV.\n\nConvert to MeV: 0.00502 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5.02 MeV. Approximately 5 MeV.\n\nBut since the problem says "the difference", and the answer is expected in GeV, unless specified otherwise. However, given that 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, and the original energy is in GeV, but the difference is small. However, maybe we need to present it in GeV. Let\'s check the problem statement again:\n\n"What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"\n\nNo specific unit is mentioned, but since the initial units are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV. However, given that the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, but depending on how precise we are, it\'s approximately 0.005 GeV.\n\nBut let me check if there is a more accurate way to compute this difference without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Taylor expansion for the relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy is T = sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) / c² - m c² = (sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) - m c² ) / c²\n\nWait, no, actually, the kinetic energy is T = E - m c² = sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) - m c²\n\nBut in units where c=1, T = sqrt(p² + m²) - m\n\nSo, expanding this in terms of p, we can do a Taylor expansion for small p/m.\n\nT = sqrt( m² + p² ) - m = m ( sqrt(1 + p²/m² ) - 1 ) ≈ m (1 + (1/2)(p²/m²) - (1/8)(p^4/m^4) + ... ) - m = (1/2) p²/m - (1/8) p^4/m^3 + ...\n\nTherefore, the relativistic correction to the classical kinetic energy is approximately - (1/8) p^4 / m^3\n\nTherefore, the difference between relativistic and classical T is approximately - (1/8) p^4 / m^3\n\nBut in our case, the classical T is p²/(2m), so the difference is T_relativistic - T_classical ≈ - (1/8) p^4 / m^3\n\nBut let\'s compute this.\n\nGiven that in the classical case, T_classical = p²/(2m1) = 1 GeV\n\nSo p² = 2 m1 T_classical = 2 * 198 GeV * 1 GeV = 396 GeV²\n\np^4 = (396)^2 GeV^4\n\nThen, the difference is - (1/8) * (396)^2 / (198)^3 GeV\n\nCompute:\n\n(396)^2 = (2*198)^2 = 4*198²\n\nTherefore, difference = - (1/8) * 4*198² / 198³ = - (1/8)*4 /198 = - (1/(2*198)) = -1/396 ≈ -0.002525 GeV\n\nBut this is negative, implying that the relativistic kinetic energy is less than the classical, which contradicts our previous result where relativistic T was higher. So this suggests that the Taylor expansion might not be appropriate here, or that the approximation is not valid because p is not that small compared to m.\n\nWait, in our case, p ≈ 20 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV. So p/m ≈ 20/198 ≈ 0.101, which is about 10%. So the expansion parameter (p/m)^2 is about 0.01, which is small, but maybe the next term is significant.\n\nWait, let\'s compute the exact difference using T_relativistic - T_classical = [sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1] - [p²/(2m1)]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nsqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by m1:\n\n= [sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)]\n\nBut let\'s compute numerically.\n\np = 19.9749 GeV\n\nm1 = 198 GeV\n\nsqrt(p² + m1²) = sqrt(19.9749² + 198²) ≈ 199.005016 GeV\n\nTherefore, T_rel = 199.005016 - 198 = 1.005016 GeV\n\nT_classical = p²/(2m1) = (19.9749)^2 / (2*198) ≈ 398.9966 / 396 ≈ 1.007564 GeV\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a second, this contradicts previous calculations. Wait, earlier, we had in the non-relativistic case p² = 396 GeV², so T_classical = 396/(2*198) = 1 GeV. But here, if p is 19.9749 GeV, then p² ≈ 19.9749² ≈ 398.9966 GeV², which divided by (2*198) is 398.9966 / 396 ≈ 1.007564 GeV. But that\'s inconsistent with the previous result.\n\nWait, confusion arises because in the non-relativistic case, p is found by assuming T_classical total = 3 GeV. But in reality, when you do the non-relativistic calculation, you have:\n\nT1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\n\nWith T1 = p²/(2m1), T2 = p²/(2m2)\n\nThus, p²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV\n\nWhich gives p² = 6 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 6 / (1/198 + 1/99) = 6 / (3/198) = 6 * 198 /3 = 396 GeV²\n\nTherefore, p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.8997 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 1 GeV\n\nT2_classical = 396/(2*99) = 2 GeV\n\nBut in reality, when we calculated p in the relativistic case, we got p ≈ 19.9749 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic p ≈19.8997 GeV.\n\nTherefore, in the non-relativistic case, p is actually sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV, not 19.9749 GeV. So my previous mistake was using the relativistic p in the classical calculation, which is incorrect.\n\nSo to correctly compute the classical T1, we need to use p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈19.8997 GeV/c\n\nWait, but in reality, the momentum in the relativistic case is different from the classical case. So we can\'t use the same p. Therefore, in the non-relativistic case, p is determined by the classical equations, which gives p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV.\n\nBut in the relativistic case, the momentum is different, p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nBut how is that possible? Because in the relativistic case, the momentum is higher, but the kinetic energy is only slightly higher.\n\nWait, but actually, in the relativistic case, the momentum is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum, leading to a different p than the classical case. Therefore, the momenta in the relativistic and classical cases are different. Therefore, my initial approach was correct: in the relativistic case, p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV, while in the classical case, p ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier when trying to compute T_classical with relativistic p? Because that\'s mixing two different scenarios. The momentum in the non-relativistic case is determined by the classical energy conservation, which gives a different p. Therefore, the correct way is:\n\nIn the relativistic case:\n\n- Solve for p using relativistic energy conservation: p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV.\n\nIn the non-relativistic case:\n\n- Solve for p using classical energy conservation: p ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nFirst, relativistic case:\n\np ≈19.9749 GeV/c\n\nT1_rel = sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + (198)^2 ) - 198 ≈199.005 - 198 =1.005 GeV\n\nNon-relativistic case:\n\np = sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV/c\n\nT1_classical = (19.8997)^2 / (2*198) ≈(395.994)/396 ≈0.99998 GeV ≈1 GeV\n\nTherefore, the difference is 1.005 -1 =0.005 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if the problem might require an exact expression instead of the approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the exact difference using the relativistic and classical approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more precise way to calculate it without approximating p.\n\nBut given the time I\'ve spent, I think the approximate difference is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. However, let me check once more.\n\nWait, let\'s compute T1_classical precisely:\n\np² = 396 GeV²\n\nm1 =198 GeV\n\nT1_classical = 396/(2*198) =1 GeV\n\nIn the relativistic case, p_rel =19.9749 GeV/c\n\nT1_rel = sqrt(19.9749² +198²) -198 ≈ sqrt(398.996 +39204) -198 = sqrt(39602.996) -198 ≈199.005016 -198=1.005016 GeV\n\nTherefore, difference is 1.005016 -1=0.005016 GeV≈0.005 GeV\n\nSo, 0.005 GeV is the answer. But the problem might want the exact value. Alternatively, maybe there is an exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c², and classical T1 = (1/2)m1 v². But since p = gamma1 m1 v = classical p = m1 v (non-relativistic), so in the non-relativistic case, p = m1 v, so v = p/m1. Then T1_classical = (1/2)m1 (p/m1)^2 = p²/(2m1). But in the relativistic case, p = gamma1 m1 v, so v = p/(gamma1 m1). Therefore, gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p/(m1 c))² ). Therefore, T1_rel = (gamma1 -1)m1 c².\n\nBut since in the non-relativistic case, p is different, maybe we can express the difference in terms of the relativistic p.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we have the exact difference as approximately 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, and given the problem\'s context, this is likely the answer.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation is 0.005 GeV, which can be written as 5 MeV. However, since the problem may expect the answer in GeV, it\'s 0.005 GeV. But let me check the calculation once more for any possible mistake.\n\nWait, another way to compute the difference is:\n\nT_rel - T_class = [sqrt(p_rel² + m1²) - m1] - [p_class²/(2m1)]\n\nBut p_rel and p_class are different. In our case, p_rel ≈19.9749 GeV/c, p_class≈19.8997 GeV/c\n\nBut this complicates things, as both p\'s are different. Therefore, the difference comes from both the different momentum and the different formula.\n\nBut since in each case the momentum is determined by the respective (relativistic or classical) conservation laws, the total difference is 0.005 GeV as computed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 0.005 GeV, or 5 MeV. Since the question doesn\'t specify units, but the initial data is in GeV, I\'ll go with 0.005 GeV. However, sometimes in particle physics, small energy differences are quoted in MeV. Given that 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, and 5 MeV is a more tangible number, maybe the answer is 5 MeV. But the problem says "what is the difference", so it\'s safer to check if units are required. But as the original rest mass energy is given in GeV, and fragments\' rest masses are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, so both are correct. However, given that the difference is small, it\'s better to write it as 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. But maybe the exact value is 5 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the exact difference using more precise values.\n\nFrom before:\n\nT1_rel = 1.005016 GeV\n\nT1_classical =1 GeV\n\nDifference: 0.005016 GeV, which is approximately 5.02 MeV. So approximately 5 MeV.\n\nGiven that in exams, such differences are often rounded to the nearest MeV, so 5 MeV.\n\nBut to adhere to the problem\'s units, which are GeV, 0.005 GeV is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if my initial calculation of T1_rel as 1.007 GeV was due to an error. Wait, no, that was when I approximated p as 20 GeV/c. But with exact p, it\'s 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{0.005 \\text{ GeV}}.\n\nBut to double-check, let\'s consider another approach.\n\nThe total energy released (total kinetic energy) is 3 GeV.\n\nIn the relativistic case, the energies are distributed between the two particles based on their momenta and masses. In the classical case, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to their masses, since T = p²/(2m), and p is the same. So T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2. Therefore, T1 =1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.\n\nIn the relativistic case, the ratio is different. The more massive fragment has lower kinetic energy. Wait, but in our calculation, T1 was approximately 1.005 GeV, which is slightly higher than the classical 1 GeV, but T2 was 2 GeV in classical, but in reality, T2 was 2 GeV in the relativistic case. Wait, no, in the relativistic case, T2 was 101 -99=2 GeV. Wait, but that was when we used p=20 GeV/c.\n\nWait, no, in reality, when we use the correct p_rel≈19.9749 GeV/c, then E2 = sqrt( p_rel² + m2² ) = sqrt(19.9749² +99² )≈ sqrt(398.996 +9801)=sqrt(10199.996)≈100.995 GeV\n\nTherefore, T2=100.995 -99=1.995 GeV\n\nTherefore, total kinetic energy is T1 + T2≈1.005 +1.995=3 GeV, correct.\n\nTherefore, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has T1≈1.005 GeV, and the less massive has≈1.995 GeV. While in the classical case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference for T1 is +0.005 GeV, and for T2 is -0.005 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and its classical approximation is \\boxed{0.005 \\text{ GeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390439, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8985, prompt_tokens=920, total_tokens=9905, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given an atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments where one fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass \( M \). We need to find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T₁).

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initial rest mass energy: \( M c^2 = 300 \) GeV.
   - Total rest mass of fragments: \( 0.99M \).
   - Masses of fragments: \( m_1 = 0.66M \) (198 GeV/c²) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \) (99 GeV/c²).
   - Total kinetic energy released: \( 0.01M c^2 = 3 \) GeV.

2. **Relativistic Calculation:**
   - Conservation of momentum: \( p_1 = p_2 = p \).
   - Relativistic energy equations:
     \[
     \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2} + \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2} = 300 \text{ GeV}
     \]
   - Solving for \( p \) using dimensionless variables:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + 0.66^2} + \sqrt{x^2 + 0.33^2} = 1
     \]
   - Finding \( x \approx 0.0666 \), leading to \( p \approx 19.98 \) GeV/c.
   - Relativistic kinetic energy for \( m_1 \):
     \[
     T_1 = \sqrt{(19.98 \text{ GeV})^2 + (198 \text{ GeV})^2} - 198 \text{ GeV} \approx 1.005 \text{ GeV}
     \]

3. **Classical Calculation:**
   - Classical kinetic energy using \( T = \frac{p^2}{2m} \):
     \[
     p^2 = \frac{2 \times 3 \text{ GeV}}{\frac{1}{198} + \frac{1}{99}} = 396 \text{ GeV}^2
     \]
   - Classical kinetic energy for \( m_1 \):
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{396 \text{ GeV}^2}{2 \times 198 \text{ GeV}} = 1 \text{ GeV}
     \]

4. **Difference:**
   - Relativistic T₁: \( 1.005 \text{ GeV} \)
   - Classical T₁: \( 1 \text{ GeV} \)
   - Difference: \( 1.005 \text{ GeV} - 1 \text{ GeV} = 0.005 \text{ GeV} \)

The difference between the correct T₁ value and its classical approximation is \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

v/c²

m1 = 0.66M_initial = 198 GeV/c²

m2 = 0.33M_initial = 99 GeV/c²

Total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But in reality, since energy and momentum are conserved, we need to relate their energies and momenta.

In the center of momentum frame (which is the rest frame of the original nucleus), the two fragments must have opposite momenta. So p1 = -p2.

Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p.

So for each fragment, their total relativistic energy is:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

And the sum of these energies must be equal to the initial total energy, which is M_initial c² = 300 GeV.

So:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ) = M_initial c²

But m1 and m2 are known in terms of M_initial. Let's substitute m1 = 0.66 M_initial and m2 = 0.33 M_initial.

So:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (0.66 M_initial c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (0.33 M_initial c²)^2 ) = M_initial c²

Let me divide both sides by M_initial c² to make it dimensionless:

sqrt( (p c / (M_initial c²))² + (0.66)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c / (M_initial c²))² + (0.33)^2 ) = 1

Let me define x = (p c) / (M_initial c²) = p / (M_initial c). Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + 0.66² ) + sqrt( x² + 0.33² ) = 1

So we need to solve for x. Then, once we have x, we can find p, and then compute the kinetic energies.

But this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can solve for x.

Let me denote A = sqrt(x² + 0.66²) and B = sqrt(x² + 0.33²). Then A + B = 1. Let's square both sides:

(A + B)^2 = 1

A² + 2AB + B² = 1

But A² = x² + 0.66² and B² = x² + 0.33². Therefore:

(x² + 0.66²) + 2AB + (x² + 0.33²) = 1

Combine terms:

2x² + 0.66² + 0.33² + 2AB = 1

Calculate 0.66²: 0.4356

0.33²: 0.1089

So:

2x² + 0.4356 + 0.1089 + 2AB = 1

2x² + 0.5445 + 2AB = 1

2x² + 2AB = 1 - 0.5445 = 0.4555

But AB = sqrt(x² + 0.66²) * sqrt(x² + 0.33²)

This seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can set variables or make a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider the problem in terms of velocities. But maybe that's not easier.

Alternatively, since the kinetic energy is T = (gamma - 1) m c², so for each fragment:

T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²

T2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c²

Total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV

Also, since p1 = p2 = p, we have:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2

But in relativity, momentum p = gamma m v. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = p2 = gamma2 m2 v2

But since they are moving in opposite directions, but the magnitudes are equal. So |p1| = |p2|.

So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2

But v1 and v2 are the speeds of each fragment.

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express v in terms of p and m.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's go back to the equation:

sqrt( x² + 0.66² ) + sqrt( x² + 0.33² ) = 1

Let me let y = x². Then:

sqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1

Let me denote S = sqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1

Let me isolate one of the square roots:

sqrt(y + 0.4356) = 1 - sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Now square both sides:

y + 0.4356 = 1 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089) + y + 0.1089

Simplify:

Left side: y + 0.4356

Right side: 1 + y + 0.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Subtract y from both sides:

0.4356 = 1 + 0.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Calculate 1 + 0.1089 = 1.1089

So:

0.4356 = 1.1089 - 2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Subtract 1.1089:

0.4356 - 1.1089 = -2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Calculate left side: -0.6733 = -2 sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Divide both sides by -2:

0.33665 = sqrt(y + 0.1089)

Square both sides:

0.113333 = y + 0.1089

Therefore, y = 0.113333 - 0.1089 = 0.004433

So y = x² = 0.004433

Therefore, x = sqrt(0.004433) ≈ 0.0666

Recall that x = p / (M_initial c)

So p = x M_initial c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c² * c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c

Wait, units: M_initial is 300 GeV/c², so multiplying by c gives 300 GeV/c. Then x is dimensionless, so p = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.98 GeV/c ≈ 20 GeV/c

So the momentum of each fragment is approximately 20 GeV/c.

Now, the kinetic energy T1 for the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV/c²) is:

T1 = E1 - m1 c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) - m1 c²

Similarly for T2.

Let me compute E1:

E1 = sqrt( (20 GeV/c * c)^2 + (198 GeV/c² * c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (198 GeV)^2 )

Calculate (20)^2 = 400, (198)^2 = 39204

So sqrt(400 + 39204) = sqrt(39604) = 199.007 GeV

Therefore, T1 = 199.007 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.007 GeV

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (99 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(400 + 9801) = sqrt(10201) = 101 GeV

Thus, T2 = 101 GeV - 99 GeV = 2 GeV

Check total kinetic energy: 1.007 + 2 = 3.007 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV, which matches the expected total from the 1% mass deficit. Close enough considering rounding.

So T1 (relativistic) is approximately 1.007 GeV.

Now, let's compute the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

In classical physics, kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m). Since the momenta are equal and opposite, and in the non-relativistic case, p1 = -p2, so |p1| = |p2| = p.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = p²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2 )

But we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (from the mass deficit). Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, how do we compute p?

Wait, actually, in the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is T = (1/2) m v², and momentum p = m v. So T = p²/(2m). Therefore, if we have two particles with momentum p and -p, their kinetic energies are p²/(2m1) and p²/(2m2). So total kinetic energy is p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = (p²/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV.

But we can solve for p² here.

So p² = 2 * 3 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2 )

But m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Wait, units might be tricky here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But if we express m in GeV/c² and v in terms of c, then:

T = (1/2) m c² (v²/c²) = (1/2) (m c²) (v²/c²)

But since m c² is in GeV, then T is in GeV*(v²/c²). But p = m v, so p c = m v c = (m c²) (v / c). Therefore, p c has units of GeV*(v/c). Therefore, p² c² = (m c²)^2 (v²/c²). Therefore, T = (1/2) (m c²) (v²/c²) = (1/2) (p² c²)/(m c²) ) = (p² c²)/(2 m c²) = p²/(2 m c²) * c² = p²/(2 m)

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, let's check units.

If m is in GeV/c², then p = m v, with v in m/s or whatever. But in natural units where c=1, p is in GeV/c * c = GeV. Wait, maybe I should use natural units where c=1. Let's do that to avoid confusion.

In natural units (c=1), energy, mass, and momentum have the same units. So m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV. The total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic case, T1 = p²/(2m1), T2 = p²/(2m2). Therefore, total T = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = p²/(2) (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV

So p² = 2 * 3 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 6 GeV / ( (1/198 + 1/99) GeV^{-1} )

Calculate denominator: 1/198 + 1/99 = 1/198 + 2/198 = 3/198 = 1/66 GeV^{-1}

Therefore, p² = 6 GeV / (1/66 GeV^{-1}) = 6 * 66 GeV²

p² = 396 GeV²

Therefore, p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈ 19.9 GeV

Which is close to the relativistic value we found earlier (≈20 GeV). So in the non-relativistic case, p ≈ 19.9 GeV.

Then, T1 (non-relativistic) = p²/(2m1) = 396 GeV² / (2*198 GeV) = 396 / 396 GeV = 1 GeV

Similarly, T2 = 396 / (2*99) = 396 / 198 = 2 GeV. So total is 1 + 2 = 3 GeV, which checks out.

Therefore, in the non-relativistic approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, T1 was approximately 1.007 GeV.

Therefore, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation is 1.007 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.007 GeV, which is 7 MeV.

But wait, 0.007 GeV is 7 MeV. Is that correct? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, in the relativistic calculation, we had T1 ≈ 1.007 GeV, and non-relativistic is 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.007 GeV, which is 7 MeV.

But let me check if the relativistic calculation was precise enough. When we calculated E1, we had:

E1 = sqrt( (20 GeV)^2 + (198 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(400 + 39204) = sqrt(39604) = 199.007 GeV. Therefore, T1 = 199.007 - 198 = 1.007 GeV. That seems precise.

But the momentum was approximated as 20 GeV/c, but actually, in the relativistic calculation, we found x ≈ 0.0666, which gives p = x * M_initial c = 0.0666 * 300 GeV/c = 19.98 GeV/c ≈ 20 GeV/c. So the exact value of p is 19.98 GeV/c. Let's use the exact value.

Compute E1 exactly:

p = 19.98 GeV/c

m1 c² = 198 GeV

So E1 = sqrt( (19.98)^2 + (198)^2 ) GeV

Calculate 19.98^2 = (20 - 0.02)^2 = 400 - 0.8 + 0.0004 ≈ 399.2004

So E1 = sqrt(399.2004 + 39204) = sqrt(39603.2004)

Compute sqrt(39603.2004). Since 199^2 = 39601, so sqrt(39603.2004) ≈ 199.005 GeV

Therefore, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

So more precisely, T1 (relativistic) ≈ 1.005 GeV

Non-relativistic T1 is exactly 1 GeV.

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1.000 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, so depending on rounding, it's either 5 or 7 MeV. But in the initial calculation, we had x ≈ 0.0666, which gave p ≈ 19.98 GeV/c, leading to E1 ≈ 199.007 GeV. But with more precise calculation of p, we found E1 ≈ 199.005 GeV. So actually, perhaps the exact difference is around 5 MeV. Hmm.

Wait, but let's do it more accurately. Let's use the exact value of x.

From earlier steps, we had y = x² = 0.004433, so x = sqrt(0.004433) ≈ 0.066583

Therefore, p = x * M_initial c = 0.066583 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c

So p ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c

Then E1 = sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + (198)^2 )

Compute (19.9749)^2:

19.9749^2 = (20 - 0.0251)^2 = 400 - 2*20*0.0251 + (0.0251)^2 ≈ 400 - 1.004 + 0.00063 ≈ 398.9966

Therefore, E1 = sqrt(398.9966 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.9966)

Compute sqrt(39602.9966). Since 199^2 = 39601, so sqrt(39602.9966) ≈ 199 + (39602.9966 - 39601)/(2*199) ≈ 199 + 1.9966/398 ≈ 199 + 0.005016 ≈ 199.005016 GeV

Therefore, T1 = 199.005016 - 198 = 1.005016 GeV

So relativistic T1 ≈ 1.005 GeV

Non-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV

Therefore, the difference is approximately 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But let me check again if the non-relativistic calculation gives exactly 1 GeV. Let's confirm:

p² = 396 GeV² (from before)

m1 = 198 GeV/c²

Therefore, T1 = p²/(2m1) = 396 / (2*198) = 396 / 396 = 1 GeV. Yes, exactly 1 GeV.

Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But in the problem, the answer needs to be in GeV, probably. Let me check the question again:

"What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

So the answer is 0.005 GeV. But maybe they want it in MeV? The problem says "Ignore the electrons." But units are not specified. The initial rest mass energy is in GeV, so the answer is likely expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, let me check if my calculation is precise enough.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation in solving for x. Let me check the exact solution.

We had:

sqrt(y + 0.4356) + sqrt(y + 0.1089) = 1

We found y = 0.004433. Let me verify this.

Compute sqrt(0.004433 + 0.4356) + sqrt(0.004433 + 0.1089)

= sqrt(0.440033) + sqrt(0.113333)

≈ 0.6633 + 0.3366 = 0.9999 ≈ 1. So that's correct. So y = 0.004433 is accurate.

Therefore, x = sqrt(y) ≈ 0.066583

Therefore, p = 0.066583 * 300 GeV/c ≈ 19.9749 GeV/c

Then, E1 is sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + 198^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (approx 19.975)^2 + 198^2 )

But 19.975^2 = approx 399.0

So sqrt(399 + 39204) = sqrt(39603) ≈ 199.005

Therefore, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

Therefore, difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But perhaps the exact value is 0.005 GeV, but maybe we need to calculate it more precisely. Let's do that.

Compute E1 more precisely:

p = 19.9749 GeV/c

So (p c)^2 = (19.9749 GeV)^2 ≈ 19.9749^2 = let's calculate it:

19.9749 * 19.9749

= (20 - 0.0251)^2

= 400 - 2*20*0.0251 + (0.0251)^2

= 400 - 1.004 + 0.00063001

= 398.99663001 GeV²

Then (m1 c²)^2 = (198 GeV)^2 = 39204 GeV²

So E1 = sqrt(398.99663001 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.99663001)

Now, sqrt(39602.99663) = ?

We know that 199^2 = 39601

So, let's write 39602.99663 = 39601 + 1.99663

Then, sqrt(39601 + 1.99663) ≈ 199 + (1.99663)/(2*199) - (1.99663)^2/(8*199^3) + ...

First term: 199 + 1.99663/(398) ≈ 199 + 0.0050166 ≈ 199.0050166

Second term: subtract (1.99663)^2 / (8*199^3)

(1.99663)^2 ≈ 3.9865

8*199^3 = 8*(7880599) ≈ 63044792

So 3.9865 / 63044792 ≈ 6.32e-8

So sqrt(39602.99663) ≈ 199.0050166 - 6.32e-8 ≈ 199.0050165 GeV

Therefore, T1 = 199.0050165 - 198 = 1.0050165 GeV

So up to this precision, T1 (relativistic) is approximately 1.0050165 GeV

Non-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV

Therefore, the difference is 1.0050165 - 1 = 0.0050165 GeV, which is approximately 0.00502 GeV.

Convert to MeV: 0.00502 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5.02 MeV. Approximately 5 MeV.

But since the problem says "the difference", and the answer is expected in GeV, unless specified otherwise. However, given that 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, and the original energy is in GeV, but the difference is small. However, maybe we need to present it in GeV. Let's check the problem statement again:

"What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

No specific unit is mentioned, but since the initial units are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV. However, given that the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, but depending on how precise we are, it's approximately 0.005 GeV.

But let me check if there is a more accurate way to compute this difference without approximating.

Alternatively, maybe using Taylor expansion for the relativistic kinetic energy.

The relativistic kinetic energy is T = sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) / c² - m c² = (sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) - m c² ) / c²

Wait, no, actually, the kinetic energy is T = E - m c² = sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) - m c²

But in units where c=1, T = sqrt(p² + m²) - m

So, expanding this in terms of p, we can do a Taylor expansion for small p/m.

T = sqrt( m² + p² ) - m = m ( sqrt(1 + p²/m² ) - 1 ) ≈ m (1 + (1/2)(p²/m²) - (1/8)(p^4/m^4) + ... ) - m = (1/2) p²/m - (1/8) p^4/m^3 + ...

Therefore, the relativistic correction to the classical kinetic energy is approximately - (1/8) p^4 / m^3

Therefore, the difference between relativistic and classical T is approximately - (1/8) p^4 / m^3

But in our case, the classical T is p²/(2m), so the difference is T_relativistic - T_classical ≈ - (1/8) p^4 / m^3

But let's compute this.

Given that in the classical case, T_classical = p²/(2m1) = 1 GeV

So p² = 2 m1 T_classical = 2 * 198 GeV * 1 GeV = 396 GeV²

p^4 = (396)^2 GeV^4

Then, the difference is - (1/8) * (396)^2 / (198)^3 GeV

Compute:

(396)^2 = (2*198)^2 = 4*198²

Therefore, difference = - (1/8) * 4*198² / 198³ = - (1/8)*4 /198 = - (1/(2*198)) = -1/396 ≈ -0.002525 GeV

But this is negative, implying that the relativistic kinetic energy is less than the classical, which contradicts our previous result where relativistic T was higher. So this suggests that the Taylor expansion might not be appropriate here, or that the approximation is not valid because p is not that small compared to m.

Wait, in our case, p ≈ 20 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV. So p/m ≈ 20/198 ≈ 0.101, which is about 10%. So the expansion parameter (p/m)^2 is about 0.01, which is small, but maybe the next term is significant.

Wait, let's compute the exact difference using T_relativistic - T_classical = [sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1] - [p²/(2m1)]

Let me compute this:

sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)

Multiply numerator and denominator by m1:

= [sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)]

But let's compute numerically.

p = 19.9749 GeV

m1 = 198 GeV

sqrt(p² + m1²) = sqrt(19.9749² + 198²) ≈ 199.005016 GeV

Therefore, T_rel = 199.005016 - 198 = 1.005016 GeV

T_classical = p²/(2m1) = (19.9749)^2 / (2*198) ≈ 398.9966 / 396 ≈ 1.007564 GeV

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, this contradicts previous calculations. Wait, earlier, we had in the non-relativistic case p² = 396 GeV², so T_classical = 396/(2*198) = 1 GeV. But here, if p is 19.9749 GeV, then p² ≈ 19.9749² ≈ 398.9966 GeV², which divided by (2*198) is 398.9966 / 396 ≈ 1.007564 GeV. But that's inconsistent with the previous result.

Wait, confusion arises because in the non-relativistic case, p is found by assuming T_classical total = 3 GeV. But in reality, when you do the non-relativistic calculation, you have:

T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV

With T1 = p²/(2m1), T2 = p²/(2m2)

Thus, p²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3 GeV

Which gives p² = 6 GeV / (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 6 / (1/198 + 1/99) = 6 / (3/198) = 6 * 198 /3 = 396 GeV²

Therefore, p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.8997 GeV

Therefore, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 1 GeV

T2_classical = 396/(2*99) = 2 GeV

But in reality, when we calculated p in the relativistic case, we got p ≈ 19.9749 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic p ≈19.8997 GeV.

Therefore, in the non-relativistic case, p is actually sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV, not 19.9749 GeV. So my previous mistake was using the relativistic p in the classical calculation, which is incorrect.

So to correctly compute the classical T1, we need to use p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈19.8997 GeV/c

Wait, but in reality, the momentum in the relativistic case is different from the classical case. So we can't use the same p. Therefore, in the non-relativistic case, p is determined by the classical equations, which gives p = sqrt(396) GeV ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, the momentum is different, p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

But how is that possible? Because in the relativistic case, the momentum is higher, but the kinetic energy is only slightly higher.

Wait, but actually, in the relativistic case, the momentum is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum, leading to a different p than the classical case. Therefore, the momenta in the relativistic and classical cases are different. Therefore, my initial approach was correct: in the relativistic case, p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV, while in the classical case, p ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

But why did I get confused earlier when trying to compute T_classical with relativistic p? Because that's mixing two different scenarios. The momentum in the non-relativistic case is determined by the classical energy conservation, which gives a different p. Therefore, the correct way is:

In the relativistic case:

- Solve for p using relativistic energy conservation: p ≈19.9749 GeV/c, leading to T1 ≈1.005 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case:

- Solve for p using classical energy conservation: p ≈19.8997 GeV/c, leading to T1 =1 GeV.

Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

But let me verify this.

First, relativistic case:

p ≈19.9749 GeV/c

T1_rel = sqrt( (19.9749)^2 + (198)^2 ) - 198 ≈199.005 - 198 =1.005 GeV

Non-relativistic case:

p = sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV/c

T1_classical = (19.8997)^2 / (2*198) ≈(395.994)/396 ≈0.99998 GeV ≈1 GeV

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 -1 =0.005 GeV.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check if the problem might require an exact expression instead of the approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the exact difference using the relativistic and classical approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a more precise way to calculate it without approximating p.

But given the time I've spent, I think the approximate difference is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. However, let me check once more.

Wait, let's compute T1_classical precisely:

p² = 396 GeV²

m1 =198 GeV

T1_classical = 396/(2*198) =1 GeV

In the relativistic case, p_rel =19.9749 GeV/c

T1_rel = sqrt(19.9749² +198²) -198 ≈ sqrt(398.996 +39204) -198 = sqrt(39602.996) -198 ≈199.005016 -198=1.005016 GeV

Therefore, difference is 1.005016 -1=0.005016 GeV≈0.005 GeV

So, 0.005 GeV is the answer. But the problem might want the exact value. Alternatively, maybe there is an exact formula.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy T1 = (gamma1 -1)m1 c², and classical T1 = (1/2)m1 v². But since p = gamma1 m1 v = classical p = m1 v (non-relativistic), so in the non-relativistic case, p = m1 v, so v = p/m1. Then T1_classical = (1/2)m1 (p/m1)^2 = p²/(2m1). But in the relativistic case, p = gamma1 m1 v, so v = p/(gamma1 m1). Therefore, gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p/(m1 c))² ). Therefore, T1_rel = (gamma1 -1)m1 c².

But since in the non-relativistic case, p is different, maybe we can express the difference in terms of the relativistic p.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we have the exact difference as approximately 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, and given the problem's context, this is likely the answer.

Therefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation is 0.005 GeV, which can be written as 5 MeV. However, since the problem may expect the answer in GeV, it's 0.005 GeV. But let me check the calculation once more for any possible mistake.

Wait, another way to compute the difference is:

T_rel - T_class = [sqrt(p_rel² + m1²) - m1] - [p_class²/(2m1)]

But p_rel and p_class are different. In our case, p_rel ≈19.9749 GeV/c, p_class≈19.8997 GeV/c

But this complicates things, as both p's are different. Therefore, the difference comes from both the different momentum and the different formula.

But since in each case the momentum is determined by the respective (relativistic or classical) conservation laws, the total difference is 0.005 GeV as computed.

Therefore, I think the answer is 0.005 GeV, or 5 MeV. Since the question doesn't specify units, but the initial data is in GeV, I'll go with 0.005 GeV. However, sometimes in particle physics, small energy differences are quoted in MeV. Given that 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, and 5 MeV is a more tangible number, maybe the answer is 5 MeV. But the problem says "what is the difference", so it's safer to check if units are required. But as the original rest mass energy is given in GeV, and fragments' rest masses are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, so both are correct. However, given that the difference is small, it's better to write it as 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. But maybe the exact value is 5 MeV.

Alternatively, let me compute the exact difference using more precise values.

From before:

T1_rel = 1.005016 GeV

T1_classical =1 GeV

Difference: 0.005016 GeV, which is approximately 5.02 MeV. So approximately 5 MeV.

Given that in exams, such differences are often rounded to the nearest MeV, so 5 MeV.

But to adhere to the problem's units, which are GeV, 0.005 GeV is acceptable.

But let me see if my initial calculation of T1_rel as 1.007 GeV was due to an error. Wait, no, that was when I approximated p as 20 GeV/c. But with exact p, it's 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}.

But to double-check, let's consider another approach.

The total energy released (total kinetic energy) is 3 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the energies are distributed between the two particles based on their momenta and masses. In the classical case, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to their masses, since T = p²/(2m), and p is the same. So T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2. Therefore, T1 =1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the ratio is different. The more massive fragment has lower kinetic energy. Wait, but in our calculation, T1 was approximately 1.005 GeV, which is slightly higher than the classical 1 GeV, but T2 was 2 GeV in classical, but in reality, T2 was 2 GeV in the relativistic case. Wait, no, in the relativistic case, T2 was 101 -99=2 GeV. Wait, but that was when we used p=20 GeV/c.

Wait, no, in reality, when we use the correct p_rel≈19.9749 GeV/c, then E2 = sqrt( p_rel² + m2² ) = sqrt(19.9749² +99² )≈ sqrt(398.996 +9801)=sqrt(10199.996)≈100.995 GeV

Therefore, T2=100.995 -99=1.995 GeV

Therefore, total kinetic energy is T1 + T2≈1.005 +1.995=3 GeV, correct.

Therefore, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has T1≈1.005 GeV, and the less massive has≈1.995 GeV. While in the classical case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.

Therefore, the difference for T1 is +0.005 GeV, and for T2 is -0.005 GeV.

Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV.

Yes, this makes sense. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

**Final Answer**
The difference between the correct T₁ value and its classical approximation is \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}.

Therefore, their magnitudes are equal: p1 = p2 = p.\n\nRelativistic momentum is given by p = γmv, where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). But we can also express the total energy of a particle as E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Therefore, for each fragment:\n\nE1² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²\n\nE2² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²\n\nSince E1 = m1c² + T1 and E2 = m2c² + T2, substituting these into the energy equations:\n\n(m1c² + T1)² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²\n\n(m2c² + T2)² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²\n\nExpanding the left-hand sides:\n\n(m1²c⁴ + 2 m1 c² T1 + T1²) = p²c² + m1²c⁴\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\n(m2²c⁴ + 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²) = p²c² + m2²c⁴\n\nSubtracting the rest mass terms from both sides:\n\n2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = p²c²\n\n2 m2 c² T2 + T2² = p²c²\n\nTherefore, both expressions equal p²c², so:\n\n2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²\n\nBut we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Let me denote T2 = 3 GeV - T1.\n\nSubstituting T2 into the equation:\n\n2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)²\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can simplify.\n\nFirst, note that m1 = 0.66M = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c²\n\nSimilarly, m2 = 0.33M = 99 GeV/c²\n\nSo m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².\n\nBut since M = 300 GeV/c², so c² can be considered as 1 in these units (since energy is given in GeV, and rest mass energy is Mc²). Wait, maybe we need to be careful with units here.\n\nWait, in particle physics, often units are chosen such that c = 1, so energy, mass, and momentum can be expressed in the same units (e.g., GeV, GeV/c², GeV/c). However, in this problem, since we are dealing with both relativistic and classical calculations, we need to ensure units are consistent. Let me clarify.\n\nIf rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, that implies Mc² = 300 GeV. Therefore, M = 300 GeV / c². Similarly, m1 = 198 GeV / c² and m2 = 99 GeV / c².\n\nBut when dealing with equations, perhaps it\'s better to express energies in terms where c is included. Let me proceed carefully.\n\nLet’s define variables with c=1 for simplicity, so masses and energies are in GeV. Then:\n\nM = 300 GeV (since Mc² = 300 GeV with c=1, so M = 300 GeV / c², but if we set c=1, then M is 300 GeV. Wait, this might get confusing. Alternatively, maybe we can work in natural units where c=1, so mass and energy have the same unit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way where rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so M is 300 GeV/c². Then, when they say the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, that\'s Mc² = 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². Then, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99M, so 0.99 * 300 GeV / c² = 297 GeV / c². The fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2m2. Therefore, m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 297 GeV/c², so m2 = 99 GeV/c² and m1 = 198 GeV/c².\n\nSo, in terms of rest mass energies:\n\nm1c² = 198 GeV\n\nm2c² = 99 GeV\n\nTotal initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energies T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nSo, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nNow, we need to relate T1 and T2 via momentum conservation. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p1| = |p2|.\n\nIn relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But energy is E = γmc², and kinetic energy T = (γ - 1)mc².\n\nAlternatively, using the relation between energy and momentum:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nSo, for each fragment:\n\nE1² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²\n\nE2² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²\n\nBut E1 = m1c² + T1\n\nE2 = m2c² + T2\n\nTherefore:\n\n(m1c² + T1)² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²\n\n(m2c² + T2)² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²\n\nExpanding the left sides:\n\n(m1c²)^2 + 2 m1c² T1 + T1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\n(m2c²)^2 + 2 m2c² T2 + T2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2\n\nSubtracting (m1c²)^2 and (m2c²)^2 respectively:\n\n2 m1c² T1 + T1² = (p c)^2\n\n2 m2c² T2 + T2² = (p c)^2\n\nTherefore, both expressions equal (p c)^2, so:\n\n2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² T2 + T2²\n\nBut since T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, we can write T2 = 3 GeV - T1. Substitute into the equation:\n\n2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)^2\n\nLet me plug in the values. Since m1c² = 198 GeV and m2c² = 99 GeV.\n\nLeft side: 2 * 198 GeV * T1 + T1² = 396 GeV * T1 + T1²\n\nRight side: 2 * 99 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2 * 99 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) = 198 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) = 594 GeV² - 198 GeV * T1\n\n(3 GeV - T1)^2 = 9 GeV² - 6 GeV * T1 + T1²\n\nTherefore, right side becomes:\n\n594 GeV² - 198 GeV * T1 + 9 GeV² - 6 GeV * T1 + T1²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(594 + 9) GeV² - (198 + 6) GeV * T1 + T1² = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1 + T1²\n\nSet equal to left side:\n\n396 GeV * T1 + T1² = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1 + T1²\n\nSubtract T1² from both sides:\n\n396 GeV * T1 = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n396 GeV * T1 + 204 GeV * T1 - 603 GeV² = 0\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(396 + 204) GeV * T1 - 603 GeV² = 0\n\n600 GeV * T1 = 603 GeV²\n\nTherefore, T1 = 603 GeV² / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\nSo, the relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nBut wait, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, so T2 = 3 - 1.005 = 1.995 GeV.\n\nNow, let\'s check if this makes sense. The heavier fragment has less kinetic energy, which seems counterintuitive in classical mechanics, where momentum is mv, so if masses are different, the lighter one would have higher velocity. But in relativity, since momentum is γmv, the relationship is more complex.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the heavier fragment has T1 = 1.005 GeV, which is about a third of the total kinetic energy, and the lighter fragment has about two-thirds. That seems plausible because the lighter fragment would need higher velocity to have the same magnitude of momentum, hence more kinetic energy.\n\nNow, let\'s compute the classical approximation.\n\n**Classical Calculation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2)mv², and momentum is p = mv.\n\nSince the momenta are equal and opposite, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Therefore, v2 = (m1/m2) v1. Given m1 = 2m2, so v2 = 2 v1.\n\nTotal kinetic energy T = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2²\n\nSubstitute v2 = 2 v1 and m1 = 2m2:\n\nT = (1/2)(2m2) v1² + (1/2)m2 (4 v1²) = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1²\n\nGiven that T = 3 GeV (total kinetic energy), so 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV\n\nBut m2 is 99 GeV/c². So:\n\nv1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1 / 99) c²\n\nv1 = c / √(99) ≈ c / 9.949 ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nBut in classical mechanics, velocities can\'t approach c, but since we\'re only doing a classical approximation, we proceed.\n\nThen, T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)(1 / 99) c²\n\nBut m2 c² = 99 GeV, so substituting:\n\nT1 = (1/2)(2 * 99 GeV / c²) * (1 / 99) c² = (1/2)(2 * 99 / 99) GeV = (1/2)(2) GeV = 1 GeV\n\nSo classically, T1 is 1 GeV. Relativistically, it\'s 1.005 GeV. The difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nWait, that seems small. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, in the classical calculation, we have:\n\nFrom m1 v1 = m2 v2, with m1 = 2m2, so v2 = 2 v1.\n\nTotal kinetic energy:\n\nT = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2(4v1²) = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV\n\nTherefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV\n\nBut m2 is 99 GeV/c², so:\n\nv1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1/99) c²\n\nThus, v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c, as before.\n\nThen T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(198 GeV/c²)(1/99)c² = (1/2)(2 GeV) = 1 GeV. Yes, that\'s correct.\n\nRelativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Therefore, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me verify the relativistic calculation again because 1.005 GeV seems a small difference. Let me check the algebra steps.\n\nStarting from:\n\n2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² T2 + T2²\n\nBut m1c² = 198 GeV, m2c² = 99 GeV, T2 = 3 - T1 GeV.\n\nLeft side: 2*198*T1 + T1² = 396 T1 + T1²\n\nRight side: 2*99*(3 - T1) + (3 - T1)^2 = 198*(3 - T1) + 9 -6 T1 + T1² = 594 - 198 T1 + 9 -6 T1 + T1² = 603 -204 T1 + T1²\n\nSet equal:\n\n396 T1 + T1² = 603 -204 T1 + T1²\n\nCancel T1²:\n\n396 T1 = 603 -204 T1\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(396 + 204) T1 = 603\n\n600 T1 = 603\n\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. However, let\'s check if this is in the correct unit.\n\nWait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 1.005 GeV (relativistic) - 1 GeV (classical) = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me confirm once more if the units are properly handled. Since all energies are in GeV, and the rest mass energies are given in GeV (i.e., Mc² = 300 GeV), then the kinetic energies are also in GeV. Therefore, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is expected in GeV? The problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical approximation". So, 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Depending on the problem\'s expectation, but since the answer is requested in a box, likely in GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But maybe expressed as 5 MeV. But let\'s check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an error in the relativistic calculation. Let me check the relativistic equations again.\n\nWait, in the relativistic calculation, we set up the equations correctly:\n\nE1 = m1c² + T1\n\nE2 = m2c² + T2\n\nE1 + E2 = Mc²\n\nBut Mc² is 300 GeV. However, m1c² + m2c² = 297 GeV, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nThen, using momentum conservation, we set E1² = (p c)^2 + (m1c²)^2 and similarly for E2, then equate the (p c)^2 terms.\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Then, solving for T1 gives 1.005 GeV. The classical gives 1 GeV, so difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the momentum expressions. Let me re-express the relativistic momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using velocity terms.\n\nIn relativity, the momentum is p = γ m v. The kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1)m c².\n\nSo, for each fragment:\n\np1 = γ1 m1 v1\n\np2 = γ2 m2 v2\n\nBut p1 = p2.\n\nSo, γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2\n\nBut T1 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c²\n\nT2 = (γ2 - 1) m2 c²\n\nWe can write γ1 = 1 + T1/(m1 c²)\n\nSimilarly, γ2 = 1 + T2/(m2 c²)\n\nBut also, velocity v = c² p / E. Since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, so v = c² p / E. Therefore, v1 = c² p1 / E1 and v2 = c² p2 / E2. But since p1 = p2 = p and E1 = m1c² + T1, E2 = m2c² + T2.\n\nBut maybe this approach is more complicated. Let\'s stick to the previous method, which gave a consistent answer.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s compute the velocities in the relativistic case and see if they make sense.\n\nFrom the relativistic result, T1 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nSince T1 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c², so:\n\nγ1 = 1 + T1 / (m1 c²) = 1 + 1.005 GeV / 198 GeV ≈ 1 + 0.005075 ≈ 1.005075\n\nTherefore, γ1 ≈ 1.005075\n\nThen, the velocity v1 can be found from γ1:\n\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²/c²)\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(1 - v1²/c²) = 1 / γ1 ≈ 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 - v1²/c² ≈ 0.9899\n\nTherefore, v1²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101\n\nv1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) c ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nWhich matches the classical velocity. Wait, that\'s interesting. The velocity is about 0.1c, so the classical approximation might be reasonable, but the kinetic energy difference is still 5 MeV. Even though the velocity is only 10% of c, the relativistic correction is small but non-zero.\n\nIn the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV, and relativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Let\'s compute the relativistic momentum and see if the classical momentum is different.\n\nRelativistic momentum p = sqrt(E1² - (m1 c²)^2)/c\n\nE1 = m1c² + T1 = 198 GeV + 1.005 GeV = 199.005 GeV\n\nSo,\n\np c = sqrt(199.005² - 198²) GeV\n\nCalculate that:\n\n199.005² = (200 - 0.995)² ≈ 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² = 40000 - 398 + 0.990 ≈ 39602.99\n\n198² = 39204\n\nSo, sqrt(39602.99 - 39204) = sqrt(398.99) ≈ 19.9749 GeV\n\nTherefore, p = 19.9749 GeV / c\n\nIn classical mechanics, p = m1 v1\n\nBut m1 = 198 GeV/c², v1 = 0.1005 c\n\nSo p = 198 GeV/c² * 0.1005 c = 19.899 GeV/c\n\nWhich is slightly less than the relativistic momentum of ~19.975 GeV/c. Therefore, the classical momentum underestimates the actual momentum. However, in the classical calculation for T1, we still ended up with T1 = 1 GeV, which is close to the relativistic 1.005 GeV. The difference arises because even a small error in momentum can lead to a small difference in energy when squared.\n\nThus, the difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. Since the problem asks for the difference, and in particle physics, MeV is a common unit, but the problem might expect GeV. However, given the options, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. The problem might want the answer in GeV, so 0.005 GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.\n\nWait, T1 (relativistic) = 1.005 GeV\n\nT1 (classical) = 1 GeV\n\nDifference: 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. To confirm, 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nYes. So, the answer is 5 MeV. However, the problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, if the question expects the answer in GeV, then 0.005 GeV. But in high-energy physics, 5 MeV is a standard unit. But to be safe, check the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"\n\nIt doesn\'t specify the unit, but since the initial rest mass energy is given in GeV, and the kinetic energies are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, to match the problem\'s units, maybe GeV is preferred. But since 0.005 GeV is a small number, perhaps expressed as 5 MeV. However, the problem might accept either. Let me check the calculation once more for errors.\n\nWait, another way to compute the relativistic kinetic energy is using the relation:\n\nFor each particle, T = (γ - 1)m c²\n\nAnd since p1 = p2 = p,\n\nγ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2\n\nBut also, v1 = c² p / E1, v2 = c² p / E2\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ1 m1 (c² p / E1) = γ2 m2 (c² p / E2)\n\nCancel p and c²:\n\nγ1 m1 / E1 = γ2 m2 / E2\n\nBut E1 = γ1 m1 c², E2 = γ2 m2 c²\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ1 m1 / (γ1 m1 c²) = γ2 m2 / (γ2 m2 c²)\n\nSimplifies to 1/c² = 1/c², which is a tautology, so not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that E1 + E2 = Mc² and p1 = p2 = p,\n\nE1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )\n\nE2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ) = Mc²\n\nBut this is a complicated equation to solve for p. However, in our previous approach, by introducing T1 and T2, we found T1 = 1.005 GeV. So, given that, and the classical T1 being 1 GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Given that the problem mentions "the difference", and in the context of nuclear physics, MeV is a more natural unit for such a small difference. However, the problem statement uses GeV for the initial energy. But since 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV, both are correct. The problem might expect the answer in GeV, but since it\'s a small number, maybe MeV. The problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}". Given that, and the likely answer is 5 MeV, but the problem\'s original units are GeV, so perhaps 0.005 GeV. However, let me check once more.\n\nWait, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. The kinetic energies are 3 GeV total. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Since MeV is a thousandth of a GeV, and the difference is 5 thousandths, both representations are correct. However, in exams, sometimes they prefer the answer in the same unit as the problem\'s given data. But since the question is about the difference between two values in T1, which is in GeV, but the difference is small, maybe expressed in MeV. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so either is acceptable. However, in the context of fission, MeV is more commonly used for such energy differences. For example, typical kinetic energies in fission fragments are on the order of tens to hundreds of MeV. But in this case, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV (3000 MeV), which is extremely large. Wait, 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. But typical nuclear fission kinetic energies are around 200 MeV total. So this problem is with a very high-energy fission, but regardless.\n\nGiven that, but according to the problem\'s own units, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so 3 GeV is 1% of that, which is the total kinetic energy. The difference in T1 is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Since the problem may prefer the answer in GeV, but given the smallness, perhaps 5 MeV. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n"the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"\n\nIt doesn\'t specify units, but since T1 is asked, and T1 is in GeV, but the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. However, to match the problem\'s units, maybe 0.005 GeV. But in particle physics, sometimes "MeV" are used even when the main unit is GeV. The answer is 5 MeV. I think it\'s safer to write both, but since the problem mentions "ignore the electrons", which is a common phrase in nuclear physics, where MeV are standard. Therefore, I will go with \\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\nIn the problem statement, all masses are given in GeV (rest-mass energy), so technically, the kinetic energy T1 is in GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Since the problem didn\'t specify the unit for the answer, but given that 5 MeV is a more manageable number, and MeV is a subunit, it\'s better to write both. However, in the absence of specific instructions, perhaps the answer is expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is correct. However, in the context of the problem, since the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy released is 3 GeV, a difference of 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Given that 5 MeV is a more tangible number in nuclear physics, I think the answer is 5 MeV. Hence, boxed as \\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390844, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6605, prompt_tokens=568, total_tokens=7173, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

1. **Initial Conditions and Masses**:
   - The initial rest mass energy of the nucleus is \(300 \, \text{GeV}\).
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is \(99\%\) of the initial mass, giving \(0.99 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV}\).
   - The fragments have rest masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) such that \(m_1 = 2m_2\). Solving \(m_1 + m_2 = 297 \, \text{GeV}\) gives \(m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2\) and \(m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2\).

2. **Energy Conservation**:
   - The total kinetic energy released is \(300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}\).

3. **Relativistic Calculation**:
   - Using conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic kinetic energy \(T_1\) of the more massive fragment is calculated.
   - Solving the equations for energy and momentum conservation gives \(T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}\).

4. **Classical Calculation**:
   - Using classical mechanics, the kinetic energy \(T_1\) is calculated using momentum conservation and kinetic energy equations.
   - The classical kinetic energy \(T_1\) is found to be \(1 \, \text{GeV}\).

5. **Difference**:
   - The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies is \(1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV}\), which converts to \(5 \, \text{MeV}\).

Thus, the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy \(T_1\) is \(\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}\).

Let's start with the relativistic approach.

**Relativistic Calculation:**

Total energy of each fragment is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy:

E1 = m1c² + T1

E2 = m2c² + T2

Total energy conservation: E1 + E2 = Mc²

So:

m1c² + T1 + m2c² + T2 = Mc²

But since m1 + m2 = 0.99M, then:

0.99Mc² + T1 + T2 = Mc²

Therefore, T1 + T2 = 0.01Mc² = 3 GeV (as established earlier).

Momentum conservation: p1 + p2 = 0, so p1 = -p2. Therefore, their magnitudes are equal: p1 = p2 = p.

Relativistic momentum is given by p = γmv, where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). But we can also express the total energy of a particle as E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Therefore, for each fragment:

E1² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²

E2² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²

Since E1 = m1c² + T1 and E2 = m2c² + T2, substituting these into the energy equations:

(m1c² + T1)² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²

(m2c² + T2)² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²

Expanding the left-hand sides:

(m1²c⁴ + 2 m1 c² T1 + T1²) = p²c² + m1²c⁴

Similarly for the second equation:

(m2²c⁴ + 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²) = p²c² + m2²c⁴

Subtracting the rest mass terms from both sides:

2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = p²c²

2 m2 c² T2 + T2² = p²c²

Therefore, both expressions equal p²c², so:

2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²

But we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Let me denote T2 = 3 GeV - T1.

Substituting T2 into the equation:

2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)²

This seems complex, but perhaps we can simplify.

First, note that m1 = 0.66M = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c²

Similarly, m2 = 0.33M = 99 GeV/c²

So m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².

But since M = 300 GeV/c², so c² can be considered as 1 in these units (since energy is given in GeV, and rest mass energy is Mc²). Wait, maybe we need to be careful with units here.

Wait, in particle physics, often units are chosen such that c = 1, so energy, mass, and momentum can be expressed in the same units (e.g., GeV, GeV/c², GeV/c). However, in this problem, since we are dealing with both relativistic and classical calculations, we need to ensure units are consistent. Let me clarify.

If rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, that implies Mc² = 300 GeV. Therefore, M = 300 GeV / c². Similarly, m1 = 198 GeV / c² and m2 = 99 GeV / c².

But when dealing with equations, perhaps it's better to express energies in terms where c is included. Let me proceed carefully.

Let’s define variables with c=1 for simplicity, so masses and energies are in GeV. Then:

M = 300 GeV (since Mc² = 300 GeV with c=1, so M = 300 GeV / c², but if we set c=1, then M is 300 GeV. Wait, this might get confusing. Alternatively, maybe we can work in natural units where c=1, so mass and energy have the same unit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way where rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so M is 300 GeV/c². Then, when they say the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, that's Mc² = 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². Then, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99M, so 0.99 * 300 GeV / c² = 297 GeV / c². The fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2m2. Therefore, m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 297 GeV/c², so m2 = 99 GeV/c² and m1 = 198 GeV/c².

So, in terms of rest mass energies:

m1c² = 198 GeV

m2c² = 99 GeV

Total initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energies T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, we need to relate T1 and T2 via momentum conservation. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p1| = |p2|.

In relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But energy is E = γmc², and kinetic energy T = (γ - 1)mc².

Alternatively, using the relation between energy and momentum:

E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

So, for each fragment:

E1² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²

E2² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²

But E1 = m1c² + T1

E2 = m2c² + T2

Therefore:

(m1c² + T1)² = (p c)² + (m1 c²)²

(m2c² + T2)² = (p c)² + (m2 c²)²

Expanding the left sides:

(m1c²)^2 + 2 m1c² T1 + T1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2

Similarly for the second equation:

(m2c²)^2 + 2 m2c² T2 + T2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2

Subtracting (m1c²)^2 and (m2c²)^2 respectively:

2 m1c² T1 + T1² = (p c)^2

2 m2c² T2 + T2² = (p c)^2

Therefore, both expressions equal (p c)^2, so:

2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² T2 + T2²

But since T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, we can write T2 = 3 GeV - T1. Substitute into the equation:

2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)^2

Let me plug in the values. Since m1c² = 198 GeV and m2c² = 99 GeV.

Left side: 2 * 198 GeV * T1 + T1² = 396 GeV * T1 + T1²

Right side: 2 * 99 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) + (3 GeV - T1)^2

Compute each term:

2 * 99 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) = 198 GeV * (3 GeV - T1) = 594 GeV² - 198 GeV * T1

(3 GeV - T1)^2 = 9 GeV² - 6 GeV * T1 + T1²

Therefore, right side becomes:

594 GeV² - 198 GeV * T1 + 9 GeV² - 6 GeV * T1 + T1²

Combine like terms:

(594 + 9) GeV² - (198 + 6) GeV * T1 + T1² = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1 + T1²

Set equal to left side:

396 GeV * T1 + T1² = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1 + T1²

Subtract T1² from both sides:

396 GeV * T1 = 603 GeV² - 204 GeV * T1

Bring all terms to the left:

396 GeV * T1 + 204 GeV * T1 - 603 GeV² = 0

Combine terms:

(396 + 204) GeV * T1 - 603 GeV² = 0

600 GeV * T1 = 603 GeV²

Therefore, T1 = 603 GeV² / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV

So, the relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV.

But wait, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, so T2 = 3 - 1.005 = 1.995 GeV.

Now, let's check if this makes sense. The heavier fragment has less kinetic energy, which seems counterintuitive in classical mechanics, where momentum is mv, so if masses are different, the lighter one would have higher velocity. But in relativity, since momentum is γmv, the relationship is more complex.

But according to the calculation, the heavier fragment has T1 = 1.005 GeV, which is about a third of the total kinetic energy, and the lighter fragment has about two-thirds. That seems plausible because the lighter fragment would need higher velocity to have the same magnitude of momentum, hence more kinetic energy.

Now, let's compute the classical approximation.

**Classical Calculation:**

In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2)mv², and momentum is p = mv.

Since the momenta are equal and opposite, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Therefore, v2 = (m1/m2) v1. Given m1 = 2m2, so v2 = 2 v1.

Total kinetic energy T = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2²

Substitute v2 = 2 v1 and m1 = 2m2:

T = (1/2)(2m2) v1² + (1/2)m2 (4 v1²) = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1²

Given that T = 3 GeV (total kinetic energy), so 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². So:

v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1 / 99) c²

v1 = c / √(99) ≈ c / 9.949 ≈ 0.1005 c

But in classical mechanics, velocities can't approach c, but since we're only doing a classical approximation, we proceed.

Then, T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)(1 / 99) c²

But m2 c² = 99 GeV, so substituting:

T1 = (1/2)(2 * 99 GeV / c²) * (1 / 99) c² = (1/2)(2 * 99 / 99) GeV = (1/2)(2) GeV = 1 GeV

So classically, T1 is 1 GeV. Relativistically, it's 1.005 GeV. The difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Wait, that seems small. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, in the classical calculation, we have:

From m1 v1 = m2 v2, with m1 = 2m2, so v2 = 2 v1.

Total kinetic energy:

T = (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2(4v1²) = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV

But m2 is 99 GeV/c², so:

v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) = (1/99) c²

Thus, v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c, as before.

Then T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(198 GeV/c²)(1/99)c² = (1/2)(2 GeV) = 1 GeV. Yes, that's correct.

Relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Therefore, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.

But let me verify the relativistic calculation again because 1.005 GeV seems a small difference. Let me check the algebra steps.

Starting from:

2 m1c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2c² T2 + T2²

But m1c² = 198 GeV, m2c² = 99 GeV, T2 = 3 - T1 GeV.

Left side: 2*198*T1 + T1² = 396 T1 + T1²

Right side: 2*99*(3 - T1) + (3 - T1)^2 = 198*(3 - T1) + 9 -6 T1 + T1² = 594 - 198 T1 + 9 -6 T1 + T1² = 603 -204 T1 + T1²

Set equal:

396 T1 + T1² = 603 -204 T1 + T1²

Cancel T1²:

396 T1 = 603 -204 T1

Combine terms:

(396 + 204) T1 = 603

600 T1 = 603

T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV

Yes, that's correct.

So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. However, let's check if this is in the correct unit.

Wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 1.005 GeV (relativistic) - 1 GeV (classical) = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But let me confirm once more if the units are properly handled. Since all energies are in GeV, and the rest mass energies are given in GeV (i.e., Mc² = 300 GeV), then the kinetic energies are also in GeV. Therefore, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But perhaps the answer is expected in GeV? The problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical approximation". So, 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Depending on the problem's expectation, but since the answer is requested in a box, likely in GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But maybe expressed as 5 MeV. But let's check.

Alternatively, perhaps there was an error in the relativistic calculation. Let me check the relativistic equations again.

Wait, in the relativistic calculation, we set up the equations correctly:

E1 = m1c² + T1

E2 = m2c² + T2

E1 + E2 = Mc²

But Mc² is 300 GeV. However, m1c² + m2c² = 297 GeV, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Then, using momentum conservation, we set E1² = (p c)^2 + (m1c²)^2 and similarly for E2, then equate the (p c)^2 terms.

Yes, that's correct. Then, solving for T1 gives 1.005 GeV. The classical gives 1 GeV, so difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the momentum expressions. Let me re-express the relativistic momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps using velocity terms.

In relativity, the momentum is p = γ m v. The kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1)m c².

So, for each fragment:

p1 = γ1 m1 v1

p2 = γ2 m2 v2

But p1 = p2.

So, γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2

But T1 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c²

T2 = (γ2 - 1) m2 c²

We can write γ1 = 1 + T1/(m1 c²)

Similarly, γ2 = 1 + T2/(m2 c²)

But also, velocity v = c² p / E. Since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, so v = c² p / E. Therefore, v1 = c² p1 / E1 and v2 = c² p2 / E2. But since p1 = p2 = p and E1 = m1c² + T1, E2 = m2c² + T2.

But maybe this approach is more complicated. Let's stick to the previous method, which gave a consistent answer.

Alternatively, let's compute the velocities in the relativistic case and see if they make sense.

From the relativistic result, T1 = 1.005 GeV.

Since T1 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c², so:

γ1 = 1 + T1 / (m1 c²) = 1 + 1.005 GeV / 198 GeV ≈ 1 + 0.005075 ≈ 1.005075

Therefore, γ1 ≈ 1.005075

Then, the velocity v1 can be found from γ1:

γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²/c²)

So,

sqrt(1 - v1²/c²) = 1 / γ1 ≈ 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495

Squaring both sides:

1 - v1²/c² ≈ 0.9899

Therefore, v1²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101

v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) c ≈ 0.1005 c

Which matches the classical velocity. Wait, that's interesting. The velocity is about 0.1c, so the classical approximation might be reasonable, but the kinetic energy difference is still 5 MeV. Even though the velocity is only 10% of c, the relativistic correction is small but non-zero.

In the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV, and relativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me confirm with another approach. Let's compute the relativistic momentum and see if the classical momentum is different.

Relativistic momentum p = sqrt(E1² - (m1 c²)^2)/c

E1 = m1c² + T1 = 198 GeV + 1.005 GeV = 199.005 GeV

So,

p c = sqrt(199.005² - 198²) GeV

Calculate that:

199.005² = (200 - 0.995)² ≈ 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² = 40000 - 398 + 0.990 ≈ 39602.99

198² = 39204

So, sqrt(39602.99 - 39204) = sqrt(398.99) ≈ 19.9749 GeV

Therefore, p = 19.9749 GeV / c

In classical mechanics, p = m1 v1

But m1 = 198 GeV/c², v1 = 0.1005 c

So p = 198 GeV/c² * 0.1005 c = 19.899 GeV/c

Which is slightly less than the relativistic momentum of ~19.975 GeV/c. Therefore, the classical momentum underestimates the actual momentum. However, in the classical calculation for T1, we still ended up with T1 = 1 GeV, which is close to the relativistic 1.005 GeV. The difference arises because even a small error in momentum can lead to a small difference in energy when squared.

Thus, the difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. Since the problem asks for the difference, and in particle physics, MeV is a common unit, but the problem might expect GeV. However, given the options, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. The problem might want the answer in GeV, so 0.005 GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.

Wait, T1 (relativistic) = 1.005 GeV

T1 (classical) = 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. To confirm, 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.

Yes. So, the answer is 5 MeV. However, the problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, if the question expects the answer in GeV, then 0.005 GeV. But in high-energy physics, 5 MeV is a standard unit. But to be safe, check the problem statement.

The problem states: "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

It doesn't specify the unit, but since the initial rest mass energy is given in GeV, and the kinetic energies are in GeV, the answer is likely expected in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, to match the problem's units, maybe GeV is preferred. But since 0.005 GeV is a small number, perhaps expressed as 5 MeV. However, the problem might accept either. Let me check the calculation once more for errors.

Wait, another way to compute the relativistic kinetic energy is using the relation:

For each particle, T = (γ - 1)m c²

And since p1 = p2 = p,

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2

But also, v1 = c² p / E1, v2 = c² p / E2

Therefore,

γ1 m1 (c² p / E1) = γ2 m2 (c² p / E2)

Cancel p and c²:

γ1 m1 / E1 = γ2 m2 / E2

But E1 = γ1 m1 c², E2 = γ2 m2 c²

Therefore,

γ1 m1 / (γ1 m1 c²) = γ2 m2 / (γ2 m2 c²)

Simplifies to 1/c² = 1/c², which is a tautology, so not helpful.

Alternatively, using the fact that E1 + E2 = Mc² and p1 = p2 = p,

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

Therefore,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ) = Mc²

But this is a complicated equation to solve for p. However, in our previous approach, by introducing T1 and T2, we found T1 = 1.005 GeV. So, given that, and the classical T1 being 1 GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Given that the problem mentions "the difference", and in the context of nuclear physics, MeV is a more natural unit for such a small difference. However, the problem statement uses GeV for the initial energy. But since 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV, both are correct. The problem might expect the answer in GeV, but since it's a small number, maybe MeV. The problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Given that, and the likely answer is 5 MeV, but the problem's original units are GeV, so perhaps 0.005 GeV. However, let me check once more.

Wait, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. The kinetic energies are 3 GeV total. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Since MeV is a thousandth of a GeV, and the difference is 5 thousandths, both representations are correct. However, in exams, sometimes they prefer the answer in the same unit as the problem's given data. But since the question is about the difference between two values in T1, which is in GeV, but the difference is small, maybe expressed in MeV. But the problem doesn't specify, so either is acceptable. However, in the context of fission, MeV is more commonly used for such energy differences. For example, typical kinetic energies in fission fragments are on the order of tens to hundreds of MeV. But in this case, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV (3000 MeV), which is extremely large. Wait, 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. But typical nuclear fission kinetic energies are around 200 MeV total. So this problem is with a very high-energy fission, but regardless.

Given that, but according to the problem's own units, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so 3 GeV is 1% of that, which is the total kinetic energy. The difference in T1 is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Since the problem may prefer the answer in GeV, but given the smallness, perhaps 5 MeV. However, looking back at the problem statement:

"the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

It doesn't specify units, but since T1 is asked, and T1 is in GeV, but the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. However, to match the problem's units, maybe 0.005 GeV. But in particle physics, sometimes "MeV" are used even when the main unit is GeV. The answer is 5 MeV. I think it's safer to write both, but since the problem mentions "ignore the electrons", which is a common phrase in nuclear physics, where MeV are standard. Therefore, I will go with \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

But let me check again:

In the problem statement, all masses are given in GeV (rest-mass energy), so technically, the kinetic energy T1 is in GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Since the problem didn't specify the unit for the answer, but given that 5 MeV is a more manageable number, and MeV is a subunit, it's better to write both. However, in the absence of specific instructions, perhaps the answer is expected in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is correct. However, in the context of the problem, since the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy released is 3 GeV, a difference of 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Given that 5 MeV is a more tangible number in nuclear physics, I think the answer is 5 MeV. Hence, boxed as \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}

Let’s denote \\( p = \\gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \\gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \\).\n\nIn natural units (where c=1), velocities are fractions of c, and momentum is \\( \\gamma m v \\).\n\nAlternatively, in terms of relativistic momentum:\n\n\\( p_1 = p_2 \\), so \\( \\gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \\gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \\)\n\nBut \\( \\gamma v = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2}} \\), which complicates things. Alternatively, express velocities in terms of beta (\\( \\beta = v/c \\)), so \\( \\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2} \\), and \\( p = \\gamma m \\beta c \\).\n\nBut perhaps working in natural units (c=1) will simplify equations.\n\nLet’s set c=1, so energies and masses are in GeV and GeV/c² (but since c=1, mass in GeV/c² is equivalent to GeV/(c²), but with c=1, mass is in GeV. Hmm, maybe better to use SI units, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, actually, in particle physics, often set c=1, so E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²) * c², so with c=1, E = m. Thus, rest mass energy is just m.\n\nBut in this problem, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so the rest mass M is 300 GeV/c². Then, after fission, the rest masses sum to 0.99M, so 297 GeV/c². The kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV.\n\nBut in natural units (c=1), mass is in GeV/c², energy in GeV, and momentum in GeV/c.\n\nBut perhaps we can proceed with c=1 for simplicity.\n\nSo, M = 300 GeV/c².\n\nAfter fission:\n\nm1 = 198 GeV/c²,\n\nm2 = 99 GeV/c².\n\nTotal energy before fission: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.\n\nTotal energy after fission: E1 + E2 = γ1 m1 c² + γ2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.\n\nBut since c=1, E1 + E2 = γ1 m1 + γ2 m2 = 300 GeV.\n\nBut m1 + m2 = 297 GeV/c², so the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV, as before.\n\nMomentum conservation: p1 = p2 (since they are opposite, but magnitudes equal).\n\nIn natural units, p = γ m v. But since c=1, velocity v is in units of c, so p = γ m v.\n\nBut also, energy E = γ m.\n\nAlternatively, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². In natural units, E² = p² + m².\n\nTherefore, for each fragment:\n\nE1² = p1² + m1²,\n\nE2² = p2² + m2².\n\nBut since p1 = p2 = p (magnitude), and E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,\n\nSo:\n\nE1 = sqrt(p² + m1²),\n\nE2 = sqrt(p² + m2²),\n\nand sqrt(p² + m1²) + sqrt(p² + m2²) = 300 GeV.\n\nBut m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(p² + (198)^2) + sqrt(p² + (99)^2) = 300\n\nLet’s denote x = p (in GeV/c, but since c=1, x is in GeV).\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300\n\nThis equation can be solved for x.\n\nAlternatively, let’s square both sides to eliminate sqrt terms. Let’s denote:\n\nsqrt(x² + 198²) = A,\n\nsqrt(x² + 99²) = B,\n\nso A + B = 300.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nA² + 2AB + B² = 300²\n\nBut A² = x² + 198²,\n\nB² = x² + 99²,\n\nSo:\n\n(x² + 198²) + 2AB + (x² + 99²) = 90000\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x² + (198² + 99²) + 2AB = 90000\n\nCalculate 198² = 39204, 99² = 9801, so sum is 39204 + 9801 = 49005.\n\nThus:\n\n2x² + 49005 + 2AB = 90000\n\nSo,\n\n2x² + 2AB = 90000 - 49005 = 40995\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx² + AB = 20497.5\n\nBut AB = sqrt(x² + 198²) * sqrt(x² + 99²)\n\nThis is complicated. Alternatively, we can proceed numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express AB in terms of A and B. Since A + B = 300, and A² - B² = (x² + 198²) - (x² + 99²) = 198² - 99² = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99 * 297 = 29403.\n\nBut A² - B² = (A - B)(A + B) = (A - B)(300) = 29403\n\nThus, A - B = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA + B = 300,\n\nA - B ≈ 98.01.\n\nAdding these equations:\n\n2A ≈ 398.01 => A ≈ 199.005,\n\nSubtracting:\n\n2B ≈ 300 - 98.01 = 201.99 => B ≈ 100.995.\n\nBut A = sqrt(x² + 198²) ≈ 199.005,\n\nSo, square both sides:\n\nx² + 198² ≈ (199.005)^2\n\nCalculate:\n\n198² = 39204,\n\n199.005² = (200 - 0.995)^2 ≈ 40000 - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² ≈ 40000 - 398 + ~1 = 39603.\n\nThus,\n\nx² ≈ 39603 - 39204 = 399.\n\nSo, x ≈ sqrt(399) ≈ 19.975 GeV/c.\n\nTherefore, momentum p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c.\n\nNow, compute E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) ≈ sqrt(399 + 198²) ≈ sqrt(399 + 39204) ≈ sqrt(39603) ≈ 199.005 GeV.\n\nSimilarly, E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.\n\nKinetic energy T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV,\n\nT2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.\n\nSum T1 + T2 = 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the expected.\n\nThus, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is approximately 1.005 GeV.\n\nNow, compute the classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy T1_classical.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². However, in this scenario, since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV (from the mass deficit), but classical physics would not account for relativistic mass-energy equivalence. Wait, actually, in classical physics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but without considering relativistic effects.\n\nAlternatively, in classical physics, the kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m). Since momentum is conserved, both fragments have equal and opposite momenta, with magnitude p. So, for each fragment, T1_classical = p²/(2m1), T2_classical = p²/(2m2), and T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV.\n\nBut wait, in reality, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energies would be calculated using the same momentum but different masses. However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, which in classical physics would not affect the kinetic energy, but here, since the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, and the kinetic energy comes from the 1% mass deficit. But in classical physics, mass is conserved, so perhaps the setup is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in reality, the rest mass decreases by 1%, leading to kinetic energy via E=mc², but in classical physics, kinetic energy is separate and mass is conserved. So in the classical approach, the rest masses would still sum to M, but kinetic energy is generated through some other means. But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, so perhaps even in the classical calculation, we take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV/c², and then compute kinetic energies based on momentum conservation, but using classical KE formulas.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in the classical case, we still have m1 = 198 GeV/c² and m2 = 99 GeV/c², but their kinetic energies are calculated using T = p²/(2m). Then, momentum conservation gives p1 = p2 = p. So, T1_classical = p²/(2m1), T2_classical = p²/(2m2). Then, T1_classical + T2_classical = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = (p²/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2) = total KE = 3 GeV.\n\nSo, solve for p:\n\n(p²/2)(1/198 + 1/99) = 3 GeV.\n\nCompute 1/198 + 1/99 = 1/198 + 2/198 = 3/198 = 1/66.\n\nThus,\n\n(p²/2)(1/66) = 3 => p² = 3 * 2 * 66 = 396 => p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.9 GeV/c.\n\nTherefore, p ≈ 19.9 GeV/c.\n\nThen, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 396/396 = 1 GeV.\n\nSimilarly, T2_classical = 396/(2*99) = 396/198 = 2 GeV.\n\nThus, sum is 1 + 2 = 3 GeV, correct.\n\nTherefore, in the classical approximation, T1_classical = 1 GeV, whereas relativistic calculation gave T1 ≈ 1.005 GeV.\n\nHence, the difference is approximately 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, or 5 MeV.\n\nBut let's verify the exact value.\n\nFrom the relativistic calculation, T1 was found to be approximately 1.005 GeV.\n\nBut let's check the exact value of p. Earlier, we approximated p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c. Let's compute T1 more precisely.\n\nGiven p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c,\n\nE1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) = sqrt(19.975² + 198²)\n\nCompute 19.975² ≈ (20 - 0.025)^2 ≈ 400 - 2*20*0.025 + 0.025² ≈ 400 - 1 + 0.000625 ≈ 399.000625\n\nThus, E1 = sqrt(399.000625 + 39204) = sqrt(39603.000625) ≈ 199.00500156 GeV.\n\nTherefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.00500156 - 198 = 1.00500156 GeV ≈ 1.005 GeV.\n\nThus, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute this more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve the equation exactly. The key equation was:\n\nsqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300\n\nLet me attempt to solve this equation algebraically.\n\nLet’s denote y = x².\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt(y + 198²) + sqrt(y + 99²) = 300\n\nLet’s set A = sqrt(y + 198²), B = sqrt(y + 99²)\n\nThen, A + B = 300\n\nAnd A² - B² = (y + 198²) - (y + 99²) = 198² - 99² = 29403\n\nThus, (A - B)(A + B) = 29403\n\nBut A + B = 300, so (A - B) = 29403 / 300 = 98.01\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nA + B = 300\n\nA - B = 98.01\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2A = 398.01 ⇒ A = 199.005\n\nThen, B = 300 - A = 100.995\n\nNow, A = sqrt(y + 198²) = 199.005\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ny + 198² = (199.005)²\n\nCompute (199.005)^2:\n\n= (200 - 0.995)^2\n\n= 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995²\n\n= 40000 - 398 + 0.990025\n\n= 39602.990025\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 39602.990025 - 198²\n\nBut 198² = 39204\n\nThus,\n\ny = 39602.990025 - 39204 = 398.990025\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(y) ≈ sqrt(398.990025) ≈ 19.97474 GeV/c\n\nThus, exact value of x is approximately 19.97474 GeV/c.\n\nNow, compute E1 = sqrt(x² + m1²) = sqrt(398.990025 + 198²) = sqrt(398.990025 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.990025) = 199.005 GeV.\n\nThus, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nIn classical calculation, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = (19.97474)^2/(2*198) ≈ (398.99)/(396) ≈ 1.00756 GeV.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the classical case, we found p ≈ 19.9 GeV/c, but in reality, if we use the relativistic momentum p ≈19.97474 GeV/c, but in the classical calculation, the momentum would be different? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the classical calculation, we derived p based on classical KE equations. Let's recap.\n\nIn the classical approach, we have:\n\nT1 + T2 = 3 GeV,\n\nT1 = p²/(2m1),\n\nT2 = p²/(2m2),\n\nTherefore,\n\np²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = 3\n\nFactor out p²/2:\n\np²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3\n\nWhich leads to p² = (3 * 2)/( (1/m1 + 1/m2) )\n\nSo,\n\np² = 6 / ( (1/198 + 1/99) )\n\nCompute 1/198 + 1/99 = 3/198 = 1/66\n\nThus,\n\np² = 6 / (1/66) = 6 * 66 = 396\n\nTherefore, p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.8997 GeV/c\n\nHence, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 396/396 = 1 GeV\n\nBut in reality, the relativistic momentum is approximately 19.9747 GeV/c, which is higher. However, in the classical calculation, we use p ≈19.8997 GeV/c. So, the classical T1 is exactly 1 GeV, while the relativistic T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV.\n\nBut wait, in the relativistic case, the momentum is higher, but the kinetic energy is also calculated differently. However, in the classical case, even with different momentum, the KE is calculated as p²/(2m). Therefore, the discrepancy arises because in reality, the momentum is determined relativistically, leading to a slightly higher KE when calculated relativistically.\n\nBut perhaps the confusion arises from whether, in the classical approximation, we use the same momentum as in the relativistic case. However, in reality, in the classical scenario, the momentum would differ because the velocities are calculated without relativistic effects. However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, so even in the classical case, the rest masses are as given (198 and 99 GeV/c²), and the kinetic energy comes from the 1% mass deficit. But in reality, in classical physics, KE is separate from mass, so this is a bit inconsistent. However, the problem likely wants us to assume that in the classical calculation, the rest masses are still 198 and 99, and the KE is computed via classical mechanics, leading to a different value for T1.\n\nThus, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nBut let's check the exact calculation.\n\nRelativistic T1 is exactly (gamma1 - 1)m1.\n\nGiven gamma1 = E1/m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005076.\n\nThus, T1 = (1.005076 - 1)*198 ≈ 0.005076*198 ≈ 1.005 GeV.\n\nClassical T1 is 1 GeV.\n\nThus, difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let's verify if the exact calculation gives a more precise difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact calculation can be done algebraically.\n\nFrom the relativistic equations, we have:\n\nT1 = E1 - m1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1\n\nIn natural units where c=1.\n\nSimilarly, classical T1 = p²/(2m1)\n\nThus, the difference is:\n\nsqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)\n\nLet’s compute this.\n\nLet’s denote p = 19.97474 GeV/c, m1 = 198 GeV/c².\n\nCompute sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(19.97474² + 198²) - 198 - (19.97474²)/(2*198)\n\nFrom earlier, sqrt(19.97474² + 198²) = 199.005 GeV\n\nThus, 199.005 - 198 - (398.99)/(396)\n\n= 1.005 - (1.00756)\n\n= -0.00256 GeV\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, the difference is T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 - 1.00756 ≈ -0.00256 GeV. But that contradicts previous conclusion.\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Wait, in reality, in the classical case, the momentum is different. Wait, in the relativistic case, p ≈19.9747 GeV/c, but in the classical case, p is sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV/c. Therefore, we cannot use the same p for both calculations. Therefore, we must compute T1_classical using the classical momentum, and T1_relativistic using the relativistic momentum.\n\nBut this complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking: given the same physical scenario (i.e., same rest masses and total kinetic energy), compute T1 using relativistic equations and using classical equations, then find the difference.\n\nBut in reality, the classical scenario would not have the same total kinetic energy, because in reality, the KE comes from the mass deficit. However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M, so regardless of the approach, the KE is 3 GeV. Therefore, in both cases, the total KE is 3 GeV, but the distribution between the fragments differs based on relativistic vs classical mechanics.\n\nThus, in the relativistic case, as computed, T1 ≈1.005 GeV, T2≈1.995 GeV.\n\nIn the classical case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.\n\nThus, the difference is 1.005 -1=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV, which in boxed form is \\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in GeV, it would be \\boxed{0.005 \\text{ GeV}}. But given the scale, MeV is more appropriate.\n\nBut let's verify once more.\n\nThe exact relativistic T1 is:\n\nFrom E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) = 199.005 GeV.\n\nThus, T1_rel = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nT1_classical = 1 GeV.\n\nDifference: 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391159, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5408, prompt_tokens=866, total_tokens=6274, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves an atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) (rest-mass energy 300 GeV) undergoing fission into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio, summing to 99% of \( M \). The goal is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

1. **Rest Masses and Kinetic Energy**:
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is \( 0.99M = 297 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).
   - The more massive fragment \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and the less massive \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).
   - Total kinetic energy released: \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Relativistic Calculation**:
   - Conservation of momentum: \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \).
   - Solving the relativistic energy-momentum equations:
     \[
     \sqrt{p^2 + (198)^2} + \sqrt{p^2 + (99)^2} = 300
     \]
   - Results in momentum \( p \approx 19.9747 \, \text{GeV}/c \).
   - Relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Classical Calculation**:
   - Using classical momentum conservation and kinetic energy formula:
     \[
     \frac{p^2}{2m_1} + \frac{p^2}{2m_2} = 3 \, \text{GeV}
     \]
   - Solving gives \( p \approx 19.8997 \, \text{GeV}/c \).
   - Classical kinetic energy \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Difference**:
   - The difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energies:
     \[
     1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}

.

First, relativistic energy-momentum relations:

Total energy of each fragment is \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The total energy is conserved, so:

\( E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 \)

But \( Mc^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), so:

\( \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \)

But since \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), the sum of their rest energies is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV. Therefore:

\( (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 + (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2 c^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)

But momentum conservation gives:

\( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \)

Since momentum vectors are opposite, magnitudes are equal. Let’s denote \( p = \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \).

In natural units (where c=1), velocities are fractions of c, and momentum is \( \gamma m v \).

Alternatively, in terms of relativistic momentum:

\( p_1 = p_2 \), so \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \)

But \( \gamma v = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} \), which complicates things. Alternatively, express velocities in terms of beta (\( \beta = v/c \)), so \( \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \), and \( p = \gamma m \beta c \).

But perhaps working in natural units (c=1) will simplify equations.

Let’s set c=1, so energies and masses are in GeV and GeV/c² (but since c=1, mass in GeV/c² is equivalent to GeV/(c²), but with c=1, mass is in GeV. Hmm, maybe better to use SI units, but perhaps it's manageable.

Wait, actually, in particle physics, often set c=1, so E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²) * c², so with c=1, E = m. Thus, rest mass energy is just m.

But in this problem, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV, so the rest mass M is 300 GeV/c². Then, after fission, the rest masses sum to 0.99M, so 297 GeV/c². The kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV.

But in natural units (c=1), mass is in GeV/c², energy in GeV, and momentum in GeV/c.

But perhaps we can proceed with c=1 for simplicity.

So, M = 300 GeV/c².

After fission:

m1 = 198 GeV/c²,

m2 = 99 GeV/c².

Total energy before fission: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

Total energy after fission: E1 + E2 = γ1 m1 c² + γ2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.

But since c=1, E1 + E2 = γ1 m1 + γ2 m2 = 300 GeV.

But m1 + m2 = 297 GeV/c², so the sum of rest energies is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV, as before.

Momentum conservation: p1 = p2 (since they are opposite, but magnitudes equal).

In natural units, p = γ m v. But since c=1, velocity v is in units of c, so p = γ m v.

But also, energy E = γ m.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². In natural units, E² = p² + m².

Therefore, for each fragment:

E1² = p1² + m1²,

E2² = p2² + m2².

But since p1 = p2 = p (magnitude), and E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

So:

E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²),

E2 = sqrt(p² + m2²),

and sqrt(p² + m1²) + sqrt(p² + m2²) = 300 GeV.

But m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV.

So:

sqrt(p² + (198)^2) + sqrt(p² + (99)^2) = 300

Let’s denote x = p (in GeV/c, but since c=1, x is in GeV).

So:

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300

This equation can be solved for x.

Alternatively, let’s square both sides to eliminate sqrt terms. Let’s denote:

sqrt(x² + 198²) = A,

sqrt(x² + 99²) = B,

so A + B = 300.

Squaring both sides:

A² + 2AB + B² = 300²

But A² = x² + 198²,

B² = x² + 99²,

So:

(x² + 198²) + 2AB + (x² + 99²) = 90000

Simplify:

2x² + (198² + 99²) + 2AB = 90000

Calculate 198² = 39204, 99² = 9801, so sum is 39204 + 9801 = 49005.

Thus:

2x² + 49005 + 2AB = 90000

So,

2x² + 2AB = 90000 - 49005 = 40995

Divide both sides by 2:

x² + AB = 20497.5

But AB = sqrt(x² + 198²) * sqrt(x² + 99²)

This is complicated. Alternatively, we can proceed numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express AB in terms of A and B. Since A + B = 300, and A² - B² = (x² + 198²) - (x² + 99²) = 198² - 99² = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99 * 297 = 29403.

But A² - B² = (A - B)(A + B) = (A - B)(300) = 29403

Thus, A - B = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01.

So, we have:

A + B = 300,

A - B ≈ 98.01.

Adding these equations:

2A ≈ 398.01 => A ≈ 199.005,

Subtracting:

2B ≈ 300 - 98.01 = 201.99 => B ≈ 100.995.

But A = sqrt(x² + 198²) ≈ 199.005,

So, square both sides:

x² + 198² ≈ (199.005)^2

Calculate:

198² = 39204,

199.005² = (200 - 0.995)^2 ≈ 40000 - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² ≈ 40000 - 398 + ~1 = 39603.

Thus,

x² ≈ 39603 - 39204 = 399.

So, x ≈ sqrt(399) ≈ 19.975 GeV/c.

Therefore, momentum p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c.

Now, compute E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) ≈ sqrt(399 + 198²) ≈ sqrt(399 + 39204) ≈ sqrt(39603) ≈ 199.005 GeV.

Similarly, E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

Kinetic energy T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV,

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.

Sum T1 + T2 = 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the expected.

Thus, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is approximately 1.005 GeV.

Now, compute the classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy T1_classical.

In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². However, in this scenario, since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV (from the mass deficit), but classical physics would not account for relativistic mass-energy equivalence. Wait, actually, in classical physics, the kinetic energy would be calculated using the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but without considering relativistic effects.

Alternatively, in classical physics, the kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m). Since momentum is conserved, both fragments have equal and opposite momenta, with magnitude p. So, for each fragment, T1_classical = p²/(2m1), T2_classical = p²/(2m2), and T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV.

But wait, in reality, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energies would be calculated using the same momentum but different masses. However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, which in classical physics would not affect the kinetic energy, but here, since the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, and the kinetic energy comes from the 1% mass deficit. But in classical physics, mass is conserved, so perhaps the setup is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in reality, the rest mass decreases by 1%, leading to kinetic energy via E=mc², but in classical physics, kinetic energy is separate and mass is conserved. So in the classical approach, the rest masses would still sum to M, but kinetic energy is generated through some other means. But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, so perhaps even in the classical calculation, we take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV/c², and then compute kinetic energies based on momentum conservation, but using classical KE formulas.

Therefore, perhaps in the classical case, we still have m1 = 198 GeV/c² and m2 = 99 GeV/c², but their kinetic energies are calculated using T = p²/(2m). Then, momentum conservation gives p1 = p2 = p. So, T1_classical = p²/(2m1), T2_classical = p²/(2m2). Then, T1_classical + T2_classical = p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = (p²/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2) = total KE = 3 GeV.

So, solve for p:

(p²/2)(1/198 + 1/99) = 3 GeV.

Compute 1/198 + 1/99 = 1/198 + 2/198 = 3/198 = 1/66.

Thus,

(p²/2)(1/66) = 3 => p² = 3 * 2 * 66 = 396 => p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.9 GeV/c.

Therefore, p ≈ 19.9 GeV/c.

Then, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 396/396 = 1 GeV.

Similarly, T2_classical = 396/(2*99) = 396/198 = 2 GeV.

Thus, sum is 1 + 2 = 3 GeV, correct.

Therefore, in the classical approximation, T1_classical = 1 GeV, whereas relativistic calculation gave T1 ≈ 1.005 GeV.

Hence, the difference is approximately 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, or 5 MeV.

But let's verify the exact value.

From the relativistic calculation, T1 was found to be approximately 1.005 GeV.

But let's check the exact value of p. Earlier, we approximated p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c. Let's compute T1 more precisely.

Given p ≈ 19.975 GeV/c,

E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) = sqrt(19.975² + 198²)

Compute 19.975² ≈ (20 - 0.025)^2 ≈ 400 - 2*20*0.025 + 0.025² ≈ 400 - 1 + 0.000625 ≈ 399.000625

Thus, E1 = sqrt(399.000625 + 39204) = sqrt(39603.000625) ≈ 199.00500156 GeV.

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.00500156 - 198 = 1.00500156 GeV ≈ 1.005 GeV.

Thus, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But perhaps we can compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, let's solve the equation exactly. The key equation was:

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300

Let me attempt to solve this equation algebraically.

Let’s denote y = x².

Then,

sqrt(y + 198²) + sqrt(y + 99²) = 300

Let’s set A = sqrt(y + 198²), B = sqrt(y + 99²)

Then, A + B = 300

And A² - B² = (y + 198²) - (y + 99²) = 198² - 99² = 29403

Thus, (A - B)(A + B) = 29403

But A + B = 300, so (A - B) = 29403 / 300 = 98.01

Therefore, we have:

A + B = 300

A - B = 98.01

Adding these two equations:

2A = 398.01 ⇒ A = 199.005

Then, B = 300 - A = 100.995

Now, A = sqrt(y + 198²) = 199.005

Square both sides:

y + 198² = (199.005)²

Compute (199.005)^2:

= (200 - 0.995)^2

= 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995²

= 40000 - 398 + 0.990025

= 39602.990025

Therefore,

y = 39602.990025 - 198²

But 198² = 39204

Thus,

y = 39602.990025 - 39204 = 398.990025

Therefore, x = sqrt(y) ≈ sqrt(398.990025) ≈ 19.97474 GeV/c

Thus, exact value of x is approximately 19.97474 GeV/c.

Now, compute E1 = sqrt(x² + m1²) = sqrt(398.990025 + 198²) = sqrt(398.990025 + 39204) = sqrt(39602.990025) = 199.005 GeV.

Thus, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

In classical calculation, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = (19.97474)^2/(2*198) ≈ (398.99)/(396) ≈ 1.00756 GeV.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the classical case, we found p ≈ 19.9 GeV/c, but in reality, if we use the relativistic momentum p ≈19.97474 GeV/c, but in the classical calculation, the momentum would be different? Wait, no.

Wait, in the classical calculation, we derived p based on classical KE equations. Let's recap.

In the classical approach, we have:

T1 + T2 = 3 GeV,

T1 = p²/(2m1),

T2 = p²/(2m2),

Therefore,

p²/(2m1) + p²/(2m2) = 3

Factor out p²/2:

p²/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2) = 3

Which leads to p² = (3 * 2)/( (1/m1 + 1/m2) )

So,

p² = 6 / ( (1/198 + 1/99) )

Compute 1/198 + 1/99 = 3/198 = 1/66

Thus,

p² = 6 / (1/66) = 6 * 66 = 396

Therefore, p = sqrt(396) ≈ 19.8997 GeV/c

Hence, T1_classical = p²/(2m1) = 396/(2*198) = 396/396 = 1 GeV

But in reality, the relativistic momentum is approximately 19.9747 GeV/c, which is higher. However, in the classical calculation, we use p ≈19.8997 GeV/c. So, the classical T1 is exactly 1 GeV, while the relativistic T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the momentum is higher, but the kinetic energy is also calculated differently. However, in the classical case, even with different momentum, the KE is calculated as p²/(2m). Therefore, the discrepancy arises because in reality, the momentum is determined relativistically, leading to a slightly higher KE when calculated relativistically.

But perhaps the confusion arises from whether, in the classical approximation, we use the same momentum as in the relativistic case. However, in reality, in the classical scenario, the momentum would differ because the velocities are calculated without relativistic effects. However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 0.99M, so even in the classical case, the rest masses are as given (198 and 99 GeV/c²), and the kinetic energy comes from the 1% mass deficit. But in reality, in classical physics, KE is separate from mass, so this is a bit inconsistent. However, the problem likely wants us to assume that in the classical calculation, the rest masses are still 198 and 99, and the KE is computed via classical mechanics, leading to a different value for T1.

Thus, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But let's check the exact calculation.

Relativistic T1 is exactly (gamma1 - 1)m1.

Given gamma1 = E1/m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005076.

Thus, T1 = (1.005076 - 1)*198 ≈ 0.005076*198 ≈ 1.005 GeV.

Classical T1 is 1 GeV.

Thus, difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let's verify if the exact calculation gives a more precise difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation can be done algebraically.

From the relativistic equations, we have:

T1 = E1 - m1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1

In natural units where c=1.

Similarly, classical T1 = p²/(2m1)

Thus, the difference is:

sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)

Let’s compute this.

Let’s denote p = 19.97474 GeV/c, m1 = 198 GeV/c².

Compute sqrt(p² + m1²) - m1 - p²/(2m1)

First, compute sqrt(19.97474² + 198²) - 198 - (19.97474²)/(2*198)

From earlier, sqrt(19.97474² + 198²) = 199.005 GeV

Thus, 199.005 - 198 - (398.99)/(396)

= 1.005 - (1.00756)

= -0.00256 GeV

Wait, that can't be. Wait, the difference is T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 - 1.00756 ≈ -0.00256 GeV. But that contradicts previous conclusion.

Wait, there's a mistake here. Wait, in reality, in the classical case, the momentum is different. Wait, in the relativistic case, p ≈19.9747 GeV/c, but in the classical case, p is sqrt(396) ≈19.8997 GeV/c. Therefore, we cannot use the same p for both calculations. Therefore, we must compute T1_classical using the classical momentum, and T1_relativistic using the relativistic momentum.

But this complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking: given the same physical scenario (i.e., same rest masses and total kinetic energy), compute T1 using relativistic equations and using classical equations, then find the difference.

But in reality, the classical scenario would not have the same total kinetic energy, because in reality, the KE comes from the mass deficit. However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M, so regardless of the approach, the KE is 3 GeV. Therefore, in both cases, the total KE is 3 GeV, but the distribution between the fragments differs based on relativistic vs classical mechanics.

Thus, in the relativistic case, as computed, T1 ≈1.005 GeV, T2≈1.995 GeV.

In the classical case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.

Thus, the difference is 1.005 -1=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV, which in boxed form is \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in GeV, it would be \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}. But given the scale, MeV is more appropriate.

But let's verify once more.

The exact relativistic T1 is:

From E1 = sqrt(p² + m1²) = 199.005 GeV.

Thus, T1_rel = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

T1_classical = 1 GeV.

Difference: 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}
