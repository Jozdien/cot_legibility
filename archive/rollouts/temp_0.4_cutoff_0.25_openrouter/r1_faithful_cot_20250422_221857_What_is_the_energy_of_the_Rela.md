To find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X (Lithium-6) is 0.96c, we need to calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

1. **Determine the rest mass energy of Lithium-6**:
   - The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.015122794 atomic mass units (u).
   - Converting this to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     E_{\text{rest}} = 6.015122794 \times 931.49410242 \approx 5603.0514 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**:
   - Given \(v = 0.96c\), the Lorentz factor is:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714285714
     \]

3. **Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy**:
   - The kinetic energy \(K\) is given by:
     \[
     K = (\gamma - 1) \times E_{\text{rest}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     K = (3.5714285714 - 1) \times 5603.0514 \approx 2.5714285714 \times 5603.0514
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     K \approx 14,407.8465 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

Thus, the energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is \(\boxed{14407.8465}\) MeV.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X, which is Lithium with 3 neutrons, is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, let's start by recalling some physics concepts here. 

First, I know that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just the classical ½mv² anymore. Instead, I have to use the relativistic equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times its rest mass energy, right? So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). Then the kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy. 

But wait, the problem mentions the energy of the RHIC. I think in particle accelerators, the energy is usually given per particle, and sometimes they specify it as kinetic energy or total energy. The question says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they are referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus? Or perhaps the total energy? Hmm. The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but since they mention speed, which relates to gamma, maybe I need to calculate the kinetic energy required to accelerate the Lithium nucleus to 0.96c. 

But first, let's figure out the rest mass of the nucleus X. The nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, standard Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means 3 protons. If it's Lithium with 3 neutrons, that would be Lithium-6, since normally Lithium has 3 protons and varying neutrons. The most common isotope is Lithium-7 with 4 neutrons. So Lithium-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus X is ^6Li. 

So the rest mass of ^6Li. The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but actually, the atomic mass of ^6Li is more accurate to use. Let me check. The exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that, 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ 6.015 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate that. 

6 * 931.5 = 5589, and 0.015 * 931.5 ≈ 13.9725. So total is approximately 5589 + 13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of ^6Li is approximately 5603 MeV. But maybe I should check the exact value. Wait, maybe I should use the exact mass from a table. Let me recall: the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 atomic mass units. Using 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So multiplying 6.015122794 * 931.49410242. 

Let me compute that:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

Then 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.015122794 * 900 = 13.6105146, and 0.015122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ ~0.476. So total is approximately 13.6105146 + 0.476 ≈ 14.0865. 

So total mass energy is approximately 5,588.9646 + 14.0865 ≈ 5,603.0511 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.05 MeV/c². Let's note that as the rest mass energy, E_rest = 5603.05 MeV.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute that. 

First, (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. Let me check that. 

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784/10000) = 28/100 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. So gamma ≈ 3.5714. 

Therefore, the total energy E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 * 5603.05 MeV. Let's compute that. 

First, 3 * 5603.05 = 16,809.15

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ 0.07 * 5603.05 = 392.2135 and 0.0014 * 5603.05 ≈ 7.844. So total ≈ 392.2135 + 7.844 ≈ 400.0575. 

So total E_total ≈ 16,809.15 + 2,801.525 + 400.0575 ≈ 16,809.15 + 3,201.5825 ≈ 20,010.7325 MeV. 

But wait, maybe I should do a more accurate multiplication. Let's compute 3.5714 * 5603.05. 

3.5714 * 5603.05:

First, 3 * 5603.05 = 16,809.15

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05:

Let's compute 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135

5603.05 * 0.0014 = 7.84427

So total 0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ 392.2135 + 7.84427 ≈ 400.05777

Adding up: 16,809.15 + 2,801.525 = 19,610.675 + 400.05777 ≈ 20,010.73277 MeV. 

So approximately 20,010.73 MeV total energy. Then the kinetic energy is E_total - E_rest = 20,010.73 - 5,603.05 = 14,407.68 MeV. 

But wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC". In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, sometimes they refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, or the total energy per nucleus, or maybe per nucleon. Wait, but RHIC collides heavy ions, so perhaps the energy is given per nucleus. But the problem just says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they want the kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

Alternatively, sometimes the energy is quoted as the total energy per nucleon. Let me think. For example, if the nucleus has A nucleons, then sometimes the energy is given as (total energy)/A. But the problem statement isn't specific. Hmm. Let me check the PS: the precision is 1e-4. So the answer should be given with four decimal places. 

But first, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy of the nucleus. So, in that case, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) * m * c². Which is what I calculated as 14,407.68 MeV. But let's verify. 

Alternatively, if the energy is given as the total energy, then it would be gamma * m * c², which is 20,010.73 MeV. But the problem says "the energy of RHIC", so perhaps they refer to the kinetic energy. Because in accelerator physics, the kinetic energy is often what's used. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy is given per nucleon. Since Lithium-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons), then the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.68 / 6 ≈ 2,401.28 MeV. But again, the problem doesn't specify. 

Wait, the question is "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So the collider's energy would refer to the kinetic energy per nucleus, because that's what's needed to accelerate it to that speed. So I think the answer is the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is (gamma - 1) * m * c². 

So in this case, that would be 14,407.68 MeV. But let's check the calculation again. 

Wait, gamma is 3.5714286. So gamma - 1 = 2.5714286. Then multiply by the rest mass energy 5,603.05 MeV. 

So 2.5714286 * 5,603.05. Let's compute that:

First, 2 * 5,603.05 = 11,206.1

0.5 * 5,603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714286 * 5,603.05 ≈ 5,603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135, and 5,603.05 * 0.0014286 ≈ approximately 8.007

So total 392.2135 + 8.007 ≈ 400.2205

Adding up: 11,206.1 + 2,801.525 = 14,007.625 + 400.2205 ≈ 14,407.8455 MeV. 

So approximately 14,407.8455 MeV. Rounding to four decimal places, that would be 14,407.8455 MeV. But wait, the rest mass we calculated was approximately 5,603.05 MeV. Let's check if that's accurate. 

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Let's compute that more precisely. 

1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So 6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = ?

First, let's compute 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

Then 0.015122794 * 931.49410242:

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242:

First, 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122794 * 900 = 0.1105146 + 0.000122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ 0.003865 ≈ 0.1143796

So total 4.6574705121 + 0.1143796 ≈ 4.77185

So total 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77185 ≈ 14.08679

Therefore, total rest mass energy is 5,588.96461452 + 14.08679 ≈ 5,603.0514 MeV/c². So E_rest = 5,603.0514 MeV.

Then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So gamma ≈ 3.5714285714

Then kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * E_rest = (3.5714285714 - 1) * 5,603.0514 MeV = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514 MeV

Let's compute 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514

First, note that 2.5714285714 is equal to 18/7. Because 2.5714285714 = 2 + 4/7 ≈ 2.571428...

Yes, 18/7 ≈ 2.5714285714. So 18/7 * 5,603.0514

Compute 5,603.0514 * 18 / 7

First, compute 5,603.0514 * 18:

5,603.0514 * 10 = 56,030.514

5,603.0514 * 8 = 44,824.4112

Total 56,030.514 + 44,824.4112 = 100,854.9252

Then divide by 7: 100,854.9252 / 7 ≈ 14,407.846457 MeV

So approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8465 MeV. But the problem says the precision is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, so four decimal places. 

But wait, the units. The question says "the energy of RHIC". Typically, RHIC energy is given in GeV per nucleon. Wait, but maybe not. Let me check. 

Wait, RHIC accelerates ions to certain energies, and the energy is often given as the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. For example, if it's 100 GeV per nucleon for a gold nucleus with 197 nucleons, the total energy would be 197 * 100 GeV. But in this case, the problem might be asking for the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says "the energy of the RHIC", but since RHIC is a collider, it's possible that they are referring to the kinetic energy per nucleus. Alternatively, if the energy is given per nucleon, we need to divide by the number of nucleons. 

But the nucleus here is Lithium-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if the kinetic energy per nucleon is (14,407.8465 MeV) / 6 ≈ 2,401.30775 MeV per nucleon, which is 2.40130775 GeV per nucleon. 

But the problem says "the energy of RHIC". I need to check standard conventions. 

Looking it up, RHIC typically operates at 100 GeV per nucleon for heavy ions like gold. But in this problem, since it's a specific nucleus, maybe the answer expects the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. However, given that the rest mass energy is around 5,603 MeV (5.6 GeV) and the kinetic energy we calculated is about 14,407 MeV (14.4 GeV), which is plausible. 

But to confirm, let's think: in accelerator physics, the "energy" of the collider is usually the kinetic energy per particle. For example, the LHC at 13 TeV is the kinetic energy per proton. Wait, no, actually, the LHC's energy is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but for protons, the rest mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy at those speeds. However, for heavy ions, the rest mass is significant. 

Wait, but in the case of RHIC, when they say they collide gold ions at 100 GeV per nucleon, that's the kinetic energy per nucleon. So if we have 6 nucleons, each with 100 GeV kinetic energy, the total kinetic energy of the nucleus would be 600 GeV. But that's way higher than our calculation here. Wait, but 100 GeV per nucleon is extremely high. Our calculation here is about 2.4 GeV per nucleon. 

But perhaps the question is not referring to per nucleon. Let's check the problem statement again: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". Since speed is a property of the entire nucleus, not per nucleon, the energy required would be the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Therefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which we calculated as approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Converting that to GeV, it's 14.4078465 GeV. 

But the problem doesn't specify units, but since the rest mass was in MeV, probably the answer should be in MeV. Also, the precision is 1e-4, which would be 0.0001, so four decimal places. 

But let me check the calculation once more for accuracy. 

Given:

v = 0.96c

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714

Rest mass energy E_rest = 5,603.0514 MeV

Kinetic energy E_k = (gamma - 1) * E_rest = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514 MeV

As we calculated, this is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

To ensure precision to 1e-4, we need to calculate this product more accurately. Let's use more precise values. 

First, let's compute 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514

Breakdown:

5,603.0514 * 2 = 11,206.1028

5,603.0514 * 0.5 = 2,801.5257

5,603.0514 * 0.0714285714 = ?

0.0714285714 is 1/14. So 5,603.0514 / 14 = 400.21795714

So adding them up:

11,206.1028 + 2,801.5257 = 14,007.6285 + 400.21795714 = 14,407.84645714 MeV

So indeed, 14,407.8465 MeV when rounded to four decimal places. So the answer is 14407.8465 MeV. 

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like Joules? Unlikely, since in particle physics energies are usually in eV units. The question mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which probably refers to the decimal places in MeV. So 14,407.8465 MeV can be written as 14407.8465 MeV, which has four decimal places. 

Alternatively, maybe the rest mass was supposed to be calculated more approximately. Let me check if the mass of ^6Li is indeed approximately 6.015 u. Yes, according to data, the isotopic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. So the calculation seems correct. 

Another point: sometimes, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But in our calculation, we used the atomic mass of ^6Li, which already accounts for the binding energy. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the kinetic energy required is approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". In reality, RHIC is a collider, so it has two beams going in opposite directions. The energy per beam would be half of the collision energy. But the problem doesn't mention collision energy or anything like that; it just asks for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So likely, they just want the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which we've calculated. 

Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14407.8465 MeV. But maybe we need to present it as 1.44078465 × 10^4 MeV, but the question says precision is 1e-4, which is four decimal places, so 14407.8465 MeV. 

But let me check if the question wants the answer in a different unit, like TeV or GeV. 14,407.8465 MeV is 14.4078465 GeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which for GeV would be 14.4078 GeV. But the rest mass was in MeV, so probably the answer should be in MeV. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the total energy (gamma * m c²) instead of the kinetic energy. Let's check what happens if we compute that. 

E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714285714 * 5,603.0514 MeV ≈ 20,010.7302 MeV. 

But if the question is ambiguous, but given that they mentioned speed, which relates to gamma, but the standard formula for kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m c². However, in some contexts, especially in engineering or colloquial terms, "energy" might refer to the total energy. But in physics, when talking about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy, because the rest mass energy is inherent to the particle and not provided by the collider. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is the kinetic energy, 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But to be absolutely sure, let's see: if the problem had said "total energy", we would use gamma * m c², but since it says "energy of RHIC", which is the energy imparted to the particle, that's the kinetic energy. 

Yes, the rest mass energy is the energy the particle has even when at rest, so the collider's energy would refer to the kinetic energy. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Converting that to the required precision of 1e-4 (four decimal places), we write 14407.8465 MeV. 

But let's check the calculation once more for any possible error. 

Rest mass of ^6Li: 6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242. As calculated earlier, this is approximately 5,603.0514 MeV. 

Gamma at 0.96c: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 3.5714285714. 

Kinetic energy: (3.5714285714 - 1) * 5,603.0514 = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514 = 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Yes, this seems correct. 

Therefore, the energy of RHIC required is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in GeV? 14,407.8465 MeV = 14.4078465 GeV. If we write this with four decimal places, it's 14.4078 GeV. But the problem didn't specify units, but since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, and the precision is 1e-4, which for MeV would be 0.0001 MeV, which is 100 eV, but that seems too precise. Alternatively, maybe the unit is in atomic units, but no. 

Wait, actually, 1e-4 precision in the energy. If the energy is in MeV, then 1e-4 MeV is 100 eV. But the rest mass is ~5,603 MeV, so 1e-4 of that would be 0.5603 MeV, which is 560.3 keV. But the calculation we did for kinetic energy is 14,407.8465 MeV, which to a precision of 1e-4 would mean 14,407.8465 MeV ± 1.4408 MeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which likely refers to the relative precision, not the absolute. So 1e-4 relative precision is 0.01%. So the answer should be given to four decimal places if the value is in the order of 10^4 MeV (14,407.8465), so four decimal places here would be tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and ten-thousandths of a MeV. So 14,407.8465 MeV is already to four decimal places. 

But 14,407.8465 MeV is 1.44078465 × 10^4 MeV. If we write it as 14407.8465 MeV, that's correct. 

Alternatively, sometimes in such contexts, the energy is given per nucleon. Let's check what that would be. 

Lithium-6 has 6 nucleons. So kinetic energy per nucleon is 14,407.8465 / 6 ≈ 2,401.30775 MeV. But again, the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so unless specified, it's safer to give the total kinetic energy. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But just to cross-verify, let's calculate using another approach. 

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

K = (γ - 1)mc²

We have γ = 3.5714285714, m = 6.015122794 u, c² is in the units. 

Alternatively, using m in kg and c in m/s:

But that would complicate things, and since we already converted the mass to MeV/c², it's easier to stick with MeV. 

Alternatively, let's compute the velocity in terms of beta (β = v/c = 0.96), then compute gamma, then K. Which is what we did. 

Yes, all steps seem correct. 

Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But wait, the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So we need to present the answer with four decimal places. 14,407.8465 is already four decimal places. However, looking at the calculation steps, we had:

Gamma: 3.5714285714

E_rest: 5,603.0514 MeV

K = (gamma - 1) * E_rest = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514 = 14,407.84645714 MeV

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Alternatively, if the problem requires the answer in a different format, such as scientific notation with four decimal places, it would be 1.4408 x 10^4 MeV. But as per the problem's PS, it's better to present it as 14407.8465 MeV. 

However, considering that the rest mass was calculated to seven significant figures (5,603.0514 MeV), and gamma was calculated to about 10 significant figures (3.571428571), the multiplication would give us a result with significant figures limited by the least precise value, which is the rest mass (seven significant figures). But 5,603.0514 is 8 significant figures. Gamma is 3.571428571 (10 sig figs). So multiplying gives 10 significant figures, but the problem says precision of 1e-4, which is four decimal places. 

Therefore, regardless of significant figures, we need to present four decimal places. So 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But to check, let's compute the exact value using more precise numbers. 

Rest mass: 6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u = 

Let's compute this exactly:

6.015122794 * 931.49410242

Break it down:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

0.015122794 * 931.49410242

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242:

0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122794 * 931,494,102.42 (if we convert to eV?) Wait, no. 

Wait, 0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122794 * 900 ≈ 0.1105146 + 0.000122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ 0.003865 ≈ 0.1143796

So total 4.6574705121 + 0.1143796 ≈ 4.7718501121

Thus, 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.7718501121 ≈ 14.0867911363

Therefore, total rest mass energy is 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867911363 ≈ 5,603.05140566 MeV

So E_rest = 5,603.05140566 MeV

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428571428571...

So gamma = 3.571428571428571...

Then kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) * E_rest = 2.571428571428571... * 5,603.05140566

Let's compute this multiplication with high precision:

2.571428571428571 * 5,603.05140566

First, note that 2.571428571428571 is 18/7. So 18/7 * 5,603.05140566

Compute 5,603.05140566 * 18 = 100,854.92530188

Then divide by 7: 100,854.92530188 / 7 = 14,407.846471697 MeV

So K = 14,407.846471697 MeV

Rounded to four decimal places, this is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Therefore, the precise answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Hence, the energy of RHIC required to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

**Final Answer**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14407.8465} MeV.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X, which is Lithium with 3 neutrons, is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, let's start by recalling some physics concepts here. 

First, I know that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just the classical ½mv² anymore. Instead, I have to use the relativistic equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times its rest mass energy, right? So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). Then the kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy. 

But wait, the problem mentions the energy of the RHIC. I think in particle accelerators, the energy is usually given per particle, and sometimes they specify it as kinetic energy or total energy. The question says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they are referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus? Or perhaps the total energy? Hmm. The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but since they mention speed, which relates to gamma, maybe I need to calculate the kinetic energy required to accelerate the Lithium nucleus to 0.96c. 

But first, let's figure out the rest mass of the nucleus X. The nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, standard Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means 3 protons. If it's Lithium with 3 neutrons, that would be Lithium-6, since normally Lithium has 3 protons and varying neutrons. The most common isotope is Lithium-7 with 4 neutrons. So Lithium-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus X is ^6Li. 

So the rest mass of ^6Li. The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but actually, the atomic mass of ^6Li is more accurate to use. Let me check. The exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that, 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ 6.015 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate that. 

6 * 931.5 = 5589, and 0.015 * 931.5 ≈ 13.9725. So total is approximately 5589 + 13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of ^6Li is approximately 5603 MeV. But maybe I should check the exact value. Wait, maybe I should use the exact mass from a table. Let me recall: the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 atomic mass units. Using 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So multiplying 6.015122794 * 931.49410242. 

Let me compute that:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

Then 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.015122794 * 900 = 13.6105146, and 0.015122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ ~0.476. So total is approximately 13.6105146 + 0.476 ≈ 14.0865. 

So total mass energy is approximately 5,588.9646 + 14.0865 ≈ 5,603.0511 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.05 MeV/c². Let's note that as the rest mass energy, E_rest = 5603.05 MeV.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute that. 

First, (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. Let me check that. 

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784/10000) = 28/100 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. So gamma ≈ 3.5714. 

Therefore, the total energy E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 * 5603.05 MeV. Let's compute that. 

First, 3 * 5603.05 = 16,809.15

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ 0.07 * 5603.05 = 392.2135 and 0.0014 * 5603.05 ≈ 7.844. So total ≈ 392.2135 + 7.844 ≈ 400.0575. 

So total E_total ≈ 16,809.15 + 2,801.525 + 400.0575 ≈ 16,809.15 + 3,201.5825 ≈ 20,010.7325 MeV. 

But wait, maybe I should do a more accurate multiplication. Let's compute 3.5714 * 5603.05. 

3.5714 * 5603.05:

First, 3 * 5603.05 = 16,809.15

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05:

Let's compute 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135

5603.05 * 0.0014 = 7.84427

So total 0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ 392.2135 + 7.84427 ≈ 400.05777

Adding up: 16,809.15 + 2,801.525 = 19,610.675 + 400.05777 ≈ 20,010.73277 MeV. 

So approximately 20,010.73 MeV total energy. Then the kinetic energy is E_total - E_rest = 20,010.73 - 5,603.05 = 14,407.68 MeV. 

But wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC". In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, sometimes they refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, or the total energy per nucleus, or maybe per nucleon. Wait, but RHIC collides heavy ions, so perhaps the energy is given per nucleus. But the problem just says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they want the kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

Alternatively, sometimes the energy is quoted as the total energy per nucleon. Let me think. For example, if the nucleus has A nucleons, then sometimes the energy is given as (total energy)/A. But the problem statement isn't specific. Hmm. Let me check the PS: the precision is 1e-4. So the answer should be given with four decimal places. 

But first, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy of the nucleus. So, in that case, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) * m * c². Which is what I calculated as 14,407.68 MeV. But let's verify. 

Alternatively, if the energy is given as the total energy, then it would be gamma * m * c², which is 20,010.73 MeV. But the problem says "the energy of RHIC", so per

I need to determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that would accelerate a Lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons to 0.96 times the speed of light. This requires applying relativistic physics principles rather than classical mechanics.

In relativistic physics, the total energy equals the Lorentz factor (gamma) multiplied by the rest mass energy. The Lorentz factor is defined as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). The kinetic energy is then calculated as the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

First, I need to identify the nucleus X. Lithium has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons), and with 3 neutrons, this would be Lithium-6 (^6Li).

To calculate the rest mass energy of ^6Li, I'll use its atomic mass of 6.015122794 atomic mass units (u), with 1 u equaling 931.49410242 MeV/c². Multiplying these values:
6 × 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452 MeV/c²
0.015122794 × 931.49410242 ≈ 14.0865 MeV/c²
Adding these: 5,588.9646 + 14.0865 ≈ 5,603.0511 MeV/c²

So the rest mass energy (E_rest) is approximately 5603.05 MeV.

Next, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor for v = 0.96c:
γ = 1/√(1-(0.96)²)
(0.96)² = 0.9216
1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
√0.0784 = 0.28
γ = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714

Now I can calculate the total energy:
E_total = γ × E_rest = 3.5714 × 5603.05 MeV

Computing this multiplication:
3 × 5603.05 = 16,809.15 MeV
0.5 × 5603.05 = 2,801.525 MeV
0.0714 × 5603.05 ≈ 400.05777 MeV
Total: 16,809.15 + 2,801.525 + 400.05777 ≈ 20,010.73277 MeV

Therefore, the total energy is approximately 20,010.73 MeV.

The kinetic energy would be:
E_kinetic = E_total - E_rest = 20,010.73 - 5,603.05 = 14,407.68 MeV

Since the problem asks for "the energy of RHIC," this could refer to either the kinetic energy of the nucleus (14,407.68 MeV) or its total energy (20,010.73 MeV), with the answer needing four decimal places of precision.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) necessary for a nucleus of Lithium-6, which includes 3 protons and 3 neutrons, to travel at 0.96 times the speed of light. Let me start by considering some basic physics concepts.

At relativistic speeds, we can no longer use the classical kinetic energy formula, which is ½mv². Instead, we must employ relativistic equations. A particle's total energy is equal to its rest mass energy times the Lorentz factor, gamma. Gamma is defined as 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). The kinetic energy is then the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

The task refers to the "energy of RHIC." In particle accelerators, energy is often specified per particle and might mean either kinetic or total energy. Given the mention of speed and consequently gamma, I probably need to calculate the kinetic energy required to accelerate the nucleus of Lithium to 0.96c.

Let's begin by finding the rest mass of nucleus X, which is Lithium-6 (^6Li), composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is around 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is approximately 939.565 MeV/c². For accuracy, I'll note that the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015 atomic mass units (u), with 1 u equivalent to about 931.5 MeV/c². Thus, converting this gives 6.015 * 931.5 ≈ 5603 MeV/c² for its rest mass energy.

Given a speed of 0.96c for the nucleus, gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus (0.96)²). Calculating further, (0.96)² is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 equals 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, thus gamma equals 1/0.28, approximately 3.5714.

So, the total energy E_total is the product of gamma and the rest mass energy: 3.5714 * 5603 MeV. After performing the calculations, E_total is approximately 20,010.73 MeV. The kinetic energy is E_total minus the rest mass energy: 20,010.73 MeV - 5603 MeV, equaling about 14,407.68 MeV.

Considering the phrasing "the energy of RHIC," the question likely refers to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Depending on conventions in particle physics, energy could also be stated per nucleon, but without explicit instructions, it seems this is asking for the kinetic energy. Using four decimal places as required by the problem, the precision checks out.

The energy is typically given as the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, no. Wait, actually, for heavy ions, the energy is often given as the total kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC can collide gold nuclei at 100 GeV per nucleon. So if that\'s the case, then perhaps here we need to compute the kinetic energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number of nucleons. \n\nWait, but the nucleus here is Lithium-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if we compute the kinetic energy per nucleon, then multiply by 6. But let\'s see. Let me check how RHIC\'s energy is usually specified. \n\nLooking it up in my mind, RHIC operates with different energies for different ions. For example, for gold ions, it\'s 100 GeV per nucleon. So each gold nucleus (A=197) has a kinetic energy of 100 GeV/nucleon * 197 nucleons = 19.7 TeV. But wait, actually, no. Wait, the per nucleon energy is the same, so each nucleon has 100 GeV of energy? Wait, no, that\'s not how it works. Kinetic energy is a property of the entire nucleus. But when they say 100 GeV per nucleon, they mean that if you take the total kinetic energy of the nucleus and divide by the number of nucleons, you get 100 GeV. So for a gold nucleus with A=197, the total kinetic energy would be 100 GeV * 197 = 19.7 TeV. \n\nBut in this problem, we have a Lithium-6 nucleus. So if we calculate the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is (gamma - 1) * m * c², then if we divide by 6, we get the kinetic energy per nucleon. However, the problem says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they just want the kinetic energy of the nucleus. But the problem is not very clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, since it\'s asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, it\'s referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. So I should compute (gamma - 1) * m * c², which is the kinetic energy. \n\nBut let\'s confirm the calculation. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. \n\nSo gamma ≈ 3.5714286. Then, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c². So (3.5714286 - 1) * 5603.05 MeV ≈ 2.5714286 * 5603.05. Let\'s compute that. \n\n2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1\n\n0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525\n\n0.0714286 * 5603.05 ≈ 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135\n\n5603.05 * 0.0014286 ≈ 8.0 (approx)\n\nSo total ≈ 392.2135 + 8.0 ≈ 400.2135\n\nAdding up: 11,206.1 + 2,801.525 = 14,007.625 + 400.2135 ≈ 14,407.8385 MeV. So approximately 14,407.84 MeV. \n\nBut earlier, when I computed E_total - E_rest, I got 14,407.68 MeV. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps. To get a more precise value, let\'s do a more accurate calculation. \n\nFirst, exact gamma:\n\nv = 0.96c\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428571428571\n\nSo gamma ≈ 3.571428571428571\n\nNow, compute (gamma - 1) * m * c²:\n\ngamma - 1 = 2.571428571428571\n\nMultiply by 5603.05 MeV:\n\nLet\'s compute 2.571428571428571 * 5603.05\n\nFirst, note that 2.571428571 is approximately 2 + 0.5 + 0.071428571\n\nSo 2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1\n\n0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525\n\n0.071428571 * 5603.05\n\nCompute 5603.05 * 0.071428571:\n\nFirst, 5603.05 / 14 ≈ 400.217857 because 1/14 ≈ 0.071428571\n\nSo 5603.05 * 0.071428571 ≈ 5603.05 / 14 ≈ 400.217857\n\nTherefore, adding all parts:\n\n11,206.1 + 2,801.525 = 14,007.625\n\n14,007.625 + 400.217857 ≈ 14,407.842857 MeV\n\nSo approximately 14,407.842857 MeV. Rounding to four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.8429 MeV. \n\nBut let\'s check if the rest mass was calculated correctly. Wait, the rest mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = ?\n\nFirst, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452\n\n0.015122794 * 931.49410242\n\nCompute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005122794 * 931.49410242\n\nFirst, 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122794 * 900 = 0.1105146; 0.000122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ 0.0038655\n\nSo total ≈ 0.1105146 + 0.0038655 ≈ 0.1143801\n\nSo 0.005122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.1143801 ≈ 4.7718506\n\nThus, total 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.7718506 ≈ 14.08679162\n\nAdding to the 6 u part: 5,588.96461452 + 14.08679162 ≈ 5,603.05140614 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is approximately 5,603.0514 MeV. \n\nSo then, (gamma - 1) * m * c² = 2.571428571428571 * 5,603.0514 MeV\n\nLet\'s compute this precisely:\n\n2.571428571428571 * 5,603.0514\n\nBreak it down:\n\n2 * 5,603.0514 = 11,206.1028\n\n0.5 * 5,603.0514 = 2,801.5257\n\n0.071428571428571 * 5,603.0514\n\nAs before, 5,603.0514 * 0.071428571428571 ≈ 5,603.0514 / 14 ≈ 400.21795714\n\nSo adding all three parts:\n\n11,206.1028 + 2,801.5257 = 14,007.6285\n\n14,007.6285 + 400.21795714 ≈ 14,407.846457 MeV\n\nSo approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounding to four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut let\'s check using another method. Let\'s use the exact formula:\n\nKinetic energy = (gamma - 1) * m * c²\n\nWhere gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714\n\nSo gamma - 1 = 2.5714285714\n\nMultiply by m*c² = 5,603.0514 MeV:\n\n2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514\n\nLet me compute this multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, 2 * 5,603.0514 = 11,206.1028\n\n0.5 * 5,603.0514 = 2,801.5257\n\n0.0714285714 * 5,603.0514\n\nCompute 5,603.0514 * 0.0714285714:\n\nWe can note that 0.0714285714 is approximately 1/14, so 5,603.0514 / 14 = 400.21795714\n\nSo adding all parts:\n\n11,206.1028 + 2,801.5257 = 14,007.6285\n\n14,007.6285 + 400.21795714 = 14,407.84645714 MeV\n\nSo approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Therefore, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", and given that RHIC\'s energy is typically given per nucleon, maybe we need to divide by the number of nucleons to get the kinetic energy per nucleon, then present that. \n\nWait, the nucleus is Lithium-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if the total kinetic energy is ~14,407.85 MeV, then the kinetic energy per nucleon is 14,407.85 / 6 ≈ 2,401.3075 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. \n\nBut the problem says "the energy of RHIC", and in the case of RHIC, they often specify the energy as the collision energy per nucleon pair. For example, if two gold nuclei are colliding each with 100 GeV per nucleon, the total center-of-mass energy is higher. But here, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. \n\nWait, but in accelerators, the energy given to the ions is kinetic energy. So if the question is about the kinetic energy of the nucleus, then the answer is approximately 14,407.85 MeV, or 14.40785 GeV. But 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But that seems low for RHIC, which typically operates at much higher energies. For example, RHIC can go up to 100 GeV per nucleon for gold ions. \n\nWait, but perhaps because Lithium is lighter, the energy required to accelerate it to 0.96c is lower. Let\'s check with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the total energy, not the kinetic. Let\'s see. If the total energy is gamma*m*c², which we calculated as approximately 20,010.73 MeV or 20.01073 GeV. \n\nBut again, 20 GeV is still lower than typical RHIC energies, but maybe for Lithium it\'s okay. \n\nBut let\'s think again. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC". In accelerator physics, the "energy" of the collider is usually given as the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the charge state of the ion, but I might be mixing concepts here. \n\nAlternatively, the magnetic rigidity of the accelerator is related to the momentum of the particle. But the problem states speed, so maybe we need to calculate the kinetic energy required to reach that speed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the relativistic total energy, which is gamma*m*c². Let\'s check what happens if we consider that. \n\nTotal energy is gamma*m*c² = 3.5714 * 5,603.05 MeV ≈ 20,010.73 MeV ≈ 20.0107 GeV. \n\nBut again, depending on context, but given that the problem mentions "energy of RHIC", and since RHIC is a collider, it\'s possible that they are asking for the kinetic energy. However, given that the rest mass energy is about 5.6 GeV, and the kinetic energy is about 14.4 GeV, totaling to 20 GeV, which would be the total energy. \n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps we can look for similar problems. For example, in some textbooks, when asked about the energy required to accelerate a particle to a certain speed, they refer to the kinetic energy. So maybe the answer is the kinetic energy, 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut let\'s check with another approach. Let\'s compute the momentum and see what energy that corresponds to. \n\nThe momentum p of a relativistic particle is gamma * m * v. \n\nGiven that v = 0.96c, gamma = 3.5714285714, m = 5,603.05 MeV/c². \n\nSo p = gamma * m * v / c = gamma * m * 0.96. \n\nWait, in units where c=1, p = gamma * m * v. \n\nBut let\'s compute p in MeV/c units. \n\np = gamma * m * v / c = 3.5714285714 * 5,603.05 MeV/c² * 0.96c / c = 3.5714285714 * 5,603.05 * 0.96 MeV/c\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, 3.5714285714 * 0.96 = 3.4285714285\n\nThen multiply by 5,603.05 MeV/c:\n\n3.4285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 3 * 5,603.05 = 16,809.15\n\n0.4285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 0.4 * 5,603.05 = 2,241.22 plus 0.0285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 0.0285714285 * 5,600 ≈ 160, so total ≈ 2,241.22 + 160 = 2,401.22\n\nSo total p ≈ 16,809.15 + 2,401.22 ≈ 19,210.37 MeV/c\n\nBut in accelerator physics, the magnetic rigidity is related to the momentum, but unless they are asking for that, which they aren\'t, we can ignore that. \n\nAlternatively, the total energy squared is (pc)² + (mc²)². Let\'s check that. \n\nE_total² = (pc)² + (m c²)²\n\nSo E_total = sqrt( (19,210.37 MeV)^2 + (5,603.05 MeV)^2 )\n\nCompute that:\n\n(19,210.37)^2 ≈ (19,000)^2 = 361,000,000, plus 2*19,000*210.37 = 7,994, 060, plus (210.37)^2 ≈ 44,255. So total ≈ 361,000,000 + 7,994,060 + 44,255 ≈ 369,038,315 (MeV²)\n\n(5,603.05)^2 ≈ (5,600)^2 = 31,360,000, plus 2*5,600*3.05 = 34, 160, plus (3.05)^2 ≈ 9.3025. So total ≈ 31,360,000 + 34,160 + 9.3025 ≈ 31,394,169.3025 (MeV²)\n\nAdding both: 369,038,315 + 31,394,169.3025 ≈ 400,432,484.3 (MeV²)\n\nSquare root of 400,432,484.3 ≈ 20,010.81 MeV, which matches our earlier calculation of E_total ≈ 20,010.73 MeV. Close enough, considering rounding errors. \n\nSo that checks out. \n\nBut coming back to the original question: What is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c?\n\nGiven that RHIC\'s energy is the kinetic energy per nucleus, the answer would be approximately 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.40785 GeV.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check the units. The user hasn\'t specified units, but given that in particle physics, energies are often in GeV or MeV. The rest mass we calculated is ~5.6 GeV, so kinetic energy ~14.4 GeV. \n\nBut maybe the answer is expected in terms of total energy. However, given that the problem mentions "energy of RHIC", which is typically the kinetic energy. But to be thorough, perhaps we should present both and see which one makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified and assumes that the rest mass is just 6 atomic mass units, ignoring the actual mass defect. But since we calculated the rest mass as 6.015 u, which is more precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect a calculation using non-relativistic kinetic energy, but at 0.96c, that\'s definitely relativistic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the energy per nucleon. Since the nucleus has 6 nucleons, the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8465 / 6 ≈ 2,401.30775 MeV, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. \n\nBut again, the problem states "the energy of RHIC", so perhaps they want the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. \n\nAlternatively, if they are following the same convention as RHIC\'s operation, where energy is given per nucleon in GeV/u, then the answer would be approximately 2.4013 GeV/u. \n\nBut the problem statement is not clear. However, given that they specified the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons, which is 6 nucleons, and they ask for the energy of RHIC, which typically refers to the energy per nucleon, maybe the answer is 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. \n\nBut let\'s check with the initial calculation. The kinetic energy of the nucleus is (gamma - 1) * m * c² = ~14,407.85 MeV. If we divide by 6, we get ~2,401.3 MeV per nucleon, which is 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. \n\nBut RHIC\'s top energy is 100 GeV per nucleon for heavy ions like gold, so 2.4 GeV per nucleon seems low. However, for lighter ions, the required energy to reach a certain speed would be lower. Because kinetic energy depends on both velocity and mass. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy, which would be ~20 GeV. But without more context, it\'s hard to say. \n\nWait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In reality, the energy of the collider would refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, because different ions have different masses. So by specifying the kinetic energy per nucleon, you can have different ions reach different speeds. \n\nBut in this case, since the question is about a specific nucleus, maybe they just want the kinetic energy of that nucleus. However, given the lack of specificity in the question, both answers could be possible. \n\nBut given that the rest mass is 5,603.05 MeV and gamma is ~3.5714, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m*c² ≈ 14,407.85 MeV. If we convert that to Joules or another unit, but the problem doesn\'t specify, so likely in MeV or GeV. \n\nBut in high-energy physics, energies are usually given in GeV. So 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", so four decimal places. \n\nWait, 14,407.8465 MeV is 14.4078465 GeV, which to four decimal places is 14.4078 GeV. But wait, let\'s check:\n\n14,407.8465 MeV = 14.4078465 GeV\n\nRounded to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV (since the fifth decimal is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down). Wait, no: 14.4078465\n\nFirst decimal: 4\n\nSecond: 0\n\nThird: 7\n\nFourth: 8\n\nFifth: 4\n\nSo 14.4078|465 GeV, so the fourth decimal is 8, the next is 4, so it remains 14.4078 GeV. \n\nBut let me verify the exact value. \n\nWe had earlier:\n\nKinetic energy = 14,407.84645714 MeV = 14.40784645714 GeV\n\nSo to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV. \n\nBut wait, 14.40784645714\n\nThe fourth decimal is the fourth place after the decimal: 14.4078 (fourth is 8), the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays 14.4078. \n\nBut actually, let\'s count:\n\n14.40784645714\n\nPositions:\n\n1: 4\n\n2: 0\n\n3: 7\n\n4: 8\n\n5: 4\n\nSo yes, the fourth decimal is 8, and the fifth is 4, so it rounds to 14.4078. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in MeV with four decimal places. So 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So if the answer is about 14,407.8465 MeV, then 1e-4 precision would be ±0.0001, which is four decimal places. So 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem didn\'t specify units, but given the context, MeV or GeV. Probably in GeV, but given that the rest mass is ~5.6 GeV, the kinetic energy is ~14.4 GeV, so 14.4078 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, if they expect the answer in MeV, then 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the total energy instead. Let\'s check. If the total energy is 20,010.73 MeV, which is 20.01073 GeV, and to four decimal places, 20.0107 GeV. \n\nBut how to know which one is expected? The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", and since RHIC is a collider, the energy is typically defined by the kinetic energy. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reports the collision energy in TeV, which is the total energy, but for heavy ions, they often use per nucleon energy. \n\nBut given that this is a physics problem, and not an engineering question about RHIC\'s actual operation, it\'s more likely that they want the relativistic kinetic energy of the nucleus. So the answer is approximately 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, if they want the total energy, 20.0107 GeV. But given that the question is about speed, and kinetic energy is what relates to the work done to accelerate the particle to that speed, I think kinetic energy is the answer. \n\nWait, another way to think: energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy because that\'s what\'s imparted to the particles. Rest mass energy is inherent to the particle, so the collider\'s energy refers to the kinetic energy. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. \n\nBut let\'s check if there\'s another approach. For example, using the velocity and the relativistic equations for energy and momentum. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², and we have already computed that. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between beta and gamma. \n\nBut in any case, the calculation seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 14.4078 GeV, or 14,407.8 MeV. However, given the problem requires precision to 1e-4, the exact value is 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078465 GeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14.4078 GeV. But if we keep it in MeV, 14,407.8465 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So 1e-4 relative precision, or absolute? If relative, then 1e-4 of the value. But likely, it\'s four decimal places in the final answer. \n\nBut the problem didn\'t specify units. Since the rest mass was in MeV (from the calculation), it\'s likely expecting the answer in MeV. So 14,407.8465 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut let me check the calculation one more time for any possible error. \n\nRest mass of ^6Li: 6.015122794 u\n\n1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c²\n\nTherefore, rest mass energy: 6.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 5,603.051406 MeV/c². \n\nGamma for v = 0.96c: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714\n\nKinetic energy: (gamma - 1) * m c² = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.051406 ≈ 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nYes, this seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the energy of RHIC should be approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in GeV. So 14.4078 GeV. However, it\'s essential to present the answer as specified. Since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, and the problem didn\'t specify, but the PS mentions precision to 1e-4, which is four decimal places. If we write it in MeV, it\'s 14407.8465 MeV, which is 1.44078465 × 10^4 MeV. But to four decimal places, 14407.8465 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, converting to GeV: 14.4078465 GeV, which to four decimal places is 14.4078 GeV. \n\nBut since the rest mass energy is 5,603.05 MeV, which is a precise value, and the gamma is exact as 25/7 (since 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25, so gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714). Wait, 1/0.28 is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714. \n\nSo gamma is exactly 25/7. Therefore, gamma - 1 = 18/7. \n\nTherefore, kinetic energy is (18/7) * 5,603.051406 MeV. \n\nCompute 18/7 * 5,603.051406:\n\n18/7 = 2.5714285714\n\nSo 5,603.051406 * 18 / 7\n\nFirst compute 5,603.051406 * 18:\n\n5,603.051406 * 10 = 56,030.51406\n\n5,603.051406 * 8 = 44,824.411248\n\nTotal = 56,030.51406 + 44,824.411248 = 100,854.925308\n\nNow divide by 7:\n\n100,854.925308 / 7 ≈ 14,407.84647257 MeV\n\nSo exactly 14,407.84647257 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nTherefore, this is the precise calculation. So the answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of GeV with four decimal places, so 14.4078 GeV. However, given the initial rest mass was in MeV, and the precision required is 1e-4, which for MeV is four decimal places, but for GeV is four decimal places as well. \n\nBut since 14,407.8465 MeV is 14.4078465 GeV, both are acceptable, but since the question didn\'t specify, and in high-energy physics, energies are often in GeV, but sometimes in MeV for precision. Given that the value is around 14.4 GeV, writing it as 14.4078 GeV with four decimal places is appropriate. \n\nAlternatively, if writing in MeV with four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So if the energy is ~14,407.8 MeV, then 1e-4 of that is ~1.44078 MeV. So to have a precision of ±1.44078 MeV, but the question says the precision is at 1e-4, which is 0.0001 in absolute terms? Wait, maybe it\'s referring to the relative precision. 1e-4 is 0.01% precision. \n\nBut in terms of the answer, they probably want four decimal places in the appropriate unit. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that the rest mass was calculated to four decimal places in MeV (5,603.0514 MeV), and the kinetic energy is 14,407.8465 MeV, which also has four decimal places, I think the answer should be presented as 14,407.8465 MeV, or converting to GeV with the same precision, 14.4078 GeV. \n\nBut I need to check if the question specifies units. It doesn\'t, but given the context of RHIC, which typically uses GeV per nucleon, but since this is a specific nucleus, maybe MeV is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, since 14,407.8465 MeV is approximately 14.4078465 GeV, which is 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. \n\nHowever, considering that the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, so if the answer is in GeV, four decimal places, but if in MeV, also four decimal places. But since the calculation gives us 14,407.8465 MeV, which is already four decimal places in MeV (since the .8465 is after the decimal in MeV? Wait, no. Wait, 14,407.8465 MeV is written with four decimal places: 14407.8465. The decimal places are the digits after the decimal point. So 14,407.8465 has four decimal places. \n\nYes, so 14,407.8465 MeV is correct to four decimal places. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut let me just cross-verify once more. \n\nAlternatively, use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (gamma - 1) m c²\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714\n\nm c² = 5,603.051406 MeV\n\nK = (25/7 - 1) * 5,603.051406 = (18/7) * 5,603.051406 = (5,603.051406 * 18) / 7\n\nAs done earlier, this gives exactly 14,407.84647257 MeV, which rounds to 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nYes, this is consistent. \n\nTherefore, the energy of RHIC needed to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nBut just to ensure there\'s no mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me verify the atomic mass of ^6Li. According to data, the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122887 u (from the National Nuclear Data Center). So my value of 6.015122794 u was slightly off, but within the fourth decimal place of u, which when converted to MeV would result in a negligible difference. \n\nUsing 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = \n\n6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452\n\n0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242\n\nPlus 0.000022887 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0213\n\nSo total ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.093149410242 + 0.0213 ≈ 4.77191992234\n\nAdding to the 0.01 part: 9.3149410242 + 4.77191992234 ≈ 14.0868609465\n\nTotal rest mass energy: 5,588.96461452 + 14.0868609465 ≈ 5,603.05147547 MeV/c². \n\nSo even with the more precise atomic mass, the rest mass energy is approximately 5,603.0515 MeV/c², which doesn\'t significantly change our previous calculation. The kinetic energy remains approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the answer is confirmed to be 14,407.8465 MeV. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the RHIC is \\boxed{14407.8465} MeV.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385902, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7995, prompt_tokens=1743, total_tokens=9738, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Lithium-6) is 0.96c, we need to calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

1. **Determine the rest mass energy of Lithium-6**:
   - The atomic mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is 6.015122794 atomic mass units (u).
   - Converting this to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
     \[
     \text{Rest mass energy} = 6.015122794 \times 931.49410242 \approx 5603.0514 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   - Given \( v = 0.96c \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714285714
     \]

3. **Relativistic kinetic energy**:
   - The kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1) \times \text{rest mass energy} \):
     \[
     \text{Kinetic Energy} = (3.5714285714 - 1) \times 5603.0514 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Kinetic Energy} = 2.5714285714 \times 5603.0514 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Kinetic Energy} \approx 14407.8465 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

Thus, the energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is \(\boxed{14407.8465}\) MeV.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

the context of colliders, RHIC accelerates ions to certain energies. The energy is typically given as the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, no. Wait, actually, for heavy ions, the energy is often given as the total kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC can collide gold nuclei at 100 GeV per nucleon. So if that's the case, then perhaps here we need to compute the kinetic energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number of nucleons. 

Wait, but the nucleus here is Lithium-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if we compute the kinetic energy per nucleon, then multiply by 6. But let's see. Let me check how RHIC's energy is usually specified. 

Looking it up in my mind, RHIC operates with different energies for different ions. For example, for gold ions, it's 100 GeV per nucleon. So each gold nucleus (A=197) has a kinetic energy of 100 GeV/nucleon * 197 nucleons = 19.7 TeV. But wait, actually, no. Wait, the per nucleon energy is the same, so each nucleon has 100 GeV of energy? Wait, no, that's not how it works. Kinetic energy is a property of the entire nucleus. But when they say 100 GeV per nucleon, they mean that if you take the total kinetic energy of the nucleus and divide by the number of nucleons, you get 100 GeV. So for a gold nucleus with A=197, the total kinetic energy would be 100 GeV * 197 = 19.7 TeV. 

But in this problem, we have a Lithium-6 nucleus. So if we calculate the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is (gamma - 1) * m * c², then if we divide by 6, we get the kinetic energy per nucleon. However, the problem says "the energy of RHIC", so maybe they just want the kinetic energy of the nucleus. But the problem is not very clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, since it's asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, it's referring to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. So I should compute (gamma - 1) * m * c², which is the kinetic energy. 

But let's confirm the calculation. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. 

So gamma ≈ 3.5714286. Then, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c². So (3.5714286 - 1) * 5603.05 MeV ≈ 2.5714286 * 5603.05. Let's compute that. 

2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714286 * 5603.05 ≈ 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135

5603.05 * 0.0014286 ≈ 8.0 (approx)

So total ≈ 392.2135 + 8.0 ≈ 400.2135

Adding up: 11,206.1 + 2,801.525 = 14,007.625 + 400.2135 ≈ 14,407.8385 MeV. So approximately 14,407.84 MeV. 

But earlier, when I computed E_total - E_rest, I got 14,407.68 MeV. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps. To get a more precise value, let's do a more accurate calculation. 

First, exact gamma:

v = 0.96c

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428571428571

So gamma ≈ 3.571428571428571

Now, compute (gamma - 1) * m * c²:

gamma - 1 = 2.571428571428571

Multiply by 5603.05 MeV:

Let's compute 2.571428571428571 * 5603.05

First, note that 2.571428571 is approximately 2 + 0.5 + 0.071428571

So 2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.071428571 * 5603.05

Compute 5603.05 * 0.071428571:

First, 5603.05 / 14 ≈ 400.217857 because 1/14 ≈ 0.071428571

So 5603.05 * 0.071428571 ≈ 5603.05 / 14 ≈ 400.217857

Therefore, adding all parts:

11,206.1 + 2,801.525 = 14,007.625

14,007.625 + 400.217857 ≈ 14,407.842857 MeV

So approximately 14,407.842857 MeV. Rounding to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8429 MeV. 

But let's check if the rest mass was calculated correctly. Wait, the rest mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Let me compute that more accurately. 

6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = ?

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

0.015122794 * 931.49410242

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242

First, 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122794 * 900 = 0.1105146; 0.000122794 * 31.49410242 ≈ 0.0038655

So total ≈ 0.1105146 + 0.0038655 ≈ 0.1143801

So 0.005122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.1143801 ≈ 4.7718506

Thus, total 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.7718506 ≈ 14.08679162

Adding to the 6 u part: 5,588.96461452 + 14.08679162 ≈ 5,603.05140614 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is approximately 5,603.0514 MeV. 

So then, (gamma - 1) * m * c² = 2.571428571428571 * 5,603.0514 MeV

Let's compute this precisely:

2.571428571428571 * 5,603.0514

Break it down:

2 * 5,603.0514 = 11,206.1028

0.5 * 5,603.0514 = 2,801.5257

0.071428571428571 * 5,603.0514

As before, 5,603.0514 * 0.071428571428571 ≈ 5,603.0514 / 14 ≈ 400.21795714

So adding all three parts:

11,206.1028 + 2,801.5257 = 14,007.6285

14,007.6285 + 400.21795714 ≈ 14,407.846457 MeV

So approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounding to four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But let's check using another method. Let's use the exact formula:

Kinetic energy = (gamma - 1) * m * c²

Where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714

So gamma - 1 = 2.5714285714

Multiply by m*c² = 5,603.0514 MeV:

2.5714285714 * 5,603.0514

Let me compute this multiplication step by step:

First, 2 * 5,603.0514 = 11,206.1028

0.5 * 5,603.0514 = 2,801.5257

0.0714285714 * 5,603.0514

Compute 5,603.0514 * 0.0714285714:

We can note that 0.0714285714 is approximately 1/14, so 5,603.0514 / 14 = 400.21795714

So adding all parts:

11,206.1028 + 2,801.5257 = 14,007.6285

14,007.6285 + 400.21795714 = 14,407.84645714 MeV

So approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Therefore, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", and given that RHIC's energy is typically given per nucleon, maybe we need to divide by the number of nucleons to get the kinetic energy per nucleon, then present that. 

Wait, the nucleus is Lithium-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if the total kinetic energy is ~14,407.85 MeV, then the kinetic energy per nucleon is 14,407.85 / 6 ≈ 2,401.3075 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. 

But the problem says "the energy of RHIC", and in the case of RHIC, they often specify the energy as the collision energy per nucleon pair. For example, if two gold nuclei are colliding each with 100 GeV per nucleon, the total center-of-mass energy is higher. But here, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. 

Wait, but in accelerators, the energy given to the ions is kinetic energy. So if the question is about the kinetic energy of the nucleus, then the answer is approximately 14,407.85 MeV, or 14.40785 GeV. But 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But that seems low for RHIC, which typically operates at much higher energies. For example, RHIC can go up to 100 GeV per nucleon for gold ions. 

Wait, but perhaps because Lithium is lighter, the energy required to accelerate it to 0.96c is lower. Let's check with another approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the total energy, not the kinetic. Let's see. If the total energy is gamma*m*c², which we calculated as approximately 20,010.73 MeV or 20.01073 GeV. 

But again, 20 GeV is still lower than typical RHIC energies, but maybe for Lithium it's okay. 

But let's think again. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC". In accelerator physics, the "energy" of the collider is usually given as the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the charge state of the ion, but I might be mixing concepts here. 

Alternatively, the magnetic rigidity of the accelerator is related to the momentum of the particle. But the problem states speed, so maybe we need to calculate the kinetic energy required to reach that speed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the relativistic total energy, which is gamma*m*c². Let's check what happens if we consider that. 

Total energy is gamma*m*c² = 3.5714 * 5,603.05 MeV ≈ 20,010.73 MeV ≈ 20.0107 GeV. 

But again, depending on context, but given that the problem mentions "energy of RHIC", and since RHIC is a collider, it's possible that they are asking for the kinetic energy. However, given that the rest mass energy is about 5.6 GeV, and the kinetic energy is about 14.4 GeV, totaling to 20 GeV, which would be the total energy. 

But to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps we can look for similar problems. For example, in some textbooks, when asked about the energy required to accelerate a particle to a certain speed, they refer to the kinetic energy. So maybe the answer is the kinetic energy, 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But let's check with another approach. Let's compute the momentum and see what energy that corresponds to. 

The momentum p of a relativistic particle is gamma * m * v. 

Given that v = 0.96c, gamma = 3.5714285714, m = 5,603.05 MeV/c². 

So p = gamma * m * v / c = gamma * m * 0.96. 

Wait, in units where c=1, p = gamma * m * v. 

But let's compute p in MeV/c units. 

p = gamma * m * v / c = 3.5714285714 * 5,603.05 MeV/c² * 0.96c / c = 3.5714285714 * 5,603.05 * 0.96 MeV/c

Compute that:

First, 3.5714285714 * 0.96 = 3.4285714285

Then multiply by 5,603.05 MeV/c:

3.4285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 3 * 5,603.05 = 16,809.15

0.4285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 0.4 * 5,603.05 = 2,241.22 plus 0.0285714285 * 5,603.05 ≈ 0.0285714285 * 5,600 ≈ 160, so total ≈ 2,241.22 + 160 = 2,401.22

So total p ≈ 16,809.15 + 2,401.22 ≈ 19,210.37 MeV/c

But in accelerator physics, the magnetic rigidity is related to the momentum, but unless they are asking for that, which they aren't, we can ignore that. 

Alternatively, the total energy squared is (pc)² + (mc²)². Let's check that. 

E_total² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

So E_total = sqrt( (19,210.37 MeV)^2 + (5,603.05 MeV)^2 )

Compute that:

(19,210.37)^2 ≈ (19,000)^2 = 361,000,000, plus 2*19,000*210.37 = 7,994, 060, plus (210.37)^2 ≈ 44,255. So total ≈ 361,000,000 + 7,994,060 + 44,255 ≈ 369,038,315 (MeV²)

(5,603.05)^2 ≈ (5,600)^2 = 31,360,000, plus 2*5,600*3.05 = 34, 160, plus (3.05)^2 ≈ 9.3025. So total ≈ 31,360,000 + 34,160 + 9.3025 ≈ 31,394,169.3025 (MeV²)

Adding both: 369,038,315 + 31,394,169.3025 ≈ 400,432,484.3 (MeV²)

Square root of 400,432,484.3 ≈ 20,010.81 MeV, which matches our earlier calculation of E_total ≈ 20,010.73 MeV. Close enough, considering rounding errors. 

So that checks out. 

But coming back to the original question: What is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c?

Given that RHIC's energy is the kinetic energy per nucleus, the answer would be approximately 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.40785 GeV.

But wait, let's check the units. The user hasn't specified units, but given that in particle physics, energies are often in GeV or MeV. The rest mass we calculated is ~5.6 GeV, so kinetic energy ~14.4 GeV. 

But maybe the answer is expected in terms of total energy. However, given that the problem mentions "energy of RHIC", which is typically the kinetic energy. But to be thorough, perhaps we should present both and see which one makes sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified and assumes that the rest mass is just 6 atomic mass units, ignoring the actual mass defect. But since we calculated the rest mass as 6.015 u, which is more precise. 

Alternatively, maybe they expect a calculation using non-relativistic kinetic energy, but at 0.96c, that's definitely relativistic. 

Alternatively, perhaps they want the energy per nucleon. Since the nucleus has 6 nucleons, the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8465 / 6 ≈ 2,401.30775 MeV, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. 

But again, the problem states "the energy of RHIC", so perhaps they want the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. 

Alternatively, if they are following the same convention as RHIC's operation, where energy is given per nucleon in GeV/u, then the answer would be approximately 2.4013 GeV/u. 

But the problem statement is not clear. However, given that they specified the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons, which is 6 nucleons, and they ask for the energy of RHIC, which typically refers to the energy per nucleon, maybe the answer is 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. 

But let's check with the initial calculation. The kinetic energy of the nucleus is (gamma - 1) * m * c² = ~14,407.85 MeV. If we divide by 6, we get ~2,401.3 MeV per nucleon, which is 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. 

But RHIC's top energy is 100 GeV per nucleon for heavy ions like gold, so 2.4 GeV per nucleon seems low. However, for lighter ions, the required energy to reach a certain speed would be lower. Because kinetic energy depends on both velocity and mass. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy, which would be ~20 GeV. But without more context, it's hard to say. 

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In reality, the energy of the collider would refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, because different ions have different masses. So by specifying the kinetic energy per nucleon, you can have different ions reach different speeds. 

But in this case, since the question is about a specific nucleus, maybe they just want the kinetic energy of that nucleus. However, given the lack of specificity in the question, both answers could be possible. 

But given that the rest mass is 5,603.05 MeV and gamma is ~3.5714, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m*c² ≈ 14,407.85 MeV. If we convert that to Joules or another unit, but the problem doesn't specify, so likely in MeV or GeV. 

But in high-energy physics, energies are usually given in GeV. So 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", so four decimal places. 

Wait, 14,407.8465 MeV is 14.4078465 GeV, which to four decimal places is 14.4078 GeV. But wait, let's check:

14,407.8465 MeV = 14.4078465 GeV

Rounded to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV (since the fifth decimal is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down). Wait, no: 14.4078465

First decimal: 4

Second: 0

Third: 7

Fourth: 8

Fifth: 4

So 14.4078|465 GeV, so the fourth decimal is 8, the next is 4, so it remains 14.4078 GeV. 

But let me verify the exact value. 

We had earlier:

Kinetic energy = 14,407.84645714 MeV = 14.40784645714 GeV

So to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV. 

But wait, 14.40784645714

The fourth decimal is the fourth place after the decimal: 14.4078 (fourth is 8), the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays 14.4078. 

But actually, let's count:

14.40784645714

Positions:

1: 4

2: 0

3: 7

4: 8

5: 4

So yes, the fourth decimal is 8, and the fifth is 4, so it rounds to 14.4078. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in MeV with four decimal places. So 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So if the answer is about 14,407.8465 MeV, then 1e-4 precision would be ±0.0001, which is four decimal places. So 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem didn't specify units, but given the context, MeV or GeV. Probably in GeV, but given that the rest mass is ~5.6 GeV, the kinetic energy is ~14.4 GeV, so 14.4078 GeV. 

Alternatively, if they expect the answer in MeV, then 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But maybe the problem expects the total energy instead. Let's check. If the total energy is 20,010.73 MeV, which is 20.01073 GeV, and to four decimal places, 20.0107 GeV. 

But how to know which one is expected? The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", and since RHIC is a collider, the energy is typically defined by the kinetic energy. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reports the collision energy in TeV, which is the total energy, but for heavy ions, they often use per nucleon energy. 

But given that this is a physics problem, and not an engineering question about RHIC's actual operation, it's more likely that they want the relativistic kinetic energy of the nucleus. So the answer is approximately 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. 

Alternatively, if they want the total energy, 20.0107 GeV. But given that the question is about speed, and kinetic energy is what relates to the work done to accelerate the particle to that speed, I think kinetic energy is the answer. 

Wait, another way to think: energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy because that's what's imparted to the particles. Rest mass energy is inherent to the particle, so the collider's energy refers to the kinetic energy. 

Therefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. 

But let's check if there's another approach. For example, using the velocity and the relativistic equations for energy and momentum. 

Alternatively, consider that the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², and we have already computed that. 

Alternatively, using the relation between beta and gamma. 

But in any case, the calculation seems consistent. 

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 14.4078 GeV, or 14,407.8 MeV. However, given the problem requires precision to 1e-4, the exact value is 14,407.8465 MeV, which is 14.4078465 GeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14.4078 GeV. But if we keep it in MeV, 14,407.8465 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So 1e-4 relative precision, or absolute? If relative, then 1e-4 of the value. But likely, it's four decimal places in the final answer. 

But the problem didn't specify units. Since the rest mass was in MeV (from the calculation), it's likely expecting the answer in MeV. So 14,407.8465 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But let me check the calculation one more time for any possible error. 

Rest mass of ^6Li: 6.015122794 u

1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c²

Therefore, rest mass energy: 6.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 5,603.051406 MeV/c². 

Gamma for v = 0.96c: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714

Kinetic energy: (gamma - 1) * m c² = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.051406 ≈ 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Yes, this seems correct. 

Therefore, the energy of RHIC should be approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem might expect the answer in GeV. So 14.4078 GeV. However, it's essential to present the answer as specified. Since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, and the problem didn't specify, but the PS mentions precision to 1e-4, which is four decimal places. If we write it in MeV, it's 14407.8465 MeV, which is 1.44078465 × 10^4 MeV. But to four decimal places, 14407.8465 MeV. 

Alternatively, converting to GeV: 14.4078465 GeV, which to four decimal places is 14.4078 GeV. 

But since the rest mass energy is 5,603.05 MeV, which is a precise value, and the gamma is exact as 25/7 (since 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25, so gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714). Wait, 1/0.28 is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714. 

So gamma is exactly 25/7. Therefore, gamma - 1 = 18/7. 

Therefore, kinetic energy is (18/7) * 5,603.051406 MeV. 

Compute 18/7 * 5,603.051406:

18/7 = 2.5714285714

So 5,603.051406 * 18 / 7

First compute 5,603.051406 * 18:

5,603.051406 * 10 = 56,030.51406

5,603.051406 * 8 = 44,824.411248

Total = 56,030.51406 + 44,824.411248 = 100,854.925308

Now divide by 7:

100,854.925308 / 7 ≈ 14,407.84647257 MeV

So exactly 14,407.84647257 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Therefore, this is the precise calculation. So the answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of GeV with four decimal places, so 14.4078 GeV. However, given the initial rest mass was in MeV, and the precision required is 1e-4, which for MeV is four decimal places, but for GeV is four decimal places as well. 

But since 14,407.8465 MeV is 14.4078465 GeV, both are acceptable, but since the question didn't specify, and in high-energy physics, energies are often in GeV, but sometimes in MeV for precision. Given that the value is around 14.4 GeV, writing it as 14.4078 GeV with four decimal places is appropriate. 

Alternatively, if writing in MeV with four decimal places, 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So if the energy is ~14,407.8 MeV, then 1e-4 of that is ~1.44078 MeV. So to have a precision of ±1.44078 MeV, but the question says the precision is at 1e-4, which is 0.0001 in absolute terms? Wait, maybe it's referring to the relative precision. 1e-4 is 0.01% precision. 

But in terms of the answer, they probably want four decimal places in the appropriate unit. 

Given the ambiguity, but considering that the rest mass was calculated to four decimal places in MeV (5,603.0514 MeV), and the kinetic energy is 14,407.8465 MeV, which also has four decimal places, I think the answer should be presented as 14,407.8465 MeV, or converting to GeV with the same precision, 14.4078 GeV. 

But I need to check if the question specifies units. It doesn't, but given the context of RHIC, which typically uses GeV per nucleon, but since this is a specific nucleus, maybe MeV is acceptable. 

Alternatively, since 14,407.8465 MeV is approximately 14.4078465 GeV, which is 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. 

However, considering that the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, so if the answer is in GeV, four decimal places, but if in MeV, also four decimal places. But since the calculation gives us 14,407.8465 MeV, which is already four decimal places in MeV (since the .8465 is after the decimal in MeV? Wait, no. Wait, 14,407.8465 MeV is written with four decimal places: 14407.8465. The decimal places are the digits after the decimal point. So 14,407.8465 has four decimal places. 

Yes, so 14,407.8465 MeV is correct to four decimal places. 

Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But let me just cross-verify once more. 

Alternatively, use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:

K = (gamma - 1) m c²

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714

m c² = 5,603.051406 MeV

K = (25/7 - 1) * 5,603.051406 = (18/7) * 5,603.051406 = (5,603.051406 * 18) / 7

As done earlier, this gives exactly 14,407.84647257 MeV, which rounds to 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Yes, this is consistent. 

Therefore, the energy of RHIC needed to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is 14,407.8465 MeV. 

But just to ensure there's no mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me verify the atomic mass of ^6Li. According to data, the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122887 u (from the National Nuclear Data Center). So my value of 6.015122794 u was slightly off, but within the fourth decimal place of u, which when converted to MeV would result in a negligible difference. 

Using 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = 

6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242

Plus 0.000022887 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0213

So total ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.093149410242 + 0.0213 ≈ 4.77191992234

Adding to the 0.01 part: 9.3149410242 + 4.77191992234 ≈ 14.0868609465

Total rest mass energy: 5,588.96461452 + 14.0868609465 ≈ 5,603.05147547 MeV/c². 

So even with the more precise atomic mass, the rest mass energy is approximately 5,603.0515 MeV/c², which doesn't significantly change our previous calculation. The kinetic energy remains approximately 14,407.8465 MeV. 

Therefore, the answer is confirmed to be 14,407.8465 MeV. 

**Final Answer**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14407.8465} MeV.

However, the question states "the energy of RHIC," which might refer to the kinetic energy per nucleus. Alternatively, sometimes total energy is considered. However, typically, in accelerator physics, the kinetic energy is what is reported. For example, RHIC\'s collision energy is often given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. However, the problem doesn\'t specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy of the nucleus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the total energy. Let me check the problem statement again: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed. Since energy can refer to kinetic energy. But to be precise, maybe the problem expects the total energy. However, in physics, when asking for the energy of the collider, it\'s more likely they refer to the kinetic energy. However, to confirm, perhaps we need to check both.\n\nBut the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", and in accelerator terms, the beam energy is typically the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, but the question specifies "the energy of the nucleus X". Wait, the original question says: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So the energy here refers to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Because the collider\'s energy would be set such that the accelerated nucleus has that speed, so kinetic energy.\n\nBut in high-energy physics, energies are often given per nucleon. For example, RHIC collides heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But the problem doesn\'t specify per nucleon, so perhaps it\'s the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Let\'s check the problem again. The nucleus is Lithium-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.\n\nBut the question does not mention per nucleon. So the answer is the total kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is approximately 14,407.8457 MeV. To convert to the required precision (1e-4), which is four decimal places. Let\'s compute this more accurately.\n\nFirst, the rest mass energy:\n\nExact calculation of E_rest:\n\n6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u\n\nCalculate 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452\n\n0.015122794 * 931.49410242:\n\nCalculate 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005122794 * 931.49410242 = ?\n\nFirst, 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 931.49410242 * 0.000122794 ≈ 0.1143\n\nSo 4.6574705121 + 0.1143 ≈ 4.7718\n\nSo total 0.015122794 contribution is 9.3149410242 + 4.7718 ≈ 14.0867 MeV\n\nTherefore, total E_rest ≈ 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867 ≈ 5,603.0513 MeV\n\nGamma is exactly 3.5714285714...\n\nSo E_total = 5,603.0513 MeV * 3.5714285714 = ?\n\nLet\'s compute:\n\nFirst, 5,603.0513 * 3 = 16,809.1539\n\n5,603.0513 * 0.5714285714:\n\n0.5 * 5,603.0513 = 2,801.52565\n\n0.0714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈\n\n5,603.0513 * 0.07 = 392.213591\n\n5,603.0513 * 0.0014285714 ≈ 5,603.0513 * 0.001 = 5.6030513; 5,603.0513 * 0.0004285714 ≈ 2.4013\n\nSo total 0.0714285714 contribution ≈ 392.213591 + 5.6030513 + 2.4013 ≈ 400.2179423\n\nTherefore, 0.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 2,801.52565 + 400.2179423 ≈ 3,201.7435923\n\nTotal E_total ≈ 16,809.1539 + 3,201.7435923 ≈ 20,010.8974923 MeV\n\nSo E_total ≈ 20,010.8975 MeV\n\nThen kinetic energy is E_total - E_rest = 20,010.8975 - 5,603.0513 = 14,407.8462 MeV\n\nSo the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8462 MeV. To four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.8462 MeV.\n\nBut wait, in accelerator physics, energies are often given in GeV (giga-electron volts) rather than MeV. 14,407.8462 MeV is 14.4078462 GeV. But the problem doesn\'t specify units, but in the PS it says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4." So perhaps it\'s expected in MeV with four decimal places. So 14,407.8462 MeV. But let\'s check if the problem expects the total energy or the kinetic energy. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In this context, the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed would be the kinetic energy. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8462 MeV, which can be rounded to four decimal places as 14,407.8462 MeV.\n\nBut let\'s verify once more. Alternatively, the problem could be referring to the total energy. However, in most cases, when asking about the energy of a collider, it\'s the kinetic energy. But let\'s confirm with the definition:\n\nTotal energy is gamma times rest energy. Kinetic energy is total minus rest. Since the question is about the energy provided by the collider, which would be the kinetic energy. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8462 MeV. To four decimal places, 14,407.8462 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like joules, but given the rest mass is calculated in MeV, it\'s likely expected in MeV. So the final answer is 14,407.8462 MeV. However, let\'s check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, another way to compute the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c². So (3.5714285714 - 1) * 5,603.0513 MeV = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈\n\n2 * 5,603.0513 = 11,206.1026\n\n0.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 3,201.7435\n\nAdding together: 11,206.1026 + 3,201.7435 ≈ 14,407.8461 MeV, which matches the previous result. So yes, 14,407.8461 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14,407.8461 MeV with four decimal places. But let\'s check if the rest mass was correctly calculated.\n\nThe isotope is Lithium-6 (^6Li), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Yes, that\'s correct. Then multiplied by 931.49410242 MeV/u gives approximately 5,603.0513 MeV. Correct.\n\nGamma calculation for 0.96c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... Correct.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy is indeed (gamma - 1) * m c² = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 14,407.8461 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8461 MeV.\n\nBut the problem mentions "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", and in practice, RHIC\'s energy is often given per nucleon in GeV/nucleon. Since ^6Li has 6 nucleons, if the kinetic energy per nucleon is 14,407.8461 MeV / 6 ≈ 2,401.3077 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon, so it\'s safer to provide the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8461 MeV.

Depending on rounding rules, this would be 14,407.8463 MeV (four decimal places). However, the problem states the precision is 1e-4, which is four decimal places. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s use more precise computation:\n\nE_rest = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242\n\nUsing calculator:\n\n6.015122794 * 931.49410242\n\nFirst compute 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452\n\nThen 0.015122794 * 931.49410242:\n\n0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005122794 * 931.49410242:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.000122794 * 931.49410242 = 931.49410242 * 0.000122794 ≈ 0.1143\n\nTotal: 4.6574705121 + 0.1143 ≈ 4.77177\n\nSo total 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77177 ≈ 14.0867110242\n\nThus, E_rest = 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867110242 ≈ 5,603.05132554 MeV\n\nGamma = 3.571428571428571...\n\nE_total = 5,603.05132554 * 3.571428571428571\n\nLet\'s compute 5,603.05132554 * 3.571428571428571:\n\n3.571428571428571 is 25/7. So 5,603.05132554 * 25 / 7.\n\nFirst compute 5,603.05132554 * 25 = 5,603.05132554 * 20 = 112,061.0265108 + 5,603.05132554 * 5 = 28,015.2566277 = Total 112,061.0265108 + 28,015.2566277 = 140,076.2831385\n\nNow divide by 7: 140,076.2831385 / 7 ≈ 20,010.8975912 MeV\n\nThus, E_total ≈ 20,010.8975912 MeV\n\nE_kinetic = 20,010.8975912 - 5,603.05132554 ≈ 14,407.8462657 MeV\n\nRounded to four decimal places: 14,407.8463 MeV\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, considering that the rest mass was calculated with higher precision, and the gamma factor is exact (25/7), the exact kinetic energy would be:\n\nE_kinetic = (gamma - 1) * E_rest = (25/7 - 1) * E_rest = (18/7) * E_rest\n\nE_rest = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 5,603.05132554 MeV\n\n18/7 * 5,603.05132554 = (18 * 5,603.05132554) / 7\n\n18 * 5,603.05132554 = 100,854.92386\n\nDivide by 7: 100,854.92386 / 7 ≈ 14,407.846266 MeV\n\nSo exactly 14,407.846266... MeV, which rounds to 14,407.8463 MeV at four decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. But wait, the problem states "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4." 1e-4 in MeV would be 0.0001 MeV, which is 100 eV. However, given that the rest mass and gamma factor calculations result in a value that, when computed precisely, gives 14,407.8463 MeV, which is already to four decimal places. Hence, the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, converting this into GeV, it\'s 14.4078463 GeV, but the problem doesn\'t specify the unit. However, since the rest mass was in MeV, it\'s safer to present the answer in MeV.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in joules or another unit, but given the context, MeV is appropriate. Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, considering that the initial rest mass might have more decimal places, but the given atomic mass is 6.015122794 u, which we used fully. Therefore, the calculation is as precise as possible, and the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check if the question is perhaps asking for the energy per nucleon. The nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). If so, then the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8463 MeV / 6 ≈ 2,401.3077 MeV/nucleon, which is 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon. Therefore, unless specified, it\'s the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", and RHIC\'s energy is typically quoted per nucleon, but since the problem doesn\'t specify, we should state the total. However, given that the rest mass energy is for the entire nucleus, and the calculation is for the entire nucleus, the answer should be the total kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.8463 MeV. However, in the box, we need to present it with LaTeX. So:\n\n\\boxed{14407.8463 \\text{ MeV}}\n\nBut just to confirm once more, perhaps the problem expects the total energy (E_total) instead of kinetic. The question says "the energy of the RHIC". In accelerator physics, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially in relativity, people might refer to total energy. To check, let\'s see what\'s more standard.\n\nFor example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reports the collision energy in terms of total energy (e.g., 13 TeV), but that\'s the total center-of-mass energy for proton-proton collisions. However, for heavy ions, they often report the energy per nucleon. But in this case, the problem doesn\'t specify. Given that the speed is given, and we calculated both total and kinetic, but the question is about the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed, which is the kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, which is 14,407.8463 MeV. Hence, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{14407.8463 \\text{ MeV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386296, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5079, prompt_tokens=667, total_tokens=5746, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Lithium-6 nucleus (³Li with 3 neutrons) to a speed of 0.96c, we use relativistic physics principles.

1. **Identify the nucleus and its rest mass energy:**
   - Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of 6.015122794 u.
   - Convert atomic mass to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     E_{\text{rest}} = 6.015122794 \, \text{u} \times 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5603.0513 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)):**
   - For \(v = 0.96c\):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
     \]

3. **Compute the total energy (\(E_{\text{total}}\)):**
   - Using the Lorentz factor:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \times E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5603.0513 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20010.8976 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

4. **Determine the kinetic energy (\(E_{\text{kinetic}}\)):**
   - Subtract the rest mass energy from the total energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{kinetic}} = E_{\text{total}} - E_{\text{rest}} = 20010.8976 \, \text{MeV} - 5603.0513 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14407.8463 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c is the kinetic energy, which is:

\[
\boxed{14407.8463 \text{ MeV}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, in accelerator physics, kinetic energy is often the relevant measure. To confirm, I'll check both possibilities.

But wait, the exact rest mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Let's recalculate precisely.

Rest mass energy:
6.015122794 u × 931.49410242 MeV/u ≈ 6.015122794 × 931.49410242

Calculating step by step:
6 × 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452
0.015122794 × 931.49410242 ≈ 14.0865 MeV
Total E_rest ≈ 5,588.96461452 + 14.0865 = 5,603.05111452 MeV

Gamma calculation:
v = 0.96c
γ = 1/√(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/√(1 - 0.9216) = 1/√0.0784
√0.0784 = 0.28 exactly (since 0.28² = 0.0784)
γ = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

E_total = γ × E_rest = 3.5714285714 × 5,603.05111452 MeV
Calculating:
3 × 5,603.05111452 = 16,809.15334356
0.5714285714 × 5,603.05111452 ≈
First, 0.5 × 5,603.05111452 = 2,801.52555726
0.0714285714 × 5,603.05111452 ≈ 5,603.05111452 × 0.0714285714 ≈ 400.21793675
Total E_total ≈ 16,809.15334356 + 2,801.52555726 + 400.21793675 ≈ 20,010.8968376 MeV

Thus, E_total ≈ 20,010.8968 MeV (to four decimal places)
E_kinetic = E_total - E_rest = 20,010.8968 - 5,603.0511 = 14,407.8457 MeV

But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy per nucleon is sometimes considered. However, the question states "the energy of RHIC," which might refer to the kinetic energy per nucleus. Alternatively, sometimes total energy is considered. However, typically, in accelerator physics, the kinetic energy is what is reported. For example, RHIC's collision energy is often given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. However, the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy of the nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the total energy. Let me check the problem statement again: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed. Since energy can refer to kinetic energy. But to be precise, maybe the problem expects the total energy. However, in physics, when asking for the energy of the collider, it's more likely they refer to the kinetic energy. However, to confirm, perhaps we need to check both.

But the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", and in accelerator terms, the beam energy is typically the kinetic energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, but the question specifies "the energy of the nucleus X". Wait, the original question says: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So the energy here refers to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Because the collider's energy would be set such that the accelerated nucleus has that speed, so kinetic energy.

But in high-energy physics, energies are often given per nucleon. For example, RHIC collides heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so perhaps it's the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Let's check the problem again. The nucleus is Lithium-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.

But the question does not mention per nucleon. So the answer is the total kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is approximately 14,407.8457 MeV. To convert to the required precision (1e-4), which is four decimal places. Let's compute this more accurately.

First, the rest mass energy:

Exact calculation of E_rest:

6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u

Calculate 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

0.015122794 * 931.49410242:

Calculate 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242 = ?

First, 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 931.49410242 * 0.000122794 ≈ 0.1143

So 4.6574705121 + 0.1143 ≈ 4.7718

So total 0.015122794 contribution is 9.3149410242 + 4.7718 ≈ 14.0867 MeV

Therefore, total E_rest ≈ 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867 ≈ 5,603.0513 MeV

Gamma is exactly 3.5714285714...

So E_total = 5,603.0513 MeV * 3.5714285714 = ?

Let's compute:

First, 5,603.0513 * 3 = 16,809.1539

5,603.0513 * 0.5714285714:

0.5 * 5,603.0513 = 2,801.52565

0.0714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈

5,603.0513 * 0.07 = 392.213591

5,603.0513 * 0.0014285714 ≈ 5,603.0513 * 0.001 = 5.6030513; 5,603.0513 * 0.0004285714 ≈ 2.4013

So total 0.0714285714 contribution ≈ 392.213591 + 5.6030513 + 2.4013 ≈ 400.2179423

Therefore, 0.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 2,801.52565 + 400.2179423 ≈ 3,201.7435923

Total E_total ≈ 16,809.1539 + 3,201.7435923 ≈ 20,010.8974923 MeV

So E_total ≈ 20,010.8975 MeV

Then kinetic energy is E_total - E_rest = 20,010.8975 - 5,603.0513 = 14,407.8462 MeV

So the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8462 MeV. To four decimal places, that's 14,407.8462 MeV.

But wait, in accelerator physics, energies are often given in GeV (giga-electron volts) rather than MeV. 14,407.8462 MeV is 14.4078462 GeV. But the problem doesn't specify units, but in the PS it says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4." So perhaps it's expected in MeV with four decimal places. So 14,407.8462 MeV. But let's check if the problem expects the total energy or the kinetic energy. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In this context, the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed would be the kinetic energy. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8462 MeV, which can be rounded to four decimal places as 14,407.8462 MeV.

But let's verify once more. Alternatively, the problem could be referring to the total energy. However, in most cases, when asking about the energy of a collider, it's the kinetic energy. But let's confirm with the definition:

Total energy is gamma times rest energy. Kinetic energy is total minus rest. Since the question is about the energy provided by the collider, which would be the kinetic energy. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8462 MeV. To four decimal places, 14,407.8462 MeV.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like joules, but given the rest mass is calculated in MeV, it's likely expected in MeV. So the final answer is 14,407.8462 MeV. However, let's check for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, another way to compute the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c². So (3.5714285714 - 1) * 5,603.0513 MeV = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈

2 * 5,603.0513 = 11,206.1026

0.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 3,201.7435

Adding together: 11,206.1026 + 3,201.7435 ≈ 14,407.8461 MeV, which matches the previous result. So yes, 14,407.8461 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8461 MeV with four decimal places. But let's check if the rest mass was correctly calculated.

The isotope is Lithium-6 (^6Li), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122794 u. Yes, that's correct. Then multiplied by 931.49410242 MeV/u gives approximately 5,603.0513 MeV. Correct.

Gamma calculation for 0.96c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... Correct.

Therefore, the kinetic energy is indeed (gamma - 1) * m c² = 2.5714285714 * 5,603.0513 ≈ 14,407.8461 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8461 MeV.

But the problem mentions "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", and in practice, RHIC's energy is often given per nucleon in GeV/nucleon. Since ^6Li has 6 nucleons, if the kinetic energy per nucleon is 14,407.8461 MeV / 6 ≈ 2,401.3077 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon, so it's safer to provide the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8461 MeV. To four decimal places, 14,407.8461 MeV.

But let me check once more for any possible calculation errors. Let's recompute gamma:

v = 0.96c

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714. Correct.

Rest mass energy: 6.015122794 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242

Calculating 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

0.015122794 * 931.49410242:

0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242 = 4.7718 (as before)

Total 9.3149410242 + 4.7718 = 14.0867410242

Total rest energy: 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867410242 ≈ 5,603.05135554 MeV

So more precisely, E_rest ≈ 5,603.05135554 MeV

Gamma is 3.5714285714

Total energy: 5,603.05135554 * 3.5714285714 ≈ ?

Calculating:

5,603.05135554 * 3 = 16,809.15406662

5,603.05135554 * 0.5714285714:

0.5 * 5,603.05135554 = 2,801.52567777

0.0714285714 * 5,603.05135554 ≈ 5,603.05135554 * 0.0714285714 ≈ 400.217954 MeV

Total for 0.5714285714: 2,801.52567777 + 400.217954 ≈ 3,201.74363177

Total energy: 16,809.15406662 + 3,201.74363177 ≈ 20,010.8976984 MeV

Kinetic energy: 20,010.8976984 - 5,603.05135554 ≈ 14,407.8463429 MeV

Rounded to four decimal places: 14,407.8463 MeV

But since the fourth decimal place is 6 in 14,407.8463, but let's check the exact value:

20,010.8976984 - 5,603.05135554 = 14,407.84634286 MeV

So 14,407.84634286 MeV, which is 14,407.8463 MeV when rounded to four decimal places.

However, considering the exact calculation steps, the precise value is 14,407.84634286 MeV. Depending on rounding rules, this would be 14,407.8463 MeV (four decimal places). However, the problem states the precision is 1e-4, which is four decimal places. Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV.

But to confirm, let's use more precise computation:

E_rest = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242

Using calculator:

6.015122794 * 931.49410242

First compute 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

Then 0.015122794 * 931.49410242:

0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122794 * 931.49410242:

Breakdown:

0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122794 * 931.49410242 = 931.49410242 * 0.000122794 ≈ 0.1143

Total: 4.6574705121 + 0.1143 ≈ 4.77177

So total 0.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77177 ≈ 14.0867110242

Thus, E_rest = 5,588.96461452 + 14.0867110242 ≈ 5,603.05132554 MeV

Gamma = 3.571428571428571...

E_total = 5,603.05132554 * 3.571428571428571

Let's compute 5,603.05132554 * 3.571428571428571:

3.571428571428571 is 25/7. So 5,603.05132554 * 25 / 7.

First compute 5,603.05132554 * 25 = 5,603.05132554 * 20 = 112,061.0265108 + 5,603.05132554 * 5 = 28,015.2566277 = Total 112,061.0265108 + 28,015.2566277 = 140,076.2831385

Now divide by 7: 140,076.2831385 / 7 ≈ 20,010.8975912 MeV

Thus, E_total ≈ 20,010.8975912 MeV

E_kinetic = 20,010.8975912 - 5,603.05132554 ≈ 14,407.8462657 MeV

Rounded to four decimal places: 14,407.8463 MeV

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, considering that the rest mass was calculated with higher precision, and the gamma factor is exact (25/7), the exact kinetic energy would be:

E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) * E_rest = (25/7 - 1) * E_rest = (18/7) * E_rest

E_rest = 6.015122794 * 931.49410242 ≈ 5,603.05132554 MeV

18/7 * 5,603.05132554 = (18 * 5,603.05132554) / 7

18 * 5,603.05132554 = 100,854.92386

Divide by 7: 100,854.92386 / 7 ≈ 14,407.846266 MeV

So exactly 14,407.846266... MeV, which rounds to 14,407.8463 MeV at four decimal places.

Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. But wait, the problem states "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4." 1e-4 in MeV would be 0.0001 MeV, which is 100 eV. However, given that the rest mass and gamma factor calculations result in a value that, when computed precisely, gives 14,407.8463 MeV, which is already to four decimal places. Hence, the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, converting this into GeV, it's 14.4078463 GeV, but the problem doesn't specify the unit. However, since the rest mass was in MeV, it's safer to present the answer in MeV.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in joules or another unit, but given the context, MeV is appropriate. Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. However, considering that the initial rest mass might have more decimal places, but the given atomic mass is 6.015122794 u, which we used fully. Therefore, the calculation is as precise as possible, and the answer is 14,407.8463 MeV when rounded to four decimal places.

But wait, let's check if the question is perhaps asking for the energy per nucleon. The nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). If so, then the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8463 MeV / 6 ≈ 2,401.3077 MeV/nucleon, which is 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon. Therefore, unless specified, it's the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", and RHIC's energy is typically quoted per nucleon, but since the problem doesn't specify, we should state the total. However, given that the rest mass energy is for the entire nucleus, and the calculation is for the entire nucleus, the answer should be the total kinetic energy.

Therefore, the final answer is 14,407.8463 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8463 MeV. However, in the box, we need to present it with LaTeX. So:

\boxed{14407.8463 \text{ MeV}}

But just to confirm once more, perhaps the problem expects the total energy (E_total) instead of kinetic. The question says "the energy of the RHIC". In accelerator physics, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially in relativity, people might refer to total energy. To check, let's see what's more standard.

For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reports the collision energy in terms of total energy (e.g., 13 TeV), but that's the total center-of-mass energy for proton-proton collisions. However, for heavy ions, they often report the energy per nucleon. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify. Given that the speed is given, and we calculated both total and kinetic, but the question is about the energy required to accelerate the nucleus to that speed, which is the kinetic energy.

Therefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, which is 14,407.8463 MeV. Hence, the final answer is:

\boxed{14407.8463 \text{ MeV}}

Let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.96c. Then, v²/c² = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. Multiplying that by the rest mass energy: 5603 MeV * 3.57142857. Let me compute that precisely. 5603 * 3.57142857.\n\nAlternatively, to get more precise, perhaps I should use exact fractions. Since 0.96 is 24/25, so beta = 24/25. Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (24/25)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 576/625) = 1/sqrt(49/625) = 1/(7/25) = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is exactly 25/7. Therefore, the total energy is (25/7) * 5603 MeV. Let me compute that. 5603 divided by 7 is 800.4285714, multiplied by 25 equals 20,010.7142857 MeV. Then, the kinetic energy is 20,010.7142857 - 5603 = 14,407.7142857 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.7143 MeV. But perhaps the rest mass needs to be more precise.\n\nWait, the actual rest mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 atomic mass units (from the periodic table). Let me check that. If I use the exact value, 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u. Let\'s compute that. 6.015122 * 931.494. Let\'s do this step by step.\n\n6 * 931.494 = 5,588.964\n\n0.015122 * 931.494 ≈ 0.015122 * 900 ≈ 13.6098, and 0.015122 * 31.494 ≈ ~0.476. So total ~14.0858. So total rest mass energy ≈ 5,588.964 + 14.0858 ≈ 5,603.0498 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.05 MeV.\n\nTherefore, using gamma = 25/7, the total energy is (25/7) * 5603.05 ≈ 25/7 * 5603.05. Let\'s compute 5603.05 / 7 = 800.4357142857. Then multiply by 25: 800.4357142857 * 25 = 20,010.8928571 MeV. Then subtract the rest mass: 20,010.8928571 - 5,603.05 = 14,407.8428571 MeV. So approximately 14,407.8429 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8429 MeV.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like GeV. 14,407.8429 MeV is 14.4078429 GeV. But the question says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4," which would be 0.0001. However, the answer needs to be in what unit? The problem says "energy of RHIC" but doesn\'t specify, but given the context, it\'s likely in GeV or MeV. Since the rest mass is in the thousands of MeV, the answer is in the tens of thousands of MeV, so perhaps 14,407.8429 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. But the problem says "precision of the energy is at 1e-4," which would be four decimal places. If in MeV, that\'s 14407.8429 MeV, so 14407.8429, which is 14407.8429 with four decimal places. However, perhaps the answer needs to be in units of energy per nucleon? Let\'s check.\n\nThe nucleus is ^6Li, which has 6 nucleons. If the total kinetic energy is 14,407.8429 MeV, then per nucleon, it\'s 14,407.8429 / 6 ≈ 2401.3071 MeV per nucleon. But the problem doesn\'t specify per nucleon, so maybe the total kinetic energy is required. However, in collider physics, sometimes energies are given per nucleon. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking up RHIC\'s typical operations, heavy ions like gold are accelerated to energies of 100 GeV per nucleon. But the problem here is about Lithium-6. However, the question doesn\'t specify per nucleon. Let me re-read the question: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So, the energy here likely refers to the kinetic energy per nucleus. But sometimes, in accelerator physics, the energy is given as the total energy, but given that they mention speed, which relates to gamma, which relates to total energy. Wait, but the kinetic energy is what\'s required to accelerate it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the rest mass. Wait, but the problem statement says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So maybe we need to present the answer with four decimal places. In my calculation, the kinetic energy was approximately 14,407.8429 MeV. So 14407.8429 MeV. But perhaps it\'s better to present it as 14.4078 GeV. But the problem doesn\'t specify units. However, given that the rest mass is in MeV, and the answer is in the order of 10^4 MeV, using GeV would make it 14.4078 GeV. But maybe the answer is expected in MeV with four decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic. Let me check again. The problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In accelerator physics, the "beam energy" can sometimes refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC is known to collide heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, perhaps total kinetic energy of the nucleus is required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is in terms of the rest mass. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nGiven that gamma is 25/7, and rest mass energy is 5603.05 MeV, total energy is 25/7 * 5603.05 ≈ 20,010.89 MeV. So if the question is asking for total energy, it would be approximately 20,010.89 MeV, but if kinetic energy, then 14,407.84 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the kinetic energy per nucleon. Let\'s see. The nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). So if the total kinetic energy is 14,407.84 MeV, then per nucleon, it\'s 14,407.84 /6 ≈ 2401.307 MeV per nucleon. But again, the problem didn\'t specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is given in terms of the kinetic energy in Joules. But that\'s unlikely, as particle physics usually uses electron volts. The problem mentions precision to 1e-4, so four decimal places. Let me check the calculation again for any possible errors.\n\nFirst, the rest mass of ^6Li. Let me confirm the exact mass. The atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.01512289 u. 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So rest mass energy is 6.01512289 * 931.49410242. Let\'s compute that.\n\nFirst, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452\n\nThen, 0.01512289 * 931.49410242. Let\'s compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.00512289 * 931.49410242: 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.00012289 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0001 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0931494 + 0.00002289 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0213\n\nSo total for 0.01512289: 9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 = 13.9724115363 + 0.0931494 + 0.0213 ≈ 14.0868609 MeV\n\nTotal rest mass energy: 5,588.96461452 + 14.0868609 ≈ 5,603.05147542 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.0515 MeV. Therefore, more precisely, gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714.\n\nTotal energy: 5603.0515 * 25/7 = 5603.0515 * 3.5714285714 ≈ Let\'s compute 5603.0515 * 3.5714285714.\n\nFirst, 5603.0515 * 3 = 16,809.1545\n\n5603.0515 * 0.5714285714 = 5603.0515 * (4/7) ≈ 5603.0515 / 7 = 800.4359286, then multiplied by 4 = 3,201.743714\n\nSo total energy ≈ 16,809.1545 + 3,201.743714 ≈ 20,010.8982 MeV\n\nThus, kinetic energy is 20,010.8982 - 5,603.0515 ≈ 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\nBut let me check with exact fractions. Let me compute 5603.0515 * 25 /7:\n\nFirst, 5603.0515 ÷ 7 = 800.435928571428...\n\n800.435928571428... * 25 = 20,010.8982142857...\n\nSubtract rest mass: 20,010.8982142857... - 5,603.0515 = 14,407.8467142857...\n\nSo, 14,407.8467 MeV when rounded to four decimal places. So 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, if expressed in GeV, that\'s 14.4078 GeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which would mean four decimal places. If we present it in GeV, 14.4078 GeV (four decimal places). But if in MeV, 14407.8467 MeV, which is 14407.8467 with four decimal places. However, the problem might expect the answer in a specific unit. Since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, perhaps the answer should be in MeV. However, sometimes in accelerator physics, energies are given per nucleon. Let me check if that\'s the case here.\n\nThe problem states "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". RHIC accelerates ions to certain energies, typically quoted as per nucleon in units of GeV/nucleon. For example, gold ions at RHIC are accelerated to 100 GeV per nucleon. So perhaps here, the energy per nucleon is required. Let me check.\n\nIf the total kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV for a ^6Li nucleus (6 nucleons), then the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8467 /6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon. The question is ambiguous, but given that it\'s about the entire nucleus\'s speed, maybe the total kinetic energy is required. But in practice, collider energies are often given per nucleon. Let me see if there\'s a way to confirm.\n\nLooking up RHIC\'s parameters, for example, gold ions (Au) are accelerated to 100 GeV per nucleon, resulting in a total energy per nucleus of 197 * 100 GeV = 19.7 TeV. However, this is total energy, but wait, actually, the 100 GeV is the kinetic energy per nucleon. Wait, no, in reality, the energy in accelerators is often given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. So if the problem is following that convention, then it would be 2.4013 GeV/u.\n\nBut since the problem doesn\'t specify, but asks for "the energy of RHIC", which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the way the question is phrased, and the fact that they mention the speed of the nucleus, which depends on the total energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon. Therefore, I think the answer is the total kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV, or 14.4078 GeV. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy in terms of the rest mass energy. For instance, in units of Mc², but the question doesn\'t specify. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the answer in joules or another unit, but given the context of particle physics, MeV or GeV is standard.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". If the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV, then written as 14407.8467 MeV, the precision is to four decimal places (0.0001 MeV), which is 0.1 keV. That seems excessively precise, given that rest mass calculations are precise only to a few keV. However, given the problem statement requires it, we can present it as such.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy (not just kinetic), which would be 20,010.8982 MeV, or 20.0109 GeV. But the question says "energy of RHIC", and typically, the kinetic energy is what\'s relevant for accelerators, as the rest mass energy is inherent to the particle. Therefore, the answer is likely the kinetic energy.\n\nThus, after careful calculation, the kinetic energy required is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.8467 MeV. However, converting to GeV for simplicity, it\'s 14.4078 GeV. But given the problem\'s precision requirement, we need to ensure four decimal places in the final answer\'s unit. If the answer is in MeV, then 14407.8467 MeV. If in GeV, 14.4078 GeV. But since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, perhaps MeV is the appropriate unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the answer in terms of the total energy. Let me check again. If the problem states "energy of RHIC", which accelerates particles to a certain energy. In accelerator physics, sometimes "energy" refers to the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV of energy, which is kinetic energy. However, for heavy ions, they often use kinetic energy per nucleon. But since the problem mentions the nucleus\'s speed, which depends on the total energy (gamma times rest mass), then the total energy is gamma*mc². But the question is ambiguous. If they want the kinetic energy, it\'s (gamma -1)mc². If they want the total energy, it\'s gamma*mc².\n\nWait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". The energy provided by the collider to the nucleus would be the kinetic energy, since the rest mass energy is intrinsic. Therefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1)mc². So, 14,407.8467 MeV. Therefore, the answer is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14407.8467 MeV. However, considering significant figures, the given speed is 0.96c, which is two decimal places, but the problem specifies the precision to 1e-4, which is four decimal places, so we need to compute it to four decimal places regardless.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. Sometimes, in such problems, the rest mass is considered as the mass number times the atomic mass unit. For example, for ^6Li, the mass number is 6, so rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5,589 MeV. However, the actual mass of ^6Li is slightly higher because of the mass defect. Wait, no, the mass defect would make the actual mass less than the sum of individual nucleons. Wait, protons and neutrons combined would be 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5,633.511 MeV. However, the actual mass of ^6Li is 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5,603 MeV, which is less than 5,633.511 MeV, showing the mass defect (binding energy). So using the precise isotopic mass is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, using 6.015122 u for ^6Li, which gives 5603.0515 MeV as the rest mass energy. Therefore, the previous calculation of kinetic energy as 14,407.8467 MeV is accurate. Therefore, the answer is 14407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14407.8467 MeV. However, perhaps the problem expects the answer in scientific notation with four decimal places. For example, 1.44078467 × 10^4 MeV, which would be 1.4408 × 10^4 MeV when rounded to four decimal places. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, so four decimal places. Therefore, written as 14407.8467 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, if the unit is GeV, 14.4078467 GeV, which is 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. Given that RHIC energies are typically discussed in GeV per nucleon, but since the problem doesn\'t specify, both are possible. However, since the rest mass was calculated as ~5,603 MeV, which is ~5.6 GeV, the total kinetic energy is ~14.4 GeV, which is reasonable. Therefore, presenting the answer as 14.4078 GeV with four decimal places.\n\nBut to confirm, let me check the calculation once again:\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.\n\nRest mass energy = 6.015122 * 931.494 MeV ≈ 5603.0515 MeV.\n\nTotal energy = gamma * rest mass = 3.57142857 * 5603.0515 ≈ 20,010.8982 MeV.\n\nKinetic energy = Total - Rest = 20,010.8982 - 5,603.0515 = 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\nYes, so that\'s correct. Therefore, the kinetic energy required is 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8467 MeV. Alternatively, converting to GeV, 14.4078 GeV. However, given the problem\'s requirement for precision to 1e-4, which is 0.0001, and since 14,407.8467 MeV is already to four decimal places in MeV, the answer should be presented as 14407.8467 MeV. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 10^9 electron volts (GeV), so 14.4078 GeV. Either way, as long as the precision is maintained.\n\nHowever, considering that in accelerator physics, the energy is often given per nucleon, let me check once more. The nucleus has 6 nucleons. If the total kinetic energy is 14,407.8467 MeV, then per nucleon, it\'s 14,407.8467 / 6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon ≈ 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. If the problem expects the answer per nucleon, then the answer would be 2.4013 GeV/u with four decimal places. But the problem does not specify per nucleon, so this is speculative. Given the problem statement, it\'s safer to provide the total kinetic energy of the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, after thorough calculation and verification, the kinetic energy required for the Lithium-6 nucleus to reach 0.96c is 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that\'s 14,407.8467 MeV. However, in the context of RHIC, which typically refers to energies per nucleon, but since the problem mentions the nucleus\'s speed, which depends on the total energy, the answer is likely the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Hence, the final answer is \\boxed{14407.8467 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in GeV, it would be \\boxed{14.4078 \\text{ GeV}}. But since the rest mass was calculated in MeV and the precision is to four decimal places, MeV seems more appropriate. However, checking standard units used in RHIC: RHIC\'s beam energy is often stated in GeV per nucleon. For example, 100 GeV per nucleon for gold ions. If the problem follows this convention, then the answer would be per nucleon. However, since the problem does not specify, but given the way the question is phrased, I think the answer is the total kinetic energy. But given that ambiguity, it\'s possible the expected answer is per nucleon. Let me recalculate that.\n\nTotal kinetic energy: 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\nNumber of nucleons: 6.\n\nKinetic energy per nucleon: 14,407.8467 /6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon = 2.4013078 GeV/nucleon. Rounded to four decimal places, 2.4013 GeV/nucleon.\n\nBut the problem states "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". The speed of the nucleus depends on the total energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon. Therefore, the correct answer is the total kinetic energy. However, to cover all bases, perhaps I should present both. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, but given that speed is a property of the entire nucleus, the total kinetic energy is the answer. Therefore, I will stick with 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\nBut to ensure absolute correctness, let\'s check with another approach. The relationship between kinetic energy (K), rest mass (m0), and velocity (v) is given by:\n\nK = (gamma - 1)m0c²\n\nWe have gamma = 25/7, m0c² = 5603.0515 MeV\n\nThus, K = (25/7 - 1) * 5603.0515 = (18/7) * 5603.0515 ≈ (2.57142857) * 5603.0515 ≈ 14,407.8467 MeV. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV. The precision required is 1e-4, which is satisfied. Therefore, the box should contain this value with four decimal places in MeV. So, \\boxed{14407.8467 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nHowever, another possibility is that the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy (gamma*m0c²), which would be 20,010.8982 MeV, but considering that accelerators\' energy refers to the kinetic energy imparted, not the total energy, it\'s more likely kinetic energy. Hence, the final answer is 14,407.8467 MeV.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the RHIC is \\boxed{14407.8467 \\text{ MeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386529, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5780, prompt_tokens=650, total_tokens=6430, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for a Lithium-6 nucleus (composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons) to reach a speed of 0.96c, we need to use relativistic equations. 

1. **Rest Mass Calculation**:
   - The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.015122 atomic mass units (u).
   - Converting this to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     \text{Rest mass energy} = 6.015122 \times 931.494 \approx 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Lorentz Factor (Gamma)**:
   - The speed \(v = 0.96c\), so:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = \frac{25}{7} \approx 3.57142857
     \]

3. **Total Energy Calculation**:
   - Total energy \(E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \times \text{rest mass energy}\):
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \frac{25}{7} \times 5603.0515 \approx 20010.8982 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

4. **Kinetic Energy Calculation**:
   - Kinetic energy \(K = E_{\text{total}} - \text{rest mass energy}\):
     \[
     K = 20010.8982 \, \text{MeV} - 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14407.8467 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

The precision required is \(1 \times 10^{-4}\), which is satisfied by the calculation. Therefore, the energy of the RHIC required is:

\[
\boxed{14407.8467 \text{ MeV}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Let me verify the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.96c. Then, v²/c² = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. Multiplying that by the rest mass energy: 5603 MeV * 3.57142857. Let me compute that precisely. 5603 * 3.57142857.

Alternatively, to get more precise, perhaps I should use exact fractions. Since 0.96 is 24/25, so beta = 24/25. Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (24/25)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 576/625) = 1/sqrt(49/625) = 1/(7/25) = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is exactly 25/7. Therefore, the total energy is (25/7) * 5603 MeV. Let me compute that. 5603 divided by 7 is 800.4285714, multiplied by 25 equals 20,010.7142857 MeV. Then, the kinetic energy is 20,010.7142857 - 5603 = 14,407.7142857 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.7143 MeV. But perhaps the rest mass needs to be more precise.

Wait, the actual rest mass of ^6Li is 6.015122 atomic mass units (from the periodic table). Let me check that. If I use the exact value, 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u. Let's compute that. 6.015122 * 931.494. Let's do this step by step.

6 * 931.494 = 5,588.964

0.015122 * 931.494 ≈ 0.015122 * 900 ≈ 13.6098, and 0.015122 * 31.494 ≈ ~0.476. So total ~14.0858. So total rest mass energy ≈ 5,588.964 + 14.0858 ≈ 5,603.0498 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.05 MeV.

Therefore, using gamma = 25/7, the total energy is (25/7) * 5603.05 ≈ 25/7 * 5603.05. Let's compute 5603.05 / 7 = 800.4357142857. Then multiply by 25: 800.4357142857 * 25 = 20,010.8928571 MeV. Then subtract the rest mass: 20,010.8928571 - 5,603.05 = 14,407.8428571 MeV. So approximately 14,407.8429 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8429 MeV.

However, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like GeV. 14,407.8429 MeV is 14.4078429 GeV. But the question says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4," which would be 0.0001. However, the answer needs to be in what unit? The problem says "energy of RHIC" but doesn't specify, but given the context, it's likely in GeV or MeV. Since the rest mass is in the thousands of MeV, the answer is in the tens of thousands of MeV, so perhaps 14,407.8429 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV. But the problem says "precision of the energy is at 1e-4," which would be four decimal places. If in MeV, that's 14407.8429 MeV, so 14407.8429, which is 14407.8429 with four decimal places. However, perhaps the answer needs to be in units of energy per nucleon? Let's check.

The nucleus is ^6Li, which has 6 nucleons. If the total kinetic energy is 14,407.8429 MeV, then per nucleon, it's 14,407.8429 / 6 ≈ 2401.3071 MeV per nucleon. But the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so maybe the total kinetic energy is required. However, in collider physics, sometimes energies are given per nucleon. Wait, let me check.

Looking up RHIC's typical operations, heavy ions like gold are accelerated to energies of 100 GeV per nucleon. But the problem here is about Lithium-6. However, the question doesn't specify per nucleon. Let me re-read the question: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So, the energy here likely refers to the kinetic energy per nucleus. But sometimes, in accelerator physics, the energy is given as the total energy, but given that they mention speed, which relates to gamma, which relates to total energy. Wait, but the kinetic energy is what's required to accelerate it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the rest mass. Wait, but the problem statement says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So maybe we need to present the answer with four decimal places. In my calculation, the kinetic energy was approximately 14,407.8429 MeV. So 14407.8429 MeV. But perhaps it's better to present it as 14.4078 GeV. But the problem doesn't specify units. However, given that the rest mass is in MeV, and the answer is in the order of 10^4 MeV, using GeV would make it 14.4078 GeV. But maybe the answer is expected in MeV with four decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic. Let me check again. The problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". In accelerator physics, the "beam energy" can sometimes refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC is known to collide heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps total kinetic energy of the nucleus is required.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is in terms of the rest mass. Let me check the calculation again.

Given that gamma is 25/7, and rest mass energy is 5603.05 MeV, total energy is 25/7 * 5603.05 ≈ 20,010.89 MeV. So if the question is asking for total energy, it would be approximately 20,010.89 MeV, but if kinetic energy, then 14,407.84 MeV.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the kinetic energy per nucleon. Let's see. The nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). So if the total kinetic energy is 14,407.84 MeV, then per nucleon, it's 14,407.84 /6 ≈ 2401.307 MeV per nucleon. But again, the problem didn't specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is given in terms of the kinetic energy in Joules. But that's unlikely, as particle physics usually uses electron volts. The problem mentions precision to 1e-4, so four decimal places. Let me check the calculation again for any possible errors.

First, the rest mass of ^6Li. Let me confirm the exact mass. The atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.01512289 u. 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So rest mass energy is 6.01512289 * 931.49410242. Let's compute that.

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.96461452

Then, 0.01512289 * 931.49410242. Let's compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.00512289 * 931.49410242: 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.00012289 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0001 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0931494 + 0.00002289 * 931.494 ≈ 0.0213

So total for 0.01512289: 9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 = 13.9724115363 + 0.0931494 + 0.0213 ≈ 14.0868609 MeV

Total rest mass energy: 5,588.96461452 + 14.0868609 ≈ 5,603.05147542 MeV/c². So approximately 5603.0515 MeV. Therefore, more precisely, gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714.

Total energy: 5603.0515 * 25/7 = 5603.0515 * 3.5714285714 ≈ Let's compute 5603.0515 * 3.5714285714.

First, 5603.0515 * 3 = 16,809.1545

5603.0515 * 0.5714285714 = 5603.0515 * (4/7) ≈ 5603.0515 / 7 = 800.4359286, then multiplied by 4 = 3,201.743714

So total energy ≈ 16,809.1545 + 3,201.743714 ≈ 20,010.8982 MeV

Thus, kinetic energy is 20,010.8982 - 5,603.0515 ≈ 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8467 MeV.

But let me check with exact fractions. Let me compute 5603.0515 * 25 /7:

First, 5603.0515 ÷ 7 = 800.435928571428...

800.435928571428... * 25 = 20,010.8982142857...

Subtract rest mass: 20,010.8982142857... - 5,603.0515 = 14,407.8467142857...

So, 14,407.8467 MeV when rounded to four decimal places. So 14,407.8467 MeV.

Alternatively, if expressed in GeV, that's 14.4078 GeV. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which would mean four decimal places. If we present it in GeV, 14.4078 GeV (four decimal places). But if in MeV, 14407.8467 MeV, which is 14407.8467 with four decimal places. However, the problem might expect the answer in a specific unit. Since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, perhaps the answer should be in MeV. However, sometimes in accelerator physics, energies are given per nucleon. Let me check if that's the case here.

The problem states "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". RHIC accelerates ions to certain energies, typically quoted as per nucleon in units of GeV/nucleon. For example, gold ions at RHIC are accelerated to 100 GeV per nucleon. So perhaps here, the energy per nucleon is required. Let me check.

If the total kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV for a ^6Li nucleus (6 nucleons), then the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.8467 /6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon, which is approximately 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. However, the problem does not specify per nucleon. The question is ambiguous, but given that it's about the entire nucleus's speed, maybe the total kinetic energy is required. But in practice, collider energies are often given per nucleon. Let me see if there's a way to confirm.

Looking up RHIC's parameters, for example, gold ions (Au) are accelerated to 100 GeV per nucleon, resulting in a total energy per nucleus of 197 * 100 GeV = 19.7 TeV. However, this is total energy, but wait, actually, the 100 GeV is the kinetic energy per nucleon. Wait, no, in reality, the energy in accelerators is often given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. So if the problem is following that convention, then it would be 2.4013 GeV/u.

But since the problem doesn't specify, but asks for "the energy of RHIC", which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the way the question is phrased, and the fact that they mention the speed of the nucleus, which depends on the total energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon. Therefore, I think the answer is the total kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV, or 14.4078 GeV. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy in terms of the rest mass energy. For instance, in units of Mc², but the question doesn't specify. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the answer in joules or another unit, but given the context of particle physics, MeV or GeV is standard.

Wait, but the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". If the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV, then written as 14407.8467 MeV, the precision is to four decimal places (0.0001 MeV), which is 0.1 keV. That seems excessively precise, given that rest mass calculations are precise only to a few keV. However, given the problem statement requires it, we can present it as such.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy (not just kinetic), which would be 20,010.8982 MeV, or 20.0109 GeV. But the question says "energy of RHIC", and typically, the kinetic energy is what's relevant for accelerators, as the rest mass energy is inherent to the particle. Therefore, the answer is likely the kinetic energy.

Thus, after careful calculation, the kinetic energy required is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8467 MeV. However, converting to GeV for simplicity, it's 14.4078 GeV. But given the problem's precision requirement, we need to ensure four decimal places in the final answer's unit. If the answer is in MeV, then 14407.8467 MeV. If in GeV, 14.4078 GeV. But since the rest mass was calculated in MeV, perhaps MeV is the appropriate unit.

Alternatively, maybe the question wants the answer in terms of the total energy. Let me check again. If the problem states "energy of RHIC", which accelerates particles to a certain energy. In accelerator physics, sometimes "energy" refers to the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV of energy, which is kinetic energy. However, for heavy ions, they often use kinetic energy per nucleon. But since the problem mentions the nucleus's speed, which depends on the total energy (gamma times rest mass), then the total energy is gamma*mc². But the question is ambiguous. If they want the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1)mc². If they want the total energy, it's gamma*mc².

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". The energy provided by the collider to the nucleus would be the kinetic energy, since the rest mass energy is intrinsic. Therefore, the answer should be the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1)mc². So, 14,407.8467 MeV. Therefore, the answer is approximately 14,407.8467 MeV, which to four decimal places is 14407.8467 MeV. However, considering significant figures, the given speed is 0.96c, which is two decimal places, but the problem specifies the precision to 1e-4, which is four decimal places, so we need to compute it to four decimal places regardless.

But let me check if there's another approach. Sometimes, in such problems, the rest mass is considered as the mass number times the atomic mass unit. For example, for ^6Li, the mass number is 6, so rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5,589 MeV. However, the actual mass of ^6Li is slightly higher because of the mass defect. Wait, no, the mass defect would make the actual mass less than the sum of individual nucleons. Wait, protons and neutrons combined would be 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5,633.511 MeV. However, the actual mass of ^6Li is 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5,603 MeV, which is less than 5,633.511 MeV, showing the mass defect (binding energy). So using the precise isotopic mass is more accurate.

Therefore, using 6.015122 u for ^6Li, which gives 5603.0515 MeV as the rest mass energy. Therefore, the previous calculation of kinetic energy as 14,407.8467 MeV is accurate. Therefore, the answer is 14407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14407.8467 MeV. However, perhaps the problem expects the answer in scientific notation with four decimal places. For example, 1.44078467 × 10^4 MeV, which would be 1.4408 × 10^4 MeV when rounded to four decimal places. But the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, so four decimal places. Therefore, written as 14407.8467 MeV.

Alternatively, if the unit is GeV, 14.4078467 GeV, which is 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. Given that RHIC energies are typically discussed in GeV per nucleon, but since the problem doesn't specify, both are possible. However, since the rest mass was calculated as ~5,603 MeV, which is ~5.6 GeV, the total kinetic energy is ~14.4 GeV, which is reasonable. Therefore, presenting the answer as 14.4078 GeV with four decimal places.

But to confirm, let me check the calculation once again:

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Rest mass energy = 6.015122 * 931.494 MeV ≈ 5603.0515 MeV.

Total energy = gamma * rest mass = 3.57142857 * 5603.0515 ≈ 20,010.8982 MeV.

Kinetic energy = Total - Rest = 20,010.8982 - 5,603.0515 = 14,407.8467 MeV.

Yes, so that's correct. Therefore, the kinetic energy required is 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 14,407.8467 MeV. Alternatively, converting to GeV, 14.4078 GeV. However, given the problem's requirement for precision to 1e-4, which is 0.0001, and since 14,407.8467 MeV is already to four decimal places in MeV, the answer should be presented as 14407.8467 MeV. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 10^9 electron volts (GeV), so 14.4078 GeV. Either way, as long as the precision is maintained.

However, considering that in accelerator physics, the energy is often given per nucleon, let me check once more. The nucleus has 6 nucleons. If the total kinetic energy is 14,407.8467 MeV, then per nucleon, it's 14,407.8467 / 6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon ≈ 2.4013 GeV/nucleon. If the problem expects the answer per nucleon, then the answer would be 2.4013 GeV/u with four decimal places. But the problem does not specify per nucleon, so this is speculative. Given the problem statement, it's safer to provide the total kinetic energy of the nucleus.

Therefore, after thorough calculation and verification, the kinetic energy required for the Lithium-6 nucleus to reach 0.96c is 14,407.8467 MeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 14,407.8467 MeV. However, in the context of RHIC, which typically refers to energies per nucleon, but since the problem mentions the nucleus's speed, which depends on the total energy, the answer is likely the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Hence, the final answer is \boxed{14407.8467 \text{ MeV}}.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in GeV, it would be \boxed{14.4078 \text{ GeV}}. But since the rest mass was calculated in MeV and the precision is to four decimal places, MeV seems more appropriate. However, checking standard units used in RHIC: RHIC's beam energy is often stated in GeV per nucleon. For example, 100 GeV per nucleon for gold ions. If the problem follows this convention, then the answer would be per nucleon. However, since the problem does not specify, but given the way the question is phrased, I think the answer is the total kinetic energy. But given that ambiguity, it's possible the expected answer is per nucleon. Let me recalculate that.

Total kinetic energy: 14,407.8467 MeV.

Number of nucleons: 6.

Kinetic energy per nucleon: 14,407.8467 /6 ≈ 2401.3078 MeV/nucleon = 2.4013078 GeV/nucleon. Rounded to four decimal places, 2.4013 GeV/nucleon.

But the problem states "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". The speed of the nucleus depends on the total energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon. Therefore, the correct answer is the total kinetic energy. However, to cover all bases, perhaps I should present both. But since the problem doesn't specify, but given that speed is a property of the entire nucleus, the total kinetic energy is the answer. Therefore, I will stick with 14,407.8467 MeV.

But to ensure absolute correctness, let's check with another approach. The relationship between kinetic energy (K), rest mass (m0), and velocity (v) is given by:

K = (gamma - 1)m0c²

We have gamma = 25/7, m0c² = 5603.0515 MeV

Thus, K = (25/7 - 1) * 5603.0515 = (18/7) * 5603.0515 ≈ (2.57142857) * 5603.0515 ≈ 14,407.8467 MeV. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV. The precision required is 1e-4, which is satisfied. Therefore, the box should contain this value with four decimal places in MeV. So, \boxed{14407.8467 \text{ MeV}}.

However, another possibility is that the problem expects the answer in terms of the total energy (gamma*m0c²), which would be 20,010.8982 MeV, but considering that accelerators' energy refers to the kinetic energy imparted, not the total energy, it's more likely kinetic energy. Hence, the final answer is 14,407.8467 MeV.


**Final Answer**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14407.8467 \text{ MeV}}.
