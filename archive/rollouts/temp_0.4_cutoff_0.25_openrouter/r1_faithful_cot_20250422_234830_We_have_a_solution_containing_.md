To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by considering the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

1. **Assumption of Free Ligand Concentration**:
   - The problem states the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. Square brackets typically denote equilibrium (free) concentration, so we assume [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

2. **Expressing Complex Concentrations**:
   - Let \([Co^{2+}] = x\).
   - Using the stability constants, the concentrations of the complexes are:
     - \([Co(SCN)^+] = \beta_1 x [SCN⁻] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x\)
     - \([Co(SCN)_2] = \beta_2 x [SCN⁻]^2 = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x\)
     - \([Co(SCN)_3^-] = \beta_3 x [SCN⁻]^3 = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x\)
     - \([Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 x [SCN⁻]^4 = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x\)

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   - Summing all cobalt species:
     \[
     x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 2.3646x
     \]
   - Given \(2.3646x = 10^{-2}\) M, solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \text{ M}
     \]

4. **Concentration of Co(SCN)₂**:
   - \([Co(SCN)_2] = 0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 0.00423 \approx 0.001692 \text{ M}\)

5. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species:
     \[
     \left( \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
     \]

6. **Considering Total SCN⁻ Concentration**:
   - If the problem intended total SCN⁻ to be 0.1 M, iterative calculations show the percentage is approximately 15.4%. However, given the problem's context and typical conventions, the free ligand concentration assumption is more likely intended.

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is \(\boxed{17\%}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me start by recalling what the problem says. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. 

First, I need to remember what stability constants mean. Stability constants (β) are equilibrium constants for the formation of complex ions in solution. For a metal ion M and a ligand L, the formation of the complex ML_n can be represented by the equation:

M + nL ↔ ML_n

The stability constant β_n is given by:

β_n = [ML_n] / ([M][L]^n)

So β1 corresponds to the formation of ML, β2 to ML2, and so on. In this case, the metal is Co(II) and the ligand is SCN-. The complexes formed would be Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄^2- with the given β values. The problem specifically asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species. So:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 10^-2 M

The thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M. However, since SCN- is a ligand that complexes with Co^2+, the free ligand concentration [SCN-] will be less than 0.1 M because some is consumed in forming the complexes. But wait, the problem states that the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. Hmm, maybe that's the free concentration? Or is it the total concentration? This is a critical point. If the problem says the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M, it might refer to the free SCN- concentration. But usually, when they give a total concentration, they specify it as total. Let me check the problem statement again.

"The [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But in such problems, if they mention the concentration of the ligand without specifying, sometimes it's the total concentration. However, given that stability constants are defined in terms of free ligand concentration, maybe the 0.1 M is the free ligand concentration. Wait, but if that's the case, then we can proceed directly. Let me think.

If [SCN-] is 0.1 M, then each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration. Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 * x

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063 * x

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 * x

Then, the total cobalt concentration is:

x + 9*0.1*x + 0.4*x + 0.063*x + 0.0016*x = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*(2.3646) = 0.01 M

So solving for x:

x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * x ≈ 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.001692 M

The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, which is approximately 17%.

Wait, but let's check if [SCN-] is indeed 0.1 M as free ligand. If the problem states that the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, then this approach is incorrect. Because in that case, the free SCN- would be less, as some is bound in the complexes. So we need to clarify this.

But the problem states: "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote the equilibrium concentration, so free SCN- is 0.1 M. Therefore, the approach above is correct.

Alternatively, if the total SCN- was 0.1 M, then we would have to account for all the SCN- in the complexes. Let's check that possibility just to be sure.

Suppose [SCN-]_total = 0.1 M = [SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄^2-]

But in that case, we'd have a system of equations where both the total Co and total SCN- are known. But since the problem states [SCN-] is 0.1 M, not the total, it's more likely that [SCN-] is the free ligand concentration. Therefore, proceeding with the initial approach is valid.

So, following through:

Total Co species sum up to 0.01 M, which gives x ≈ 0.00423 M. Then, the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ is 0.4 * x ≈ 0.001692 M. The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, so approximately 17%.

But let me check the calculations again for accuracy.

First, compute the coefficients:

β1*[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*[SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3*[SCN-]^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4*[SCN-]^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum of all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So total Co = x * 2.3646 = 0.01 M → x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.0000423 = 0.001692 M

Percentage: (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%

So approximately 16.9%, which is roughly 17%. But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me do the division more precisely.

0.01 / 2.3646 = ?

Let's compute 2.3646 goes into 0.01.

First, 2.3646 * 0.004 = 0.0094584

Subtract from 0.01: 0.01 - 0.0094584 = 0.0005416

Now, 2.3646 * 0.0002 = 0.00047292

Subtract: 0.0005416 - 0.00047292 = 0.00006868

So total x ≈ 0.004 + 0.0002 = 0.0042, with a small remainder. So approximately 0.00423.

Thus, [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.001692

0.001692 / 0.01 = 0.1692 → 16.92%

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%. Depending on the required precision, maybe 17%. But let's check if the stability constants are given with specific significant figures. The β values are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. These are all two significant figures except β1=9 (one sig fig). But maybe in the context of the problem, they are considered exact. However, since the answer is expected to be a percentage, perhaps rounded to two significant figures, so 17%.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16.9%. Let's check the exact calculation.

But let's compute 0.01 / 2.3646 exactly.

2.3646 = 23646/10000

So 0.01 / (23646/10000) = 0.01 * 10000 / 23646 = 100 / 23646 ≈ 0.00423

Yes, so x ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * (0.1)^2 * x = 40 * 0.01 * 0.00423 = 0.001692

Total Co is 0.01, so 0.001692 / 0.01 = 0.1692 → 16.92%

So the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, depending on the problem's expectation, maybe we need to keep two decimal places. But given the input data, β has one or two significant figures, so the answer should have two significant figures. So 17%.

But wait, β1 is 9 (one sig fig), β2 is 40 (two sig figs), β3=63 (two), β4=16 (two). The concentrations are given as 10^-2 and 0.1 (which is two sig figs). So the least number of sig figs is one (from β1=9). But that complicates things. However, maybe in the context of the problem, all βs are considered exact, so we can keep three sig figs in the answer. So 16.9%.

But the problem asks for the percentage, so maybe the answer is 17%.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming [SCN-] is 0.1 M free. Let's consider if [SCN-] is total.

If [SCN-]_total = 0.1 M, then:

[SCN-] = 0.1 - [Co(SCN)^+] - 2[Co(SCN)₂] - 3[Co(SCN)₃^-] - 4[Co(SCN)₄^2-]

But this complicates the system because [SCN-] is part of the equation. This would require solving a system of equations. Let's see.

Let me denote:

Let [Co^2+] = x

Then,

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 x [SCN-] = 9x[SCN-]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN-]^2 =40x[SCN-]^2

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β3 x [SCN-]^3 =63x[SCN-]^3

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 x [SCN-]^4 =16x[SCN-]^4

Total Co: x + 9x[SCN-] +40x[SCN-]^2 +63x[SCN-]^3 +16x[SCN-]^4 =0.01

Total SCN-: [SCN-] +9x[SCN-] +2*40x[SCN-]^2 +3*63x[SCN-]^3 +4*16x[SCN-]^4 =0.1

So two equations with two variables x and [SCN-]. This system is nonlinear and might be challenging to solve analytically. However, given that the previous assumption gives a reasonable answer, and the problem states "[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M", which is more likely to be the free concentration, the first approach is valid. But to confirm, let's see if assuming free [SCN-]=0.1 M and getting [SCN-]_total =0.1 + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃^-] +4[Co(SCN)₄^2-]

From the first calculation:

[Co(SCN)^+] =9*0.00423*0.1=0.003807 M

[Co(SCN)₂]=0.001692 M

[Co(SCN)₃^-]=63*0.00423*(0.1)^3=63*0.00423*0.001=0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)₄^2-]=16*0.00423*(0.1)^4=16*0.00423*0.0001=0.00000677 M

Total SCN- in complexes:

1*0.003807 +2*0.001692 +3*0.000266 +4*0.00000677 ≈0.003807 +0.003384 +0.000798 +0.000027 ≈0.008016 M

Then total SCN- would be 0.1 (free) +0.008016 (complexed)=0.108016 M, which is higher than the given 0.1 M. This contradicts the problem statement if [SCN-] is total. Therefore, my initial assumption that [SCN-]=0.1 M is free is incorrect. So the problem must have meant that the total SCN- is 0.1 M. Therefore, I need to set up the equations accordingly.

This complicates things. So now, we need to solve the system where:

Total Co: x + 9x[L] +40x[L]^2 +63x[L]^3 +16x[L]^4 =0.01

Total SCN-: [L] +9x[L] +80x[L]^2 +189x[L]^3 +64x[L]^4 =0.1

Where [L] is the free SCN- concentration.

This is a system of nonlinear equations. Solving this requires some numerical methods. Let's denote:

Equation 1: x*(1 +9[L] +40[L]^2 +63[L]^3 +16[L]^4) =0.01

Equation 2: [L] +x*(9[L] +80[L]^2 +189[L]^3 +64[L]^4) =0.1

This is quite complex. Maybe we can make an assumption that [L] is approximately 0.1 M, given that the total SCN- is 0.1 M and the complexes may not consume too much. Let's test this.

Assume [L] ≈0.1 M. Then from equation 1:

x*(1 +0.9 +4 +6.3 +0.16) =x*(12.36)=0.01 →x≈0.01/12.36≈0.000809 M

Then compute total SCN- from equation 2:

[L] +x*(9[L] +80[L]^2 +189[L]^3 +64[L]^4)

=0.1 +0.000809*(0.9 +8 +18.9 +6.4)

=0.1 +0.000809*(34.2)

≈0.1 +0.0277≈0.1277 M

But total SCN- should be 0.1 M, so our assumption that [L]=0.1 leads to a total SCN- of 0.1277, which is too high. Therefore, the free [L] must be less than 0.1 M.

This suggests that the initial approach overestimates the free [L], so the actual free [L] is lower, which would decrease the concentrations of the complexes, but since total SCN- is fixed, it's a balance.

This is getting complicated. Maybe we can use an iterative approach. Let's make an initial guess for [L], compute x from equation 1, then check equation 2, adjust [L], and repeat.

Let's start with [L]=0.08 M.

From equation 1:

x*(1 +9*0.08 +40*(0.08)^2 +63*(0.08)^3 +16*(0.08)^4)

Compute each term:

9*0.08=0.72

40*(0.0064)=0.256

63*(0.000512)=0.032256

16*(0.00004096)=0.00065536

Sum:1 +0.72 +0.256 +0.032256 +0.000655≈1 +0.72=1.72 +0.256=1.976 +0.032256=2.008256 +0.000655≈2.0089

So x=0.01 /2.0089≈0.004978 M

Now compute equation 2:

[L] +x*(9[L] +80[L]^2 +189[L]^3 +64[L]^4)

=0.08 +0.004978*(9*0.08 +80*(0.08)^2 +189*(0.08)^3 +64*(0.08)^4)

Calculate inside the brackets:

9*0.08=0.72

80*0.0064=0.512

189*0.000512≈0.096768

64*0.00004096≈0.00262144

Sum:0.72 +0.512=1.232 +0.096768=1.328768 +0.002621≈1.331389

Multiply by x:0.004978 *1.331389≈0.006623

Add to [L]:0.08 +0.006623≈0.086623 M

But total SCN- should be 0.1 M, so 0.0866 is less than 0.1. Therefore, our guess of [L]=0.08 gives total SCN-≈0.0866. We need to increase [L] to get closer to 0.1.

Let's try [L]=0.09 M.

From equation 1:

x*(1 +9*0.09 +40*(0.09)^2 +63*(0.09)^3 +16*(0.09)^4)

Calculate terms:

9*0.09=0.81

40*0.0081=0.324

63*(0.000729)=0.045927

16*(0.0006561)=0.0104976

Sum:1 +0.81=1.81 +0.324=2.134 +0.045927≈2.1799 +0.0104976≈2.1904

x=0.01/2.1904≈0.004565 M

Equation 2:

[L] +x*(9*0.09 +80*(0.09)^2 +189*(0.09)^3 +64*(0.09)^4)

=0.09 +0.004565*(0.81 +80*0.0081 +189*0.000729 +64*0.0006561)

Compute inside:

80*0.0081=0.648

189*0.000729≈0.137781

64*0.0006561≈0.04199

Sum:0.81 +0.648=1.458 +0.137781≈1.5958 +0.04199≈1.63779

Multiply by x:0.004565*1.63779≈0.007475

Total SCN-:0.09 +0.007475≈0.097475≈0.0975 M

Still less than 0.1. Need to increase [L] a bit more.

Try [L]=0.095 M.

Equation 1:

x*(1 +9*0.095 +40*(0.095)^2 +63*(0.095)^3 +16*(0.095)^4)

Compute:

9*0.095=0.855

40*(0.009025)=0.361

63*(0.095)^3=63*(0.0008574)=0.0540162

16*(0.095)^4=16*(0.0008145)=0.013032

Sum:1 +0.855=1.855 +0.361=2.216 +0.0540162≈2.270 +0.013032≈2.283

x=0.01/2.283≈0.00438 M

Equation 2:

[L] +x*(9*0.095 +80*(0.095)^2 +189*(0.095)^3 +64*(0.095)^4)

=0.095 +0.00438*(0.855 +80*0.009025 +189*0.0008574 +64*0.0008145)

Compute inside:

80*0.009025=0.722

189*0.0008574≈0.162

64*0.0008145≈0.0521

Sum:0.855 +0.722=1.577 +0.162=1.739 +0.0521≈1.7911

Multiply by x:0.00438*1.7911≈0.00784

Total SCN-:0.095 +0.00784≈0.10284 M

Close to 0.1, but slightly over. So between [L]=0.09 and 0.095, total SCN- goes from ~0.0975 to ~0.1028. We need to find [L] where total SCN-≈0.1.

Let's interpolate.

At [L]=0.09, total SCN-=0.0975

At [L]=0.095, total SCN-=0.1028

We need total SCN-=0.1. The difference between 0.0975 and 0.1028 is 0.0053 over an [L] increase of 0.005. We need to cover 0.1 -0.0975=0.0025.

So fraction=0.0025/0.0053≈0.4717

So [L]=0.09 +0.4717*0.005≈0.09 +0.00236=0.09236 M

Test [L]=0.09236 M.

Equation 1:

x*(1 +9*0.09236 +40*(0.09236)^2 +63*(0.09236)^3 +16*(0.09236)^4)

Compute each term:

9*0.09236≈0.8312

40*(0.09236)^2≈40*(0.00853)≈0.3412

63*(0.09236)^3≈63*(0.000787)≈0.0496

16*(0.09236)^4≈16*(0.0000727)≈0.001163

Sum:1 +0.8312=1.8312 +0.3412=2.1724 +0.0496≈2.222 +0.001163≈2.22316

x=0.01/2.22316≈0.004498 M

Equation 2:

[L] +x*(9*0.09236 +80*(0.09236)^2 +189*(0.09236)^3 +64*(0.09236)^4)

Calculate inside:

9*0.09236≈0.8312

80*(0.09236)^2≈80*0.00853≈0.6824

189*(0.09236)^3≈189*0.000787≈0.1487

64*(0.09236)^4≈64*0.0000727≈0.00465

Sum:0.8312 +0.6824=1.5136 +0.1487≈1.6623 +0.00465≈1.66695

Multiply by x:0.004498*1.66695≈0.0075

Total SCN-:0.09236 +0.0075≈0.09986 M≈0.0999 M≈0.1 M

Close enough. So [L]≈0.09236 M and x≈0.004498 M.

Now, compute the concentration of Co(SCN)₂:

β2*x*[L]^2=40*0.004498*(0.09236)^2

First compute (0.09236)^2≈0.00853

Then 40*0.004498=0.1799

Multiply by 0.00853≈0.1799*0.00853≈0.001535 M

Total Co species is 0.01 M, so percentage is (0.001535 /0.01)*100=15.35%

So approximately 15.4%.

But wait, this contradicts the previous result. So depending on whether [SCN-] is free or total, the answer differs significantly. The problem statement says "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote equilibrium concentration, i.e., free SCN-. However, when we assumed that, the total SCN- turned out to be higher than 0.1, which isn't possible if the total is supposed to be 0.1. Therefore, the problem must mean that the total SCN- is 0.1 M, and we have to solve the system properly, leading to approximately 15.4%.

But this requires solving the system numerically, which is more complex. However, given that the problem is likely intended to be solved with the assumption that [SCN-] is free at 0.1 M (even though that leads to a higher total), but considering the answer options or context, maybe the first approach is expected. However, strictly speaking, if the problem states the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, and given that square brackets denote equilibrium concentrations, then the first approach is correct. But in reality, if the total SCN- is 0.1 M, the answer is different.

This is a significant ambiguity in the problem statement. To resolve it, perhaps we should consider standard conventions. In coordination chemistry problems, when the ligand concentration is given without specifying, it's usually the excess ligand concentration, meaning that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total because the complexes consume negligible ligand. However, in this case, with Co concentration 0.01 M and SCN- 0.1 M, the ligand is in excess (10 times Co), but the complexes might consume a non-negligible amount.

Wait, total SCN- consumed by complexes would be:

For each complex:

Co(SCN)^+ has 1 SCN per Co, so 0.01 M * (fraction of Co in Co(SCN)^+) *1

Similarly, Co(SCN)₂: 2 SCN per Co, etc.

But if the total Co is 0.01 M and SCN- is 0.1 M, the maximum SCN- consumed if all Co were in Co(SCN)₄^2- would be 4*0.01=0.04 M, leaving [SCN-]=0.06 M. But since the stability constants are not extremely large, the actual consumption would be less. Therefore, the free [SCN-] is not negligible compared to total.

But given the problem's wording, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many textbooks, when they provide the ligand concentration in such a context, they often mean the free ligand concentration, especially when using square brackets. Therefore, the first approach is valid, giving approximately 16.9%.

But the correct answer requires knowing whether [SCN-] is free or total. Since the problem says "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M", using square brackets, which typically denote equilibrium concentration, i.e., free, so the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, when I considered total SCN-=0.1, the answer was approximately 15.4%.

This is a critical point. To determine which is correct, perhaps we can look at typical problem setups. In problems where stability constants are given, and ligand concentration is provided without specifying total or free, it's usually the free ligand concentration. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 16.9%, rounding to 17%.

But given that in reality, if you add SCN- to a solution with Co, the total SCN- would be free plus complexed, so the problem should specify. However, since it's a textbook-style problem, they likely intended [SCN-] to be the free ligand. Hence, the first calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 17%.

But to be thorough, let's check one more iteration in the total SCN- case to see if we can get closer.

Previous iteration at [L]=0.09236 gave total SCN-≈0.09986, very close to 0.1. The concentration of Co(SCN)₂ was 0.001535 M, which is 15.35%.

If we do another iteration with [L]=0.0925 M:

Equation 1:

x*(1 +9*0.0925 +40*(0.0925)^2 +63*(0.0925)^3 +16*(0.0925)^4)

Calculate:

9*0.0925=0.8325

40*(0.008556)=0.34224

63*(0.0925)^3≈63*(0.000791)=0.049833

16*(0.0925)^4≈16*(0.0000731)=0.00117

Sum:1 +0.8325=1.8325 +0.34224=2.1747 +0.049833≈2.2245 +0.00117≈2.2257

x=0.01/2.2257≈0.004493 M

Equation 2:

[L] +x*(9*0.0925 +80*(0.0925)^2 +189*(0.0925)^3 +64*(0.0925)^4)

Compute inside:

9*0.0925=0.8325

80*(0.008556)=0.6845

189*(0.000791)=0.1495

64*(0.0000731)=0.00468

Sum:0.8325 +0.6845=1.517 +0.1495=1.6665 +0.00468≈1.67118

Multiply by x:0.004493*1.67118≈0.0075

Total SCN-:0.0925 +0.0075≈0.1000 M

Perfect. So [L]=0.0925 M gives total SCN-=0.1 M.

Then, x=0.004493 M

[Co(SCN)₂]=β2*x*[L]^2=40*0.004493*(0.0925)^2

Calculate (0.0925)^2=0.008556

40*0.004493=0.17972

0.17972*0.008556≈0.001537 M

Percentage:0.001537/0.01*100=15.37%

So approximately 15.4%.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 15.4% if [SCN-] is total, and 16.9% if [SCN-] is free. Given the problem statement's ambiguity, but considering standard notation where [SCN-] denotes free concentration, it's a dilemma. However, the fact that when assuming [SCN-] is free leads to a total SCN- of ~0.108 M, which contradicts the given total of 0.1 M, suggests that the problem intended [SCN-] to be total. Therefore, the correct approach is the second one, leading to approximately 15.4%.

But I need to reconcile this with the problem statement. The problem says, "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". If that's the total concentration, then we have to do the more complex calculation. If it's the free, then the answer is higher. Since the problem might be designed for the first approach, but in reality, the correct approach requires the second.

Given that this is a chemistry problem, and in such contexts, if they give the concentration of a ligand without specifying, it's often the total concentration, especially if the problem involves calculating species distribution. Wait, no, actually, in stability constant calculations, the ligand concentration in the formulas is the free concentration. Therefore, if they say the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, they probably mean the free concentration. However, in practice, adding 0.1 M SCN- to the solution would make the total SCN- higher due to the complexes. But maybe in this problem, they're assuming that the amount of SCN- consumed by complexation is negligible, so [SCN-] ≈0.1 M. Let's check.

If Co is 0.01 M and SCN- is 0.1 M, even if all Co were in the highest complex (Co(SCN)₄^2-), which consumes 4 SCN- per Co, that would be 4*0.01=0.04 M SCN- consumed. So free SCN- would be 0.1 -0.04=0.06 M. But since the stability constants are not extremely large, the actual consumption is less. However, in the first approach where we assume [SCN-]=0.1, the total SCN- would be 0.1 + complexed SCN- (which we calculated as ~0.008 M), totaling ~0.108 M. Therefore, if the problem states that the total SCN- is 0.1 M, but we've calculated that assuming free [SCN-]=0.1 leads to total SCN-=0.108, which is inconsistent. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that [SCN-] is total, and we need to solve the system.

But solving the system gives [Co(SCN)₂]≈15.4%. However, this requires iterative calculation which might be beyond the intended scope. Maybe the problem expects the first approach, assuming [SCN-]=0.1 M free, leading to ~17%.

Given that this is likely an undergraduate problem, they might expect the first approach. However, to confirm, let's look at typical problems. For example, in the case where ligand is in excess, free ligand ≈ total ligand. Here, SCN- is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, so ligand is in tenfold excess. Even if all Co forms complexes with 4 SCN-, that's 0.04 M SCN- consumed, leaving 0.06 M free. But if the stability constants are such that the complexes are not fully formed, the free SCN- would be higher. For example, with the given β values, the formation of higher complexes is not favored because β4=16 is less than β3=63. Wait, the stability constants are cumulative, so β4 is for the formation of ML4 from M and 4L. The stepwise constants would be β1=9, β2=40/9≈4.44, β3=63/40≈1.575, β4=16/63≈0.254. So the formation of ML3 and ML4 is less favored than ML2. Therefore, the dominant complexes might be ML and ML2.

Given that, the consumption of SCN- would be:

For 0.01 M Co, assuming mostly ML and ML2:

Suppose majority is ML2: each Co consumes 2 SCN-, so total SCN- consumed=0.01*2=0.02 M, leaving [SCN-]=0.1-0.02=0.08 M. But this is a rough estimate. However, if we proceed with the initial assumption that [SCN-]=0.1 M, the error introduced might not be too large. But in reality, [SCN-] is less, so the actual concentration of the complexes would be lower.

But given the problem's ambiguity and the typical convention, I think the answer expected is 17%, using the first approach. However, strictly speaking, considering total SCN-=0.1 M, the correct answer is approximately 15.4%.

But since the problem might not expect iterative calculations, and given that β4 is small, maybe the higher complexes can be neglected. Let's try neglecting ML3 and ML4.

Assume only ML and ML2 are present.

Total Co: x +9x[L] +40x[L]^2=0.01

Total SCN-: [L] +9x[L] +2*40x[L]^2=0.1

Let [L]=0.1 M (free). Then:

Total Co: x*(1 +0.9 +4)=x*5.9=0.01→x≈0.01/5.9≈0.001695 M

[ML]=9x[L]=9*0.001695*0.1=0.0015255 M

[ML2]=40x[L]^2=40*0.001695*0.01=0.000678 M

Total Co:0.001695+0.0015255+0.000678≈0.0038985 M, which is less than 0.01. Wait, this doesn't make sense. Wait, no—if we assume [L]=0.1, then x=0.01/5.9≈0.001695, but then total Co would be x*(1 +0.9 +4)=0.001695*5.9≈0.01, which is correct.

But total SCN- would be [L] +9x[L] +80x[L]^2=0.1 +0.001695*0.9 +0.001695*0.8=0.1 +0.0015255 +0.001356≈0.10288 M

But the problem states total SCN-=0.1, so this is inconsistent. Therefore, even neglecting higher complexes, we still have to solve the system.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the concentration of SCN- is so large compared to Co that [SCN-] ≈0.1 M, and the complexes do not significantly affect it. This is a common approximation when the ligand is in large excess.

Given that SCN- is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, a tenfold excess. If the stability constants are such that even with some complexation, the free SCN- remains approximately 0.1 M, then the first approach is valid. Let's see.

If we assume [SCN-]=0.1 M, then:

Total Co species sum to 0.01 M, with x=0.01 / (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)=0.01/2.3646≈0.00423 M

Then, [ML2]=0.4x≈0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of total Co.

The total SCN- consumed would be:

[ML] +2[ML2] +3[ML3] +4[ML4] =0.9x +2*0.4x +3*0.063x +4*0.0016x= (0.9 +0.8 +0.189 +0.0064)x=1.8954x≈1.8954*0.00423≈0.00802 M

Therefore, total SCN-=0.1 (free) +0.00802≈0.10802 M. If the problem allows this approximation (ignoring the 8% excess), considering that the ligand is in excess, they might accept 17% as the answer.

In many educational problems, such approximations are acceptable when the ligand is in excess, even if technically the total ligand concentration is higher. Therefore, the intended answer is likely 17%.


**Final Answer**
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{17\%}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me start by recalling what the problem says. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. 

First, I need to remember what stability constants mean. Stability constants (β) are equilibrium constants for the formation of complex ions in solution. For a metal ion M and a ligand L, the formation of the complex ML_n can be represented by the equation:

M + nL ↔ ML_n

The stability constant β_n is given by:

β_n = [ML_n] / ([M][L]^n)

So β1 corresponds to the formation of ML, β2 to ML2, and so on. In this case, the metal is Co(II) and the ligand is SCN-. The complexes formed would be Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄^2- with the given β values. The problem specifically asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species. So:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 10^-2 M

The thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M. However, since SCN- is a ligand that complexes with Co^2+, the free ligand concentration [SCN-] will be less than 0.1 M because some is consumed in forming the complexes. But wait, the problem states that the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. Hmm, maybe that's the free concentration? Or is it the total concentration? This is a critical point. If the problem says the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M, it might refer to the free SCN- concentration. But usually, when they give a total concentration, they specify it as total. Let me check the problem statement again.

"The [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But in such problems, if they mention the concentration of the ligand without specifying, sometimes it's the total concentration. However, given that stability constants are defined in terms of free ligand concentration, maybe the 0.1 M is the free ligand concentration. Wait, but if that's the case, then we can proceed directly. Let me think.

If [SCN-] is 0.1 M, then each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration. Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 * x

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063 * x

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 * x

Then, the total cobalt concentration is:

x + 9*0.1*x + 0.4*x + 0.063*x + 0.0016*x = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*(2.3646) = 0.01 M

So solving for x:

x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * x ≈ 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.001692 M

The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, which is approximately 17%.

Wait, but let's check if [SCN-] is indeed 0.1 M as free ligand. If the problem states that the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, then this approach is incorrect. Because in that case, the free SCN- would be less, as some is bound in the complexes. So we need to clarify this.

But the problem states: "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote the equilibrium concentration, so free SCN- is 0.1 M. Therefore, the approach above is correct.

Alternatively, if the total SCN- was 0.1 M, then we would have to account for all the SCN- in the complexes. Let's check that possibility just to be sure.

Suppose [SCN-]_total = 0.1 M = [SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄^2-]

But in that case, we'd have a system of equations where both the total Co and total SCN- are known. But since the problem states [SCN-] is 0.1 M, not the total, it's more likely that [SCN-] is the free ligand concentration. Therefore, proceeding with the initial approach is valid.

So, following through:

Total Co species sum up to 0.01 M, which gives x ≈ 0.00423 M. Then, the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ is 0.4 * x ≈ 0.001692 M. The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, so approximately 17%.

But let me check the calculations again for accuracy.

First, compute the coefficients:

β1*[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*[SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3*[SCN-]^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4*[SCN-]^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum of all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So total Co = x * 2.3646 = 0.01 M → x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.0000423 = 0.001692 M

Percentage: (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%

So approximately 16.9%, which is roughly 17%. But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me do the division more precisely.

0.01 / 2.3646 = ?

Let's compute 2.3646 goes into 0.01.

First, 2.3646 * 0.004 = 0.0094584

Subtract from 0.01: 0.01 - 0.0094584 = 0.0005416

Now, 2.3646 * 0.0002 = 0.00047292

Subtract: 0.0005416 - 0.00047292 = 0.00006868

So total x ≈ 0.004 + 0.0002 = 0.0042, with a small remainder. So approximately 0.00423.

Thus, [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.001692

0.001692 / 0.01 = 0.1692 → 16.92%

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%. Depending on the required precision, maybe 17%. But let's check if the stability constants are given with specific significant figures. The β values are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. These are all two significant figures except β1=9 (one sig fig). But maybe in the context of the problem, they are considered exact. However, since the answer is expected to be a percentage, perhaps rounded to two significant figures, so 17%.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16.9%. Let's check the exact calculation.

But let's compute 0.01 / 2.3646 exactly.

2.3646 = 23646/10000

So 0.01 / (23646/10000) = 0.01 * 10000 / 23646 = 100 / 23646 ≈ 0.00423

Yes, so x ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * (0.1)^2 * x = 40 * 0.01 * 0.00423 = 0.001692

Total Co is 0.01, so 0.001692 / 0.01 = 0.1692 → 16.92%

So the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, depending on the problem's expectation, maybe we need to keep tw

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The given stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Let me begin by understanding what stability constants represent. Stability constants (β) are equilibrium constants for complex ion formation in solution. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the formation of complex ML_n follows the equation:

M + nL ↔ ML_n

The stability constant β_n is defined as:

β_n = [ML_n] / ([M][L]^n)

In this case, the metal is Co(II) and the ligand is SCN-. The complexes formed would be Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄^2- with the corresponding β values. I need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)₂.

The total cobalt concentration equals the sum of all cobalt species:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 10^-2 M

The problem states that [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M, which I'll interpret as the free ligand concentration since stability constants are defined in terms of free ligand concentration.

If I denote [Co^2+] as x, then each complex's concentration can be expressed as:

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 0.4x

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 0.063x

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x

The total cobalt concentration equation becomes:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(2.3646) = 0.01 M

Solving for x:

x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Therefore, [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.001692 M

The percentage of dithiocyanato complex is:
(0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%

Let me double-check these calculations:

Sum of all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M
[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M
Percentage: (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%

So the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes as a portion of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. To begin, let's recall the details provided: the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The specified stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Stability constants (β) are equilibrium constants that describe the formation of complex ions in a solution. For a metal ion M and a ligand L, the formation of complex ML_n is expressed as:

M + nL ↔ ML_n

The stability constant β_n is calculated by:

β_n = [ML_n] / ([M][L]^n)

Here, β1 refers to ML formation, β2 to ML2, and so forth. In this scenario, the metal is Co(II), and the ligand is SCN-. The resulting complexes are Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄^2- with the given β values. The task is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)₂.

The total cobalt concentration is a sum of all cobalt species present:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 10^-2 M

Given the thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M, it's important to determine if this value represents the total or free concentration since SCN- forms complexes with Co^2+. While the problem indicates [SCN-] is 0.1 M, suggesting the free concentration, typically, when denoting a total concentration, solutions specify this explicitly. Assessing these constants with the assumption that 0.1 M refers to the free ligand concentration seems reasonable in line with typical conventions.

Assuming [SCN-] as 0.1 M, we express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration (x):

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 0.4 * x

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 0.063 * x

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 * x

Total cobalt concentration becomes:

x + 0.9*x + 0.4*x + 0.063*x + 0.0016*x = x*(2.3646) = 0.01 M

Solving for x gives us:

x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Thus, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ is [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * x ≈ 0.001692 M.

The percentage for Co(SCN)₂ is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, which approximates to 17%. Hence, assuming two significant figures for the percentage, the result is approximately 17%.

If the options are given with one decimal, 16.9%, otherwise 17%.\n\nBut let\'s check if there\'s another approach. Maybe using the distribution of the complexes.\n\nThe fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of Co(SCN)₂ is β2[SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nWhich is exactly what we computed. So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThen, the numerator is 0.4\n\nSo fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9% or 17%.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another method. Suppose we consider that the free ligand concentration is 0.1 M. Then, the stepwise formation constants can be considered. Wait, the problem gives the cumulative stability constants (βn), which are the product of the stepwise constants (K1, K1*K2, etc.). Since we have β1 to β4, we can express each complex in terms of β.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall correctly, the distribution of the complexes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα_0 = 1 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\nWhere α_0 is the fraction of free Co^2+. Similarly, the fraction for Co(SCN)^+ is α1 = β1[L] * α0, for Co(SCN)₂ is α2 = β2[L]^2 * α0, and so on.\n\nTherefore, α2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)\n\nWhich is exactly what we calculated before, leading to α2 ≈ 0.1692 or 16.92%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 16.9%, but since the given β values are integers without decimal places, maybe we should present it as 17%.\n\nHowever, to ensure precision, let\'s do the exact calculation:\n\nDenominator D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 = 1\n\n9*0.1 = 0.9\n\n40*0.01 = 0.4\n\n63*0.001 = 0.063\n\n16*0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding these: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo D = 2.3646\n\nNumerator for Co(SCN)₂ is 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4\n\nTherefore, α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%. If we need to round to the nearest whole number, it\'s 17%.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer to be given with two significant figures. Since the given concentrations are 10^-2 M (one significant figure?) Wait, c(Co) = 10^-2 M. That\'s 0.01 M, which is one significant figure. Similarly, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, also one significant figure. However, the stability constants are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. These have one, two, two, and two significant figures respectively.\n\nBut in such cases, the number of significant figures in the answer is determined by the least precise measurement. However, since this is a problem from a textbook or an exam, they might expect an exact answer as per the given values, regardless of significant figures. Therefore, 16.92% would be acceptable, but likely rounded to 17%.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the stability constants are given as integers, maybe the answer is intended to be 17%.\n\nBut to check, let\'s compute 0.4 / 2.3646 exactly.\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646:\n\n2.3646 * 0.1692 = ?\n\n0.1 * 2.3646 = 0.23646\n\n0.06 * 2.3646 = 0.141876\n\n0.009 * 2.3646 = 0.0212814\n\n0.0002 * 2.3646 = 0.00047292\n\nAdding up: 0.23646 + 0.141876 = 0.378336; +0.0212814 = 0.3996174; +0.00047292 ≈ 0.4000903\n\nSo 2.3646 * 0.1692 ≈ 0.40009, which is very close to 0.4. Therefore, 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692, so 16.92%.\n\nThus, the precise answer is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9% or 17%.\n\nBut since in many cases, percentages are given to one decimal place if the input data allows. Here, since the SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M (one decimal place), and Co concentration as 0.01 M (two decimal places), the answer should probably be to two significant figures, which would be 17%.\n\nWait, 16.92% is three significant figures. If we take the given data: c(Co) is 10^-2 M, which is one significant figure, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, one significant figure, and the β values are given as 9 (1 sig fig), 40 (2), 63 (2), 16 (2). So the least number of significant figures is 1. But that might be too strict. Alternatively, since some β values have two sig figs, maybe we can keep two sig figs in the answer. Then, 17%.\n\nBut in practice, when given a mix of sig figs, it\'s a bit ambiguous. However, since the problem is likely designed for educational purposes, expecting an answer of approximately 17%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should present the exact fraction. Let\'s see:\n\n0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692 → 16.92%, which is 16.92%. If we are to write this as a boxed number, the question is whether to round or not. Given that in chemistry problems, unless specified, one decimal place is common. So 16.9%.\n\nBut let me check similar problems. For example, if you have stability constants and ligand concentrations, calculating the percentage typically results in answers to one or two decimal places depending on the inputs. Since the ligand concentration is given as 0.1 M (one decimal), and the βs as whole numbers, maybe one decimal place is acceptable. So 16.9%.\n\nHowever, different sources might round differently. To be precise, since 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.1692, converting to percentage is 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place. Therefore, the answer is 16.9%.\n\nBut let me check once more. If all the calculations are precise, the exact value is 16.92%, so depending on the required precision, but since the problem gives β1 as 9 (which is 9.0?), maybe they expect two decimal places. However, since 9 is an integer, it\'s ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 17%, as the closest whole number. Given that 16.92% is very close to 17%, and in many cases, such percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut to be safe, since the calculation gives 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%, and if the problem expects a precise answer, maybe 16.9%. However, different people might round differently.\n\nWait, let\'s think again. The problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". The blue color is usually associated with the tetrahedral Co(SCN)₂ complex, I think. But in aqueous solution, Co(II) complexes with SCN- can form different complexes. However, assuming that the dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)₂, which is the second complex.\n\nBut let\'s confirm that. The formula for the dithiocyanato complex would be [Co(SCN)₂], which has two SCN- ligands. The problem refers to it as the "blue" complex, which is a characteristic of the tetrahedral Co(SCN)₂ complex. So that\'s correct.\n\nThus, the percentage is 16.92%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%. Since in the given data, the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M (one decimal place), and the answer should match that precision. Therefore, 16.9% is appropriate with one decimal place. However, if the problem expects an integer, 17% is acceptable.\n\nBut given that the calculation gives 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place, I think that\'s the most accurate answer here. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\nBut let me check once more with exact fractions.\n\nThe denominator D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) + 63*(0.001) + 16*(0.0001) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo D = 2.3646\n\nNumerator N = 40*(0.01) = 0.4\n\nSo N/D = 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692\n\nMultiply by 100 to get percentage: 16.92%\n\nThus, the exact value is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%. Therefore, the answer is 16.9%.\n\nHowever, since the problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, but given the input data\'s precision, one decimal is sufficient. Hence, the answer is 16.9%.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s see: if [SCN-] was 0.10 M (two decimal places), then we could justify two decimal places in the answer. But since it\'s given as 0.1 M (one decimal), the answer should be one decimal place. Hence, 16.9%.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is from a source that uses significant figures, let\'s count them.\n\nc(Co) = 1e-2 M: 1 significant figure.\n\n[SCN-] = 0.1 M: 1 significant figure.\n\nβ1=9: 1 significant figure.\n\nβ2=40: 1 or 2? 40 could be 1 or 2. If written as 40., it\'s two, but as 40, ambiguous. Similarly, 63 and 16: same issue.\n\nIn many textbooks, numbers without a decimal are considered to have trailing zeros as significant only if specified. So 40 might be considered 1 significant figure, but that\'s not standard. Typically, trailing zeros in numbers without a decimal are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 40 would be 4 x 10^1 (1 sig fig), but written as 40, it\'s unclear. Given that β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, they are likely given as integers, so two significant figures each except β1=9 (1 sig fig). Therefore, the least number of significant figures is 1 (from β1 and the concentrations). Therefore, the answer should be to 1 significant figure, which would be 20%. But that contradicts the precise calculation.\n\nWait, this is a problem. If we follow significant figures strictly:\n\nThe concentrations have 1 sig fig (0.01 M and 0.1 M), and β1=9 (1 sig fig), others have two. The calculation involves multiplication and division, so the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement, which is 1 sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 20%. But that seems incorrect given the precise calculation is 16.92%.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. However, in real practice, stability constants are often known with more precision, and if they are given as 9, 40, 63, 16, perhaps they are considered exact for the problem\'s sake, and the concentrations are given as 0.01 and 0.1, which could be considered exact (e.g., 0.01 M is 1.0 x 10^-2, so two sig figs). Wait, 0.01 M has one significant figure, but if written as 0.010 M, it would be two. Similarly, 0.1 M is one, 0.10 M is two.\n\nGiven that the problem states c(Co) = 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, one significant figure. [SCN-] = 0.1 M, one significant figure. The stability constants are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. If these are considered to have one, one, two, two significant figures, then the least is one. But this is getting too into the weeds.\n\nIn an exam setting, unless specified, they might expect the precise calculation (16.92%) rounded to two decimal places or one. But given the ambiguity, I think the answer is expected to be 17%.\n\nAlternatively, since 16.92% is very close to 17%, and given the possible rounding in the stability constants (β2=40 is possibly an approximate value), 17% is a reasonable answer.\n\nBut to adhere to the precise calculation, I should state it as 16.9%. However, different sources might round differently.\n\nWait, another approach: Let\'s express all terms with more precision.\n\nCompute D = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 = 1.0000\n\n9*0.1 = 0.9000\n\n40*0.01 = 0.4000\n\n63*0.001 = 0.0630\n\n16*0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum: 1.0000 + 0.9000 = 1.9000\n\n1.9000 + 0.4000 = 2.3000\n\n2.3000 + 0.0630 = 2.3630\n\n2.3630 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo D = 2.3646\n\nNumerator: β2*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4000\n\nThus, fraction = 0.4000 / 2.3646 = 0.1692\n\nMultiply by 100: 16.92%\n\nTherefore, the exact value is 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place. Hence, the answer is 16.9%.\n\nHowever, since the problem might expect a whole number, but given the calculation, 16.9% is more accurate. Therefore, I will present the answer as 16.9%, which in boxed form is \\boxed{16.9\\%}.\n\nBut just to confirm, let me check a reference or example. For instance, if you have similar problems in textbooks, how are they rounded? For example, in Harris\'s Quantitative Chemical Analysis, such problems are usually rounded to two significant figures or one decimal place based on input data. Given that the input data here has one significant figure for concentrations, but the βs have two, it\'s a bit conflicting. But since the calculation leads to 16.92%, which is two decimal places, but the input data\'s precision is low, perhaps the answer should be 17%.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 0.1 is one decimal place, and the result is 16.92%, which has two decimal places, but we might round to one decimal place, giving 16.9%.\n\nGiven the options, I think 16.9% is the most precise correct answer, respecting the one decimal place from the [SCN-] concentration. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{16.9\\%}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \\boxed{16.9\\%}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391401, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4291, prompt_tokens=2317, total_tokens=6608, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by using the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \) M, and the free thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

The concentration of each cobalt species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] = \( x \):

- \([Co(SCN)^+] = \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot [SCN^-] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x\)
- \([Co(SCN)_2] = \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot [SCN^-]^2 = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x\)
- \([Co(SCN)_3^-] = \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot [SCN^-]^3 = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x\)
- \([Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot [SCN^-]^4 = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x\)

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 2.3646x
\]

Given \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \) M, we solve for \( x \):

\[
2.3646x = 0.01 \implies x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \text{ M}
\]

The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex \([Co(SCN)_2]\) is:

\[
0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 0.00423 \approx 0.001692 \text{ M}
\]

The percentage of \([Co(SCN)_2]\) among all cobalt species is:

\[
\frac{0.001692}{0.01} \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the percentage is:

\[
\boxed{16.9\%}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

os decimal places. If the options are given with one decimal, 16.9%, otherwise 17%.

But let's check if there's another approach. Maybe using the distribution of the complexes.

The fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of Co(SCN)₂ is β2[SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)

Which is exactly what we computed. So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

Then, the numerator is 0.4

So fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%

Therefore, the percentage is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9% or 17%.

But let me cross-verify with another method. Suppose we consider that the free ligand concentration is 0.1 M. Then, the stepwise formation constants can be considered. Wait, the problem gives the cumulative stability constants (βn), which are the product of the stepwise constants (K1, K1*K2, etc.). Since we have β1 to β4, we can express each complex in terms of β.

Alternatively, if I recall correctly, the distribution of the complexes can be calculated using the formula:

α_0 = 1 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)

Where α_0 is the fraction of free Co^2+. Similarly, the fraction for Co(SCN)^+ is α1 = β1[L] * α0, for Co(SCN)₂ is α2 = β2[L]^2 * α0, and so on.

Therefore, α2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4)

Which is exactly what we calculated before, leading to α2 ≈ 0.1692 or 16.92%.

Therefore, the answer should be 16.9%, but since the given β values are integers without decimal places, maybe we should present it as 17%.

However, to ensure precision, let's do the exact calculation:

Denominator D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

Compute each term:

1 = 1

9*0.1 = 0.9

40*0.01 = 0.4

63*0.001 = 0.063

16*0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding these: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D = 2.3646

Numerator for Co(SCN)₂ is 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4

Therefore, α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%

Rounded to two decimal places, 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%. If we need to round to the nearest whole number, it's 17%.

But the problem might expect the answer to be given with two significant figures. Since the given concentrations are 10^-2 M (one significant figure?) Wait, c(Co) = 10^-2 M. That's 0.01 M, which is one significant figure. Similarly, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, also one significant figure. However, the stability constants are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. These have one, two, two, and two significant figures respectively.

But in such cases, the number of significant figures in the answer is determined by the least precise measurement. However, since this is a problem from a textbook or an exam, they might expect an exact answer as per the given values, regardless of significant figures. Therefore, 16.92% would be acceptable, but likely rounded to 17%.

Alternatively, if we consider that the stability constants are given as integers, maybe the answer is intended to be 17%.

But to check, let's compute 0.4 / 2.3646 exactly.

0.4 divided by 2.3646:

2.3646 * 0.1692 = ?

0.1 * 2.3646 = 0.23646

0.06 * 2.3646 = 0.141876

0.009 * 2.3646 = 0.0212814

0.0002 * 2.3646 = 0.00047292

Adding up: 0.23646 + 0.141876 = 0.378336; +0.0212814 = 0.3996174; +0.00047292 ≈ 0.4000903

So 2.3646 * 0.1692 ≈ 0.40009, which is very close to 0.4. Therefore, 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692, so 16.92%.

Thus, the precise answer is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9% or 17%.

But since in many cases, percentages are given to one decimal place if the input data allows. Here, since the SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M (one decimal place), and Co concentration as 0.01 M (two decimal places), the answer should probably be to two significant figures, which would be 17%.

Wait, 16.92% is three significant figures. If we take the given data: c(Co) is 10^-2 M, which is one significant figure, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, one significant figure, and the β values are given as 9 (1 sig fig), 40 (2), 63 (2), 16 (2). So the least number of significant figures is 1. But that might be too strict. Alternatively, since some β values have two sig figs, maybe we can keep two sig figs in the answer. Then, 17%.

But in practice, when given a mix of sig figs, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the problem is likely designed for educational purposes, expecting an answer of approximately 17%.

Alternatively, maybe we should present the exact fraction. Let's see:

0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692 → 16.92%, which is 16.92%. If we are to write this as a boxed number, the question is whether to round or not. Given that in chemistry problems, unless specified, one decimal place is common. So 16.9%.

But let me check similar problems. For example, if you have stability constants and ligand concentrations, calculating the percentage typically results in answers to one or two decimal places depending on the inputs. Since the ligand concentration is given as 0.1 M (one decimal), and the βs as whole numbers, maybe one decimal place is acceptable. So 16.9%.

However, different sources might round differently. To be precise, since 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.1692, converting to percentage is 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place. Therefore, the answer is 16.9%.

But let me check once more. If all the calculations are precise, the exact value is 16.92%, so depending on the required precision, but since the problem gives β1 as 9 (which is 9.0?), maybe they expect two decimal places. However, since 9 is an integer, it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 17%, as the closest whole number. Given that 16.92% is very close to 17%, and in many cases, such percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number unless specified otherwise.

But to be safe, since the calculation gives 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%, and if the problem expects a precise answer, maybe 16.9%. However, different people might round differently.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". The blue color is usually associated with the tetrahedral Co(SCN)₂ complex, I think. But in aqueous solution, Co(II) complexes with SCN- can form different complexes. However, assuming that the dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)₂, which is the second complex.

But let's confirm that. The formula for the dithiocyanato complex would be [Co(SCN)₂], which has two SCN- ligands. The problem refers to it as the "blue" complex, which is a characteristic of the tetrahedral Co(SCN)₂ complex. So that's correct.

Thus, the percentage is 16.92%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%. Since in the given data, the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M (one decimal place), and the answer should match that precision. Therefore, 16.9% is appropriate with one decimal place. However, if the problem expects an integer, 17% is acceptable.

But given that the calculation gives 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place, I think that's the most accurate answer here. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%.

But let me check once more with exact fractions.

The denominator D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) + 63*(0.001) + 16*(0.0001) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D = 2.3646

Numerator N = 40*(0.01) = 0.4

So N/D = 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 16.92%

Thus, the exact value is 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%. Therefore, the answer is 16.9%.

However, since the problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, but given the input data's precision, one decimal is sufficient. Hence, the answer is 16.9%.

But to confirm, let's see: if [SCN-] was 0.10 M (two decimal places), then we could justify two decimal places in the answer. But since it's given as 0.1 M (one decimal), the answer should be one decimal place. Hence, 16.9%.

Alternatively, if the problem is from a source that uses significant figures, let's count them.

c(Co) = 1e-2 M: 1 significant figure.

[SCN-] = 0.1 M: 1 significant figure.

β1=9: 1 significant figure.

β2=40: 1 or 2? 40 could be 1 or 2. If written as 40., it's two, but as 40, ambiguous. Similarly, 63 and 16: same issue.

In many textbooks, numbers without a decimal are considered to have trailing zeros as significant only if specified. So 40 might be considered 1 significant figure, but that's not standard. Typically, trailing zeros in numbers without a decimal are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 40 would be 4 x 10^1 (1 sig fig), but written as 40, it's unclear. Given that β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, they are likely given as integers, so two significant figures each except β1=9 (1 sig fig). Therefore, the least number of significant figures is 1 (from β1 and the concentrations). Therefore, the answer should be to 1 significant figure, which would be 20%. But that contradicts the precise calculation.

Wait, this is a problem. If we follow significant figures strictly:

The concentrations have 1 sig fig (0.01 M and 0.1 M), and β1=9 (1 sig fig), others have two. The calculation involves multiplication and division, so the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement, which is 1 sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 20%. But that seems incorrect given the precise calculation is 16.92%.

But this is a contradiction. However, in real practice, stability constants are often known with more precision, and if they are given as 9, 40, 63, 16, perhaps they are considered exact for the problem's sake, and the concentrations are given as 0.01 and 0.1, which could be considered exact (e.g., 0.01 M is 1.0 x 10^-2, so two sig figs). Wait, 0.01 M has one significant figure, but if written as 0.010 M, it would be two. Similarly, 0.1 M is one, 0.10 M is two.

Given that the problem states c(Co) = 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, one significant figure. [SCN-] = 0.1 M, one significant figure. The stability constants are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. If these are considered to have one, one, two, two significant figures, then the least is one. But this is getting too into the weeds.

In an exam setting, unless specified, they might expect the precise calculation (16.92%) rounded to two decimal places or one. But given the ambiguity, I think the answer is expected to be 17%.

Alternatively, since 16.92% is very close to 17%, and given the possible rounding in the stability constants (β2=40 is possibly an approximate value), 17% is a reasonable answer.

But to adhere to the precise calculation, I should state it as 16.9%. However, different sources might round differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's express all terms with more precision.

Compute D = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

Compute each term:

1 = 1.0000

9*0.1 = 0.9000

40*0.01 = 0.4000

63*0.001 = 0.0630

16*0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum: 1.0000 + 0.9000 = 1.9000

1.9000 + 0.4000 = 2.3000

2.3000 + 0.0630 = 2.3630

2.3630 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D = 2.3646

Numerator: β2*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4000

Thus, fraction = 0.4000 / 2.3646 = 0.1692

Multiply by 100: 16.92%

Therefore, the exact value is 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place. Hence, the answer is 16.9%.

However, since the problem might expect a whole number, but given the calculation, 16.9% is more accurate. Therefore, I will present the answer as 16.9%, which in boxed form is \boxed{16.9\%}.

But just to confirm, let me check a reference or example. For instance, if you have similar problems in textbooks, how are they rounded? For example, in Harris's Quantitative Chemical Analysis, such problems are usually rounded to two significant figures or one decimal place based on input data. Given that the input data here has one significant figure for concentrations, but the βs have two, it's a bit conflicting. But since the calculation leads to 16.92%, which is two decimal places, but the input data's precision is low, perhaps the answer should be 17%.

Alternatively, considering that 0.1 is one decimal place, and the result is 16.92%, which has two decimal places, but we might round to one decimal place, giving 16.9%.

Given the options, I think 16.9% is the most precise correct answer, respecting the one decimal place from the [SCN-] concentration. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{16.9\%}.

**Final Answer**
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{16.9\%}.

To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the free thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

1. **Express concentrations of all cobalt species in terms of free Co²⁺ (\( x \))**:
   - \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x \)

2. **Sum all species to match the total cobalt concentration**:
   \[
   x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂**:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.4x = 0.4 \times 0.00423 \approx 0.001692 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Determine the percentage of Co(SCN)₂**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately \( \boxed{17\%} \) of the cobalt-containing species are blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.

However, given the problem statement, it\'s more straightforward to take [SCN-] as 0.1 M (free ligand concentration), as the problem states "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M," which usually refers to the equilibrium concentration unless stated otherwise.\n\nThus, proceeding with the initial calculation, the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ is approximately 16.92%, which rounds to 17%.\n\nBut let\'s recheck the arithmetic.

Wait, no, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So these are cumulative stability constants, not stepwise. That is, β2 is the stability constant for the formation of ML2 directly from M and 2L. Therefore, the equations are correctly set up.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes β can be confused with stepwise constants (K1, K2, etc.), but here they are given as βn which are cumulative. So, β2 = K1*K2. The values here are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but β4 is smaller than β3, which is unusual. Typically, cumulative stability constants increase with each step, but sometimes higher complexes are less stable. For example, Co(SCN)₃ and Co(SCN)₄ might have lower stability than the previous ones. So β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So that\'s possible. So, the given β values are correct as per the problem statement.\n\nThus, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.92%, which is 16.9% or 17% when rounded.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by using the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M, and the free thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]) is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

The concentrations of the cobalt complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] = \(x\):

\[
\begin{align*}
[\text{Co(SCN)⁺}] &= \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)₂}] &= \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)₃⁻}] &= \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)₄²⁻}] &= \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x.
\end{align*}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:

\[
x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 2.3646x.
\]

Given the total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M:

\[
2.3646x = 0.01 \implies x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \text{ M}.
\]

The concentration of Co(SCN)₂ is:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)₂}] = 0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 0.00423 \approx 0.001692 \text{ M}.
\]

The percentage of Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt-containing species is:

\[
\left( \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.92\% \approx 17\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \(\boxed{17\%}\).

However, to ensure accuracy, let's verify the assumption that [SCN-] is 0.1 M. If the 0.1 M SCN- is the total concentration (including all complexes), the calculation becomes more complex. The total SCN- concentration would be:

[SCN-]_total = [SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄^2-]

But since the problem states "[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M," it's more likely that this is the free SCN- concentration. However, to be thorough, let's check the alternative.

If [SCN-]_total = 0.1 M, then:

[SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃^-] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 0.1 M

But this complicates the equations and requires solving a system where [SCN-] is a variable. However, given the problem statement, it's more straightforward to take [SCN-] as 0.1 M (free ligand concentration), as the problem states "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M," which usually refers to the equilibrium concentration unless stated otherwise.

Thus, proceeding with the initial calculation, the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ is approximately 16.92%, which rounds to 17%.

But let's recheck the arithmetic. Let's compute the total cobalt species:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*(2.3646)

Therefore, x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.001692 M

Percentage: (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%

So, approximately 16.9%, which is ~17%. The answer would be approximately 17%. However, looking at the stability constants given, it's possible that the β values are in log units? Wait, no, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So these are cumulative stability constants, not stepwise. That is, β2 is the stability constant for the formation of ML2 directly from M and 2L. Therefore, the equations are correctly set up.

Alternatively, sometimes β can be confused with stepwise constants (K1, K2, etc.), but here they are given as βn which are cumulative. So, β2 = K1*K2. The values here are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but β4 is smaller than β3, which is unusual. Typically, cumulative stability constants increase with each step, but sometimes higher complexes are less stable. For example, Co(SCN)₃ and Co(SCN)₄ might have lower stability than the previous ones. So β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So that's possible. So, the given β values are correct as per the problem statement.

Thus, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.92%, which is 16.9% or 17% when rounded. Given that the original data has β values as integers and concentrations given to one or two significant figures, the answer should be expressed with two significant figures, so 17%.

But let me confirm once more. Let's recast the problem step by step.

Given:

Total Co concentration: 0.01 M

[SCN-] = 0.1 M (free)

Stability constants:

β1 = [CoSCN+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9

β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63

β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16

Let [Co^2+] = x

Then:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x

[Co(SCN)2] = β2 x [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x

[Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 x [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x

[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 x [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x

Total Co is:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*(2.3646) = 0.01 M

So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is 0.4x ≈ 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.001692 M

The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.92%, which is approximately 17%.

Therefore, the answer is 17%.

**Final Answer**
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{17\%}.
