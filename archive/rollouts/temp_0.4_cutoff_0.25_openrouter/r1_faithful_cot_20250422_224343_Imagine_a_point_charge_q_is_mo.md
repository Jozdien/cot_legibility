# Original Question

Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\mu_o$ is the permeability.

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \), generated by a moving point charge \( q \) along trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), when the electromagnetic field was emitted, and depend on the charge's position \( \vec{s}(t_r) \) and velocity \( \vec{v} \) at that time. The vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) points from the retarded position to the observation point.

**Scalar Potential \( V \):**
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} }
\]

**Vector Potential \( \vec{A} \):**
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} }
\]

Here, \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum, \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, and \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space. The denominator \( |\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c} \) incorporates the retarded position and velocity of the charge, adjusting for the component of the velocity in the direction of the observation point.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t, caused by a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the potentials are observed at a later time t, which is greater than the retarded time tr. The retarded time is the time when the field was generated, right? So, the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and the observation is at position r at time t. The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is v. 

First, I remember that for moving charges, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let me recall the form of those. The scalar potential V is usually something like (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance adjusted by the velocity term. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) times the charge times velocity divided by the same adjusted distance. But I need to be careful with the exact expressions.

Wait, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials take into account the retardation effect, meaning that the potentials at time t depend on the state of the charge at the retarded time tr. The retarded time is the time when the light (or electromagnetic signal) left the charge to reach the observation point r at time t. So, tr = t - |d|/c, where |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. But d itself is r - s(tr), so |d| is the magnitude of that vector. Therefore, tr is defined implicitly by tr = t - |r - s(tr)|/c. That seems complicated because tr is on both sides. But maybe for the potentials, we don't need to solve for tr explicitly; we just need to express the potentials in terms of quantities evaluated at tr.

So, the scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

Wait, is that right? Or is there a gamma factor? Let me think. For a charge moving with constant velocity, the potential would be different, but in the general case of accelerated motion, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials apply. The denominator should involve the retarded distance adjusted by the component of the velocity in the direction of d. Because when the charge is moving towards the observation point, the effective distance is less, which causes the Doppler shift kind of effect.

Yes, I think the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ (d - (d · v)/c ) ]

But wait, d is a vector. How do we subtract the scalar (d · v)/c from the vector d? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the denominator is the magnitude of d minus the projection of velocity onto the direction of d, scaled by 1/c. Let's clarify.

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials have a denominator term called the "retarded distance" adjusted by the velocity. The general formula for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c )) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c )) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Here, d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d, which is (d)/|d|. So, the denominator is |d| multiplied by (1 - (d̂ · v)/c). So, the term (d̂ · v)/c is the component of the velocity in the direction of the observation point divided by the speed of light. This factor accounts for the Doppler effect and the retardation.

Therefore, writing this out, the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c, because d̂ · v is (d · v)/|d|, so multiplying by |d| gives (d · v). Therefore, the denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c. Wait, no:

Wait, if you have |d| * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ) = |d| - |d|*(d̂ · v)/c = |d| - (d · v)/c. So, yes, the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c. Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

But wait, let me check the units. The scalar potential should be in volts (V), and the vector potential in tesla meters per second (T·m/s) or weber per meter (Wb/m). Let's see. The denominator for V is in meters (since |d| is meters and (d · v)/c is (meters·meters/second)/(meters/second)) = meters. So, denominator is meters. Then, q/(4πε₀ meters) gives volts. Correct. For A, μ₀ has units of H/m, so (μ₀ * q * v)/(4π meters) would be (H/m * C * m/s)/m) = (H·C/s)/m². H is Wb/A, and C/s is A, so H·C/s is Wb. Therefore, Wb/m² is Tesla. Wait, but A is supposed to be in Tesla·meter? Hmm. Wait, maybe not. The vector potential A is in Tesla·meter? Wait, no. The units of A are webers per meter (Wb/m), which is equivalent to Tesla·meter (since 1 Wb = 1 T·m²). So, T·m²/m = T·m. Hmm. Let me check again. The unit of vector potential A is indeed T·m or Wb/m. However, the standard expression for A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v)/( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c )). So, μ₀ has units of H/m, q is C, v is m/s, |d| is m. So, (H/m * C * m/s)/m = (H·C·s⁻¹)/m². Since H is V·s/(A·m), and C is A·s, so H·C·s⁻¹ = (V·s/(A·m)) * (A·s) * s⁻¹ = V·s²/(m) * s⁻¹ = V·s/m. Then, divided by m²: V·s/m³. But V·s is Wb (since V = Wb/s), so Wb/m³. Hmm, that doesn't seem to match. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps better to recall that the Biot-Savart law has A with units of T·m. Let's see: The Biot-Savart law for A is (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ (I dl × r̂)/r². Current I is in Amperes, dl is meters, r is meters. So, units are (H/m * A * m * m)/m² = H·A/m. Since H is Wb/(A·m), so H·A/m = Wb/(m²). But A is supposed to be Wb/m. Hmm, maybe I need to check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the units of A are indeed correct as (μ₀ charge velocity)/(distance). Since μ₀ has units of H/m, charge is C, velocity is m/s, distance is m. So, (H/m * C * m/s)/m = H·C/(s·m²). Since H is V·s/(A·m), C is A·s, so substituting: (V·s/(A·m) * A·s)/(s·m²) = (V·s²)/(m³·s) ) = V·s/m³. But V is J/C, so (J/C)·s/m³. J is N·m, so (N·m/C)·s/m³ = (kg·m/s²·m/C)·s/m³ = kg/(C·s·m). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the expressions for V and A are as per Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall the standard form. Let me look this up mentally. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / ( |d| (1 - d̂ · v/c) ) )

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v / ( |d| (1 - d̂ · v/c) ) )

Where all quantities (d, v) are evaluated at the retarded time tr. So, d = r - s(tr), and d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. The term (1 - d̂ · v/c) is called the Doppler factor or the retardation factor. So, the denominator is |d| multiplied by (1 - d̂ · v/c). Therefore, the potentials are inversely proportional to this factor.

So, to write the final expressions, using the given notation:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c |\vec{d}|}\right)} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

Similarly,

A(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c |\vec{d}|}\right)} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

But in the denominator, note that (d · v)/c is a scalar, and |d| is the magnitude of d, so the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c. So, the expressions can be written either with the unit vector factored out or not.

Alternatively, since d̂ = d / |d|, so d̂ · v = (d · v)/|d|, so 1 - d̂ · v/c = 1 - (d · v)/(c |d|). Therefore, the denominator is |d| (1 - (d · v)/(c |d|)) = |d| - (d · v)/c.

Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

And the vector potential is:

A = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

But let me check a textbook formula. In Griffiths' Electrodynamics, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are written as:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{(\mathcal{R} c - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})}

A(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q c \vec{v}}{(\mathcal{R} c - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})}

Where \vec{\mathcal{R}} = \vec{r} - \vec{w}(t_r) (which is our d), and \mathcal{R} = |\vec{\mathcal{R}}| (our |d|). So, substituting, this becomes:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{\mathcal{R} c - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v}} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\mathcal{R} - (\vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})/c}

Which matches our previous expression. Similarly for A. So, the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c. Therefore, the answer should be as above.

Therefore, the scalar potential V is (1/(4πε₀)) * q divided by (|d| - (d · v)/c), and the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * q v divided by the same denominator. All evaluated at the retarded time tr.

So, in boxed form:

Scalar potential V:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} }

Vector potential \vec{A}:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} }

I think that's correct. Let me verify once more. The key idea is that the potentials depend on the retarded position and velocity, and the denominator includes a term that accounts for the velocity's component in the direction of the observation point. This term modifies the effective distance, leading to effects like the Doppler shift in the potentials. Yes, this seems right. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are indeed given by these expressions when the charge is moving with velocity v at the retarded time, and the observation is made at position r at time t. The vector d connects the retarded position to the observation point. Therefore, the expressions are correct.

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t, caused by a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the potentials are observed at a later time t, which is greater than the retarded time tr. The retarded time is the time when the field was generated, right? So, the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and the observation is at position r at time t. The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is v. 

First, I remember that for moving charges, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let me recall the form of those. The scalar potential V is usually something like (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance adjusted by the velocity term.

The retarded time is the time when the light (or electromagnetic signal) left the charge to reach the observation point r at time t. So, tr = t - |d|/c, where |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. But d itself is r - s(tr), so |d| is the magnitude of that vector. Therefore, tr is defined implicitly by tr = t - |r - s(tr)|/c. That seems complicated because tr is on both sides. But maybe for the potentials, we don't need to solve for tr explicitly; we just need to express the potentials in terms of quantities evaluated at tr.

So, the scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

Wait, is that right? Or is there a gamma factor? Let me think. For a charge moving with constant velocity, the potential would be different, but in the general case of accelerated motion, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials apply. The denominator should involve the retarded distance adjusted by the component of the velocity in the direction of d. Because when the charge is moving towards the observation point, the effective distance is less, which causes the Doppler shift kind of effect.

Yes, I think the scalar potential is:

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the scalar potential V and vector potential A at position r and time t, resulting from a point charge q moving along trajectory s(t). The observation occurs at time t, which comes after the retarded time tr. The retarded time represents when the field was originally generated, with the charge positioned at s(tr) during time tr, while the observation happens at position r during time t. The vector d represents the displacement from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). The charge's velocity at retarded time is denoted as v.

For moving charges, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V typically involves (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance with a velocity adjustment term. Similarly, the vector potential A equals (μ₀/(4π)) times the charge times velocity divided by this same adjusted distance. I need to be precise about these expressions.

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials incorporate retardation effects, meaning potentials at time t depend on the charge's state at retarded time tr. This retarded time is when the electromagnetic signal departed from the charge to arrive at observation point r at time t. Thus, tr = t - |d|/c, where |d| represents the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. Since d equals r - s(tr), |d| is this vector's magnitude. Therefore, tr is implicitly defined by tr = t - |r - s(tr)|/c. This creates complexity since tr appears on both sides of the equation. However, for calculating potentials, we might not need to explicitly solve for tr; we just need to express potentials using quantities evaluated at tr.

The scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

I'm questioning whether this formula includes a gamma factor. For charges moving at constant velocity, the potential differs, but for accelerated motion, we apply the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator incorporates the retarded distance adjusted by the velocity component in direction d. This adjustment occurs because when a charge moves toward the observation point, the effective distance decreases, creating a Doppler-like effect.

I believe the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a location r and time t, due to a moving point charge q. This charge follows a path s(t), and the potentials are measured at a later time t, which is beyond the retarded time tr. The retarded time indicates when the field was generated. So, at time tr, the charge was at position s(tr), while the observation occurs at position r at time t. The vector d points from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). At the retarded time, the velocity of the charge is v.

To begin, for moving charges, the potentials are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I need to recall their form: the scalar potential V is generally expressed as (1/(4πε₀)) times the charge, divided by the adjusted retarded distance with a velocity correction. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) multiplied by the charge and velocity, divided by the same adjusted distance. I need to ensure the expressions are exact.

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials reflect the retardation effect, implying that the potentials at time t are influenced by the charge's state at the retarded time tr. The retarded time corresponds to when the electromagnetic signal departed the charge to reach observation point r at time t, given by tr = t - |d|/c, where |d| is the distance between the charge at tr and the observation site. Since d is r - s(tr), |d| represents the magnitude of this vector. Therefore, tr is defined implicitly by the equation tr = t - |r - s(tr)|/c. This formulation is complex as tr appears on both sides. However, for calculating the potentials, we don't necessarily need to solve for tr explicitly; what's essential is expressing the potentials using quantities evaluated at tr.

So the scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

Is this correct, or should there be a gamma factor involved? Let me consider. For a charge with constant velocity, the potential would differ, but in the broader scenario of accelerated motion, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are applicable. The denominator incorporates the retarded distance modified by the velocity component in the direction of d. When the charge moves towards the observation point, the effective distance reduces, leading to a Doppler shift effect.

Yes, so, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)

To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials take into account the retarded time \( t_r \), which is the time when the electromagnetic field was generated and is related to the observation time \( t \) by \( t = t_r + \frac{|\vec{d}|}{c} \), where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are given by:

1. **Scalar Potential**:
   \[
   V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)
   \]
   where \( \vec{d} \) is the vector from the retarded position of the charge \( \vec{s}(t_r) \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time \( t_r \).

2. **Vector Potential**:
   \[
   \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)
   \]
   Here, \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the other terms are as defined for the scalar potential.

The key factor in the denominators, \( |\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c} \), accounts for the Doppler-like effect due to the velocity of the charge relative to the observation point.

) * ( q ) / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ) )

Where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. But wait, sometimes it's written as |d| - (d · v)/c. Let me check the units. If d is a vector, then d · v has units of length times velocity. To make the denominator have units of length, we need to divide by c, which is velocity. So (d · v)/c has units of length. Therefore, |d| - (d · v)/c is a length. So the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c. So the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

But wait, I need to confirm. Let me recall the standard Liénard-Wiechert expressions. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (κ R ) ] evaluated at tr

And the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (κ R ) ] evaluated at tr

Where R is the vector from the retarded position to the field point, which is our d, and κ is 1 - (R̂ · v)/c. So R is |d|, R̂ is d̂, so κ = 1 - (d̂ · v)/c. Therefore, κ R = |d| - (d · v)/c. Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

And the vector potential is:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

So that seems correct. Let me check again. The denominator is sometimes called the "retardation factor" or the Doppler factor. It accounts for the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. If the charge is moving towards the observation point, then d · v is positive, so the denominator becomes smaller, increasing the potential, which makes sense because the charge is getting closer. If it's moving away, the denominator is larger, reducing the potential. That seems consistent with expectations.

Therefore, the final expressions are:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

Vector potential A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ]

But I should also make sure that d is evaluated at the retarded time tr, meaning that d = r - s(tr), and v is the velocity of the charge at tr. So all quantities in the potentials are evaluated at the retarded time. Therefore, in the expressions, d, v, and tr are all related through the retarded time condition t = tr + |d|/c. But in the potentials, we don't need to solve for tr explicitly; we just express the potentials in terms of these retarded quantities.

Therefore, the answer should be the Liénard-Wiechert potentials as written above.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)
\]
where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) and \( t_r \) is the retarded time.

\boxed{
V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\left|\vec{d}\right| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}, \quad
\vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{\left|\vec{d}\right| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \), due to a moving point charge \( q \) following trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), when the electromagnetic fields began propagating from the charge's position \( \vec{s}(t_r) \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) points from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, and \( \vec{v} \) is the charge's velocity at \( t_r \).

**Scalar Potential:**
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{ |\vec{d}| - \dfrac{ \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} }{ c } } }
\]

**Vector Potential:**
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{ \mu_0 }{ 4 \pi } \dfrac{ q \vec{v} }{ |\vec{d}| - \dfrac{ \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} }{ c } } }
\]

Here, \( |\vec{d}| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \), and the denominator incorporates the relativistic correction term \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c \), accounting for the charge's velocity at the retarded time. These expressions are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \), ensuring causality by considering the finite speed of light \( c \).

) * ( q ) / ( d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) )

Where d is |d|, and d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Alternatively, written as |d| - (d · v)/c, since d · v = |d||v|cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So, the denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c = |d|(1 - (v/c)cosθ). Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v ) / [ |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

But since μ₀ε₀ = 1/c², maybe this can be expressed in terms of c. However, the standard form is as above.

Wait, Liénard-Wiechert potentials are usually written as:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (κ |d| ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (κ |d| ) ]

where κ = 1 - (d̂ · v)/c, evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Yes, that seems correct. So κ is the Doppler factor. So the potentials depend on the velocity of the charge at the retarded time and the direction from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.

Therefore, the scalar potential V is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) ), and vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) ), where all quantities (d, v) are evaluated at the retarded time tr.

But to write this in vector notation, since d is the vector from s(tr) to r, then d = r - s(tr), and d̂ is d / |d|. So (d̂ · v) is (d · v)/|d|. So the denominator can also be written as |d| - (d · v)/c. Therefore, another way to write the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c.

Hence, the scalar potential can be written as:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

Similarly, vector potential:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

But in some references, the denominator is written with the retarded velocity, and the retarded position. So yes, these expressions should be correct.

Therefore, the answer is:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = [1/(4πε₀)] * [ q / (d - (d · v)/c) ]

Vector potential A(r, t) = [μ₀/(4π)] * [ q v / (d - (d · v)/c) ]

But I need to ensure that d here is the magnitude. Wait, in the denominator, |d| is the magnitude, and (d · v)/c is a scalar. So the denominator is |d| minus the projection of (d · v)/c. So the denominator is a scalar quantity. Therefore, to be precise, it's |d| - (d · v)/c. So in LaTeX notation, that would be written as |\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c.

So the final expressions are:

Scalar potential:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

Vector potential:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

But wait, in standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is actually the retarded distance multiplied by the factor (1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c), where \vec{n} is the unit vector in the direction of d. So \vec{n} = \vec{d}/|\vec{d}|, so (1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c) multiplied by |\vec{d}| gives |\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c. Hence, the denominator is indeed |\vec{d}| (1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c ). Therefore, the expressions I wrote are correct.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{q}{(1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c)|\vec{d}|} \right]

and similarly for A. But both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Scalar potential:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|}\right)} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

Vector potential:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|}\right)} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

Alternatively, since \vec{d}/|\vec{d}| is the unit vector, we can write:

1 - \vec{v} \cdot (\vec{d}/|\vec{d}|)/c, but the denominator is the same.

Therefore, the final expressions for the potentials are as above. So boxed:

Scalar potential:

V = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{ |\vec{d}| - \dfrac{ \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} }{ c } } }

Vector potential:

\vec{A} = \boxed{ \dfrac{ \mu_0 }{ 4 \pi } \dfrac{ q \vec{v} }{ |\vec{d}| - \dfrac{ \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} }{ c } } }

Yes, this seems correct. Let me check against standard Liénard-Wiechert.

In standard form, V = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / ( (1 - n · v/c) R ) ) evaluated at retarded time, where R is |d|, and n is the unit vector in direction of d. So yes, that's equivalent. Similarly, A is (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v / ( (1 - n · v/c) R ) ), which is same as above.

Therefore, the answer is correct.

To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at a position \(\vec{r}\) and time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \) when the electromagnetic field was generated, considering the finite speed of light \( c \).

The retarded time \( t_r \) is defined such that \( t_r = t - \frac{|\vec{d}|}{c} \), where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) is the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The velocity of the charge at \( t_r \) is \( \vec{v} \).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are given by:

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]

These expressions incorporate the retarded distance \( |\vec{d}| \) and the velocity-dependent term \( \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c} \), which accounts for the Doppler effect due to the charge's motion.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
\boxed{
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right), \quad
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)

) * [ q / ( ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) ) ]

But wait, in the denominator, it's actually |d| multiplied by (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Since |d| * d̂ = d, so |d| - (d · v)/c is |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ). Therefore, the denominator is |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ). Thus, the scalar potential can also be written as:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v/c )) ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) times the charge times velocity, divided by the same denominator. So,

A(r, t) = (μ₀ / (4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v/c )) ) ]

But since μ₀ε₀ = 1/c², these expressions are related. Also, note that in the denominator, the term (1 - (d̂ · v/c )) is critical as it accounts for the velocity's effect on the potential. If the charge is moving directly away from the observer, this term reduces the denominator, increasing the potential, whereas if moving towards, the denominator decreases, leading to a higher potential.

But wait, when the charge is moving towards the observation point, d̂ and v are in the same direction, so d̂ · v is positive, so 1 - (d̂ · v/c ) would be less than 1, making the denominator smaller, hence the potential larger. That makes sense, as the effective distance is contracted. Conversely, moving away, the denominator is larger, potential smaller. This is consistent with Doppler effect reasoning.

But in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is called the retarded distance multiplied by (1 - β ⋅ n), where β is v/c and n is the unit vector from the retarded position to the field point. So in our notation, n is d̂, and β is v/c. Therefore, the denominator is |d| (1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c ). Therefore, the scalar potential is indeed as written above.

Therefore, the scalar and vector potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ) ) ]

But sometimes these expressions are written in terms of d, not |d|. Since d is the vector from the retarded position to r, |d| is its magnitude, and d̂ is its unit vector. So, the denominator can be written as (d ⋅ (d/|d| ) - d ⋅ v/c ) = |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c. So either form is acceptable, but perhaps the standard way is to write:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

Similarly for A:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

But in some references, they write the denominator as |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ), which is equivalent. So both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) / ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c )

Vector potential A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v / (4π)) / ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c )

But I need to check the exact form. Let me recall the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

In standard textbooks (e.g., Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics), the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( (1 - n ⋅ β ) |r - r_s| ) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr

A(r, t) = (μ₀ c / (4π)) * [ q β / ( (1 - n ⋅ β ) |r - r_s| ) ] evaluated at tr

Here, n is the unit vector from the source position r_s(tr) to the field point r, so n = (r - r_s(tr)) / |r - r_s(tr)| = d̂. β is v/c, where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. So, substituting these, we get:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ) ) ]

A = (μ₀ c / (4π)) * [ q (v/c) / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ) ) ]

Simplifying A:

A = (μ₀ q v / (4π)) / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c ) )

Which is the same as:

A = (μ₀ q v / (4π)) / ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c )

Since (d̂ ⋅ v)/c multiplied by |d| is (d ⋅ v)/c.

Therefore, both potentials can be written with the denominator |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c. So the final expressions are:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε₀ ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

A(r, t) = [ μ₀ q v ] / [4π ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

These are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. Therefore, the answer should be these expressions.

But let me check whether the denominator is indeed |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c. In other words, is the term (d ⋅ v)/c, or (d ⋅ β ), where β = v/c. Yes, since β = v/c, so (d ⋅ β ) = (d ⋅ v)/c, so the denominator is |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c. Correct.

Thus, the scalar and vector potentials are as above.

Another point to verify: the denominator is evaluated at the retarded time. All quantities in the potentials (d, v) are evaluated at tr. So, to be precise, d = r - s(tr), and v is the velocity at tr. But in the problem statement, they've already defined d as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, and v as the velocity at tr. Therefore, using those definitions, the expressions are correct.

Therefore, the answer is:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = q / [4πε₀ ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

Vector potential A(r, t) = μ₀ q v / [4π ( |d| - (d ⋅ v)/c ) ]

But in LaTeX:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}

But in the problem statement, the user specifies to use c, ε₀, μ₀. So, yes, these are the correct expressions. Therefore, the answer is these two equations.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]
where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).

\boxed{
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right), \quad
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right)
