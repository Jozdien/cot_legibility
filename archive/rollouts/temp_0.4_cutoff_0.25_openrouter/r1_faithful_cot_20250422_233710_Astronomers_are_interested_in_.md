Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and the same mass ratio, and both stars radiate as black bodies with the same observed peak wavelengths, we need to determine the luminosity ratio considering their radial velocities.

1. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity \( L \) is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \).
2. **Wien's Law**: The peak wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature \( T \).
3. **Doppler Shift**: The observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is affected by the radial velocity \( v \).

**Key Steps**:
- Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we must correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures.
- For Star_1 (radial velocity 0 km/s), the emitted wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{emit1}} \) is the same as the observed wavelength.
- For Star_2 (radial velocity 700 km/s), the emitted wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{emit2}} \) is calculated using the Doppler shift formula:
  \[
  \lambda_{\text{emit2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}
  \]
- Using Wien's Law, the temperatures are related by:
  \[
  T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
  \]
- The luminosity ratio \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \) is:
  \[
  \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}\right)^4
  \]

**Calculations**:
- Convert \( v = 700 \) km/s to a fraction of the speed of light \( c \):
  \[
  \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
  \]
- Compute the factor:
  \[
  \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)^4 \approx (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009366
  \]
- The luminosity ratio:
  \[
  \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009366} \approx 2.23
  \]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of \(\boxed{2.23}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. Both stars are radiating as black bodies, and some parameters are given. Let me start by recalling what determines the luminosity of a star when treated as a black body. 

From what I remember, the luminosity (L) of a star depends on its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature. 

Now, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, does mass directly affect the luminosity here? Well, in stars, mass does play a role in determining things like temperature and lifespan, but since we're treating them as black bodies and given that they've found the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe the mass isn't directly needed here? Hmm, maybe I need to check that. 

The problem also mentions that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) for both stars are the same. From Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of the black body: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, that implies that the temperatures of both stars are the same. Wait, but if that's the case, then the temperatures cancel out when taking the ratio of luminosities. Let me confirm that. 

If λ_max1 = λ_max2, then by Wien's Law: b / T1 = b / T2 ⇒ T1 = T2. So, both stars have the same temperature. Therefore, when calculating the ratio L1 / L2, since L ∝ R² T⁴, and T is the same for both, the ratio becomes (R1 / R2)². 

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1 / L2 = (1.5)² = 2.25. So, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. 

Wait a minute, but the problem also mentions their masses. Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Does that affect anything here? In the context of black body radiation, if we're only considering luminosity based on radius and temperature, then mass might not directly come into play. However, maybe there's a detail I'm missing. For example, if the stars are moving, could their velocities affect the observed luminosity? 

The problem also states that the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Well, if a star is moving towards or away from us, there could be a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. However, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. 

Wait, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that might Doppler shift its emitted wavelengths. But the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So does that mean that the actual rest frame peak wavelengths of the stars are different, but due to the Doppler shift, they appear the same to the observers? 

Oh, this is a crucial point! The observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) is affected by the Doppler effect. The formula for the Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). But wait, actually, the exact formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer. If the radial velocity is positive (receding), the wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if it's negative (approaching), the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). 

But in the problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." It doesn't specify direction, but typically radial velocity is given with a sign. However, since it's written as 0 and 700 km/s, maybe they just gave the speed, not the direction. But usually, radial velocity is given with a sign, where positive is receding. But given that it's not specified here, maybe we need to assume that Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s relative to the observer. However, the problem says "radial velocity", which is the component along the line of sight. 

But regardless, the key point is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. However, the actual emitted peak wavelengths (in the rest frame of each star) would be different if their velocities cause a Doppler shift. 

Wait, but the problem states: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But because of the Doppler shift, the actual emitted peak wavelengths (in the stars' rest frames) would be different. 

Therefore, using Wien's law, we need to correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures of the stars. Then, use those temperatures in the Stefan-Boltzmann law to compute the luminosity ratio. 

So, the steps are:

1. For each star, compute the rest frame peak wavelength (λ_emitted) from the observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) using Doppler shift.

2. Use Wien's law to find the temperature of each star.

3. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to compute the luminosity ratio.

But since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but different radial velocities, their emitted peak wavelengths would be different. 

Let me formalize this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s. So, its observed peak wavelength λ_obs1 is equal to its emitted peak wavelength λ_emit1. 

For Star_2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume that this velocity is along the line of sight. If the velocity is away from us (positive), then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). If it's towards us (negative velocity), then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). However, the problem doesn't specify the direction, but since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, not -700 km/s, it might be assumed to be moving away. But in astronomy, radial velocities can be either positive (receding) or negative (approaching). Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to check if the direction affects the calculation. 

Wait, but regardless of direction, since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Therefore, for Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs1. For Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) if moving away, or λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) or λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c). 

However, without knowing the direction of the velocity (whether it's redshifted or blueshifted), we can't be sure. But given that the velocity is given as 700 km/s (positive), which is a high velocity, but in reality, stars in the galaxy typically have velocities much lower compared to the speed of light. However, this is a problem, so maybe we just have to take the given velocity as the radial velocity, and use the Doppler shift formula. 

Wait, but the exact Doppler shift formula for relativistic speeds is different, but 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (~300,000 km/s), so we can use the non-relativistic approximation: 

λ_obs / λ_emit = 1 + v/c 

where v is positive if the source is moving away, negative if moving towards. 

Since the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. If Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). If moving towards, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). But since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, which have different velocities. 

Wait, for Star_1, λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since v1=0). For Star_2, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) if moving away, or λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. 

But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, λ_obs (Star_1) = λ_obs (Star_2) = λ_obs. 

Therefore, the actual emitted peak wavelengths are:

Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs

Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) [if moving away]

or

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c) [if moving towards]

But the problem doesn't specify the direction. However, given that radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (though still non-relativistic, 700/300,000 ≈ 0.0023), but in any case, the problem might be expecting us to use the Doppler shift formula. 

But since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted ones differ due to Doppler shift, then we can relate the temperatures of the stars through Wien's law. 

Wien's law states that λ_emit * T = constant (b). Therefore, for each star:

λ_emit1 * T1 = b

λ_emit2 * T2 = b

Therefore, λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = T2 / T1

But from Doppler shift:

For Star_2, assuming it's moving away:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

But λ_obs is equal to λ_emit1 (since Star_1's emitted is equal to observed). Therefore:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

So:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = (1 + v2/c)

From Wien's law:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but wait. Let's be precise.

For Star_1:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since v1=0)

T1 = b / λ_emit1

For Star_2:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) ⇒ λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ_obs

But since T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c) if Star_2 is moving away. If Star_2 is moving towards, then it would be (1 - v2/c), but since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, and the problem doesn't specify direction, but in astronomy, positive radial velocity usually means moving away. However, the problem doesn't specify, which is confusing. Wait, but the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." It doesn't say positive or negative. Maybe in this context, they just state the magnitude, but we need to consider the direction. However, since they are calculating radial velocities, which are typically signed quantities, but here they are given as 0 and 700 km/s. If Star_2 has a higher radial velocity, but without a sign, perhaps we need to assume it's moving away. But given that they found the peak wavelengths to be the same, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength would be blueshifted compared to the observed, wait no: wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the emitted wavelength is shorter. Wait, let's clarify.

If a star is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer than emitted: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). Therefore, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). Conversely, if moving towards (v negative), λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - |v|/c), so λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 - |v|/c). 

But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ_emit1 = λ_obs. For Star_2, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) if moving away, or λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v/c) if moving towards. 

Therefore, depending on the direction, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is either smaller or larger than Star_1's. 

But since Wien's law relates the emitted wavelength to temperature: T = b / λ_emit, so if λ_emit2 is smaller, then T2 is higher, and vice versa. 

Therefore, if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c), so T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b (1 + v/c) / λ_obs. But since T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 (1 + v/c). Therefore, T2 is higher than T1. 

If Star_2 is moving towards (v negative), then λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - |v|/c) = λ_obs / (1 + |v|/c) if v is negative. Wait, no: if velocity is negative (towards), then λ_obs = λ_emit2 (1 + v/c) where v is negative. So let's write it as:

v2 = -700 km/s (moving towards). Then λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700/c). Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c). Then T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) ) = b (1 - 700/c)/λ_obs = T1 (1 - 700/c). Therefore, T2 would be lower than T1. 

But the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So regardless of the actual direction, the calculation would have to account for the Doppler shift in order to find the actual temperature. 

But the problem does not specify the direction of the radial velocity. However, given that it's 700 km/s, which is a substantial velocity, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths appeared the same. If the astronomers are calculating the luminosity, they would need to correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperature of the stars. 

But here's the thing: the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So, the astronomers are taking into account the Doppler shift when calculating the luminosity. Therefore, even though the observed peak wavelengths are the same, they know that due to the radial velocity, the actual temperatures might be different, so they correct for that. 

Therefore, we need to compute the luminosity ratio considering both the radius ratio and the temperature ratio, where the temperatures are determined by correcting the observed peak wavelength for Doppler shift. 

So, let's formalize this:

Given:

- R1 = 1.5 R2

- M1 = 1.5 M2 (but mass might not be directly necessary here)

- λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_obs

- v1 = 0 km/s, v2 = 700 km/s

Assuming black body radiation, the astronomers would use Wien's law and Doppler shift to find the temperatures.

For Star_1:

Since v1 = 0, λ_emit1 = λ_obs

Therefore, T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

For Star_2:

They observe λ_obs, but need to compute λ_emit2 considering its velocity. 

Assuming that the velocity is radial, the Doppler shift formula (non-relativistic) is:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

Solving for λ_emit2:

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But wait, the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." If the radial velocity is positive, that implies Star_2 is moving away, so the Doppler formula applies as above. If it were moving towards, the velocity would be negative, and the formula would be λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 - |v2|/c). However, since the problem states the radial velocity as 700 km/s without a sign, we might need to assume the standard convention where positive velocity is receding. Therefore, we can take v2 as +700 km/s. 

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Now, the luminosity ratio is:

L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, and T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

Therefore:

L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴

But we need to compute this factor. Let's plug in the numbers.

First, convert v2 to a fraction of the speed of light:

v2 = 700 km/s

c = 3 x 10^5 km/s

Therefore, v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333...

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333...

Therefore, (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴ ≈ (1 / 1.002333)^4 ≈ (approx 0.99767)^4 ≈ ?

Calculating this:

First, 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997668

Then, raising to the 4th power:

0.997668^2 ≈ 0.99534

Then, 0.99534^2 ≈ 0.9907

So approximately 0.9907

Therefore, L1 / L2 ≈ (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. 

But wait, this is an approximation. Maybe we should calculate it more precisely. Let's compute v2/c:

v2 = 700 km/s

c = 300,000 km/s

v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333333...

So, 1 + v2/c = 1.002333333...

Thus, 1 / (1 + v2/c) = 1 / 1.002333333... ≈ 0.997668

Now, (0.997668)^4:

First, square it: (0.997668)^2

0.997668 * 0.997668

Compute 0.997668 * 0.997668:

Let me compute this:

Let x = 0.997668

x * x = (1 - 0.002332)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002332 + (0.002332)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004664 + 0.00000543 ≈ 0.995341

But precise calculation:

0.997668 * 0.997668:

Multiply 997668 * 997668:

But maybe better to compute step by step:

0.997668 * 0.997668:

First, 1 * 1 = 1

Then, subtract 0.002332 * 1 + 0.002332 * 1 - (0.002332)^2

Wait, perhaps better to use the formula (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b² where a=1, b=0.002332

So, (1 - 0.002332)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002332 + (0.002332)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004664 + 0.00000543 ≈ 0.99534143

Therefore, (0.997668)^2 ≈ 0.995341

Then, squaring that: (0.995341)^2

Again, approximate:

(1 - 0.004659)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004659 + (0.004659)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009318 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9907037

Therefore, (0.997668)^4 ≈ 0.9907037

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is:

(1.5)^2 * 0.9907037 = 2.25 * 0.9907037 ≈ 2.22908

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23. 

But the question says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the answer is approximately 2.25 * (1 / (1 + 700/c))^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. 

But given that the options might expect an exact expression, maybe we need to keep it in terms of 1.5² / (1 + 700/c)^4. But since 700/c is 7/3000, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift effect? Wait, but the problem explicitly mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler shift must be considered. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same, leading to a factor of 2.25, but actually, because of the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different, leading to a slightly lower factor. 

But if we were to ignore the Doppler shift (which would be incorrect), the factor would be 2.25. However, the radial velocity is given, so we must consider it. 

But let's check if the problem expects a precise calculation or an approximate one. Since 700 km/s is much less than c, the factor (1 + v/c) is small, so maybe the problem expects us to approximate that the Doppler effect is negligible? But 700 km/s is 0.233% of the speed of light, which might lead to a small but non-negligible effect. 

Wait, let's compute (1 + 700/c)^4:

700 / c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333

So, (1 + 0.0023333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.0023333 + 6*(0.0023333)^2 + 4*(0.0023333)^3 + (0.0023333)^4

Using the binomial expansion:

≈ 1 + 0.0093333 + 6*(0.000005444) + 4*(0.0000000127) + 0.0000000003

≈ 1 + 0.0093333 + 0.000032666 + 0.0000000508 + 0.0000000003

≈ 1.009366

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009366, so 1 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.009366 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. 

But in the options, maybe it's given as (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4, but since 700/c is small, perhaps the answer is approximately 2.25. However, given that the calculation shows it's about 2.23, but maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift because it's small? 

Wait, but the problem specifically mentions that the radial velocities are different and the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, the astronomers would have to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating the luminosity. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.25 multiplied by (1 / (1 + v/c))^4. 

But maybe the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift? Let me check the question again:

"Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the key point is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. If they are computing the luminosity, they have to consider the actual temperature, which requires correcting for the Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer should take into account the Doppler shift. 

Therefore, the correct factor is (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.23. However, given that the problem might expect an exact expression, or maybe they want us to ignore the Doppler shift because 700 km/s is too small, but that seems unlikely because radial velocity is given. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to realize that the temperatures are the same because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but that would be incorrect because the observed wavelengths are affected by Doppler shift. So the actual temperatures are different. 

Wait, but another way: if the astronomers are calculating the luminosity, they have to figure out the intrinsic luminosity, which depends on the actual temperature and radius. The observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler shift, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. 

Wait, no. Luminosity is the total power emitted by the star, which depends on its actual radius and temperature. However, if the star is moving, relativistic effects could in principle affect the observed luminosity, but luminosity is an intrinsic quantity. Wait, no. Actually, the luminosity as measured by an observer might be affected by relativistic Doppler shifting and beaming effects, but when astronomers calculate the intrinsic luminosity, they correct for such effects. 

So, the intrinsic luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the effective temperature in the star's rest frame. 

Therefore, if the observed peak wavelength is affected by Doppler shift, astronomers would need to determine the rest-frame temperature of each star. 

Given that, the steps are:

For Star_1: v1 = 0, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs. Therefore, T1 = b / λ_emit1.

For Star_2: λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) ⇒ λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Therefore, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b*(1 + v2/c)/λ_obs = T1*(1 + v2/c).

Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). 

Therefore, the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2² ) * ( T1⁴ / (T1*(1 + v2/c))⁴ ) = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )

Which is 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4. 

As calculated before, this is approximately 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.23. 

But since the problem gives the radial velocity as 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, but actually, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Wait, no, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333. 

So, same as before. 

But perhaps the problem is designed to have a certain answer. Let me check whether 700 km/s is a typo or not. But given that, the answer is approximately 2.25 divided by (1.002333)^4. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity, but luminosity is intrinsic. Wait, no. Luminosity is intrinsic, so it's calculated based on the star's actual radius and temperature. The observed flux is affected by distance and Doppler effects, but luminosity is not. Therefore, if the astronomers are calculating the luminosity, they need to determine the actual temperature (correcting for Doppler shift) and use the actual radius. 

Therefore, the answer should be 2.25 divided by (1 + v/c)^4. But since the velocity is 700 km/s, which is 0.233% of c, the denominator is (1 + 0.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0094, so the answer is approximately 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23. 

But since the problem is multiple choice, perhaps the answer is 5.06, but that seems unlikely. Wait, let's think again. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering that the luminosity ratio involves both the mass and radius? But the problem says that the mass is 1.5 times larger for Star_1, but in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the mass isn't directly involved. Unless the mass affects the temperature through some relation. 

In main-sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter, but this is a proportionality based on the mass-luminosity relation, which says L ∝ M^3 or something like that. But the problem states to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so we shouldn't use the mass-luminosity relation, which is an empirical relation for main-sequence stars. 

Therefore, the problem gives mass but it's irrelevant? Because if they radiate as black bodies, and we have their radii and temperatures, then mass doesn't factor into the luminosity calculation. So the mention of mass might be a red herring. 

Therefore, the answer is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. 

But T1/T2 is 1 / (1 + v/c). 

So, (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + 700/c))^4 ≈ 2.25 * (1 / 1.00233)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. 

But maybe the problem expects an exact answer without considering the Doppler shift, which would be 2.25. However, given that the radial velocity is provided, and the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler shift must be considered. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Let's check that. 

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But for non-relativistic speeds (v << c), this approximates to 1 + v/c. 

Given that 700 km/s is 0.233% of c, the relativistic correction is negligible. For example, sqrt( (1 + 0.00233)/(1 - 0.00233) ) ≈ sqrt(1.00233 / 0.99767) ≈ sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00233, which is the same as the non-relativistic approximation. Therefore, the difference is negligible. 

Therefore, even using the relativistic formula, the result is approximately the same. 

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.25 * (1 / 1.00233)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. 

But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers without plugging in the speed of light. Let's see:

L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4. 

But since c is a constant, but the problem doesn't give a numerical value for c, so they might expect to leave it in terms of c. However, in the context of an exam problem, they might have intended for you to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocities are small, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25. 

But given that the problem explicitly mentions the radial velocities and that the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same, it's clear that the Doppler shift must be considered. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.23. 

However, since the problem is likely multiple choice, and given the options, 2.25 is a possible answer, but the correct calculation gives approximately 2.23. But maybe the problem rounds the Doppler factor to 1, considering it's negligible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly conflating the mass-luminosity relation with the black body formula. The mass-luminosity relation states that L ∝ M^3 for main-sequence stars, but the problem says to assume black body radiation. Therefore, mass is not needed. 

Wait, but if the problem mentions mass, maybe it's a distractor. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the mass and radius to determine the temperature via some relation, but for black bodies, unless specified, we don't have a direct relation between mass and temperature. 

Given all this, I think the intended answer is 2.25, assuming that the temperatures are the same because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but that's incorrect because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. However, if the problem expects the answer 2.25, then maybe that's the case. But given that the radial velocity is given, I think the correct answer is approximately 2.23, but since in a test setting, exact calculation might be needed. 

Alternatively, perhaps they expect you to calculate the factor using the exact values:

v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333

(1 + v/c)^4 = (1.002333)^4

Let's compute this exactly:

First, 1.002333^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144

Then, squaring that result: (1.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0093647

Thus, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. 

But since the problem is likely multiple choice, and given that 2.23 is close to 2.25, but if the options are given to two decimal places, 2.23 might be the answer. However, if the options are fractions, perhaps 81/16 or something, but that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25. 

But why would they mention the radial velocities if not to have us consider the Doppler shift? It's possible that the problem is testing whether we recognize that the Doppler shift affects the observed peak wavelength, and thus the inferred temperature. 

Therefore, considering all of this, the correct factor is approximately 2.23. However, since we don't have options, but need to provide a box answer, perhaps the problem expects the exact expression, which is (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4. But since c is known, we can compute it as a numerical factor. 

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is given in another unit. Wait, 700 km/s. Let's confirm the calculation:

v = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333

Thus, (1 + v/c) = 1.0023333

Therefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009366

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. 

But if the problem is from an exam, and the options are given, and 2.25 is an option, and 2.23 is another, then 2.23 would be the correct one. But since we have to write the box answer, and the calculation gives approximately 2.23, but let me see if there's a precise way to compute this. 

Alternatively, using logarithms:

ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233 (since for small x, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...)

So, ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233 - (0.00233)^2 / 2 + (0.00233)^3 / 3 ≈ 0.00233 - 0.0000027 + 0.000000004 ≈ approximately 0.0023273

Therefore, 4 * ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.009309

Exponentiating: e^(0.009309) ≈ 1.00936, which matches our previous result. 

Thus, again, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229. 

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 2.23. Rounded to three significant figures, 2.23. 

But perhaps the answer is simply 2.25, and the radial velocity is a red herring. However, given the problem explicitly mentions radial velocities and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler shift must be considered. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be approximately 2.23. However, since the problem might expect an exact symbolic expression, but given the numbers, it's a numerical factor. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in error and expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. But given the data, I think we should consider it. 

Therefore, after careful consideration, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, given that the problem might require an exact answer, and in the absence of options, I'll go with the exact expression:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4

But since c is 3e5 km/s, 700/c = 700/3e5 = 7/3000. Therefore,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1 + 7/3000)^4

If we compute this exactly:

(307/300)^4 = (300 +7)^4 / 300^4

But this is complex. Alternatively, express as a decimal:

(1 + 7/3000) = 1.002333...

So, 1.002333333^4 ≈ 1.009366

Therefore, 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229

But since we need to present the answer as a factor, and the problem might expect a fractional answer or a decimal. Given that, and that 2.229 is closest to 2.25, but not exactly. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the calculation without considering the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25. But that seems incorrect. 

Given the problem's context and that it's for an exam, I think the answer is 2.25, but with the information given, the correct calculation leads to approximately 2.23. However, since the user hasn't provided options, but asks for the answer in a box, I need to check if fractional exponents are possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the temperature ratio is squared?

Wait, let's double-check the calculation:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

T1 is from Star_1's rest frame, T2 from Star_2's rest frame. 

From earlier:

T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)

Therefore, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)

Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4

Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229

So, approximately 2.23. 

But since precise calculation is needed, and in the absence of options, I think the answer is approximately 2.23. However, the problem might expect the answer as (3/2)^2 / ( (1 + 700/c)^4 ). But since c is 3e5 km/s, 700/c = 7/3000, so:

Factor = (9/4) / ( (3007/3000)^4 )

But this is an exact expression, but unlikely to be the expected answer. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. 

But given that this is a calculation where the Doppler effect is minimal, and if the problem is from a textbook chapter that hasn't covered Doppler shift in luminosity calculations, the intended answer might still be 2.25. 

However, given all the steps and the problem's mention of radial velocity, I must conclude that the correct factor is approximately 2.23. 

But since in the calculation, using the exact values, it's approximately 2.23, but this is not a nice number. However, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the velocity leads to a higher temperature for Star_2, thus making its luminosity higher, but since Star_1 is larger in radius, the net effect is Star_1 being more luminous. 

Wait, but in our calculation, L1/L2 is 2.25 / 1.0093 ≈ 2.23, which is a slight reduction from 2.25 due to Star_2 being hotter. 

But if the Doppler shift wasn't considered, L1/L2 would be 2.25. 

Given that, perhaps the problem is designed to have us answer 2.25, with the mention of radial velocity being a distractor. However, I think that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the computed the luminosity, considering the Doppler shift, so that the ratio is higher. Wait, no: if Star_2 is moving away, its temperature is higher in the rest frame, so its luminosity would be higher. Wait, no: L is proportional to R² T⁴. If Star_2 has a higher temperature but smaller radius, the ratio depends on both. 

Wait, Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v/c))^4. Since (1 + v/c) > 1, then L1/L2 < 2.25. Therefore, the factor is less than 2.25. 

But our calculation gave approximately 2.23, which is less than 2.25. 

However, if the problem expects a whole number or a simple fraction, 2.23 is not one. But maybe the answer is 81/16, which is 5.0625, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass in the luminosity calculation. But in black body radiation, mass isn't a factor. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3) combined with the black body radiation. But that would be conflicting assumptions. 

If we assume L ∝ M^3, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^3 = 3.375. But since they also give radii and temperatures, this is inconsistent. 

Alternatively, if the problem is combining both the mass-luminosity relation and the black body law, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the ratio of the observed fluxes, but the question says luminosity, which is intrinsic. 

Therefore, given all this, I think the intended answer is 2.25, but the correct answer considering Doppler shift is approximately 2.23. However, since the problem mentions radial velocity, the astronomers would have to correct for it, leading to the 2.23 factor. 

But since this is a calculation without given options, and the instructions are to provide the answer in a box, I will go with the exact calculation: 

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229, which rounds to \boxed{2.23}

However, depending on the problem's expectation, it might be \boxed{2.25} if Doppler shift is ignored. But given the radial velocity information, I think 2.23 is correct. 

But to check once more: if the Doppler shift is ignored, then T1 = T2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. 

But the problem states that the astronomers calculated the radial velocities and found the peak wavelengths to be the same. Therefore, they must have corrected for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures. Therefore, the answer considering Doppler shift is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.23}

But since precise calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is 2.23 when rounded to two decimal places, but in exams, sometimes significant figures are considered. The given values (1.5, 700) have two significant figures. Therefore, 700 km/s is two sig figs, 1.5 is two sig figs, speed of light is exact, so the answer should be two sig figs. 

2.229 rounded to two sig figs is 2.2. But 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is three sig figs. However, since 700 is two sig figs, the answer should be two sig figs. Therefore, 2.2. 

But this is getting too into the weeds. Given that, perhaps the problem expects 2.25. But given the strict calculation, it's 2.23. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in error, or I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify once more:

v = 700 km/s = 0.7 * 10^3 km/s

c = 3 * 10^5 km/s

v/c = 0.7 / 300 = 0.002333...

1 + v/c = 1.002333...

(1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.009366

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

Yes, this is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. Hence, the factor is \boxed{2.23}.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.23}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. Both stars are radiating as black bodies, and some parameters are given. Let me start by recalling what determines the luminosity of a star when treated as a black body. 

From what I remember, the luminosity (L) of a star depends on its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature. 

Now, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, does mass directly affect the luminosity here? Well, in stars, mass does play a role in determining things like temperature and lifespan, but since we're treating them as black bodies and given that they've found the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe the mass isn't directly needed here? Hmm, maybe I need to check that. 

The problem also mentions that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) for both stars are the same. From Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of the black body: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, that implies that the temperatures of both stars are the same. Wait, but if that's the case, then the temperatures cancel out when taking the ratio of luminosities. Let me confirm that. 

If λ_max1 = λ_max2, then by Wien's Law: b / T1 = b / T2 ⇒ T1 = T2. So, both stars have the same temperature. Therefore, when calculating the ratio L1 / L2, since L ∝ R² T⁴, and T is the same for both, the ratio becomes (R1 / R2)². 

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1 / L2 = (1.5)² = 2.25. So, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. 

Wait a minute, but the problem also mentions their masses. Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Does that affect anything here? In the context of black body radiation, if we're only considering luminosity based on radius and temperature, then mass might not directly come into play. However, maybe there's a detail I'm missing. For example, if the stars are moving, could their velocities affect the observed luminosity? 

The problem also states that the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Well, if a star is moving towards or away from us, there could be a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. However, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. 

Wait, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that might Doppler shift its emitted wavelengths. But the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So does that mean that the actual rest frame peak wavelengths of the stars are different, but due to the Doppler shift, they appear the same to the observers? 

Oh, this is a crucial point! The observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) is affected by the Doppler effect. The formula for the Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). But wait, actually, the exact formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer. If the radial velocity is positive (receding), the wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if it's negative (approaching), the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). 

But in the problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." It doesn't specify direction, but typically radial velocity is given with a sign. However, since it's written as 0 and 700 km/s, maybe they just gave the speed, not the direction. But usually, radial velocity is given with a sign, where positive is receding. But given that it's not specified here, maybe we need to assume that Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s relative to the observer. However, the problem says "radial velocity", which is the component along the line of sight. 

But regardless, the key point is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. However, the actual emitted peak wavelengths (in the rest frame of each star) would be different if their velocities cause a Doppler shift. 

Wait, but the problem states: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But because of the Doppler shift, the actual emitted peak wavelengths (in the stars' rest frames) would be different. 

Therefore, using Wien's law, we need to correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures of the stars. Then, use those temperatures in the Stefan-Boltzmann law to compute the luminosity ratio. 

So, the steps are:

1. For each star, compute the rest frame peak wavelength (λ_emitted) from the observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) using Doppler shift.

2. Use Wien's law to find the temperature of each star.

3. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to compute the luminosity ratio.

But since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but different radial velocities, their emitted peak wavelengths would be different. 

Let me formalize this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s. So, its observed peak wavelength λ_obs1 is equal to its emitted peak wavelength λ_emit1. 

For Star_2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume that this velocity is along the line of sight. If the velocity is away from us (positive), then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). If it's towards us (negative velocity), then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). However, the problem doesn't specify the direction, but since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, not -700 km/s, it might be assumed to be moving away. But in astronomy, radial velocities can be either positive (receding) or negative (approaching). Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to check if the direction affects the calculation. 

Wait, but regardless of direction, since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Therefore, for Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs1. For Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) if moving away, or λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) or λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c). 

However, without knowing the direction of the velocity (whether it's redshifted or blueshifted), we can't be sure. But given that the velocity is given as 700 km/s (positive), which is a high velocity, but in reality, stars in the galaxy typically have velocities much lower compared to the speed of light. However, this is a problem, so maybe we just have to take the given velocity as the radial velocity, and use the Doppler shift formula. 

Wait, but the exact Doppler shift formula for relativistic speeds is different, but 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (~300,000 km/s), so we can use the non-relativistic approximation: 

λ_obs / λ_emit = 1 + v/c 

where v is positive if the source is moving away, negative if moving towards. 

Since the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. If Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). If moving towards, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). But since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, which have different velocities. 

Wait, for Star_1, λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since v1=0). For Star_2, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) if moving away, or λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. 

But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, λ_obs (Star_1) = λ_obs (Star_2) = λ_obs. 

Therefore, the actual emitted peak wavelengths are:

Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs

Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) [if moving away]

or

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c) [if moving towards]

But the problem doesn't specify the direction. However, given that radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (though still non-relativistic, 700/300,000 ≈ 0.0023), but in any case, the problem might be expecting us to use the Doppler shift formula. 

But since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted ones differ due to Doppler shift, then we can relate the temperatures of the stars through Wien's law. 

Wien's law states that λ_emit * T = constant (b). Therefore, for each star:

λ_emit1 * T1 = b

λ_emit2 * T2 = b

Therefore, λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = T2 / T1

But from Doppler shift:

For Star_2, assuming it's moving away:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

But λ_obs is equal to λ_emit1 (since Star_1's emitted is equal to observed). Therefore:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

So:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = (1 + v2/c)

From Wien's law:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but wait. Let's be precise.

For Star_1:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since v1=0)

T1 = b / λ_emit1

For Star_2:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) ⇒ λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ_obs

But since T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

I need to determine by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2. Both stars are treated as black bodies, with certain parameters provided.

The luminosity (L) of a star functioning as a black body is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T), as expressed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ represents the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

According to the information provided, Star_1 has both a radius and mass 1.5 times greater than Star_2. While mass influences characteristics like temperature and lifespan in stars, it may not directly impact luminosity in our black body model, especially considering that the peak wavelengths are identical.

The problem states that both stars have the same peak wavelengths (λ_max). According to Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature: λ_max = b/T, with b being Wien's displacement constant. Since the peak wavelengths are equal, one might initially conclude that the temperatures are also equal. If temperatures were identical, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would simplify to (R1/R2)², resulting in (1.5)² = 2.25.

However, an important detail is that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s while Star_2 moves at 700 km/s. This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. The problem indicates that astronomers found the observed peak wavelengths to be identical, but due to the Doppler effect, the emitted wavelengths in each star's rest frame would differ.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: λ_observed = λ_emitted × (1 + v/c), where v is positive for objects moving away (redshift) and negative for objects approaching (blueshift). Since Star_1 isn't moving relative to us, its emitted and observed wavelengths are equal: λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

For Star_2, assuming it's moving away from us (positive radial velocity): λ_obs = λ_emit2 × (1 + v2/c), which means λ_emit2 = λ_obs/(1 + v2/c).

Since the observed wavelengths are identical for both stars (λ_obs), but Star_2's emitted wavelength differs due to its motion, we can use Wien's Law to relate their temperatures.

For Star_1: T1 = b/λ_emit1 = b/λ_obs
For Star_2: T2 = b/λ_emit2 = b/(λ_obs/(1 + v2/c)) = (b/λ_obs) × (1 + v2/c) = T1 × (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, Star_2's temperature exceeds Star_1's by a factor of (1 + v2/c).

Alright, I need to determine by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 surpasses that of Star_2. Both stars are considered to be radiating as black bodies, so I should recall what influences luminosity under this condition. 

From what I know, a star's luminosity (L) is dependent on its radius (R) and surface temperature (T), with the Stefan-Boltzmann law providing the formula: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature raised to the fourth power. 

The problem specifies that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Additionally, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But, does mass affect luminosity directly in this context? While mass influences temperature and lifespan in stars, given that the stars are black bodies and both have the same peak wavelength, mass might not be directly relevant here. I need to verify this. 

It's also mentioned that both stars have the same peak wavelength (λ_max). According to Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely related to temperature: λ_max = b / T. Thus, both stars having the same peak wavelength suggests they share the same temperature. If so, the temperatures will cancel out in the luminosity ratio. Let’s check this. 

Given λ_max1 = λ_max2, by Wien's Law, b / T1 = b / T2, implying T1 = T2. Both stars have the same temperature. Therefore, when calculating L1 / L2, because L ∝ R² T⁴ and T is identical for both, the ratio reduces to (R1 / R2)². 

With R1 = 1.5 R2, hence L1 / L2 = (1.5)² = 2.25. So, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. 

But, what about their masses? Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Does this impact the outcome here? In terms of black body radiation and focusing on luminosity based on radius and temperature, mass may not be directly involved. Could there be something I'm overlooking? For instance, if the stars move, could velocities alter perceived luminosity?

The problem also specifies that Star_1 and Star_2 have radial velocities of 0 km/s and 700 km/s, respectively. Radial velocity affects motion along the line of sight. But how does this influence luminosity? A star's motion towards or away from us alters observed wavelengths through Doppler shift. However, the problem states the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and they are equal.

If Star_2 moves at 700 km/s, that could Doppler shift its emitted wavelengths. Yet, the observed wavelengths remain identical. So, does this imply their actual rest frame peak wavelengths differ, but appear the same to observers due to the Doppler shift?

This is crucial! The observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) is subject to the Doppler effect. The Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if receding). However, the formula varies depending on the direction of travel. When radial velocity is positive (moving away), the wavelength lengthens (redshifted); when negative (approaching), it shortens (blueshifted).

But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s" for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively, without specifying direction. Typically, radial velocity includes a sign, but here, only the speed is given. Assuming Star_2 moves at 700 km/s relative to the observer seems reasonable. Again, "radial velocity" refers to the component along the line of sight.

Yet, the observed peak wavelengths are identical for both stars. The actual emitted wavelengths differ due to the Doppler shift, suggesting they are distinct in each star's rest frame.

Let's formalize this. Denote:

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s, meaning λ_obs1 equals its emitted λ_emit1.

For Star_2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Assuming motion along the line of sight, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) if moving away, or λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c) if approaching. Without direction specified, we might presume it's moving away, as positive velocities typically imply recession. Yet, in astronomy, they also indicate direction, either receding or approaching.

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, hence, for Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs1. Additionally, for Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) or λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c).

Thus, understanding their actual rest frame emitted wavelengths would show differences due to Doppler effects, despite observed equality. Hence, using Wien's law and adjusting for the Doppler shift can determine the stars' actual temperatures. That correction feeds into the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the luminosity ratio. 

Steps:

1. Determine each star's rest frame peak wavelength (λ_emitted) from the observed peak wavelength (λ_observed) using the Doppler shift.

2. Apply Wien's law for each star's temperature.

3. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the luminosity ratio.

Given the same observed peak wavelength but differing radial velocities, their emitted peaks differ.

Formalization:

- Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

- Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) [if moving away] or λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c) [if approaching].

Direction aside, since the observed wavelengths are equal but emitted ones vary due to Doppler effects, relate their temperatures using Wien's law. 

Wien’s law tells us λ_emit * T = constant (b). Therefore, for both stars: 

λ_emit1 * T1 = b

λ_emit2 * T2 = b

Thus, λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 gives T2 / T1. With the Doppler shift:

Star_2, moving away:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

Since λ_obs equals λ_emit1 (Star_1’s emitted matching observed), derive:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

So:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = (1 + v2/c)

Using Wien’s law:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 yields T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

Hence, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Accurate calculation:

For Star_1:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs (v1=0)

T1 = b / λ_emit1

For Star_2:

λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) ⇒ λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ_obs

Given T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Hence, continue from here.

But the problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. However, radial velocity convention is that positive velocity means moving away. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, then it is moving away, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). If it\'s moving towards, it would be negative velocity. But since the problem states 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it\'s moving away. \n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nBut wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different. But according to this, T2 is higher than T1. However, the problem says Star_1 has larger radius and mass. But we need to compute luminosity. \n\nSo, let\'s compute the luminosity ratio L1 / L2. \n\nLuminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. Therefore, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)\n\nBut we have R1 = 1.5 R2\n\nT2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore,\n\nL1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1.5² * R2² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T1^4) * 1 / (1 + v2/c)^4\n\n= 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4\n\nSo, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4\n\nNow, plug in v2 = 700 km/s. We need to express this in terms of the speed of light c. \n\nThe speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nSo, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4\n\nWe can compute this using the binomial approximation since v2/c is small:\n\n(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for x << 1\n\nSo, (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333\n\nBut let\'s compute it more accurately:\n\nFirst, 0.002333^1 = 0.002333\n\n0.002333^2 ≈ 0.000005444\n\n0.002333^3 ≈ 0.0000000127\n\n0.002333^4 ≈ 0.0000000000296\n\nSo, (1 + 0.002333)^4 = 1 + 4*0.002333 + 6*(0.002333)^2 + 4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003266 + 0.0000000508 + 0.0000000000296 ≈ 1.0093647\n\nSo, approximately 1.0093647\n\nTherefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ 1.0093647\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.229\n\nSo approximately 2.23 times.\n\nBut let me check with a calculator for better precision.\n\nFirst, compute 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...\n\nThen, 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333...\n\nCompute (1.0023333333)^4:\n\nFirst, compute ln(1.002333333) ≈ 0.0023305 (using ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...)\n\nSo, ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.0023305 - (0.0023305)^2 / 2 + (0.0023305)^3 / 3 ≈ 0.0023305 - 0.00000272 + 0.000000004 ≈ ~0.0023278\n\nThen, multiply by 4: 4 * 0.0023278 ≈ 0.009311\n\nExponentiate: e^0.009311 ≈ 1.00936\n\nTherefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ e^0.009311 ≈ 1.00936\n\nSo, 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nSo approximately 2.23. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. \n\nBut let me check if the velocity is actually towards us. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the Doppler shift formula would be λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). Then, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - v2/c)) = b * (1 - v2/c) / λ_obs. But since T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c). \n\nTherefore, in that case, T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c). Then, the temperature of Star_2 would be lower than Star_1. Then, the luminosity ratio would be:\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5²) * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 - v2/c))^4\n\nSince T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c), so (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 - v2/c)\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 - v2/c)^4\n\nBut if the velocity is towards us, then (1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.002333... ≈ 0.997666...\n\nSo, (0.997666...)^4 ≈ ?\n\nAgain, using binomial approx:\n\n(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x.\n\nSo, with x = 0.002333..., (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990666...\n\nBut more accurately:\n\n(0.9976666667)^4:\n\nCompute ln(0.9976666667) ≈ -0.002335 (since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - ...)\n\nSo, ln(0.9976666667) ≈ -0.002335 - (0.002335)^2 / 2 - ... ≈ -0.002335 - 0.00000272 ≈ -0.0023377\n\nMultiply by 4: -0.0093508\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.0093508) ≈ 1 - 0.0093508 + (0.0093508)^2 / 2 - ... ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, (0.997666...)^4 ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, 1 / (0.9907) ≈ 1.0094, so 1 / (0.997666...)^4 ≈ (1 / 0.9907) ≈ 1.0094\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 0.9907, so 1 / (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 / 0.9907 ≈ 1.0094\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271\n\nSo approximately 2.27.\n\nBut in this case, the problem states the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. If the velocity is positive (receding), then the factor is ~2.23, if it\'s negative (approaching), the factor is ~2.27. \n\nHowever, the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." In astronomical terms, radial velocity is usually given with positive meaning receding. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so this is ambiguous. However, given that they just state 700 km/s without a sign, maybe we are to take the speed, not considering direction. But in reality, radial velocity is a vector. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore the Doppler shift effect? Wait, but the problem mentions that the astronomers calculated the radial velocities, which would be necessary to correct the observed wavelengths to get the rest frame wavelengths. Since they found the peak wavelengths to be the same, that must mean that after correcting for radial velocity, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same? Wait, this is a critical point. \n\nWait, when astronomers measure the wavelength of a star, they have to correct for the Doppler shift caused by the star\'s radial velocity to determine the rest wavelength. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, they would measure the observed wavelength, then compute the rest wavelength by undoing the Doppler shift. Then, if both stars\' rest wavelengths are the same, that would mean their temperatures are the same. But the problem says: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." \n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. If they "determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", that would be the observed wavelengths. But then they "found that they are the same". So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, without correcting for radial velocity, the observed λ_max is the same for both. Then, as per my earlier reasoning, this would imply different rest frame λ_max for each star, leading to different temperatures. \n\nBut if the astronomers corrected for radial velocity, then the rest frame λ_max would be the same, implying same temperature. However, the problem says they "calculated the radial velocities", which might mean that they determined the velocities by measuring the Doppler shift. So perhaps after measuring the observed wavelengths, they used the radial velocities to compute the rest frame wavelengths, found they are the same, hence same temperature. \n\nThis is a crucial point. Let me parse the problem again:\n\n"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."\n\nSo, the key is "appeared brightest"—that would be the observed wavelength, not the rest frame. If they didn\'t correct for radial velocity, then the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But if they did correct for radial velocity, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nBut in order to determine the radial velocity, they would measure the Doppler shift. So, if they measured the radial velocities (0 and 700 km/s), that means they already accounted for the Doppler shift in their measurements. Therefore, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, after correcting for Doppler shift, are the same. Therefore, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me think. \n\nWhen you take a spectrum of a star, you measure the observed wavelengths. Then, by measuring the Doppler shift (comparing observed wavelengths to known rest wavelengths of spectral lines), you can determine the radial velocity. Once you know the radial velocity, you can calculate what the rest wavelength of any observed feature is. \n\nTherefore, if the astronomers determined the radial velocities, they must have used the Doppler shift to compute the rest wavelengths of the spectral features. Therefore, when they say "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", if they are referring to the rest wavelengths (after correcting for Doppler shift), then the peak wavelengths (rest frame) are the same, hence temperatures are the same, and then luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)² = 2.25. \n\nBut if they are referring to the observed wavelengths (before correcting for Doppler shift), then the rest frame peak wavelengths differ, leading to different temperatures, and the luminosity ratio is 2.25 divided or multiplied by (1 ± v/c)^4. \n\nThe problem\'s exact wording is: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."\n\nThe phrase "appeared brightest" suggests the observed wavelengths (i.e., not corrected for Doppler shift). Because "appeared" is what is observed. However, in practice, when astronomers talk about determining the peak emission wavelength, they usually correct for Doppler shift to get the rest wavelength. Otherwise, the peak wavelength would be shifted, and they would account for that. \n\nBut given that the problem also mentions that they calculated the radial velocities, which requires knowing the rest wavelengths of spectral lines. So, likely, they measured the observed wavelengths, determined the Doppler shift (radial velocity), and then computed the rest wavelengths. Therefore, the peak wavelengths they mention are the rest frame wavelengths, which are the same for both stars. Therefore, temperatures are the same. \n\nIn that case, the luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nBut if that\'s the case, why does the problem mention the radial velocities? Maybe it\'s a distractor. But given that the problem is from an exam, sometimes they include extraneous information. \n\nWait, but let\'s check both interpretations:\n\n1. If the observed peak wavelengths (not corrected for velocity) are the same. Then, we have to account for Doppler shift in temperature calculation. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 2.23 or 2.27 depending on direction. But since velocity is given as 700 km/s, positive, which usually means receding, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.23.\n\n2. If the rest frame peak wavelengths (corrected for velocity) are the same, then T1 = T2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."\n\nThe key word is "appeared". If something "appears" a certain way, that usually refers to the observed quantity, not the rest frame. However, in spectroscopy, when determining the peak emission, astronomers do correct for the Doppler shift to report the rest wavelength. For example, if a star is moving towards us, its spectrum is blueshifted, but the reported wavelength is the rest wavelength. So, the peak wavelength they determine is the rest wavelength. \n\nTherefore, the fact that they determined the radial velocities means they have already accounted for the Doppler shift, so the peak wavelengths they mention are the rest frame ones. Therefore, T1 = T2. \n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nBut why would the problem mention the radial velocities then? Maybe to check if we consider relativistic effects or something else. But if the temperatures are the same, then velocities don\'t affect the luminosity ratio. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be trying to trick us into considering the Doppler effect, but actually, the temperatures are the same because the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nGiven that in professional astronomy, when they say "the wavelength at which the star appears brightest", they usually mean the rest frame wavelength after correcting for Doppler shift. Otherwise, every star would have a different peak wavelength due to their velocities, which isn\'t useful for comparing their temperatures. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is that the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. Hence, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. \n\nBut the problem mentions the radial velocities. Maybe it\'s expecting us to think that because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its luminosity is affected by Doppler dimming? Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property, independent of the observer\'s frame. Wait, no. Actually, the observed flux (apparent brightness) is affected by Doppler shift and relativistic effects, but luminosity is the total power emitted, which is a property of the star. \n\nWait, but in the star\'s rest frame, the luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. However, if the star is moving relative to the observer, the observed flux can change due to Doppler boosting or dimming, but the intrinsic luminosity remains the same. However, the problem states that the astronomers "computed the luminosity", which should be the intrinsic luminosity, so they must have corrected for any Doppler effects. Therefore, the radial velocity doesn\'t affect the calculation of intrinsic luminosity. \n\nTherefore, if the rest frame temperatures are the same (since they corrected for Doppler shift), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. \n\nBut then why is the radial velocity given? Maybe it\'s a red herring, or perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the relativistic Doppler effect on luminosity. Wait, but luminosity is still an intrinsic property. Unless the problem is considering the luminosity as observed, which would require considering the Doppler effect. \n\nWait, the problem says: "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nIf they computed the luminosity based on observations, they would have to account for the fact that the observed flux is affected by distance and Doppler effects. However, if both stars are at the same distance, then the flux ratio would be (L1 / L2) * ( (1 + v/c)^-2 ) if moving away, due to Doppler boosting. But this is getting into more complicated aspects. \n\nWait, the flux received from a moving source is affected by Doppler shift and relativistic beaming. The flux F is proportional to L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-3} for a source moving away, due to the Doppler shift (frequency decreases) and time dilation. But this is getting into more advanced topics. However, if the problem is at an introductory level, it might not expect this. \n\nAlternatively, if the stars are moving, their luminosities as computed by the observers would require considering the Doppler effect. Luminosity, in the context of blackbody radiation, when observed, can be affected by the Doppler shift. The formula for the observed flux is F = (L / (4πd²)) * ( (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) )^{-4} \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the effective temperature observed would be different, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. If they used the observed flux and the observed peak wavelength (corrected for Doppler shift), then they would derive the intrinsic luminosity. \n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let\'s check standard textbooks. \n\nIn standard blackbody radiation problems where radial velocity is involved, if you determine the rest frame temperature via correcting the observed peak wavelength using Doppler shift, then you can compute the intrinsic luminosity. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, since the astronomers determined the rest frame peak wavelengths to be the same (by correcting for radial velocity), they would assign the same temperature to both stars, and compute the luminosity ratio as (R1/R2)^2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.25, so the factor is 2.25. \n\nBut the presence of the radial velocity in the problem is confusing. Maybe the problem is trying to test whether the student confuses luminosity with observed flux. For example, if Star_2 is moving away, its flux would be reduced due to Doppler shifting of photons to longer wavelengths (lower energy), and also due to the fact that the number of photons received per unit time is reduced. However, luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn\'t depend on the velocity relative to the observer. \n\nTherefore, if the astronomers computed the luminosity, they must have corrected for the distance and any Doppler effects to calculate the intrinsic luminosity. Therefore, the answer should be 2.25. \n\nBut given that the problem specifically mentions that the radial velocities were calculated, but the peak wavelengths (rest frame) are the same, implying same temperature, hence the luminosity ratio is 2.25. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects us to consider that the luminosity as observed is different, but the question says "computed the luminosity", which is intrinsic, so I think it\'s 2.25. \n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: Rest frame temperatures are the same (after correcting for Doppler shift). Then, L1/L2 = 2.25.\n\nCase 2: Observed peak wavelengths are the same (not corrected for Doppler shift). Then, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 2.23.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions radial velocities, which are needed to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame, the answer is likely Case 1: 2.25. \n\nBut I need to check for any possible other factors. The problem also mentions that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. In main sequence stars, mass and luminosity are related, with luminosity roughly proportional to mass cubed or so. But in this problem, since we are told to assume black body radiation, the mass might not be directly relevant unless it affects radius or temperature. However, the problem already gives radius and temperature (via peak wavelength) so mass is redundant. \n\nTherefore, the inclusion of mass is likely a distractor. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2.25, so the factor is 2.25, which is 9/4. \n\nBut wait, the problem says "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:", so the answer is 2.25, which is 9/4. \n\nBut let me just check units. The radial velocity is given in km/s. When using the Doppler shift formula, we need to make sure that the units of v and c are the same. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So, v/c = 7 x 10^5 / 3 x 10^8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333. \n\nSo, it\'s a small factor. If we consider the problem to be precise, it might require the exact calculation. But since the result is approximately 2.25 or 2.25 divided by (1.002333)^4, which is approximately 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23, or if considering blueshift, 2.25 / (0.997666)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 0.9907 ≈ 2.271. \n\nBut without knowing the direction, we can\'t choose. However, in radial velocity measurements, a positive value usually indicates recession. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, it\'s moving away. Therefore, the calculation would be 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.23. \n\nBut this contradicts the earlier interpretation where rest frame temperatures are the same. \n\nThis is a problem. The confusion arises from whether the peak wavelengths given are rest frame or observed. \n\nGiven that astronomers use radial velocity to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame, the rest frame peak wavelengths would be the same, leading to same temperature. Hence, L1/L2 = 2.25. \n\nBut in that case, why is the velocity given? Maybe to check if we consider the relativistic effects on luminosity. But luminosity is intrinsic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler broadening affects the measurement of the peak wavelength. But Doppler broadening affects the line widths, not the peak wavelength. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the radial velocities are given for another reason, such as determining the distance via Hubble\'s law, but that seems unrelated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the student to realize that because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its luminosity is actually lower due to the Doppler effect. But again, luminosity is intrinsic. \n\nWait, but in reality, the observed flux (which is what we measure) is affected by the star\'s velocity. The flux decreases if the star is moving away because each photon is redshifted (lower energy) and because the number of photons per unit time is decreased due to the velocity. The formula for the observed flux from a moving source is F = L / (4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-2} \n\nBut if the astronomers are calculating the luminosity from the observed flux, they would have to correct for the Doppler effect. So if they measure the flux F_obs, then the inferred luminosity would be L = 4πd² F_obs * (1 + v/c)^2 \n\nTherefore, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed flux is F2 = L2 / (4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-2}\n\nTherefore, the astronomers would compute L2 = 4πd² F2 * (1 + v/c)^2 \n\nSimilarly, for Star_1, since v=0, L1 = 4πd² F1 \n\nTherefore, the computed luminosity ratio would be L1 / L2 = (F1 / F2) / (1 + v/c)^2 \n\nBut the problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. To compute this, they would need the observed fluxes and the distances. However, the problem doesn\'t mention distances or fluxes. \n\nAlternatively, if both stars are at the same distance, then F1 / F2 = (L1 / L2) * (1 + v/c)^2 \n\nBut then to find L1 / L2, they would need to know F1 / F2 and the velocities. However, the problem doesn\'t give F1 / F2. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions that the peak wavelengths are the same, which allows them to compute the temperatures (after correcting for Doppler shift), and they have the radii, then they can compute the luminosities via L = 4πR²σT⁴. \n\nBut if they corrected the observed peak wavelengths for Doppler shift to get the rest frame peak wavelengths, which are the same, then temperatures are the same. Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. \n\nAlternatively, if they did not correct for Doppler shift, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are different, leading to different temperatures, and the luminosity ratio is adjusted by the Doppler factor. \n\nBut since they determined the radial velocities, they must have corrected for the Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer is 2.25. \n\nTherefore, the factor is 2.25, which is 9/4. \n\nGiven the problem\'s context and standard astronomical practice, I think the answer is 2.25. The inclusion of radial velocity might be to test if students get confused and try to use it unnecessarily. Also, the mention of mass is likely a distractor since the problem gives radius and temperature (via peak wavelength), which are the only factors needed for luminosity under the black body assumption. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of \\boxed{2.25}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390782, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6483, prompt_tokens=2675, total_tokens=9158, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius \( R \) and the fourth power of its temperature \( T \):

\[ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \]

Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)) and the same mass factor, we need to consider the temperatures of the stars. The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) for both stars are the same. Using Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength to the temperature (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \)), we conclude that the temperatures of the stars must be the same if the peak wavelengths are the same after correcting for Doppler shift.

The astronomers determined the radial velocities of the stars, which are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. However, since the observed peak wavelengths are the same after correcting for Doppler shift, the rest frame temperatures of both stars are the same. This correction means the temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are equal.

Thus, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radii of the stars:

\[ \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \]

Substituting the given radius ratio:

\[ \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \]

The radial velocities and masses mentioned in the problem are not directly relevant to the calculation of luminosity in this context, as the temperatures are determined to be the same after correcting for Doppler shift, and the luminosity depends only on radius and temperature.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2.25}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c) if Star_2 is moving away, or (1 - v2/c) if moving towards. But the problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. However, radial velocity convention is that positive velocity means moving away. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, then it is moving away, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). If it's moving towards, it would be negative velocity. But since the problem states 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it's moving away. 

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different. But according to this, T2 is higher than T1. However, the problem says Star_1 has larger radius and mass. But we need to compute luminosity. 

So, let's compute the luminosity ratio L1 / L2. 

Luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. Therefore, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

But we have R1 = 1.5 R2

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

Therefore,

L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4 ) )

Simplify:

= (1.5² * R2² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T1^4) * 1 / (1 + v2/c)^4

= 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4

So, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4

Now, plug in v2 = 700 km/s. We need to express this in terms of the speed of light c. 

The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333...

Therefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4

We can compute this using the binomial approximation since v2/c is small:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for x << 1

So, (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333

But let's compute it more accurately:

First, 0.002333^1 = 0.002333

0.002333^2 ≈ 0.000005444

0.002333^3 ≈ 0.0000000127

0.002333^4 ≈ 0.0000000000296

So, (1 + 0.002333)^4 = 1 + 4*0.002333 + 6*(0.002333)^2 + 4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003266 + 0.0000000508 + 0.0000000000296 ≈ 1.0093647

So, approximately 1.0093647

Therefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ 1.0093647

Therefore, L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.229

So approximately 2.23 times.

But let me check with a calculator for better precision.

First, compute 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

Then, 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333...

Compute (1.0023333333)^4:

First, compute ln(1.002333333) ≈ 0.0023305 (using ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...)

So, ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.0023305 - (0.0023305)^2 / 2 + (0.0023305)^3 / 3 ≈ 0.0023305 - 0.00000272 + 0.000000004 ≈ ~0.0023278

Then, multiply by 4: 4 * 0.0023278 ≈ 0.009311

Exponentiate: e^0.009311 ≈ 1.00936

Therefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ e^0.009311 ≈ 1.00936

So, 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229

So approximately 2.23. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. 

But let me check if the velocity is actually towards us. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the Doppler shift formula would be λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 - v2/c). Then, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - v2/c)) = b * (1 - v2/c) / λ_obs. But since T1 = b / λ_obs, then T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c). 

Therefore, in that case, T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c). Then, the temperature of Star_2 would be lower than Star_1. Then, the luminosity ratio would be:

L1 / L2 = (1.5²) * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 - v2/c))^4

Since T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c), so (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 - v2/c)

Therefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 - v2/c)^4

But if the velocity is towards us, then (1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.002333... ≈ 0.997666...

So, (0.997666...)^4 ≈ ?

Again, using binomial approx:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x.

So, with x = 0.002333..., (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990666...

But more accurately:

(0.9976666667)^4:

Compute ln(0.9976666667) ≈ -0.002335 (since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - ...)

So, ln(0.9976666667) ≈ -0.002335 - (0.002335)^2 / 2 - ... ≈ -0.002335 - 0.00000272 ≈ -0.0023377

Multiply by 4: -0.0093508

Exponentiate: e^(-0.0093508) ≈ 1 - 0.0093508 + (0.0093508)^2 / 2 - ... ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, (0.997666...)^4 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, 1 / (0.9907) ≈ 1.0094, so 1 / (0.997666...)^4 ≈ (1 / 0.9907) ≈ 1.0094

Wait, no:

Wait, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 0.9907, so 1 / (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 / 0.9907 ≈ 1.0094

Therefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271

So approximately 2.27.

But in this case, the problem states the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. If the velocity is positive (receding), then the factor is ~2.23, if it's negative (approaching), the factor is ~2.27. 

However, the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." In astronomical terms, radial velocity is usually given with positive meaning receding. But the problem doesn't specify, so this is ambiguous. However, given that they just state 700 km/s without a sign, maybe we are to take the speed, not considering direction. But in reality, radial velocity is a vector. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore the Doppler shift effect? Wait, but the problem mentions that the astronomers calculated the radial velocities, which would be necessary to correct the observed wavelengths to get the rest frame wavelengths. Since they found the peak wavelengths to be the same, that must mean that after correcting for radial velocity, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same? Wait, this is a critical point. 

Wait, when astronomers measure the wavelength of a star, they have to correct for the Doppler shift caused by the star's radial velocity to determine the rest wavelength. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, they would measure the observed wavelength, then compute the rest wavelength by undoing the Doppler shift. Then, if both stars' rest wavelengths are the same, that would mean their temperatures are the same. But the problem says: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." 

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. If they "determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", that would be the observed wavelengths. But then they "found that they are the same". So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, without correcting for radial velocity, the observed λ_max is the same for both. Then, as per my earlier reasoning, this would imply different rest frame λ_max for each star, leading to different temperatures. 

But if the astronomers corrected for radial velocity, then the rest frame λ_max would be the same, implying same temperature. However, the problem says they "calculated the radial velocities", which might mean that they determined the velocities by measuring the Doppler shift. So perhaps after measuring the observed wavelengths, they used the radial velocities to compute the rest frame wavelengths, found they are the same, hence same temperature. 

This is a crucial point. Let me parse the problem again:

"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So, the key is "appeared brightest"—that would be the observed wavelength, not the rest frame. If they didn't correct for radial velocity, then the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But if they did correct for radial velocity, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same. 

But in order to determine the radial velocity, they would measure the Doppler shift. So, if they measured the radial velocities (0 and 700 km/s), that means they already accounted for the Doppler shift in their measurements. Therefore, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, after correcting for Doppler shift, are the same. Therefore, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. 

Wait, this is conflicting. Let me think. 

When you take a spectrum of a star, you measure the observed wavelengths. Then, by measuring the Doppler shift (comparing observed wavelengths to known rest wavelengths of spectral lines), you can determine the radial velocity. Once you know the radial velocity, you can calculate what the rest wavelength of any observed feature is. 

Therefore, if the astronomers determined the radial velocities, they must have used the Doppler shift to compute the rest wavelengths of the spectral features. Therefore, when they say "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", if they are referring to the rest wavelengths (after correcting for Doppler shift), then the peak wavelengths (rest frame) are the same, hence temperatures are the same, and then luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)² = 2.25. 

But if they are referring to the observed wavelengths (before correcting for Doppler shift), then the rest frame peak wavelengths differ, leading to different temperatures, and the luminosity ratio is 2.25 divided or multiplied by (1 ± v/c)^4. 

The problem's exact wording is: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

The phrase "appeared brightest" suggests the observed wavelengths (i.e., not corrected for Doppler shift). Because "appeared" is what is observed. However, in practice, when astronomers talk about determining the peak emission wavelength, they usually correct for Doppler shift to get the rest wavelength. Otherwise, the peak wavelength would be shifted, and they would account for that. 

But given that the problem also mentions that they calculated the radial velocities, which requires knowing the rest wavelengths of spectral lines. So, likely, they measured the observed wavelengths, determined the Doppler shift (radial velocity), and then computed the rest wavelengths. Therefore, the peak wavelengths they mention are the rest frame wavelengths, which are the same for both stars. Therefore, temperatures are the same. 

In that case, the luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. 

But if that's the case, why does the problem mention the radial velocities? Maybe it's a distractor. But given that the problem is from an exam, sometimes they include extraneous information. 

Wait, but let's check both interpretations:

1. If the observed peak wavelengths (not corrected for velocity) are the same. Then, we have to account for Doppler shift in temperature calculation. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 2.23 or 2.27 depending on direction. But since velocity is given as 700 km/s, positive, which usually means receding, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.23.

2. If the rest frame peak wavelengths (corrected for velocity) are the same, then T1 = T2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But which interpretation is correct? 

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

The key word is "appeared". If something "appears" a certain way, that usually refers to the observed quantity, not the rest frame. However, in spectroscopy, when determining the peak emission, astronomers do correct for the Doppler shift to report the rest wavelength. For example, if a star is moving towards us, its spectrum is blueshifted, but the reported wavelength is the rest wavelength. So, the peak wavelength they determine is the rest wavelength. 

Therefore, the fact that they determined the radial velocities means they have already accounted for the Doppler shift, so the peak wavelengths they mention are the rest frame ones. Therefore, T1 = T2. 

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. 

But why would the problem mention the radial velocities then? Maybe to check if we consider relativistic effects or something else. But if the temperatures are the same, then velocities don't affect the luminosity ratio. 

Alternatively, the problem might be trying to trick us into considering the Doppler effect, but actually, the temperatures are the same because the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same. 

Given that in professional astronomy, when they say "the wavelength at which the star appears brightest", they usually mean the rest frame wavelength after correcting for Doppler shift. Otherwise, every star would have a different peak wavelength due to their velocities, which isn't useful for comparing their temperatures. 

Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. Hence, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. 

But the problem mentions the radial velocities. Maybe it's expecting us to think that because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its luminosity is affected by Doppler dimming? Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property, independent of the observer's frame. Wait, no. Actually, the observed flux (apparent brightness) is affected by Doppler shift and relativistic effects, but luminosity is the total power emitted, which is a property of the star. 

Wait, but in the star's rest frame, the luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. However, if the star is moving relative to the observer, the observed flux can change due to Doppler boosting or dimming, but the intrinsic luminosity remains the same. However, the problem states that the astronomers "computed the luminosity", which should be the intrinsic luminosity, so they must have corrected for any Doppler effects. Therefore, the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation of intrinsic luminosity. 

Therefore, if the rest frame temperatures are the same (since they corrected for Doppler shift), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. 

But then why is the radial velocity given? Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the relativistic Doppler effect on luminosity. Wait, but luminosity is still an intrinsic property. Unless the problem is considering the luminosity as observed, which would require considering the Doppler effect. 

Wait, the problem says: "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

If they computed the luminosity based on observations, they would have to account for the fact that the observed flux is affected by distance and Doppler effects. However, if both stars are at the same distance, then the flux ratio would be (L1 / L2) * ( (1 + v/c)^-2 ) if moving away, due to Doppler boosting. But this is getting into more complicated aspects. 

Wait, the flux received from a moving source is affected by Doppler shift and relativistic beaming. The flux F is proportional to L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-3} for a source moving away, due to the Doppler shift (frequency decreases) and time dilation. But this is getting into more advanced topics. However, if the problem is at an introductory level, it might not expect this. 

Alternatively, if the stars are moving, their luminosities as computed by the observers would require considering the Doppler effect. Luminosity, in the context of blackbody radiation, when observed, can be affected by the Doppler shift. The formula for the observed flux is F = (L / (4πd²)) * ( (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) )^{-4} 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the effective temperature observed would be different, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. If they used the observed flux and the observed peak wavelength (corrected for Doppler shift), then they would derive the intrinsic luminosity. 

But perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let's check standard textbooks. 

In standard blackbody radiation problems where radial velocity is involved, if you determine the rest frame temperature via correcting the observed peak wavelength using Doppler shift, then you can compute the intrinsic luminosity. 

Therefore, in this problem, since the astronomers determined the rest frame peak wavelengths to be the same (by correcting for radial velocity), they would assign the same temperature to both stars, and compute the luminosity ratio as (R1/R2)^2. 

Therefore, the answer is 2.25, so the factor is 2.25. 

But the presence of the radial velocity in the problem is confusing. Maybe the problem is trying to test whether the student confuses luminosity with observed flux. For example, if Star_2 is moving away, its flux would be reduced due to Doppler shifting of photons to longer wavelengths (lower energy), and also due to the fact that the number of photons received per unit time is reduced. However, luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn't depend on the velocity relative to the observer. 

Therefore, if the astronomers computed the luminosity, they must have corrected for the distance and any Doppler effects to calculate the intrinsic luminosity. Therefore, the answer should be 2.25. 

But given that the problem specifically mentions that the radial velocities were calculated, but the peak wavelengths (rest frame) are the same, implying same temperature, hence the luminosity ratio is 2.25. 

Alternatively, if the problem expects us to consider that the luminosity as observed is different, but the question says "computed the luminosity", which is intrinsic, so I think it's 2.25. 

But to be thorough, let's consider both cases:

Case 1: Rest frame temperatures are the same (after correcting for Doppler shift). Then, L1/L2 = 2.25.

Case 2: Observed peak wavelengths are the same (not corrected for Doppler shift). Then, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 2.23.

Given that the problem mentions radial velocities, which are needed to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame, the answer is likely Case 1: 2.25. 

But I need to check for any possible other factors. The problem also mentions that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. In main sequence stars, mass and luminosity are related, with luminosity roughly proportional to mass cubed or so. But in this problem, since we are told to assume black body radiation, the mass might not be directly relevant unless it affects radius or temperature. However, the problem already gives radius and temperature (via peak wavelength) so mass is redundant. 

Therefore, the inclusion of mass is likely a distractor. 

Therefore, the answer should be 2.25, so the factor is 2.25, which is 9/4. 

But wait, the problem says "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:", so the answer is 2.25, which is 9/4. 

But let me just check units. The radial velocity is given in km/s. When using the Doppler shift formula, we need to make sure that the units of v and c are the same. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So, v/c = 7 x 10^5 / 3 x 10^8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333. 

So, it's a small factor. If we consider the problem to be precise, it might require the exact calculation. But since the result is approximately 2.25 or 2.25 divided by (1.002333)^4, which is approximately 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23, or if considering blueshift, 2.25 / (0.997666)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 0.9907 ≈ 2.271. 

But without knowing the direction, we can't choose. However, in radial velocity measurements, a positive value usually indicates recession. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, it's moving away. Therefore, the calculation would be 2.25 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.23. 

But this contradicts the earlier interpretation where rest frame temperatures are the same. 

This is a problem. The confusion arises from whether the peak wavelengths given are rest frame or observed. 

Given that astronomers use radial velocity to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame, the rest frame peak wavelengths would be the same, leading to same temperature. Hence, L1/L2 = 2.25. 

But in that case, why is the velocity given? Maybe to check if we consider the relativistic effects on luminosity. But luminosity is intrinsic. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler broadening affects the measurement of the peak wavelength. But Doppler broadening affects the line widths, not the peak wavelength. 

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the radial velocities are given for another reason, such as determining the distance via Hubble's law, but that seems unrelated. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the student to realize that because Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its luminosity is actually lower due to the Doppler effect. But again, luminosity is intrinsic. 

Wait, but in reality, the observed flux (which is what we measure) is affected by the star's velocity. The flux decreases if the star is moving away because each photon is redshifted (lower energy) and because the number of photons per unit time is decreased due to the velocity. The formula for the observed flux from a moving source is F = L / (4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-2} 

But if the astronomers are calculating the luminosity from the observed flux, they would have to correct for the Doppler effect. So if they measure the flux F_obs, then the inferred luminosity would be L = 4πd² F_obs * (1 + v/c)^2 

Therefore, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed flux is F2 = L2 / (4πd²) * (1 + v/c)^{-2}

Therefore, the astronomers would compute L2 = 4πd² F2 * (1 + v/c)^2 

Similarly, for Star_1, since v=0, L1 = 4πd² F1 

Therefore, the computed luminosity ratio would be L1 / L2 = (F1 / F2) / (1 + v/c)^2 

But the problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. To compute this, they would need the observed fluxes and the distances. However, the problem doesn't mention distances or fluxes. 

Alternatively, if both stars are at the same distance, then F1 / F2 = (L1 / L2) * (1 + v/c)^2 

But then to find L1 / L2, they would need to know F1 / F2 and the velocities. However, the problem doesn't give F1 / F2. 

Alternatively, since the problem mentions that the peak wavelengths are the same, which allows them to compute the temperatures (after correcting for Doppler shift), and they have the radii, then they can compute the luminosities via L = 4πR²σT⁴. 

But if they corrected the observed peak wavelengths for Doppler shift to get the rest frame peak wavelengths, which are the same, then temperatures are the same. Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. 

Alternatively, if they did not correct for Doppler shift, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are different, leading to different temperatures, and the luminosity ratio is adjusted by the Doppler factor. 

But since they determined the radial velocities, they must have corrected for the Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer is 2.25. 

Therefore, the factor is 2.25, which is 9/4. 

Given the problem's context and standard astronomical practice, I think the answer is 2.25. The inclusion of radial velocity might be to test if students get confused and try to use it unnecessarily. Also, the mention of mass is likely a distractor since the problem gives radius and temperature (via peak wavelength), which are the only factors needed for luminosity under the black body assumption. 

**Final Answer**
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of \boxed{2.25}.

Therefore, its actual temperature would be higher than what is inferred without considering Doppler shift. However, since astronomers observed the same peak wavelength for both, but Star_2\'s actual emitted peak wavelength is shorter (higher temperature), this implies T2 = T1 × (1 + v2/c).\n\nBut wait, let\'s re-examine the Doppler effect. If a star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the emitted wavelength would be shorter. So, λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). Therefore, if λ_obs is the same for both, then Star_2\'s emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Therefore, using Wien\'s Law:\n\nT1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nSo, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c). Wait, but this seems counterintuitive because Star_2, moving away, would have its emitted light redshifted. However, when we observe the same peak wavelength for both stars, but considering Star_2\'s velocity, the actual temperature of Star_2 must be higher. Because the observed λ_max (peak wavelength) for Star_2 is shifted to longer wavelengths (redshifted), so to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength (higher temperature), which when redshifted, matches the observed λ_max of Star_1. Therefore, Star_2\'s actual temperature is higher than Star_1\'s.\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Then, substituting into luminosity:\n\nL1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (R1/R2)² ) * (T1/T2)^4 )\n\nGiven R1/R2 = 1.5, and T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c). Therefore:\n\nL1/L2 = (1.5²) * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴\n\nWe need to compute (1 + v2/c). The velocity v2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333.\n\nThus, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333. Therefore, (1 / 1.0023333)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.0023333)^4 ≈ using binomial approximation:\n\n(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x. So, 1 - 4*(0.0023333) ≈ 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990667. However, this is an approximation. For more precision, compute (1.0023333)^-4.\n\nAlternatively, compute ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.00233 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...), so ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.00233. Then, ln((1.0023333)^4) = 4*0.00233 ≈ 0.00932. Therefore, (1.0023333)^-4 = e^(-0.00932) ≈ 1 - 0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.00932 + 0.000043 ≈ 0.990723. So approximately 0.9907.\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. But this is a rough calculation. Let\'s compute more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333... Wait, 700 divided by 300,000 is 700/300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333. Correct. So, 0.0023333.\n\nNow, 1 + v2/c = 1.0023333.\n\nCompute (1.0023333)^4:\n\nFirst, compute (1.0023333)^2:\n\n1.0023333^2 = (1 + 0.0023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1.004672044.\n\nThen, square that to get (1.004672044)^2:\n\n= 1 + 2*0.004672044 + (0.004672044)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009344088 + 0.00002183 ≈ 1.009365918.\n\nTherefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009365918. Therefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659. Therefore, 1/(1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1/1.0093659 ≈ 0.9907.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23.\n\nBut wait, this is the ratio L1/L2. The problem states that Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s by a factor of: So if L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, then the answer is approximately 2.23. However, the options might require a more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic. Let me verify.\n\nThe key steps:\n\n1. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. But due to Doppler shift, Star_2\'s emitted peak wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Since Star_1 is stationary, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.\n\n2. Therefore, using Wien\'s Law:\n\nT1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)\n\nWait, but we need to relate T1 and T2. If Star_2\'s emitted peak wavelength is shorter (because λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)), and since shorter wavelength corresponds to higher temperature (Wien\'s Law), then T2 > T1. Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, when we compute the luminosity ratio:\n\nL1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v2/c))^4\n\nSo, yes, that\'s correct.\n\nThus, plugging in the numbers:\n\nv2/c = 700 km/s / 3e5 km/s ≈ 0.002333...\n\n1 + v2/c = 1.002333...\n\n(1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.0093659\n\nThus, 1 / (1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, approximately 2.23.\n\nBut the problem states that astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, given that the problem is likely expecting an exact expression or a specific value, perhaps considering that (1 + v/c) is small and approximated, but let\'s check the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring? Wait, no, because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures differ. Therefore, this must be taken into account.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity as well. But the problem states that they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation, so they would account for the Doppler shift in temperature. Wait, no. The luminosity calculation would be based on the actual radius and temperature of the star. However, the observed flux would be affected by Doppler shift, but luminosity is intrinsic. Wait, but the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of...". So, perhaps the astronomers, knowing the radial velocities, correct for the Doppler shift when determining the temperatures. Thus, they would infer the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their velocities, and then compute the luminosities based on the actual temperatures and radii.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Correct the observed peak wavelength for Doppler shift to get the actual emitted peak wavelength for each star.\n\n2. Use Wien\'s Law to find the actual temperature of each star.\n\n3. Use Stefan-Boltzmann Law with actual R and T to compute luminosity.\n\nGiven that both stars\' observed λ_max are the same, but due to Doppler shifts, their actual λ_emit differ.\n\nFor Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.\n\nFor Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, the Doppler effect implies λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Therefore, using Wien\'s Law:\n\nT1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, the ratio of luminosities is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)² / R2² ) * ( T1⁴ / (T1 (1 + v2/c))⁴ ) ) = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / c)^4\n\nGiven c is speed of light, which is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, 700 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333... Wait, no: 700 divided by 300,000 is 0.002333... So, 700 / 3e5 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nThus, (1 + 0.002333...) ≈ 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, (1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.009366...\n\nHence, 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229...\n\nApproximately 2.23. So, the factor is roughly 2.23. However, given that the problem might expect an exact expression, but since it\'s a numerical answer, likely to two decimal places or as a fraction. Alternatively, perhaps we need to compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Doppler shift is negligible, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.23% or so), but even so, the effect on temperature is a factor of 1.0023, so when raised to the fourth power, it\'s about a 0.94% decrease from 2.25, leading to approximately 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23.\n\nHowever, let\'s compute it with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, compute v2/c:\n\nv2 = 700 km/s = 7 x 10^5 m/s\n\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nv2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333333...\n\n1 + v2/c = 1.002333333...\n\nNow, compute (1.0023333333)^4:\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute ln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.00233039 (using Taylor series: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ...)\n\nln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.0023333333 - (0.0023333333)^2 / 2 + (0.0023333333)^3 / 3 - ...\n\n≈ 0.0023333333 - (0.0000054444444) + (0.0000000127037) - ... ≈ approximately 0.0023279\n\nThen, 4 * ln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.0093116\n\nExponentiate: e^0.0093116 ≈ 1.00936 (since e^0.0093 ≈ 1.00936)\n\nThus, (1.0023333333)^4 ≈ 1.00936\n\nTherefore, 1 / 1.00936 ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229\n\nRounded to three significant figures, that\'s approximately 2.23.\n\nBut let me check using calculator-like precision:\n\nCompute (1 + 0.0023333333)^4:\n\nFirst, (1.0023333333)^2 = 1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333\n\nMultiply 1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333:\n\n= 1*1 + 1*0.0023333333 + 0.0023333333*1 + 0.0023333333*0.0023333333\n\n= 1 + 0.0023333333 + 0.0023333333 + 0.0000054444444\n\n= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444444 ≈ 1.004672111\n\nThen, square that result: (1.004672111)^2\n\nCompute 1.004672111 * 1.004672111:\n\n= 1*1 + 1*0.004672111 + 0.004672111*1 + 0.004672111*0.004672111\n\n= 1 + 0.004672111 + 0.004672111 + 0.000021828\n\n≈ 1 + 0.009344222 + 0.000021828 ≈ 1.00936605\n\nTherefore, (1.0023333333)^4 ≈ 1.00936605\n\nThus, 1 / 1.00936605 ≈ 0.990723\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291\n\nSo approximately 2.23.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of v/c, but given that the answer is numerical, we need to compute it. However, 700 km/s is a non-relativistic speed, so the Doppler shift can be approximated.\n\nAlternatively, using the relativistic Doppler effect formula, but since v << c, the approximation λ_obs/λ_emit = 1 + v/c is sufficient.\n\nBut since we already used that approximation, our calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, given that the problem might expect considering only the classical factors (radius and temperature) without Doppler shift, but the problem explicitly mentions radial velocities and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so the Doppler shift must be considered.\n\nTherefore, the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Let\'s check.\n\nIf we ignore the radial velocities, assuming that the observed peak wavelengths are the actual emitted wavelengths, then T1 = T2, and L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. However, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, and they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Therefore, the Doppler shift must be considered. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.23.\n\nBut given that 2.23 is close to 2.25, but the calculation shows it\'s slightly less. However, in multiple-choice contexts, sometimes such factors are rounded, but since the user hasn\'t provided options, we need to state the exact factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature relation. Let me verify again.\n\nStar_1: v1 = 0, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs\n\nStar_2: v2 = 700 km/s (away from us), so λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, when calculating luminosity:\n\nL1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (1.5²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the factor is 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4. Given that 700/c ≈ 0.002333, the denominator is (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009366, so 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, in precise terms, it\'s 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/(3*10^5))^4. If we compute it more accurately:\n\nFirst, compute 700 / (3*10^5) = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333333\n\nThen, (1 + 0.0023333333)^4:\n\nUsing the binomial expansion for small x:\n\n(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + n(n-1)(n-2)x³/6 + ...\n\nFor x = 0.0023333, n = 4:\n\n(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4x = 4 * 0.0023333 ≈ 0.0093333\n\n6x² = 6 * (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.0000054444 ≈ 0.000032666\n\n4x³ ≈ 4 * (0.0023333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.00000001296 ≈ 0.00000005184\n\nx^4 ≈ (0.0023333)^4 ≈ 0.000000000030\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1 + 0.0093333 + 0.000032666 + 0.00000005184 + 0.000000000030 ≈ 1.00936597\n\nThus, (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1.00936597\n\nTherefore, 1 / (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00936597 ≈ 0.990723\n\nThus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291\n\nRounding to two decimal places, 2.23. To three significant figures, 2.23. Since 2.2291 is closer to 2.23 than 2.22.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects an exact fractional expression, but given the numbers, it\'s unlikely. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23.\n\nHowever, let me check with more precise calculation using calculator:\n\nCompute 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333333\n\n1 + 0.0023333333 = 1.0023333333\n\nNow, compute 1.0023333333^4:\n\nFirst, 1.0023333333^2 = 1.00467211\n\nThen, 1.00467211^2 = (1.00467211)(1.00467211)\n\nMultiply:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*0.00467211 = 0.00467211\n\n0.00467211*1 = 0.00467211\n\n0.00467211*0.00467211 ≈ 0.000021828\n\nAdd them up:\n\n1 + 0.00467211 + 0.00467211 + 0.000021828 ≈ 1.00936504\n\nThus, 1.0023333333^4 ≈ 1.00936504\n\nTherefore, 1 / 1.00936504 ≈ 0.990723\n\nThus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291\n\nSo, approximately 2.23.\n\nGiven that in astrophysics, such factors are often rounded to two decimal places or significant figures, the answer is approximately 2.23.\n\nBut let me check one more time for any possible mistakes in the reasoning.\n\nAnother way to think: The luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\n\nWe found T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c)\n\nHence, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4\n\nThus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4 = 2.25 / (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ 2.229.\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, the problem might expect the answer to be 2.25, ignoring the Doppler shift, but since the radial velocities are given and the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler effect must be considered, leading to a slightly lower factor than 2.25.\n\nGiven that in competitive exams or textbooks, sometimes such factors are simplified, but given the data, the correct answer should consider the Doppler shift, leading to approximately 2.23. However, if we calculate with more precise exponentials:\n\nUsing natural logarithm and exponentials for higher accuracy:\n\nln(1.0023333) = 0.00233039\n\nMultiply by 4: 0.00932156\n\nExponential: e^(-0.00932156) = ?\n\nApproximate e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x⁴/24\n\nx = -0.00932156\n\ne^x ≈ 1 - 0.00932156 + (0.00932156)^2 / 2 - (0.00932156)^3 / 6 + (0.00932156)^4 / 24\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n1 = 1\n\n-0.00932156 = -0.00932156\n\n+ (0.00932156)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.0000869 / 2 ≈ 0.00004345\n\n- (0.00932156)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.000000811 / 6 ≈ 0.000000135\n\n+ (0.00932156)^4 / 24 ≈ 0.00000000756 / 24 ≈ 0.000000000315\n\nAdding up:\n\n1 - 0.00932156 = 0.99067844\n\n+ 0.00004345 = 0.99072189\n\n- 0.000000135 = 0.990721755\n\n+ 0.000000000315 ≈ 0.990721755\n\nThus, e^(-0.00932156) ≈ 0.990721755\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990721755 ≈ 2.2291\n\nSo, approximately 2.2291, which rounds to 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. If the question expects a precise answer, maybe they use (1 + v/c) without higher-order terms, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 4*(v/c)) due to (1/(1 + x))^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x.\n\nGiven that 4*(v/c) = 4*0.0023333 ≈ 0.0093333, so 1 - 0.0093333 ≈ 0.9906667, then L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906667 ≈ 2.229, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the factor is approximately 2.23.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, and given that professionals would use precise calculations, the answer should be this approximate value. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23, which can be written as \\boxed{2.23}.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there\'s a calculation mistake in the velocity.\n\nWait, the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the component of the velocity along the line of sight. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is redshifted, meaning λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). If the star is moving towards us, it\'s blueshifted: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c). The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." It doesn\'t specify the direction, but radial velocity is usually positive for receding (away), negative for approaching. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, it\'s moving away, leading to redshift. Therefore, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, our previous calculation holds.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose the 700 km/s is approaching (though unlikely without a minus sign), then λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 - v/c). Then, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = (b / λ_obs) / (1 - v/c) = T1 / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = T1 / (1 - v/c), which would mean T2 > T1, leading to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 - v/c)^4. In that case, with v/c = 0.0023333, (1 - v/c)^4 ≈ (0.9976667)^4 ≈ approximately 0.9907, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. Wait, same result? No, wait:\n\nWait, if the velocity is approaching, then v is negative. So radial velocity is -700 km/s. Then, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700/c). Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 - 700/c) = T1 * (1 - 700/c). Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 - 700/c), which would mean T2 < T1. Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 - 700/c))^4. However, 700/c is positive, so 1 / (1 - 700/c) = 1 / (negative number) if 700/c > 1, but 700/c ≈ 0.002333, so 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.9976667. Therefore, 1 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.002340, so (1 / 0.9976667)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00941, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00941 ≈ 2.271. However, this contradicts the previous result. But this scenario assumes that the radial velocity is negative (approaching), but the problem states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, with no negative sign, implying Star_2 is moving away. Therefore, the initial calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct factor is approximately 2.23.\n\nBut let me confirm with a different approach. Suppose we assign actual numbers.\n\nAssume Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away. Let’s assume c = 3e5 km/s.\n\nThen, the Doppler factor is 1 + 700/3e5 = 1 + 7/3000 ≈ 1.002333.\n\nThus, Star_2\'s emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / 1.002333.\n\nUsing Wien\'s Law, T ∝ 1/λ_emit.\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.\n\nThen, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/1.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, considering significant figures, the given data (1.5 times, 700 km/s) has two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be presented with two significant figures: approximately 2.2.\n\nBut 700 km/s is three significant figures, 1.5 is two. The rule is the least number of significant figures in the multiplicatives. However, since we have division and exponents, it\'s a bit more complex. But generally, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, the radius and mass are given as 1.5 (two significant figures), and velocity as 700 (two or three? If 700 is written as 7e2, it\'s one, but usually 700 with no decimal is ambiguous. However, in scientific contexts, 700 km/s would often be considered as two significant figures (7 and the zeros are placeholders). If it\'s three significant figures, then 700. km/s. Given the problem states 700 km/s without a decimal, it\'s ambiguous but likely two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, with two significant figures in both 1.5 and 700, the answer should be 2.2.\n\nBut our calculation gives 2.229, which is 2.23 with three significant figures. However, given the input has two significant figures for the radius and mass factor (1.5) and possibly two for velocity (700), the answer should be 2.2.\n\nBut this is a judgment call. In many textbooks, 700 could be two or three sig figs. If it\'s three, then 700. km/s would be three. Since it\'s written as 700 km/s, it\'s safer to assume two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, rounding 2.229 to two significant figures gives 2.2.\n\nHowever, different sources might handle this differently. Given the ambiguity, but in the context of astronomy, such precise velocities (700 km/s) are usually considered with three significant figures. For example, radial velocities are often measured with high precision. If 700 is three significant figures, then the answer should be 2.23.\n\nBut without explicit information, it\'s hard to tell. Given that the problem is likely constructed with 1.5 (two sig figs) and 700 (two sig figs), the answer would be 2.2. But since 1.5 is a factor and 700 km/s is a measured quantity, which might be three sig figs, the answer could be 2.23.\n\nBut given that in the calculation, we ended up with approximately 2.229, which is 2.23 when rounded to three significant figures, and if the inputs are considered to have three significant figures (700), then 2.23 is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the original factors (radius and mass) are 1.5, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the dominating factor is two sig figs. Hence, the answer should be 2.2.\n\nBut this is conflicting. In exams, usually, such factors are given with enough sig figs so that the answer can be unambiguous. Here, since 1.5 and 700 are the given numbers, and 700 is probably two sig figs, the answer should be two sig figs: 2.2.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is closer to 2.2 or 2.23 depending on rounding. If we stick to two sig figs for 1.5 and 700, then 2.2. If we consider 700 as three sig figs, then 2.23.\n\nGiven that in most educational settings, unless specified, 700 is two sig figs, so 2.2. However, the problem might expect the answer to account for the exact calculation without rounding, hence 2.23. But since the user hasn\'t specified, I\'ll present both possibilities but lean towards 2.23 as the more precise answer given the detailed calculation.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately \\boxed{2.2} or \\boxed{2.23}. But given the problem\'s context and the precise calculation leading to 2.23, I think \\boxed{2.2} is too approximate, and \\boxed{2.23} is better. However, let me check with exact fraction.\n\nCompute 1.5^2 = 2.25\n\nCompute (1 + 700/c)^4 = (1 + 7/3000)^4\n\n= (3007/3000)^4\n\nThus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / (3007/3000)^4 = 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4\n\nBut calculating this exactly is tedious, but perhaps approximate:\n\n3000/3007 ≈ 0.99767\n\n(0.99767)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^4 ≈ 0.9907\n\nThus, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the exact answer is 2.25 divided by (3007/3000)^4, which is approximately 2.23. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{2.2} if considering two significant figures, or \\boxed{2.23} with three. Given that 700 has three significant figures and 1.5 has two, the answer\'s precision is limited by the least precise measurement, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut this contradicts the detailed calculation, which gives 2.229, very close to 2.23. In many standardized tests, if the calculation results in 2.229, they might round to 2.2 or 2.23 based on options. Since the user hasn\'t provided options, but asks to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, and given that in physics, we usually maintain significant figures based on input, the answer is two significant figures: 2.2.\n\nBut considering that 1.5 is two sig figs and 700 is two or three, but in the calculation, the dominant uncertainty comes from the 1.5 factor (which is two sig figs), the answer should be 2.2.\n\nHowever, I recall that when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise value. Here, 1.5 (two sig figs) and 700 (two or three). If 700 is three, then the least is two (from 1.5). If 700 is two, then still two. Hence, two sig figs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut the detailed calculation shows 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, given that 2.229 is much closer to 2.2 than to 2.3, it\'s 2.2.\n\nBut wait, 2.229 rounded to two sig figs is 2.2, because the third digit is less than 5. Yes, 2.229 rounded to two decimal places is 2.23, but rounded to two significant figures is 2.2.\n\nWait, no: 2.229 has three sig figs. To round to two sig figs, look at the third digit: 2.229 → 2.2 (since the third digit is 2, which is less than 5).\n\nWait, no: 2.229 rounded to two significant figures:\n\nThe first two digits are 2 and .2. The third digit is 2, which is less than 5, so it remains 2.2.\n\nBut if the number were 2.25, rounded to two sig figs would be 2.3. But 2.229 is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer with two significant figures is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nHowever, I need to reconcile this with the problem statement. The problem says "the factor of:", which often in such contexts expects a exact fractional answer if possible, but given the numbers, it\'s a decimal. If the answer is approximately 2.2 or 2.23, but given the significant figures, 2.2 is appropriate.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some textbooks, when you have a factor like 1.5, which is a multiplier, and velocities given as whole numbers, they might expect the answer to be expressed with two decimal places or as a fraction. But given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, but with significant figures, it\'s 2.2.\n\nBut given that this is a calculation where the Doppler shift contributes a small correction, and the dominant factor is 2.25, which is adjusted down to 2.23, which is still closer to 2.2 than 2.3 when considering two sig figs.\n\nHowever, given that 2.229 is technically 2.23 when rounded to three significant figures, but the inputs limit it to two, the answer must be 2.2.\n\nBut I\'m conflicted because the calculation is precise to about 2.229, which is 2.23, but with sig figs, 2.2. However, in many astronomical calculations, such precision is retained beyond significant figures because the factors are known precisely. But in this problem, since the given data has limited precision, we must adhere to that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s assume that 700 km/s is three significant figures (700.), then the answer would be 2.23. However, since the problem states 700 km/s without a decimal, it\'s two significant figures. Therefore, 2.2.\n\nBut given that the problem is likely designed by someone who expects the Doppler shift calculation to slightly reduce the factor from 2.25 to approximately 2.2, and given that 2.2 is the two significant figure answer, I will go with \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut I\'m still uncertain because the precise calculation gives 2.229, which is closer to 2.23 than 2.2. However, adhering strictly to significant figures, it\'s 2.2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, but the inclusion of radial velocities suggests otherwise.\n\nBut given the problem\'s context and the necessity to consider Doppler shift, and given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, which is 2.2 with two sig figs or 2.23 with three, but the factors given have two sig figs (1.5) and the velocity has two or three. Given the problem\'s lack of clarity on sig figs, but in physics problems, usually, 700 km/s is two sig figs unless a decimal is present. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut to comply with the detailed calculation showing 2.229, and if the question permits three sig figs, then \\boxed{2.23} is better. However, given the possible sig figs, I think the answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, I should conclude with the most accurate answer derived from the calculations, which is approximately 2.23, and acknowledge the significant figures ambiguity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.2}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391100, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=9675, prompt_tokens=747, total_tokens=10422, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law, considering the Doppler effect due to radial velocities.

1. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity \( L \) is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \).
2. **Wien's Law**: The peak wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature \( T \).
3. **Doppler Effect**: Adjusting the observed wavelengths for radial velocity.

Given:
- \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
- Radial velocities: 0 km/s for Star_1, 700 km/s for Star_2.
- Observed peak wavelengths are the same.

**Steps**:
1. **Doppler Shift Adjustment**:
   - For Star_2, the emitted wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{emit2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v}{c}} \).
   - Using Wien's Law: \( T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \).

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \).
   - Substituting values: \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5}}\right)^4 \).

3. **Calculations**:
   - \( \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333 \).
   - \( 1 + 0.002333 \approx 1.002333 \).
   - \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009366 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{1.009366} \approx 0.9907 \).
   - \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.229 \).

4. **Significant Figures**:
   - Given the input data (1.5 and 700 km/s) has two significant figures, the result is rounded to two significant figures.

**Final Answer**:
\boxed{2.2}

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted, meaning its actual emitted wavelength is shorter than observed. Therefore, its actual temperature would be higher than what is inferred without considering Doppler shift. However, since astronomers observed the same peak wavelength for both, but Star_2's actual emitted peak wavelength is shorter (higher temperature), this implies T2 = T1 × (1 + v2/c).

But wait, let's re-examine the Doppler effect. If a star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the emitted wavelength would be shorter. So, λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). Therefore, if λ_obs is the same for both, then Star_2's emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Therefore, using Wien's Law:

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c). Wait, but this seems counterintuitive because Star_2, moving away, would have its emitted light redshifted. However, when we observe the same peak wavelength for both stars, but considering Star_2's velocity, the actual temperature of Star_2 must be higher. Because the observed λ_max (peak wavelength) for Star_2 is shifted to longer wavelengths (redshifted), so to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength (higher temperature), which when redshifted, matches the observed λ_max of Star_1. Therefore, Star_2's actual temperature is higher than Star_1's.

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Then, substituting into luminosity:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (R1/R2)² ) * (T1/T2)^4 )

Given R1/R2 = 1.5, and T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c). Therefore:

L1/L2 = (1.5²) * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴

We need to compute (1 + v2/c). The velocity v2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333.

Thus, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333. Therefore, (1 / 1.0023333)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.0023333)^4 ≈ using binomial approximation:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x. So, 1 - 4*(0.0023333) ≈ 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990667. However, this is an approximation. For more precision, compute (1.0023333)^-4.

Alternatively, compute ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.00233 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...), so ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.00233. Then, ln((1.0023333)^4) = 4*0.00233 ≈ 0.00932. Therefore, (1.0023333)^-4 = e^(-0.00932) ≈ 1 - 0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.00932 + 0.000043 ≈ 0.990723. So approximately 0.9907.

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. But this is a rough calculation. Let's compute more accurately.

First, compute v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333... Wait, 700 divided by 300,000 is 700/300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333. Correct. So, 0.0023333.

Now, 1 + v2/c = 1.0023333.

Compute (1.0023333)^4:

First, compute (1.0023333)^2:

1.0023333^2 = (1 + 0.0023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1.004672044.

Then, square that to get (1.004672044)^2:

= 1 + 2*0.004672044 + (0.004672044)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009344088 + 0.00002183 ≈ 1.009365918.

Therefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009365918. Therefore, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659. Therefore, 1/(1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1/1.0093659 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23.

But wait, this is the ratio L1/L2. The problem states that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor of: So if L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, then the answer is approximately 2.23. However, the options might require a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic. Let me verify.

The key steps:

1. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. But due to Doppler shift, Star_2's emitted peak wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Since Star_1 is stationary, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

2. Therefore, using Wien's Law:

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Thus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but we need to relate T1 and T2. If Star_2's emitted peak wavelength is shorter (because λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)), and since shorter wavelength corresponds to higher temperature (Wien's Law), then T2 > T1. Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, when we compute the luminosity ratio:

L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v2/c))^4

So, yes, that's correct.

Thus, plugging in the numbers:

v2/c = 700 km/s / 3e5 km/s ≈ 0.002333...

1 + v2/c = 1.002333...

(1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.0093659

Thus, 1 / (1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, approximately 2.23.

But the problem states that astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, given that the problem is likely expecting an exact expression or a specific value, perhaps considering that (1 + v/c) is small and approximated, but let's check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring? Wait, no, because the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures differ. Therefore, this must be taken into account.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity as well. But the problem states that they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation, so they would account for the Doppler shift in temperature. Wait, no. The luminosity calculation would be based on the actual radius and temperature of the star. However, the observed flux would be affected by Doppler shift, but luminosity is intrinsic. Wait, but the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of...". So, perhaps the astronomers, knowing the radial velocities, correct for the Doppler shift when determining the temperatures. Thus, they would infer the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their velocities, and then compute the luminosities based on the actual temperatures and radii.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Correct the observed peak wavelength for Doppler shift to get the actual emitted peak wavelength for each star.

2. Use Wien's Law to find the actual temperature of each star.

3. Use Stefan-Boltzmann Law with actual R and T to compute luminosity.

Given that both stars' observed λ_max are the same, but due to Doppler shifts, their actual λ_emit differ.

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, the Doppler effect implies λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Therefore, using Wien's Law:

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Thus, the ratio of luminosities is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)² / R2² ) * ( T1⁴ / (T1 (1 + v2/c))⁴ ) ) = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / c)^4

Given c is speed of light, which is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, 700 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333... Wait, no: 700 divided by 300,000 is 0.002333... So, 700 / 3e5 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333...

Thus, (1 + 0.002333...) ≈ 1.002333...

Therefore, (1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.009366...

Hence, 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229...

Approximately 2.23. So, the factor is roughly 2.23. However, given that the problem might expect an exact expression, but since it's a numerical answer, likely to two decimal places or as a fraction. Alternatively, perhaps we need to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Doppler shift is negligible, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.23% or so), but even so, the effect on temperature is a factor of 1.0023, so when raised to the fourth power, it's about a 0.94% decrease from 2.25, leading to approximately 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23.

However, let's compute it with more precise numbers.

First, compute v2/c:

v2 = 700 km/s = 7 x 10^5 m/s

c = 3 x 10^8 m/s

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333333...

1 + v2/c = 1.002333333...

Now, compute (1.0023333333)^4:

Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute ln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.00233039 (using Taylor series: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ...)

ln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.0023333333 - (0.0023333333)^2 / 2 + (0.0023333333)^3 / 3 - ...

≈ 0.0023333333 - (0.0000054444444) + (0.0000000127037) - ... ≈ approximately 0.0023279

Then, 4 * ln(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.0093116

Exponentiate: e^0.0093116 ≈ 1.00936 (since e^0.0093 ≈ 1.00936)

Thus, (1.0023333333)^4 ≈ 1.00936

Therefore, 1 / 1.00936 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

Rounded to three significant figures, that's approximately 2.23.

But let me check using calculator-like precision:

Compute (1 + 0.0023333333)^4:

First, (1.0023333333)^2 = 1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333

Multiply 1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333:

= 1*1 + 1*0.0023333333 + 0.0023333333*1 + 0.0023333333*0.0023333333

= 1 + 0.0023333333 + 0.0023333333 + 0.0000054444444

= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444444 ≈ 1.004672111

Then, square that result: (1.004672111)^2

Compute 1.004672111 * 1.004672111:

= 1*1 + 1*0.004672111 + 0.004672111*1 + 0.004672111*0.004672111

= 1 + 0.004672111 + 0.004672111 + 0.000021828

≈ 1 + 0.009344222 + 0.000021828 ≈ 1.00936605

Therefore, (1.0023333333)^4 ≈ 1.00936605

Thus, 1 / 1.00936605 ≈ 0.990723

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291

So approximately 2.23.

But the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of v/c, but given that the answer is numerical, we need to compute it. However, 700 km/s is a non-relativistic speed, so the Doppler shift can be approximated.

Alternatively, using the relativistic Doppler effect formula, but since v << c, the approximation λ_obs/λ_emit = 1 + v/c is sufficient.

But since we already used that approximation, our calculation holds.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, given that the problem might expect considering only the classical factors (radius and temperature) without Doppler shift, but the problem explicitly mentions radial velocities and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so the Doppler shift must be considered.

Therefore, the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229.

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Let's check.

If we ignore the radial velocities, assuming that the observed peak wavelengths are the actual emitted wavelengths, then T1 = T2, and L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. However, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, and they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Therefore, the Doppler shift must be considered. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.23.

But given that 2.23 is close to 2.25, but the calculation shows it's slightly less. However, in multiple-choice contexts, sometimes such factors are rounded, but since the user hasn't provided options, we need to state the exact factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature relation. Let me verify again.

Star_1: v1 = 0, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs

Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s (away from us), so λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

Thus, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Thus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, when calculating luminosity:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (1.5²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the factor is 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4. Given that 700/c ≈ 0.002333, the denominator is (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009366, so 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, in precise terms, it's 2.25 divided by (1 + 700/(3*10^5))^4. If we compute it more accurately:

First, compute 700 / (3*10^5) = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333333

Then, (1 + 0.0023333333)^4:

Using the binomial expansion for small x:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + n(n-1)(n-2)x³/6 + ...

For x = 0.0023333, n = 4:

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4

Compute each term:

4x = 4 * 0.0023333 ≈ 0.0093333

6x² = 6 * (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.0000054444 ≈ 0.000032666

4x³ ≈ 4 * (0.0023333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.00000001296 ≈ 0.00000005184

x^4 ≈ (0.0023333)^4 ≈ 0.000000000030

Adding them up:

1 + 0.0093333 + 0.000032666 + 0.00000005184 + 0.000000000030 ≈ 1.00936597

Thus, (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1.00936597

Therefore, 1 / (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00936597 ≈ 0.990723

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291

Rounding to two decimal places, 2.23. To three significant figures, 2.23. Since 2.2291 is closer to 2.23 than 2.22.

Alternatively, if the problem expects an exact fractional expression, but given the numbers, it's unlikely. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23.

However, let me check with more precise calculation using calculator:

Compute 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333333

1 + 0.0023333333 = 1.0023333333

Now, compute 1.0023333333^4:

First, 1.0023333333^2 = 1.00467211

Then, 1.00467211^2 = (1.00467211)(1.00467211)

Multiply:

1*1 = 1

1*0.00467211 = 0.00467211

0.00467211*1 = 0.00467211

0.00467211*0.00467211 ≈ 0.000021828

Add them up:

1 + 0.00467211 + 0.00467211 + 0.000021828 ≈ 1.00936504

Thus, 1.0023333333^4 ≈ 1.00936504

Therefore, 1 / 1.00936504 ≈ 0.990723

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990723 ≈ 2.2291

So, approximately 2.23.

Given that in astrophysics, such factors are often rounded to two decimal places or significant figures, the answer is approximately 2.23.

But let me check one more time for any possible mistakes in the reasoning.

Another way to think: The luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We found T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c)

Hence, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4 = 2.25 / (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ 2.229.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. However, the problem might expect the answer to be 2.25, ignoring the Doppler shift, but since the radial velocities are given and the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler effect must be considered, leading to a slightly lower factor than 2.25.

Given that in competitive exams or textbooks, sometimes such factors are simplified, but given the data, the correct answer should consider the Doppler shift, leading to approximately 2.23. However, if we calculate with more precise exponentials:

Using natural logarithm and exponentials for higher accuracy:

ln(1.0023333) = 0.00233039

Multiply by 4: 0.00932156

Exponential: e^(-0.00932156) = ?

Approximate e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x⁴/24

x = -0.00932156

e^x ≈ 1 - 0.00932156 + (0.00932156)^2 / 2 - (0.00932156)^3 / 6 + (0.00932156)^4 / 24

Compute term by term:

1 = 1

-0.00932156 = -0.00932156

+ (0.00932156)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.0000869 / 2 ≈ 0.00004345

- (0.00932156)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.000000811 / 6 ≈ 0.000000135

+ (0.00932156)^4 / 24 ≈ 0.00000000756 / 24 ≈ 0.000000000315

Adding up:

1 - 0.00932156 = 0.99067844

+ 0.00004345 = 0.99072189

- 0.000000135 = 0.990721755

+ 0.000000000315 ≈ 0.990721755

Thus, e^(-0.00932156) ≈ 0.990721755

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990721755 ≈ 2.2291

So, approximately 2.2291, which rounds to 2.23.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 2.23. If the question expects a precise answer, maybe they use (1 + v/c) without higher-order terms, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 4*(v/c)) due to (1/(1 + x))^4 ≈ 1 - 4x for small x.

Given that 4*(v/c) = 4*0.0023333 ≈ 0.0093333, so 1 - 0.0093333 ≈ 0.9906667, then L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906667 ≈ 2.229, which is the same as before.

Therefore, regardless of the method, the factor is approximately 2.23.

However, since the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, and given that professionals would use precise calculations, the answer should be this approximate value. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23, which can be written as \boxed{2.23}.

But wait, let me check if there's a calculation mistake in the velocity.

Wait, the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the component of the velocity along the line of sight. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is redshifted, meaning λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). If the star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c). The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." It doesn't specify the direction, but radial velocity is usually positive for receding (away), negative for approaching. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, it's moving away, leading to redshift. Therefore, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, our previous calculation holds.

But just to be thorough, suppose the 700 km/s is approaching (though unlikely without a minus sign), then λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 - v/c). Then, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = (b / λ_obs) / (1 - v/c) = T1 / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = T1 / (1 - v/c), which would mean T2 > T1, leading to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 - v/c)^4. In that case, with v/c = 0.0023333, (1 - v/c)^4 ≈ (0.9976667)^4 ≈ approximately 0.9907, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. Wait, same result? No, wait:

Wait, if the velocity is approaching, then v is negative. So radial velocity is -700 km/s. Then, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700/c). Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c). Then, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 - 700/c) = T1 * (1 - 700/c). Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 - 700/c), which would mean T2 < T1. Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 - 700/c))^4. However, 700/c is positive, so 1 / (1 - 700/c) = 1 / (negative number) if 700/c > 1, but 700/c ≈ 0.002333, so 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.9976667. Therefore, 1 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.002340, so (1 / 0.9976667)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00941, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00941 ≈ 2.271. However, this contradicts the previous result. But this scenario assumes that the radial velocity is negative (approaching), but the problem states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, with no negative sign, implying Star_2 is moving away. Therefore, the initial calculation holds.

Therefore, the correct factor is approximately 2.23.

But let me confirm with a different approach. Suppose we assign actual numbers.

Assume Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away. Let’s assume c = 3e5 km/s.

Then, the Doppler factor is 1 + 700/3e5 = 1 + 7/3000 ≈ 1.002333.

Thus, Star_2's emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / 1.002333.

Using Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_emit.

Therefore, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/1.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Yes, same result.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, considering significant figures, the given data (1.5 times, 700 km/s) has two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be presented with two significant figures: approximately 2.2.

But 700 km/s is three significant figures, 1.5 is two. The rule is the least number of significant figures in the multiplicatives. However, since we have division and exponents, it's a bit more complex. But generally, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, the radius and mass are given as 1.5 (two significant figures), and velocity as 700 (two or three? If 700 is written as 7e2, it's one, but usually 700 with no decimal is ambiguous. However, in scientific contexts, 700 km/s would often be considered as two significant figures (7 and the zeros are placeholders). If it's three significant figures, then 700. km/s. Given the problem states 700 km/s without a decimal, it's ambiguous but likely two significant figures.

Therefore, with two significant figures in both 1.5 and 700, the answer should be 2.2.

But our calculation gives 2.229, which is 2.23 with three significant figures. However, given the input has two significant figures for the radius and mass factor (1.5) and possibly two for velocity (700), the answer should be 2.2.

But this is a judgment call. In many textbooks, 700 could be two or three sig figs. If it's three, then 700. km/s would be three. Since it's written as 700 km/s, it's safer to assume two significant figures.

Therefore, rounding 2.229 to two significant figures gives 2.2.

However, different sources might handle this differently. Given the ambiguity, but in the context of astronomy, such precise velocities (700 km/s) are usually considered with three significant figures. For example, radial velocities are often measured with high precision. If 700 is three significant figures, then the answer should be 2.23.

But without explicit information, it's hard to tell. Given that the problem is likely constructed with 1.5 (two sig figs) and 700 (two sig figs), the answer would be 2.2. But since 1.5 is a factor and 700 km/s is a measured quantity, which might be three sig figs, the answer could be 2.23.

But given that in the calculation, we ended up with approximately 2.229, which is 2.23 when rounded to three significant figures, and if the inputs are considered to have three significant figures (700), then 2.23 is appropriate.

However, the original factors (radius and mass) are 1.5, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the dominating factor is two sig figs. Hence, the answer should be 2.2.

But this is conflicting. In exams, usually, such factors are given with enough sig figs so that the answer can be unambiguous. Here, since 1.5 and 700 are the given numbers, and 700 is probably two sig figs, the answer should be two sig figs: 2.2.

However, the exact calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is closer to 2.2 or 2.23 depending on rounding. If we stick to two sig figs for 1.5 and 700, then 2.2. If we consider 700 as three sig figs, then 2.23.

Given that in most educational settings, unless specified, 700 is two sig figs, so 2.2. However, the problem might expect the answer to account for the exact calculation without rounding, hence 2.23. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll present both possibilities but lean towards 2.23 as the more precise answer given the detailed calculation.

Therefore, the factor is approximately \boxed{2.2} or \boxed{2.23}. But given the problem's context and the precise calculation leading to 2.23, I think \boxed{2.2} is too approximate, and \boxed{2.23} is better. However, let me check with exact fraction.

Compute 1.5^2 = 2.25

Compute (1 + 700/c)^4 = (1 + 7/3000)^4

= (3007/3000)^4

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / (3007/3000)^4 = 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4

But calculating this exactly is tedious, but perhaps approximate:

3000/3007 ≈ 0.99767

(0.99767)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^4 ≈ 0.9907

Thus, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2.25 divided by (3007/3000)^4, which is approximately 2.23. Hence, the answer is \boxed{2.2} if considering two significant figures, or \boxed{2.23} with three. Given that 700 has three significant figures and 1.5 has two, the answer's precision is limited by the least precise measurement, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{2.2}.

But this contradicts the detailed calculation, which gives 2.229, very close to 2.23. In many standardized tests, if the calculation results in 2.229, they might round to 2.2 or 2.23 based on options. Since the user hasn't provided options, but asks to put the final answer within \boxed{}, and given that in physics, we usually maintain significant figures based on input, the answer is two significant figures: 2.2.

But considering that 1.5 is two sig figs and 700 is two or three, but in the calculation, the dominant uncertainty comes from the 1.5 factor (which is two sig figs), the answer should be 2.2.

However, I recall that when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise value. Here, 1.5 (two sig figs) and 700 (two or three). If 700 is three, then the least is two (from 1.5). If 700 is two, then still two. Hence, two sig figs.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}.

But the detailed calculation shows 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, given that 2.229 is much closer to 2.2 than to 2.3, it's 2.2.

But wait, 2.229 rounded to two sig figs is 2.2, because the third digit is less than 5. Yes, 2.229 rounded to two decimal places is 2.23, but rounded to two significant figures is 2.2.

Wait, no: 2.229 has three sig figs. To round to two sig figs, look at the third digit: 2.229 → 2.2 (since the third digit is 2, which is less than 5).

Wait, no: 2.229 rounded to two significant figures:

The first two digits are 2 and .2. The third digit is 2, which is less than 5, so it remains 2.2.

But if the number were 2.25, rounded to two sig figs would be 2.3. But 2.229 is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs.

Therefore, the correct answer with two significant figures is \boxed{2.2}.

However, I need to reconcile this with the problem statement. The problem says "the factor of:", which often in such contexts expects a exact fractional answer if possible, but given the numbers, it's a decimal. If the answer is approximately 2.2 or 2.23, but given the significant figures, 2.2 is appropriate.

However, I recall that in some textbooks, when you have a factor like 1.5, which is a multiplier, and velocities given as whole numbers, they might expect the answer to be expressed with two decimal places or as a fraction. But given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, but with significant figures, it's 2.2.

But given that this is a calculation where the Doppler shift contributes a small correction, and the dominant factor is 2.25, which is adjusted down to 2.23, which is still closer to 2.2 than 2.3 when considering two sig figs.

However, given that 2.229 is technically 2.23 when rounded to three significant figures, but the inputs limit it to two, the answer must be 2.2.

But I'm conflicted because the calculation is precise to about 2.229, which is 2.23, but with sig figs, 2.2. However, in many astronomical calculations, such precision is retained beyond significant figures because the factors are known precisely. But in this problem, since the given data has limited precision, we must adhere to that.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}.

But to confirm, let's assume that 700 km/s is three significant figures (700.), then the answer would be 2.23. However, since the problem states 700 km/s without a decimal, it's two significant figures. Therefore, 2.2.

But given that the problem is likely designed by someone who expects the Doppler shift calculation to slightly reduce the factor from 2.25 to approximately 2.2, and given that 2.2 is the two significant figure answer, I will go with \boxed{2.2}.

But I'm still uncertain because the precise calculation gives 2.229, which is closer to 2.23 than 2.2. However, adhering strictly to significant figures, it's 2.2.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, but the inclusion of radial velocities suggests otherwise.

But given the problem's context and the necessity to consider Doppler shift, and given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, which is 2.2 with two sig figs or 2.23 with three, but the factors given have two sig figs (1.5) and the velocity has two or three. Given the problem's lack of clarity on sig figs, but in physics problems, usually, 700 km/s is two sig figs unless a decimal is present. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}.

But to comply with the detailed calculation showing 2.229, and if the question permits three sig figs, then \boxed{2.23} is better. However, given the possible sig figs, I think the answer is \boxed{2.2}.

But since this is a thought process, I should conclude with the most accurate answer derived from the calculations, which is approximately 2.23, and acknowledge the significant figures ambiguity.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}

So T2 is higher or lower than T1?\n\nWait, if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is a factor greater than 1, so λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Hence, λ_emit2 < λ_obs. Since λ_emit2 is smaller, T2 (from Wien\'s law) would be higher. Wait, but according to Wien\'s law, higher temperature corresponds to smaller peak wavelength. So if Star_2\'s emitted wavelength is smaller, then its temperature is higher. Therefore, T2 > T1.\n\nBut the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2. But if Star_2 is hotter, depending on radii, Star_1\'s luminosity might not be higher. Wait, but we need to reconcile this.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is due to Star_2 moving towards us. If the velocity is positive when moving away, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, then the radial velocity would be negative. But since the problem states radial velocity as 700 km/s for Star_2, perhaps they just gave the speed. But in astronomy, radial velocity is signed. For example, positive is receding, negative is approaching. But since the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively," without specifying direction, perhaps we need to consider that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may have a typo, but assuming the given velocities are just speeds. However, the actual effect depends on direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the Doppler shift would blueshift its emitted wavelengths, making λ_obs smaller. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its emitted wavelength would be longer than the observed one. So in that case, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c). But if v2 is 700 km/s, then (1 - v2/c) is (1 - 700/300,000) ≈ 1 - 0.00233 ≈ 0.9977. So λ_emit2 ≈ λ_obs / 0.9977 ≈ 1.0023 λ_obs. Therefore, λ_emit2 is longer than λ_obs, so T2 would be lower than T1. Because higher wavelength implies lower temperature.\n\nAlternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c), which would be shorter than λ_obs, leading to higher temperature. So the direction is critical here.\n\nBut the problem does not specify if the velocity is towards or away. However, given that they stated "radial velocities", in astronomical terms, positive values typically indicate recession (moving away), while negative indicate approach. But if they just give 700 km/s, perhaps they mean the speed. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." If 700 km/s is the speed, regardless of direction, but since they found the same observed peak wavelength, which is the same as Star_1\'s emitted, which is at rest (v=0), then Star_2 must be moving in such a way that its emitted wavelength is Doppler-shifted to match Star_1\'s.\n\nSo, if Star_1\'s emitted wavelength is λ_emit1 = λ_obs, and Star_2\'s observed is the same, then:\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards the observer, its emitted wavelength would be longer (since blueshifted to match λ_obs). Alternatively, if moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter (since redshifted to match λ_obs). Wait, no. Let\'s think:\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards us (blue shift), the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same as Star_1\'s. Therefore, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its own emitted wavelength must be longer than observed. So that when blueshifted, it becomes the same as Star_1\'s. Similarly, if Star_2 is moving away, then its emitted wavelength must be shorter than observed (to compensate for redshift).\n\nBut since both observed wavelengths are the same, and Star_1 is at rest, Star_2\'s emitted wavelength must be blueshifted (if moving towards) or redshifted (if moving away) to match Star_1\'s. So to have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, if Star_2 is moving towards, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v/c). But since Star_1\'s λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c). Then, using Wien\'s law, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c)) = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 - v/c) = T1 * (1 - v/c). So T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c). Similarly, if moving away, λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).\n\nBut in either case, the problem says that Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s. Let\'s consider both scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Star_2 is moving towards us (v = -700 km/s, but since speed is 700, direction is negative). Then, T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c) = T1 * (1 + 700/c). (Because if v is negative, then 1 - (-v)/c = 1 + v/c). Wait, maybe my sign convention is mixed.\n\nWait, let\'s clarify:\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is:\n\nλ_obs / λ_emit = 1 + v_r / c\n\nWhere v_r is the radial velocity. If the source is moving towards the observer, v_r is negative. So:\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r = -700 km/s.\n\nThus,\n\nλ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700 / c)\n\nBut since λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (because Star_1\'s v_r = 0), then:\n\nλ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700 / c)\n\nTherefore,\n\nλ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 - 700 / c)\n\nUsing Wien\'s law, T = b / λ_emit, so:\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 - 700 / c)) = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 - 700 / c) = T1 * (1 - 700 / c)\n\nBut 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Therefore, 700 / c ≈ 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.00233. So:\n\nT2 ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.00233) ≈ T1 * 0.9977\n\nTherefore, T2 ≈ 0.9977 T1. So temperature is slightly lower.\n\nAlternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, v_r = +700 km/s:\n\nλ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700 / c)\n\nThus,\n\nλ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + 700 / c)\n\nThen,\n\nT2 = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 + 700 / c) = T1 * (1 + 700 / c) ≈ T1 * 1.00233.\n\nSo T2 ≈ 1.00233 T1. So temperature is slightly higher.\n\nBut in either case, the difference (0.23% lower or higher) is minimal. However, the problem states that Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s by a factor. Considering that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger. So, even if the temperatures are nearly the same, the radius squared term would dominate. But with the possible temperature difference, we need to factor that in.\n\nBut if T2 is slightly lower (Star_2 moving towards), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since R1=1.5 R2, and T1 ≈ T2 / 0.9977, so T1 ≈ 1.0023 T2. Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0023)^4 ≈ 1.0093. Then, L1/L2 ≈ (2.25) * 1.0093 ≈ 2.27.\n\nAlternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, T2 ≈ 1.0023 T1, so (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1 / 1.0023)^4 ≈ 0.991. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.991 ≈ 2.23.\n\nBut the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The answer is likely 2.25, but the problem mentions that they considered radial velocities. So, the Doppler shift affects the temperature calculation. However, the problem states "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nWait, but the problem says that the astronomers took into account the radial velocities when computing the luminosity. So they would have corrected for the Doppler shift. So, they would have inferred the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their velocities, and then applied the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Therefore, the answer requires using the corrected temperatures.\n\nSo, let\'s do the exact calculation.\n\nFirst, compute the Doppler factor. Let\'s assume that Star_2 is moving away (positive velocity). Then:\n\nλ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)\n\nBut λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since Star_1\'s radial velocity is 0). Therefore:\n\nFrom Wien\'s law:\n\nT1 = b / λ_emit1\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nThus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c\n\nBut v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo, v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, T2 is slightly higher than T1.\n\nBut then, when calculating luminosity:\n\nL1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4\n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5\n\nT1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997668\n\nTherefore, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997668)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002332)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002332 + ... ≈ 0.9907 (using binomial approximation for small x: (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x)\n\nBut let\'s compute it more accurately:\n\nln(0.997668) ≈ -0.002335\n\nMultiply by 4: -0.00934\n\nExponentiate: e^{-0.00934} ≈ 0.9907\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907\n\nThus, L1/L2 ≈ (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229\n\nApproximately 2.23 times.\n\nBut if Star_2 is moving towards us, then T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c), but with v2 = 700 km/s (but velocity is negative). Then:\n\nT2 = T1 * (1 - (-700/c)) = T1 * (1 + 700/c), which is the same as if moving away. Wait, no. Wait, if moving towards, the Doppler formula is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)\n\nIf v_r is the velocity of the star relative to the observer. If moving towards, v_r is negative. So:\n\nλ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + (-700)/c) = λ_emit * (1 - 700/c)\n\nTherefore, solving for λ_emit:\n\nλ_emit = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)\n\nThus, T2 = b / λ_emit = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 - 700/c) = T1 * (1 - 700/c)\n\nHence, T2 = T1 * (1 - 700/c) ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 0.997667\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 ≈ 1 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00234\n\nThus, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0094\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 ≈ (1.5)^2 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271\n\nTherefore, depending on the direction of Star_2\'s velocity, the factor is approximately 2.23 or 2.27. However, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. In astronomical terms, radial velocities are given with positive meaning recession. Therefore, Star_2 is moving away, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nBut the problem asks for the factor by which Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s. The answer choices (if any) might be expecting an exact value, but since we have to compute it, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? But the problem explicitly mentions that the radial velocities were considered in the calculation, so we can\'t ignore it. But 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 700 km/s is 0.233% of the speed of light. So, the effect is small but non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test whether I recognize that the temperatures are the same, thereby leading to a factor of 2.25. But that would be only if the Doppler shift is neglected. However, the problem states that the radial velocities were calculated, and the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. But if we don\'t account for Doppler shift, then the temperatures would be the same, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. However, if we account for Doppler shift, the temperatures differ slightly, leading to a small correction.\n\nBut maybe the problem is designed to ignore the Doppler effect because it\'s a simple question. Let\'s check the problem statement again:\n\n"Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nThe key is that the astronomers determined the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which are the same. The astronomers would have to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual luminosity. So, they observed the same peak wavelength, but considering their velocities, they would infer different actual temperatures. Therefore, the answer requires considering the Doppler shift.\n\nBut the problem\'s answer is likely expecting the application of both radius and temperature factors. Let\'s proceed with the calculation.\n\nGiven that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let\'s assume it\'s moving away (standard convention). Then, using the Doppler correction:\n\nλ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\nStar_1\'s emitted wavelength is λ_obs, since its velocity is 0.\n\nUsing Wien\'s Law:\n\nT1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs\n\nT2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v/c) = T1 * (1 + v/c)\n\nThus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio:\n\nL1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (R1/R2)² ) * ( T1 / T2 )⁴\n\nSubstituting T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c):\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5²) * (1 / (1 + v/c))⁴\n\nCompute (1 + v/c):\n\nv = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nv/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nThus, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, (1 / (1.002333))⁴ ≈ (approx) using binomial expansion:\n\n(1 + x)^-4 ≈ 1 - 4x + ... where x = 0.002333\n\nSo, ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002333) ≈ 1 - 0.00933 ≈ 0.99067\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229\n\nApproximately 2.23.\n\nBut the problem states that Star_1\'s mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. How does mass factor in here? The problem says "the mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times)". But in the context of black body radiation, mass doesn\'t directly affect luminosity. However, in real stars, mass affects luminosity through the mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3 or M^4 for main-sequence stars). But the problem specifies to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Therefore, mass is only relevant if it affects radius or temperature. But in this problem, the radius and temperature are already given (radius explicitly, temperature through the peak wavelength and Doppler shift). Therefore, the mass is extraneous information here. The answer only depends on radius and temperature.\n\nHence, the factor is approximately 2.23. But given that the problem may expect an exact expression, perhaps we need to compute (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4. But 700/c is small, so maybe the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects and approximate (1 + v/c) as just a factor, but given that even 700 km/s is non-relativistic, it\'s still a small term. However, since the problem mentions radial velocities, they must be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to neglect the Doppler shift, assuming that the observed peak wavelengths correspond to the rest frame. But the problem states that astronomers calculated radial velocities, which would be used to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame. However, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." This could mean that after correcting for Doppler shift, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, which would mean T1 = T2. However, the wording is ambiguous.\n\nIf "appeared brightest" refers to the observed (not rest frame) wavelength, then the Doppler shift must be considered. If it refers to the rest frame, then they have the same temperature. The problem says "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." Spectroscopy typically measures observed wavelengths, but astronomers can correct for Doppler shifts to find the rest frame wavelengths. If they found that the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, then T1 = T2. If they found the observed peak wavelengths are the same, then they must have different rest frame wavelengths due to Doppler shifts.\n\nThe problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which is ambiguous. If "appeared" refers to observed, then different rest frame. If they corrected for velocities, then same rest frame.\n\nBut given that the problem later mentions that they calculated radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s, it suggests that the observed wavelengths were blueshifted or redshifted, and they had to calculate the velocities based on shifts. But the problem states that they "managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which they found to be the same. So if the observed peaks are the same, then their rest frame peaks must differ. But if they corrected for radial velocities to determine the rest frame peaks, then they would be same. The wording is critical.\n\nThe key is: when the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", does "appeared" mean as observed or after correcting for Doppler shift? In astronomy, when determining the peak wavelength, they would correct for the Doppler shift to get the rest frame wavelength. Otherwise, the peak would be shifted. So likely, the astronomers measured the observed peak wavelength, then used the radial velocity to calculate the rest frame peak wavelength. If after correction, the rest frame peaks are the same, then temperatures are same. But if not corrected, then different.\n\nBut the problem states: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." If they had to correct for radial velocity to determine the rest frame peak wavelengths, then the fact that they are the same implies T1 = T2. But if they didn\'t correct, then the observed peaks are same, but rest frame differ. But given that radial velocities are given separately, the astronomers would have used those velocities to correct the observed wavelengths to find the rest frame peaks. Therefore, in that case, the rest frame peaks are same, so T1 = T2. Then, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.\n\nBut then why mention the radial velocities? If the rest frame peaks are same, then radial velocities don\'t affect the temperature calculation. But the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nIf the temperatures are same, then answer is 2.25. But radial velocities are mentioned, which might have been used to determine that the rest frame peaks are same. Therefore, the answer is 2.25. However, the inclusion of radial velocities and the fact that they calculated them might imply that the observed peaks are different, but they used radial velocities to find that the rest frame peaks are same. But the problem states that the observed peaks are same. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the problem says: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Then, using the radial velocities, they would realize that the rest frame peaks are different. For example, if Star_2 is moving away, its rest frame peak is shorter (blueshifted) to appear the same as Star_1\'s. But wait, no: If Star_2 is moving away, its rest frame peak is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c), which is shorter than λ_obs. So the rest frame peak of Star_2 is shorter, implying higher temperature. But in that case, the astronomers, knowing the radial velocity, would calculate the rest frame peak and hence the temperature. Therefore, even though the observed peaks are same, the actual rest frame peaks (and hence temperatures) differ.\n\nTherefore, the problem wants us to account for the Doppler shift in temperature calculation. Hence, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.23. But since 700 km/s is a lot, but the factor is close to 2.25. However, given that in many textbook problems, such a small velocity (compared to c) might be neglected, but the inclusion of radial velocity in the problem suggests that we should consider it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the understanding that the same observed peak wavelength implies same temperature, neglecting Doppler shift. But that would be incorrect in reality, but maybe in the problem\'s context. However, given that radial velocity is provided, it\'s expected to be used.\n\nBut if we proceed with the calculation considering Doppler shift:\n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23.\n\nBut 2.23 is approximately 2.25, but maybe the problem expects an exact form. Alternatively, if we use v = 700 km/s, then:\n\n(1 + v/c) = 1 + 700/(3*10^5) = 1 + 7/3000 = 3007/3000\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c) = 3007/3000\n\nThus, (1 + v/c)^4 = (3007/3000)^4\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (3007/3000)^4\n\nBut this is a precise calculation. Let\'s compute it:\n\nFirst, compute (3007/3000)^4:\n\n3007/3000 = 1 + 7/3000 ≈ 1.002333...\n\nCompute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233\n\nMultiply by 4: 0.00932\n\nExponentiate: e^0.00932 ≈ 1.00937\n\nTherefore, (3007/3000)^4 ≈ 1.00937\n\nThus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.229\n\nSo approximately 2.23.\n\nBut given that 2.23 is close to 2.25, but the exact value requires precise calculation. However, the problem may expect us to write the answer as ( (1.5)^2 ) / ( (1 + 700/c)^4 ). But since c is 3e5 km/s, 700/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3*100) = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but 700 km/s divided by c in km/s: c ≈ 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3*100) = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but above we had in terms of 700/3e5 = 0.00233 (unitless). Wait, actually, 700 km/s divided by c = 3e5 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but in terms of unitless factor, 700 km/s is 0.07% of c. Wait, 0.07% is 0.0007, but 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233, which is 0.233%. That’s correct.\n\nBut in any case, the exact answer is (1.5^2)/( (1 + 700/(3*10^5))^4 ). But unless the problem expects an approximate answer, which is roughly 2.25 * (1 - 4*(700/(3*10^5))) ≈ 2.25*(1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25*0.99067 ≈ 2.23.\n\nBut given that the options might not have decimals, but given the problem\'s phrasing, it\'s likely that the answer is 2.25, and the radial velocity is a distractor, or the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect. But why would they mention radial velocities then?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that both stars are in binary system, and the radial velocities are due to orbital motion, but in terms of black body radiation, the luminosity depends on the actual temperature, which would be determined after correcting for Doppler shift. Therefore, the correct calculation would lead to approximately 2.23.\n\nHowever, in most textbooks, such problems assume that the observed peak wavelength is the same in the rest frame, i.e., they neglect Doppler shift unless specified. But here, the problem specifically mentions radial velocities, so it\'s testing the understanding that the actual temperatures differ when considering Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since the options are likely rounded, and 2.23 is closest to 2.25, but another thought: maybe the problem expects to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula, but at 700 km/s, relativistic effects are negligible. The relativistic Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but for v << c, it approximates to 1 + v/c. Therefore, the non-relativistic calculation suffices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Since the peak wavelengths observed are the same and radial velocities are given, but if you do not account for Doppler shift, you would calculate the same temperature, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25. However, if you account for Doppler shift, the temperatures are different, leading to a slightly different factor. But since the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, considering the radial velocities, the answer should be the corrected one, approximately 2.23. But given that 2.23 is not a clean number, perhaps the problem expects the non-Doppler shift answer, 2.25. This is a dilemma.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the problem statement:\n\n"Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nEmphasis on "they computed", referring to the astronomers who had considered the radial velocities. Therefore, the astronomers would have corrected for the Doppler shift in their calculation. Therefore, the answer must be approximately 2.23. But since precise calculation is needed, perhaps we need to compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute (1 + v/c):\n\nv = 700 km/s = 0.7 * 10^6 m/s\n\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nv/c = 0.7 / 300 ≈ 0.002333333...\n\nThus,\n\n(1 + v/c) = 1.002333...\n\n(1 + v/c)^4:\n\nFirst, compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.0023305\n\nMultiply by 4: 0.009322\n\nExponentiate: e^{0.009322} ≈ 1.00937\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937\n\nThus,\n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.2295\n\nApproximately 2.23.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers without plugging in c. However, since c is a constant, the answer can be expressed as:\n\n( (1.5)^2 ) / (1 + 700/c)^4\n\nBut since c is known, it\'s approximately 2.23. However, given that in many exams, such a small factor might be considered negligible, and the answer taken as 2.25. But given the inclusion of radial velocity, which the problem states the astronomers used, the answer should account for the Doppler effect. Therefore, 2.23.\n\nBut since the options are likely numerical and the difference is small, maybe the problem expects 2.25. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to trick us into forgetting the Doppler shift. However, given the thoroughness of the problem statement mentioning radial velocities, I think we are supposed to consider it. But let\'s check with exact computation:\n\nCompute 1 + v/c = 1 + 700/(3*10^5) = 1 + 7/(3*100) = 1 + 7/300 = 307/300 ≈ 1.023333... Wait, no:\n\nWait, 700 km/s divided by the speed of light in km/s:\n\nc = 300,000 km/s\n\nThus, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3,000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v/c = 1.002333...\n\nRaise to the 4th power:\n\n(1.002333)^4 ≈ e^(4*0.002333) ≈ e^0.009333 ≈ 1.00938\n\nThus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00938 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.\n\nBut since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures (700 km/s), the answer should be to two significant figures. 700 has two sig figs, 1.5 has two, so the answer should be two sig figs. 2.23 is three sig figs. Rounding to two sig figs, it\'s 2.2. But 2.23 is closer to 2.2 than 2.3. However, 2.229 is approximately 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. But wait, 2.229 has three sig figs. The initial data: Star_1\'s radius and mass are 1.5 times (two sig figs), Star_2\'s velocity is 700 km/s (two sig figs). So the answer should be two sig figs. Thus, approximately 2.2.\n\nBut 2.229 rounded to two sig figs is 2.2. However, depending on the problem\'s expectations, maybe 2.25 is considered the right answer if Doppler shift is neglected. But given that the problem mentions radial velocities, which are not negligible in precise calculations, the astronomers would have considered it, leading to 2.2.\n\nBut this is conflicting. Given that in educational settings, sometimes such factors are considered even if small. However, the problem might not expect the small correction. \n\nWait, another thought: If the two stars have the same observed peak wavelength, then if you don\'t account for Doppler shift, you would assume T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25. But if you account for Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different, leading to a different ratio. The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity considering the radial velocities, so they must have gotten 2.23. However, given that the problem states the mass is 1.5 times, but in black body radiation, mass is irrelevant, so it\'s a distractor.\n\nBut since the problem is likely multiple-choice, and 2.25 is a standard answer, but considering the radial velocity, the answer is slightly less. However, without exact options, it\'s hard to tell. But given that the user asks for a boxed answer, and in many cases, such small velocity effects are neglected, but given that the problem specifically mentions radial velocities, I think we are to include it, leading to approximately 2.23. But if precise calculation is needed, 2.25*(1 - 4*(700/c)) = 2.25 - 2.25*4*(700/c). Wait, 4*(700/c) = 4*0.00233 ≈ 0.00933, so 2.25*(1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25*0.99067 ≈ 2.229. So 2.23.\n\nBut since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, and the calculation gives approximately 2.23, but 2.23 is not a standard factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the Doppler shift doesn\'t affect the luminosity ratio. \n\nWait, no. The Doppler shift affects the inferred temperature, which affects the luminosity. So the astronomers would measure the observed flux, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. Wait, no. Luminosity is the total power emitted, independent of distance and Doppler shift. However, when we observe a star moving away, its flux is reduced due to redshift (lower energy photons and time dilation), but luminosity remains the same. But in this problem, the astronomers are calculating the luminosity based on observed quantities, so they have to correct for Doppler shift.\n\nBut this is getting into more detailed astrophysics. The standard formula L = 4πR²σT⁴ is in the rest frame of the star. If the star is moving, relativistic effects come into play, such as Doppler boosting or dimming, but for non-relativistic speeds (700 km/s is non-relativistic), the primary effect is the Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. Therefore, to find the actual temperature of the star, you need to correct the observed wavelength for the Doppler shift, then apply Wien\'s law.\n\nTherefore, if they observe the same peak wavelength, but Star_2 is moving, they would calculate different temperatures for the stars. Therefore, leading to the luminosity ratio being approximately 2.23.\n\nBut since this is a problem designed for an exam, and the difference is small, but the inclusion of radial velocity is meant to test the understanding of Doppler shift affecting temperature, the answer is 2.25 multiplied by (1/(1 + v/c))^4 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 4v/c) ≈ 2.25 - 2.25*4*(700/3e5) ≈ 2.25 - 2.25*0.00933 ≈ 2.25 - 0.021 ≈ 2.229. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23.\n\nHowever, given that the problem might expect an exact answer, and in the absence of specific options, I\'ll go with the more precise calculation: approximately 2.23. But since the user requested the answer in a box, likely as a multiple of 1.5, but it\'s not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5.06, which is (1.5)^3 * (1 + v/c)^4, but that seems unrelated.\n\nWait, no. Let\'s see:\n\nIf we consider the mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3), but the problem says to assume black body radiation. So mass is irrelevant. So the answer is 2.23. But since the problem says "the same factor (1.5 times)" for mass, which is a distractor. So the answer is approximately 2.23. But since in the calculation, we got approximately 2.229, which is 2.23. But maybe the problem expects us to write it as (1.5)^2 * [ (1) / (1 + 700/c)^4 ] and perhaps evaluate it more precisely.\n\nBut given that 700/c is 7/3000, so the term [1 / (1 + 7/3000)^4 ] ≈ 1 - 28/3000 ≈ 1 - 0.00933 ≈ 0.99067. So 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.25}. Wait, but that contradicts the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to ignore the Doppler effect because it\'s a black body question, not a radial velocity question. But the problem explicitly mentions radial velocities, so I think it\'s a part of the calculation.\n\nBut given the time I\'ve spent, and the fact that in many cases such small factors are neglected, but given that the problem mentions radial velocities, which must be considered, I\'ll conclude that the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since 2.23 isn\'t a standard factor, and the problem might have a typo or expect 2.25. But to adhere to the calculation, I should state 2.23. However, since the answer needs to be boxed and likely a fraction, 2.23 is 223/100, but that\'s messy. Alternatively, maybe there\'s an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the temperature ratio again. If T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), then (T1/T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4. But with v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, v/c = 0.002333...\n\nSo (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937, so 1 / 1.00937 ≈ 0.9907. Then, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. Yes, that\'s correct.\n\nBut since 0.9907 is approximately 0.99, then 2.25 * 0.99 ≈ 2.2275, which rounds to 2.23. However, given that the problem gives data to two significant figures (1.5 and 700), the answer should be two sig figs.\n\nBut 1.5 is two sig figs, 700 is one or two? If 700 has two sig figs (assuming trailing zeros are not significant without a decimal), but in "700 km/s", it\'s ambiguous. If it\'s two sig figs, then the answer is 2.2. If 700 is three sig figs, then 2.23. But in most cases, "700" without a decimal is considered one sig fig, but in scientific contexts, sometimes written as 7.0e2 for two sig figs. Given the problem\'s context, it\'s likely two sig figs (700 km/s as two sig figs). Therefore, the answer should be two sig figs: 2.2.\n\nBut my calculation gives 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, 2.229 is 2.23 with three sig figs. If the problem expects two sig figs, then 2.2. If three, then 2.23. Given that 1.5 is two sig figs and 700 is ambiguous, but likely two, the answer is 2.2. But in most educational settings, 700 would be considered two sig figs if it\'s written without a decimal. Therefore, the answer is 2.2. But my calculation is 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, if the problem is from a source that expects three sig figs, then 2.23.\n\nBut since I can\'t be sure, and to match the precision of the given data (1.5 is two sig figs, 700 is two sig figs if the trailing zeros are significant), the answer is 2.2. However, 2.2 is 11/5, but 2.23 is approximate. Alternatively, the problem might accept 2.25 as the answer, assuming temperatures are the same. But given the radial velocity information, I think the intended answer is 2.25, testing the understanding that luminosity depends on radius and temperature, and since temperatures are same (after correcting for Doppler shift), the factor is 2.25.\n\nWait, but if astronomers correct for the Doppler shift, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are same, hence temperatures are same. Therefore, luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the answer is 2.25.\n\nBut this is the key point: when the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. If they corrected for radial velocity, then rest frame peaks are same, T same. If not, different. The problem says they "calculated the radial velocities", which would be used to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame. Hence, after correction, rest frame peaks are same, T same. Hence, L1/L2 = 2.25.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.25. The inclusion of radial velocities is to explain that they could accurately determine the rest frame peak wavelengths, hence temperatures are same. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.25}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.25}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391559, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=10071, prompt_tokens=1755, total_tokens=11826, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law, considering the given data and the radial velocities of the stars.

1. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity \( L \) is given by \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.
2. **Wien's Law**: The peak wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to the temperature \( T \), given by \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \).

**Key Points**:
- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- The observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars.
- Radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.

**Analysis**:
- The same observed peak wavelength implies the same temperature if corrected for Doppler shift. Astronomers would correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame using radial velocities.
- After correcting for Doppler shift, the rest frame peak wavelengths (and thus temperatures) are the same for both stars.

**Calculation**:
- Since the temperatures are the same after correction, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radii.
- The luminosity ratio is \( \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of \(\boxed{2.25}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T2 is higher or lower than T1?

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is a factor greater than 1, so λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Hence, λ_emit2 < λ_obs. Since λ_emit2 is smaller, T2 (from Wien's law) would be higher. Wait, but according to Wien's law, higher temperature corresponds to smaller peak wavelength. So if Star_2's emitted wavelength is smaller, then its temperature is higher. Therefore, T2 > T1.

But the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2. But if Star_2 is hotter, depending on radii, Star_1's luminosity might not be higher. Wait, but we need to reconcile this.

But wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is due to Star_2 moving towards us. If the velocity is positive when moving away, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, then the radial velocity would be negative. But since the problem states radial velocity as 700 km/s for Star_2, perhaps they just gave the speed. But in astronomy, radial velocity is signed. For example, positive is receding, negative is approaching. But since the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively," without specifying direction, perhaps we need to consider that.

Alternatively, the problem may have a typo, but assuming the given velocities are just speeds. However, the actual effect depends on direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the Doppler shift would blueshift its emitted wavelengths, making λ_obs smaller. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its emitted wavelength would be longer than the observed one. So in that case, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 - v2/c). But if v2 is 700 km/s, then (1 - v2/c) is (1 - 700/300,000) ≈ 1 - 0.00233 ≈ 0.9977. So λ_emit2 ≈ λ_obs / 0.9977 ≈ 1.0023 λ_obs. Therefore, λ_emit2 is longer than λ_obs, so T2 would be lower than T1. Because higher wavelength implies lower temperature.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c), which would be shorter than λ_obs, leading to higher temperature. So the direction is critical here.

But the problem does not specify if the velocity is towards or away. However, given that they stated "radial velocities", in astronomical terms, positive values typically indicate recession (moving away), while negative indicate approach. But if they just give 700 km/s, perhaps they mean the speed. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." If 700 km/s is the speed, regardless of direction, but since they found the same observed peak wavelength, which is the same as Star_1's emitted, which is at rest (v=0), then Star_2 must be moving in such a way that its emitted wavelength is Doppler-shifted to match Star_1's.

So, if Star_1's emitted wavelength is λ_emit1 = λ_obs, and Star_2's observed is the same, then:

If Star_2 is moving towards the observer, its emitted wavelength would be longer (since blueshifted to match λ_obs). Alternatively, if moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter (since redshifted to match λ_obs). Wait, no. Let's think:

If Star_2 is moving towards us (blue shift), the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same as Star_1's. Therefore, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its own emitted wavelength must be longer than observed. So that when blueshifted, it becomes the same as Star_1's. Similarly, if Star_2 is moving away, then its emitted wavelength must be shorter than observed (to compensate for redshift).

But since both observed wavelengths are the same, and Star_1 is at rest, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be blueshifted (if moving towards) or redshifted (if moving away) to match Star_1's. So to have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, if Star_2 is moving towards, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v/c). But since Star_1's λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c). Then, using Wien's law, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c)) = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 - v/c) = T1 * (1 - v/c). So T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c). Similarly, if moving away, λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

But in either case, the problem says that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. Let's consider both scenarios.

Case 1: Star_2 is moving towards us (v = -700 km/s, but since speed is 700, direction is negative). Then, T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c) = T1 * (1 + 700/c). (Because if v is negative, then 1 - (-v)/c = 1 + v/c). Wait, maybe my sign convention is mixed.

Wait, let's clarify:

The Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = 1 + v_r / c

Where v_r is the radial velocity. If the source is moving towards the observer, v_r is negative. So:

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r = -700 km/s.

Thus,

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700 / c)

But since λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (because Star_1's v_r = 0), then:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 - 700 / c)

Therefore,

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 - 700 / c)

Using Wien's law, T = b / λ_emit, so:

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 - 700 / c)) = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 - 700 / c) = T1 * (1 - 700 / c)

But 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Therefore, 700 / c ≈ 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.00233. So:

T2 ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.00233) ≈ T1 * 0.9977

Therefore, T2 ≈ 0.9977 T1. So temperature is slightly lower.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, v_r = +700 km/s:

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700 / c)

Thus,

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + 700 / c)

Then,

T2 = (b / λ_emit1) * (1 + 700 / c) = T1 * (1 + 700 / c) ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 ≈ 1.00233 T1. So temperature is slightly higher.

But in either case, the difference (0.23% lower or higher) is minimal. However, the problem states that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor. Considering that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger. So, even if the temperatures are nearly the same, the radius squared term would dominate. But with the possible temperature difference, we need to factor that in.

But if T2 is slightly lower (Star_2 moving towards), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since R1=1.5 R2, and T1 ≈ T2 / 0.9977, so T1 ≈ 1.0023 T2. Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0023)^4 ≈ 1.0093. Then, L1/L2 ≈ (2.25) * 1.0093 ≈ 2.27.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, T2 ≈ 1.0023 T1, so (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1 / 1.0023)^4 ≈ 0.991. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.991 ≈ 2.23.

But the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The answer is likely 2.25, but the problem mentions that they considered radial velocities. So, the Doppler shift affects the temperature calculation. However, the problem states "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers took into account the radial velocities when computing the luminosity. So they would have corrected for the Doppler shift. So, they would have inferred the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their velocities, and then applied the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Therefore, the answer requires using the corrected temperatures.

So, let's do the exact calculation.

First, compute the Doppler factor. Let's assume that Star_2 is moving away (positive velocity). Then:

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

But λ_emit1 = λ_obs (since Star_1's radial velocity is 0). Therefore:

From Wien's law:

T1 = b / λ_emit1

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Thus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Therefore, the temperature ratio T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c

But v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s

So, v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...

Therefore, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333...

Therefore, T2 is slightly higher than T1.

But then, when calculating luminosity:

L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5

T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997668

Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997668)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002332)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002332 + ... ≈ 0.9907 (using binomial approximation for small x: (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x)

But let's compute it more accurately:

ln(0.997668) ≈ -0.002335

Multiply by 4: -0.00934

Exponentiate: e^{-0.00934} ≈ 0.9907

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

Approximately 2.23 times.

But if Star_2 is moving towards us, then T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c), but with v2 = 700 km/s (but velocity is negative). Then:

T2 = T1 * (1 - (-700/c)) = T1 * (1 + 700/c), which is the same as if moving away. Wait, no. Wait, if moving towards, the Doppler formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c)

If v_r is the velocity of the star relative to the observer. If moving towards, v_r is negative. So:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + (-700)/c) = λ_emit * (1 - 700/c)

Therefore, solving for λ_emit:

λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)

Thus, T2 = b / λ_emit = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 - 700/c) = T1 * (1 - 700/c)

Hence, T2 = T1 * (1 - 700/c) ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 0.997667

Therefore, T1/T2 ≈ 1 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00234

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0094

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ (1.5)^2 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271

Therefore, depending on the direction of Star_2's velocity, the factor is approximately 2.23 or 2.27. However, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. In astronomical terms, radial velocities are given with positive meaning recession. Therefore, Star_2 is moving away, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

But the problem asks for the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The answer choices (if any) might be expecting an exact value, but since we have to compute it, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? But the problem explicitly mentions that the radial velocities were considered in the calculation, so we can't ignore it. But 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 700 km/s is 0.233% of the speed of light. So, the effect is small but non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test whether I recognize that the temperatures are the same, thereby leading to a factor of 2.25. But that would be only if the Doppler shift is neglected. However, the problem states that the radial velocities were calculated, and the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. But if we don't account for Doppler shift, then the temperatures would be the same, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. However, if we account for Doppler shift, the temperatures differ slightly, leading to a small correction.

But maybe the problem is designed to ignore the Doppler effect because it's a simple question. Let's check the problem statement again:

"Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

The key is that the astronomers determined the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which are the same. The astronomers would have to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual luminosity. So, they observed the same peak wavelength, but considering their velocities, they would infer different actual temperatures. Therefore, the answer requires considering the Doppler shift.

But the problem's answer is likely expecting the application of both radius and temperature factors. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (standard convention). Then, using the Doppler correction:

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)

Star_1's emitted wavelength is λ_obs, since its velocity is 0.

Using Wien's Law:

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v/c)) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v/c) = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Thus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, the luminosity ratio:

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (R1/R2)² ) * ( T1 / T2 )⁴

Substituting T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c):

L1 / L2 = (1.5²) * (1 / (1 + v/c))⁴

Compute (1 + v/c):

v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...

Thus, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333...

Therefore, (1 / (1.002333))⁴ ≈ (approx) using binomial expansion:

(1 + x)^-4 ≈ 1 - 4x + ... where x = 0.002333

So, ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002333) ≈ 1 - 0.00933 ≈ 0.99067

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229

Approximately 2.23.

But the problem states that Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. How does mass factor in here? The problem says "the mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times)". But in the context of black body radiation, mass doesn't directly affect luminosity. However, in real stars, mass affects luminosity through the mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3 or M^4 for main-sequence stars). But the problem specifies to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Therefore, mass is only relevant if it affects radius or temperature. But in this problem, the radius and temperature are already given (radius explicitly, temperature through the peak wavelength and Doppler shift). Therefore, the mass is extraneous information here. The answer only depends on radius and temperature.

Hence, the factor is approximately 2.23. But given that the problem may expect an exact expression, perhaps we need to compute (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4. But 700/c is small, so maybe the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects and approximate (1 + v/c) as just a factor, but given that even 700 km/s is non-relativistic, it's still a small term. However, since the problem mentions radial velocities, they must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to neglect the Doppler shift, assuming that the observed peak wavelengths correspond to the rest frame. But the problem states that astronomers calculated radial velocities, which would be used to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame. However, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." This could mean that after correcting for Doppler shift, the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, which would mean T1 = T2. However, the wording is ambiguous.

If "appeared brightest" refers to the observed (not rest frame) wavelength, then the Doppler shift must be considered. If it refers to the rest frame, then they have the same temperature. The problem says "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." Spectroscopy typically measures observed wavelengths, but astronomers can correct for Doppler shifts to find the rest frame wavelengths. If they found that the rest frame peak wavelengths are the same, then T1 = T2. If they found the observed peak wavelengths are the same, then they must have different rest frame wavelengths due to Doppler shifts.

The problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which is ambiguous. If "appeared" refers to observed, then different rest frame. If they corrected for velocities, then same rest frame.

But given that the problem later mentions that they calculated radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s, it suggests that the observed wavelengths were blueshifted or redshifted, and they had to calculate the velocities based on shifts. But the problem states that they "managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", which they found to be the same. So if the observed peaks are the same, then their rest frame peaks must differ. But if they corrected for radial velocities to determine the rest frame peaks, then they would be same. The wording is critical.

The key is: when the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", does "appeared" mean as observed or after correcting for Doppler shift? In astronomy, when determining the peak wavelength, they would correct for the Doppler shift to get the rest frame wavelength. Otherwise, the peak would be shifted. So likely, the astronomers measured the observed peak wavelength, then used the radial velocity to calculate the rest frame peak wavelength. If after correction, the rest frame peaks are the same, then temperatures are same. But if not corrected, then different.

But the problem states: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." If they had to correct for radial velocity to determine the rest frame peak wavelengths, then the fact that they are the same implies T1 = T2. But if they didn't correct, then the observed peaks are same, but rest frame differ. But given that radial velocities are given separately, the astronomers would have used those velocities to correct the observed wavelengths to find the rest frame peaks. Therefore, in that case, the rest frame peaks are same, so T1 = T2. Then, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But then why mention the radial velocities? If the rest frame peaks are same, then radial velocities don't affect the temperature calculation. But the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of:"

If the temperatures are same, then answer is 2.25. But radial velocities are mentioned, which might have been used to determine that the rest frame peaks are same. Therefore, the answer is 2.25. However, the inclusion of radial velocities and the fact that they calculated them might imply that the observed peaks are different, but they used radial velocities to find that the rest frame peaks are same. But the problem states that the observed peaks are same. Wait, no:

Wait, the problem says: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Then, using the radial velocities, they would realize that the rest frame peaks are different. For example, if Star_2 is moving away, its rest frame peak is shorter (blueshifted) to appear the same as Star_1's. But wait, no: If Star_2 is moving away, its rest frame peak is λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c), which is shorter than λ_obs. So the rest frame peak of Star_2 is shorter, implying higher temperature. But in that case, the astronomers, knowing the radial velocity, would calculate the rest frame peak and hence the temperature. Therefore, even though the observed peaks are same, the actual rest frame peaks (and hence temperatures) differ.

Therefore, the problem wants us to account for the Doppler shift in temperature calculation. Hence, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.23. But since 700 km/s is a lot, but the factor is close to 2.25. However, given that in many textbook problems, such a small velocity (compared to c) might be neglected, but the inclusion of radial velocity in the problem suggests that we should consider it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the understanding that the same observed peak wavelength implies same temperature, neglecting Doppler shift. But that would be incorrect in reality, but maybe in the problem's context. However, given that radial velocity is provided, it's expected to be used.

But if we proceed with the calculation considering Doppler shift:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4 ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23.

But 2.23 is approximately 2.25, but maybe the problem expects an exact form. Alternatively, if we use v = 700 km/s, then:

(1 + v/c) = 1 + 700/(3*10^5) = 1 + 7/3000 = 3007/3000

Therefore, (1 + v/c) = 3007/3000

Thus, (1 + v/c)^4 = (3007/3000)^4

Therefore, L1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (3007/3000)^4

But this is a precise calculation. Let's compute it:

First, compute (3007/3000)^4:

3007/3000 = 1 + 7/3000 ≈ 1.002333...

Compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233

Multiply by 4: 0.00932

Exponentiate: e^0.00932 ≈ 1.00937

Therefore, (3007/3000)^4 ≈ 1.00937

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.229

So approximately 2.23.

But given that 2.23 is close to 2.25, but the exact value requires precise calculation. However, the problem may expect us to write the answer as ( (1.5)^2 ) / ( (1 + 700/c)^4 ). But since c is 3e5 km/s, 700/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3*100) = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but 700 km/s divided by c in km/s: c ≈ 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3*100) = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but above we had in terms of 700/3e5 = 0.00233 (unitless). Wait, actually, 700 km/s divided by c = 3e5 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.02333. Wait, but in terms of unitless factor, 700 km/s is 0.07% of c. Wait, 0.07% is 0.0007, but 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233, which is 0.233%. That’s correct.

But in any case, the exact answer is (1.5^2)/( (1 + 700/(3*10^5))^4 ). But unless the problem expects an approximate answer, which is roughly 2.25 * (1 - 4*(700/(3*10^5))) ≈ 2.25*(1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25*0.99067 ≈ 2.23.

But given that the options might not have decimals, but given the problem's phrasing, it's likely that the answer is 2.25, and the radial velocity is a distractor, or the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect. But why would they mention radial velocities then?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that both stars are in binary system, and the radial velocities are due to orbital motion, but in terms of black body radiation, the luminosity depends on the actual temperature, which would be determined after correcting for Doppler shift. Therefore, the correct calculation would lead to approximately 2.23.

However, in most textbooks, such problems assume that the observed peak wavelength is the same in the rest frame, i.e., they neglect Doppler shift unless specified. But here, the problem specifically mentions radial velocities, so it's testing the understanding that the actual temperatures differ when considering Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since the options are likely rounded, and 2.23 is closest to 2.25, but another thought: maybe the problem expects to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula, but at 700 km/s, relativistic effects are negligible. The relativistic Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but for v << c, it approximates to 1 + v/c. Therefore, the non-relativistic calculation suffices.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Since the peak wavelengths observed are the same and radial velocities are given, but if you do not account for Doppler shift, you would calculate the same temperature, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25. However, if you account for Doppler shift, the temperatures are different, leading to a slightly different factor. But since the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, considering the radial velocities, the answer should be the corrected one, approximately 2.23. But given that 2.23 is not a clean number, perhaps the problem expects the non-Doppler shift answer, 2.25. This is a dilemma.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem statement:

"Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

Emphasis on "they computed", referring to the astronomers who had considered the radial velocities. Therefore, the astronomers would have corrected for the Doppler shift in their calculation. Therefore, the answer must be approximately 2.23. But since precise calculation is needed, perhaps we need to compute it more accurately.

Compute (1 + v/c):

v = 700 km/s = 0.7 * 10^6 m/s

c = 3 * 10^8 m/s

v/c = 0.7 / 300 ≈ 0.002333333...

Thus,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333...

(1 + v/c)^4:

First, compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.0023305

Multiply by 4: 0.009322

Exponentiate: e^{0.009322} ≈ 1.00937

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937

Thus,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.2295

Approximately 2.23.

But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers without plugging in c. However, since c is a constant, the answer can be expressed as:

( (1.5)^2 ) / (1 + 700/c)^4

But since c is known, it's approximately 2.23. However, given that in many exams, such a small factor might be considered negligible, and the answer taken as 2.25. But given the inclusion of radial velocity, which the problem states the astronomers used, the answer should account for the Doppler effect. Therefore, 2.23.

But since the options are likely numerical and the difference is small, maybe the problem expects 2.25. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to trick us into forgetting the Doppler shift. However, given the thoroughness of the problem statement mentioning radial velocities, I think we are supposed to consider it. But let's check with exact computation:

Compute 1 + v/c = 1 + 700/(3*10^5) = 1 + 7/(3*100) = 1 + 7/300 = 307/300 ≈ 1.023333... Wait, no:

Wait, 700 km/s divided by the speed of light in km/s:

c = 300,000 km/s

Thus, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3,000 ≈ 0.002333...

Therefore, 1 + v/c = 1.002333...

Raise to the 4th power:

(1.002333)^4 ≈ e^(4*0.002333) ≈ e^0.009333 ≈ 1.00938

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00938 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

But since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures (700 km/s), the answer should be to two significant figures. 700 has two sig figs, 1.5 has two, so the answer should be two sig figs. 2.23 is three sig figs. Rounding to two sig figs, it's 2.2. But 2.23 is closer to 2.2 than 2.3. However, 2.229 is approximately 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. But wait, 2.229 has three sig figs. The initial data: Star_1's radius and mass are 1.5 times (two sig figs), Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s (two sig figs). So the answer should be two sig figs. Thus, approximately 2.2.

But 2.229 rounded to two sig figs is 2.2. However, depending on the problem's expectations, maybe 2.25 is considered the right answer if Doppler shift is neglected. But given that the problem mentions radial velocities, which are not negligible in precise calculations, the astronomers would have considered it, leading to 2.2.

But this is conflicting. Given that in educational settings, sometimes such factors are considered even if small. However, the problem might not expect the small correction. 

Wait, another thought: If the two stars have the same observed peak wavelength, then if you don't account for Doppler shift, you would assume T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25. But if you account for Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different, leading to a different ratio. The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity considering the radial velocities, so they must have gotten 2.23. However, given that the problem states the mass is 1.5 times, but in black body radiation, mass is irrelevant, so it's a distractor.

But since the problem is likely multiple-choice, and 2.25 is a standard answer, but considering the radial velocity, the answer is slightly less. However, without exact options, it's hard to tell. But given that the user asks for a boxed answer, and in many cases, such small velocity effects are neglected, but given that the problem specifically mentions radial velocities, I think we are to include it, leading to approximately 2.23. But if precise calculation is needed, 2.25*(1 - 4*(700/c)) = 2.25 - 2.25*4*(700/c). Wait, 4*(700/c) = 4*0.00233 ≈ 0.00933, so 2.25*(1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25*0.99067 ≈ 2.229. So 2.23.

But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, and the calculation gives approximately 2.23, but 2.23 is not a standard factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity ratio. 

Wait, no. The Doppler shift affects the inferred temperature, which affects the luminosity. So the astronomers would measure the observed flux, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. Wait, no. Luminosity is the total power emitted, independent of distance and Doppler shift. However, when we observe a star moving away, its flux is reduced due to redshift (lower energy photons and time dilation), but luminosity remains the same. But in this problem, the astronomers are calculating the luminosity based on observed quantities, so they have to correct for Doppler shift.

But this is getting into more detailed astrophysics. The standard formula L = 4πR²σT⁴ is in the rest frame of the star. If the star is moving, relativistic effects come into play, such as Doppler boosting or dimming, but for non-relativistic speeds (700 km/s is non-relativistic), the primary effect is the Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. Therefore, to find the actual temperature of the star, you need to correct the observed wavelength for the Doppler shift, then apply Wien's law.

Therefore, if they observe the same peak wavelength, but Star_2 is moving, they would calculate different temperatures for the stars. Therefore, leading to the luminosity ratio being approximately 2.23.

But since this is a problem designed for an exam, and the difference is small, but the inclusion of radial velocity is meant to test the understanding of Doppler shift affecting temperature, the answer is 2.25 multiplied by (1/(1 + v/c))^4 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 4v/c) ≈ 2.25 - 2.25*4*(700/3e5) ≈ 2.25 - 2.25*0.00933 ≈ 2.25 - 0.021 ≈ 2.229. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23.

However, given that the problem might expect an exact answer, and in the absence of specific options, I'll go with the more precise calculation: approximately 2.23. But since the user requested the answer in a box, likely as a multiple of 1.5, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5.06, which is (1.5)^3 * (1 + v/c)^4, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, no. Let's see:

If we consider the mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3), but the problem says to assume black body radiation. So mass is irrelevant. So the answer is 2.23. But since the problem says "the same factor (1.5 times)" for mass, which is a distractor. So the answer is approximately 2.23. But since in the calculation, we got approximately 2.229, which is 2.23. But maybe the problem expects us to write it as (1.5)^2 * [ (1) / (1 + 700/c)^4 ] and perhaps evaluate it more precisely.

But given that 700/c is 7/3000, so the term [1 / (1 + 7/3000)^4 ] ≈ 1 - 28/3000 ≈ 1 - 0.00933 ≈ 0.99067. So 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.25}. Wait, but that contradicts the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to ignore the Doppler effect because it's a black body question, not a radial velocity question. But the problem explicitly mentions radial velocities, so I think it's a part of the calculation.

But given the time I've spent, and the fact that in many cases such small factors are neglected, but given that the problem mentions radial velocities, which must be considered, I'll conclude that the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since 2.23 isn't a standard factor, and the problem might have a typo or expect 2.25. But to adhere to the calculation, I should state 2.23. However, since the answer needs to be boxed and likely a fraction, 2.23 is 223/100, but that's messy. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my calculation.

Wait, let me check the temperature ratio again. If T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), then (T1/T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4. But with v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, v/c = 0.002333...

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937, so 1 / 1.00937 ≈ 0.9907. Then, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. Yes, that's correct.

But since 0.9907 is approximately 0.99, then 2.25 * 0.99 ≈ 2.2275, which rounds to 2.23. However, given that the problem gives data to two significant figures (1.5 and 700), the answer should be two sig figs.

But 1.5 is two sig figs, 700 is one or two? If 700 has two sig figs (assuming trailing zeros are not significant without a decimal), but in "700 km/s", it's ambiguous. If it's two sig figs, then the answer is 2.2. If 700 is three sig figs, then 2.23. But in most cases, "700" without a decimal is considered one sig fig, but in scientific contexts, sometimes written as 7.0e2 for two sig figs. Given the problem's context, it's likely two sig figs (700 km/s as two sig figs). Therefore, the answer should be two sig figs: 2.2.

But my calculation gives 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, 2.229 is 2.23 with three sig figs. If the problem expects two sig figs, then 2.2. If three, then 2.23. Given that 1.5 is two sig figs and 700 is ambiguous, but likely two, the answer is 2.2. But in most educational settings, 700 would be considered two sig figs if it's written without a decimal. Therefore, the answer is 2.2. But my calculation is 2.229, which is 2.2 when rounded to two sig figs. However, if the problem is from a source that expects three sig figs, then 2.23.

But since I can't be sure, and to match the precision of the given data (1.5 is two sig figs, 700 is two sig figs if the trailing zeros are significant), the answer is 2.2. However, 2.2 is 11/5, but 2.23 is approximate. Alternatively, the problem might accept 2.25 as the answer, assuming temperatures are the same. But given the radial velocity information, I think the intended answer is 2.25, testing the understanding that luminosity depends on radius and temperature, and since temperatures are same (after correcting for Doppler shift), the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but if astronomers correct for the Doppler shift, then the rest frame peak wavelengths are same, hence temperatures are same. Therefore, luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the answer is 2.25.

But this is the key point: when the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. If they corrected for radial velocity, then rest frame peaks are same, T same. If not, different. The problem says they "calculated the radial velocities", which would be used to correct the observed wavelengths to rest frame. Hence, after correction, rest frame peaks are same, T same. Hence, L1/L2 = 2.25.

Therefore, the answer is 2.25. The inclusion of radial velocities is to explain that they could accurately determine the rest frame peak wavelengths, hence temperatures are same. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.25}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.25}
