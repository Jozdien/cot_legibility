# Original Question

Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?

Given that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we use the Boltzmann equation to relate the population of energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the number densities of atoms in the higher and lower energy states, \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are their statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

Given that the ratio of excited states in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_1 = 2 \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_2
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars and canceling out the statistical weights (assuming they are the same for both stars), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) \right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln 2
\]

Rearranging terms, we find:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}
\]

Thus, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two stars where the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, LTE means that the excitation of atoms is governed by thermal processes, so the Boltzmann equation should apply here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

where n2 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in the higher and lower energy states, g2 and g1 are their statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, it says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, so the ratio of excited states in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2:1. But I need to be careful about which energy levels we're talking about. The problem mentions "a specific energy level," so maybe they are comparing the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one in each star. But since both stars are being compared, maybe the ratio of populations (n_i/n_j) in star_1 is twice that in star_2?

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, if we consider the population in a particular excited state (let's say level 2) relative to the ground state (level 1), then for star_1, n2/n1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2. Is that the correct interpretation?

Assuming that the statistical weights (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, since they are the same element (iron) and same energy levels. Then, the ratio of the populations would depend on the temperature.

So, for star_1: (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

For star_2: (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Given that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2

Therefore:

(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

We can cancel out (g2/g1) from both sides:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)

Let me rearrange terms:

-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/k [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Then, solving for 1/T1 - 1/T2:

1/T1 - 1/T2 = - (k/ΔE) * ln(2)

But the question asks for the correct equation for the effective temperatures. The answer options aren't given, but we need to express the relationship between T1 and T2. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express T1 in terms of T2 or vice versa. Let's try to solve for T1.

Starting from:

ΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Then,

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE

But this might be one way. Alternatively, if we want to relate T1 and T2 more directly, perhaps we can write:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)):

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2)) = 2

Which simplifies to:

exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln 2

Which is the same as before. So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Therefore,

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE

Alternatively, rearranged:

1/T1 + (k ln 2)/ΔE = 1/T2

So,

T2 = 1 / [1/T1 + (k ln 2)/ΔE ]

But this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can write the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

Let me think again. The ratio of the populations is 2. So:

(n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = 2

Which, using Boltzmann:

[exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = 2

Because the (g2/g1) cancels out. Therefore:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which again gives:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Therefore, the equation relating T1 and T2 is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

So if we rearrange this,

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE

Or,

1/T1 + (k ln 2)/ΔE = 1/T2

Therefore, T2 is equal to 1 divided by [1/T1 + (k ln 2)/ΔE]

But the question is asking which equation is correct. Since the answer options are not provided, but the user expects me to provide the correct equation. Wait, but the original problem says "which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?" but the options are not here. Wait, maybe the user forgot to include the options? Wait, looking back:

"Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."

Wait, the user hasn't provided the options. Hmm. But maybe they expect me to derive the equation and present it boxed. But the problem is from some source where options were probably given, but here they are missing. However, given that, perhaps the correct equation is T1 = T2 / (1 - (k ΔE ln 2)) or something else. Wait, but given the derivation above, the relation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE. Let me compute (k ln 2)/ΔE.

Given ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K.

So k = 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Therefore, (k ln 2)/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K * ln 2) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln 2 / K^{-1}

So, the units are 1/K, which matches the left-hand side 1/T2 - 1/T1 (which is 1/K).

Therefore, (k ln 2)/ΔE = ln 2 / (ΔE /k )

But since ΔE/k has units of temperature (because ΔE is energy, k is J/K, so ΔE/k is K). Wait, ΔE/k would be a temperature. Let me check:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1 K. So ΔE/k = 1 K.

Therefore, (k ln 2)/ΔE = (k / ΔE) * ln 2 = (1 / 1 K) * ln 2 ≈ 0.693 / K

Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 / K

But since ΔE/k is 1 K, then (k ln 2)/ΔE = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) ) = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K

Therefore, the equation is:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / (ΔE/k )

But ΔE/k is 1 K, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K

But this seems specific. However, since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = 1 K, so the equation simplifies to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K

But in terms of variables, without plugging in numbers, the general equation is:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

So the correct equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

But perhaps the answer is presented as T1 = T2 / (1 + (k ln 2 T2)/ΔE ) or something else. But since the problem asks for the equation relating T1 and T2, the direct relation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE. So if we were to write this, maybe the answer is 1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE, which can be written as T1 = [1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE]^{-1}

But without specific options, it's hard to know. However, since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * 1 K, so ΔE/k = 1 K. Therefore, substituting back:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 K^{-1}

Therefore, multiplying both sides by T1*T2:

T1 - T2 = ln 2 * T1*T2 / K

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, if ΔE = k*T, then T = ΔE/k = 1 K, but that might not be directly relevant here.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is ΔE/(k*T). If ΔE = k*T, then the exponent is 1, so exp(-1) ≈ 0.3679. But in this problem, ΔE is equal to k*1 K, so ΔE/k = 1 K. So if a star has temperature T, then the exponent is (ΔE)/(k*T) = (k*1 K)/(k*T) ) = 1 K / T. So 1/T (in units of 1/K) multiplied by 1 K gives a dimensionless exponent.

But perhaps this is a red herring.

Given that, the key equation we derived is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k = 1.38e-23 J/K, then (k ln 2)/ΔE = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) ) = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K

Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 / K

But this is a numerical value. However, since the problem states to provide the equation in terms of T1 and T2, not numerically, the answer should keep the symbols.

Therefore, the correct equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Hence, if I were to box this equation, it would be:

\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}

But let me verify once more.

Given that star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2. So the ratio of their excited states is 2:1. Using the Boltzmann factor, which is exponential in 1/T. So the equation involves the difference in the inverse temperatures. Yes, the derivation seems correct. So the answer should be the equation expressing 1/T2 - 1/T1 equals (k ln 2)/ΔE.

**Final Answer**
The correct equation is \boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}.

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two stars where the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, LTE means that the excitation of atoms is governed by thermal processes, so the Boltzmann equation should apply here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Assuming that the statistical weights (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, since they are the same element (iron) and same energy levels. Then, the ratio of the populations would depend on the temperature.

For star_2: (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Given that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2

Therefore:

(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

We can cancel out (g2/g1) from both sides:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Alright, let's examine this. The problem involves two stars where iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between these levels is 1.38 x 10^-23 J. We need to determine the equation relating their effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Under LTE, atomic excitation is determined by thermal processes, making the Boltzmann equation applicable. This equation connects energy level populations to temperature:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Here, n2 and n1 represent the number densities of atoms in higher and lower energy states, g2 and g1 are their statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

The problem indicates that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. This suggests that the ratio of excited states between star_1 and star_2 is 2:1. I need to be precise about which energy levels we're discussing. The problem mentions "a specific energy level," so perhaps we're comparing the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one in each star. Alternatively, since both stars are being compared, maybe the ratio of populations (n_i/n_j) in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

The problem statement says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." This likely means that for a particular excited state (level 2) relative to the ground state (level 1), star_1 has (n2/n1) = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2.

Since we're dealing with the same element (iron) and identical energy levels in both stars, the statistical weights (g2/g1) should be equal. Therefore, the population ratios would depend on temperature.

For star_1: (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Given that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2, we have:

(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out:

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's examine the situation. We have a problem concerning two stars where the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited at a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is provided as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Our task is to find the accurate equation relating the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Now, LTE implies that the excitation of atoms is controlled by thermal processes, thereby making the Boltzmann equation relevant. This equation connects the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Here, n2 and n1 denote the number densities of atoms in the higher and lower energy states respectively, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T represents the temperature.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, meaning the ratio of excited states in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. Considering the mention of "a specific energy level," it seems we are comparing the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one in each star. Since we're comparing both stars, perhaps the ratio of populations (n_i/n_j) in star_1 is twice what it is in star_2.

So, if iron atoms at a specific excited state (level 2) are compared to the ground state (level 1), for star_1, n2/n1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2. Does that align with the problem's description?

Assuming that both stars have the same statistical weights (g2/g1) because they involve the same element (iron) and energy levels, the population ratio would then be temperature-dependent.

Thus, for star_1: (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

And for star_2: (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Knowing that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2 gives us:

(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Canceling out (g2/g1) on both sides gives:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Wait, 1.38 x 10^-23 J is actually equal to k*T at around T ≈ 1 K, since k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So, k*T at T=1 K is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k*T, so if ΔE = k*T, then T = ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. But here, the energy difference is given as exactly k*T at T=1 K? Because k is 1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38 x 10^-23 J, then ΔE/k ≈ 1 K.\n\nBut in the problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J, so ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore, the term (ΔE/k) is approximately 1 K. Therefore, in the equation:\n\n(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/(ΔE/k) ≈ ln(2)/1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut I don\'t know if that approximation is necessary here.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that ΔE/k is equal to a certain temperature, so that when you plug in numbers, you can get a relation between T1 and T2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the ratio of the populations as:\n\n(n1/n2) = 2, but wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So if the population in the excited state relative to the lower state in star_1 is twice that in star_2, then:\n\n(n2/n1)_star1 = 2*(n2/n1)_star2\n\nBut according to Boltzmann:\n\n(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT))\n\nAssuming g2/g1 is the same for both stars (same element, same transition), then:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))\n\nSo:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) = 2\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\nΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln 2\n\nFactor out ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2\n\nTherefore:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln 2) k / ΔE\n\nBut given that ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J, and k is also approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K, so ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln 2 / 1 K\n\nBut ln 2 ≈ 0.693, so:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut this seems like a very large value unless the temperatures are very low. But stellar photospheres are much hotter than 1 K. For example, the Sun\'s photosphere is around 5800 K. If T1 and T2 are on the order of thousands of K, then 1/T is on the order of 0.001 K^-1, so 0.693 K^-1 would be way too large, which suggests that perhaps the approximation ΔE/k ≈ 1 K is not valid here. Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k is exactly 1 K. So:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K\n\nWhich is:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut if T1 and T2 are, say, 5000 K, then 1/T is 0.0002 K^-1, so the difference 0.693 K^-1 is way larger. That can\'t be. So this suggests that either the temperatures are around 1 K, which is impossible for stars, or there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the algebra. Let\'s check again.\n\nWe have:\n\nΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J\n\nk = 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K\n\nTherefore, ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K. So that\'s correct.\n\nSo 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nTherefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut this would require that 1/T2 - 1/T1 is a positive number, so 1/T2 > 1/T1, which implies that T1 > T2.\n\nBut if T1 is greater than T2, then star_1 is hotter, which makes sense because it has more excitation. But how does this equation look?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to relate T1 and T2 through the equation T1 = T2 / ln(2), but that seems not directly.\n\nWait, let\'s consider if we can write:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nΔE/(k T1) = ΔE/(k T2) - ln 2\n\nMultiply both sides by k/ΔE:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nBut since ΔE = k * 1 K, then (k ln 2)/ΔE = ln 2 / 1 K\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln 2 / 1 K\n\nBut again, unless T1 and T2 are around 1 K, which they are not, this seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that if ΔE/k = 1 K, then the equation simplifies. Let\'s write:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut this would mean that 1/T2 = 1/T1 + 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut since T1 and T2 are much larger than 1 K, 1/T1 and 1/T2 are very small, so adding 0.693 K^-1 would make 1/T2 way larger, which would mean T2 is way smaller. But stars have temperatures of thousands of K, so 1/T is about 1e-3 or 1e-4 K^-1. Adding 0.693 K^-1 would make 1/T2 ≈ 0.693 K^-1, so T2 ≈ 1.44 K, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the energy difference is not 1.38e-23 J, or there is a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe the energy difference is actually given as 1.38 x 10^-19 J? Because then ΔE/k would be about 1e4 K, which is more reasonable for stellar temperatures. But the problem states 1.38 x 10^-23 J. That seems too small. Maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is conceptual, and the answer is that T1 is lower than T2? But if star_1 has more excitation, then it should be hotter. Wait, in the Boltzmann factor, higher temperature leads to higher population in the excited state. So if star_1 has more excitation (twice as much), then T1 should be higher than T2. So the equation must reflect that T1 > T2.\n\nBut according to the equation we derived:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln 2 * k)/ΔE\n\nGiven that ΔE/k = 1 K, so (ln 2 * k)/ΔE = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nSo:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut if T2 is, say, 5000 K, then 1/T2 = 0.0002 K^-1, so 1/T1 = 0.0002 - 0.693 ≈ -0.6928 K^-1, which would give a negative temperature, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that our approach is wrong or the problem has unrealistic numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference is not 1.38e-23 J but something else. Wait, but the problem states it\'s approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Let me check the value of k: Boltzmann constant is 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE is exactly equal to k * 1 K. Therefore, the energy difference corresponds to k*T for T=1 K. But stars have much higher temperatures, so this energy difference is way too small. Typically, atomic energy level differences are on the order of electron volts. 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.38e-23 J is about 0.000086 eV, which is a very small energy difference, corresponding to transitions in the microwave or infrared range, maybe rotational transitions. But for stellar photospheres, which have temperatures of thousands of K, the relevant transitions are in the visible range, which are a few eV. So this energy difference seems too small. Maybe it\'s a typo and should be 1.38e-18 J or something. But assuming the problem is as stated, perhaps it\'s a hypothetical scenario.\n\nBut given that, maybe the correct relation is T1 = T2 / ln(2), but let\'s check.\n\nWait, let\'s suppose that T1 and T2 are such that ΔE/(k T) is small. If the thermal energy k*T is much larger than ΔE, then the exponential terms can be approximated. But in our case, ΔE = k*1 K, so if T is 5000 K, then ΔE/(k T) = 1/5000, which is small. So maybe we can use the approximation exp(-x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.\n\nBut let\'s see:\n\nStarting from:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))\n\nIf ΔE/(k T) is small, then exp(-ΔE/(k T)) ≈ 1 - ΔE/(k T)\n\nSo:\n\n1 - ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 2 [1 - ΔE/(k T2) ]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n1 - ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 2 - 2 ΔE/(k T2)\n\nRearranging:\n\n-ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 1 - 2 ΔE/(k T2)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nΔE/(k T1) ≈ -1 + 2 ΔE/(k T2)\n\nBut this leads to:\n\nΔE/(k T1) + 1 ≈ 2 ΔE/(k T2)\n\nBut since ΔE/(k T) is very small (since T is large), the left-hand side is approximately 1, so 1 ≈ 2 ΔE/(k T2)\n\nBut ΔE/k is 1 K, so 1 ≈ 2*(1 K)/T2 => T2 ≈ 2 K\n\nBut again, this is unrealistic for stars. Therefore, perhaps the assumption that ΔE/(k T) is small is invalid here, but given that ΔE/k =1 K and T is thousands of K, ΔE/(k T) is 1/5000, which is indeed small. But even then, the result is nonsensical, implying T2 is about 2 K. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or my approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem isn\'t assuming a two-level system. Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). But if the lower level is the ground state and the upper level is an excited state, then n2 is the population of the excited state. If star_1 has twice the excitation, meaning n2 is twice as much as in star_2. But if the lower level is not the ground state, but another excited state, but the problem says "a specific energy level," so maybe they are considering the ratio of populations in two specific levels, say level m and level n, and in star_1, the ratio is twice that in star_2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of iron atoms in a particular excited state relative to the total, but LTE assumes that the population follows the Boltzmann distribution, so the ratio of populations in two levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one, and in star_1, this ratio is twice that in star_2. So then:\n\nFor star_1: n_upper / n_lower = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_star2\n\nWhich leads to the same equation as before.\n\nBut given the energy difference ΔE = k*1 K, which is very small, the exponent ΔE/(kT) would be 1/T. For a star at 5000 K, this is 0.0002, so the exponent is -0.0002, so exp(-0.0002) ≈ 0.9998. Therefore, the ratio n_upper/n_lower ≈ g2/g1 * 0.9998. If g2/g1 is 1, then the ratio is almost 1. So to have star_1\'s ratio be twice that of star_2\'s, when the ratios are both close to 1, would require that star_1 has a ratio of, say, 1.9996 and star_2 has 0.9998, but that would mean the ratio is approximately 2, but in reality, the difference is tiny. However, given that the energy difference is so small, the excitation is almost equal, and a factor of 2 difference would require a significant temperature difference. But with the given numbers, this seems impossible because of the small ΔE.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and ΔE is meant to be 1.38e-18 J, which would make ΔE/k ≈ 1e5 K, which is more reasonable for stellar temperatures. Then, the equation would involve temperatures around 1e4 K, making the term ΔE/(kT) on the order of 0.1 to 10, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to use the Boltzmann equation without considering the approximation, leading to an exponential relation between the temperatures. Let\'s go back to the key equation:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))\n\nLet\'s take the ratio:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nexp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = 2\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\nΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2\n\nTherefore:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nGiven that ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J and k = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K, this simplifies to:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K\n\nSo:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^{-1}\n\nThis is the equation relating T1 and T2. Therefore, the correct equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 * k / ΔE, which, given the values, simplifies to 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^{-1}\n\nBut since the problem asks for the equation, not the numerical value, the general form is:\n\n(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * k / ΔE\n\nTherefore, the answer should be an equation that states this relationship. If the options were given, it would likely be one of the forms we derived. Since the user hasn\'t provided options, but asks to write the correct equation, we can present it as:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nOr equivalently,\n\nT1 = [1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE]^{-1}\n\nBut the more standard form would be the first one. However, given that the problem mentions "effective temperatures," which are related to the blackbody radiation, but since the question is about excitation temperatures in LTE, the relation derived via the Boltzmann equation is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is:\n\n1/T₁ - 1/T₂ = - (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nBut wait, in our derivation, we had 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE, which can be written as:\n\n1/T₁ = 1/T₂ - (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nBut depending on how the answer is presented, it might be written as:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T₁)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T₂))\n\nBut that\'s another way of writing the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying both sides by T1*T2:\n\nT1 - T2 = (k ln 2 / ΔE) T1 T2\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nGiven the problem statement, the most direct equation derived is:\n\n1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = (ln 2) k / ΔE\n\nSo this is the correct relation between T₁ and T₂. Therefore, the answer should be this equation. Since the user hasn\'t provided options, but the problem is from a multiple-choice context, perhaps the answer is expressed as:\n\nT₁ = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\ln 2} / (1 + \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T₂ \\ln 2})\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. Alternatively, if we consider that when you invert the equation:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T1)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))\n\nThen:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)) = 1/2\n\nTake natural log:\n\nΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) = -ln 2\n\nWhich gives:\n\n1/T1 - 1/T2 = - (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nOr:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nTherefore, the equation is 1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = (k ln 2)/ΔE\n\nGiven that the problem states the energy difference ΔE is 1.38 x 10^-23 J, which is equal to k * 1 K, this simplifies to:\n\n1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K⁻¹\n\nBut since the problem likely expects an equation in terms of the symbols T₁, T₂, ΔE, k, and not numerical values, the answer is:\n\n\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{k \\ln 2}{\\Delta E}\n\nSo boxed:\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{k \\ln 2}{\\Delta E}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390305, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5624, prompt_tokens=733, total_tokens=6357, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars, given that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Using the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels:
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]
where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the excited and lower energy levels, \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are their statistical weights, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Given that star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2, we equate the ratios:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]
Taking the natural logarithm and simplifying:
\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln 2 - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]
Rearranging terms:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln 2
\]
Solving for the temperature difference:
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}
\]

### Final Answer
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

allogarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)

Let's rearrange terms:

-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/k [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/k [ ( -T2 + T1 ) / (T1*T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me check that algebra again. Let's see:

Starting from:

-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

(ΔE/k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Which is:

(ΔE/k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * k / ΔE

Then, rearranged:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln(2) * k / ΔE

But maybe it's more useful to write the ratio of temperatures. Let's see. Let me denote T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let's write the original equation after taking the logarithm:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)):

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2)) = 2

Take natural log:

[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ] = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln(2) * k)/ΔE

So:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln(2) * k)/ΔE

Alternatively, solving for T1 in terms of T2:

Let me invert the equation:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln(2) k)/ΔE

So,

T1 = [ 1/T2 - (ln(2) k)/ΔE ]^(-1)

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, if we can assume that T1 and T2 are not too different, maybe approximate? But the question is about which equation is correct, not necessarily solving for T1 in terms of T2. The answer choices are likely equations involving T1 and T2. Since the problem didn't give options, but the user just said "which of these equations... is correct?" Maybe the assistant is supposed to provide the correct relation?

Wait, actually, the original problem statement says: "which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?" But since the user hasn't provided the options, maybe in the original context there were options, but here it's omitted. Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote: "Two stars are being studied... which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?" But the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, maybe in the initial problem setup, the user is referring to a specific set of equations, but here they are omitted. Hmm, maybe this is a translation error or omission.

Wait, the user's question is presented as a problem statement, perhaps from an exam or a textbook, but the options are missing. However, the user is asking for the correct equation. Since the original problem mentions "these equations," but they are not here, maybe the assistant is supposed to derive the correct equation.

Given that, perhaps the correct equation is T1 = T2 / ln(2), but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe T1 = ΔE/(k ln(2)) * something. Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio between the temperatures can be expressed as:

From the equation we had:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) k)/ΔE

But solving for T1 in terms of T2 would require knowing the value of ΔE, k, etc. But since the problem states that the energy difference is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, 1.38 x 10^-23 J is actually equal to k*T at around T ≈ 1 K, since k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So, k*T at T=1 K is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k*T, so if ΔE = k*T, then T = ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. But here, the energy difference is given as exactly k*T at T=1 K? Because k is 1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38 x 10^-23 J, then ΔE/k ≈ 1 K.

But in the problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J, so ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore, the term (ΔE/k) is approximately 1 K. Therefore, in the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)/(ΔE/k) ≈ ln(2)/1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But I don't know if that approximation is necessary here.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that ΔE/k is equal to a certain temperature, so that when you plug in numbers, you can get a relation between T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the ratio of the populations as:

(n1/n2) = 2, but wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So if the population in the excited state relative to the lower state in star_1 is twice that in star_2, then:

(n2/n1)_star1 = 2*(n2/n1)_star2

But according to Boltzmann:

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT))

Assuming g2/g1 is the same for both stars (same element, same transition), then:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) = 2

Take natural logarithm:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln 2

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2

Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln 2) k / ΔE

But given that ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J, and k is also approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K, so ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln 2 / 1 K

But ln 2 ≈ 0.693, so:

1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But this seems like a very large value unless the temperatures are very low. But stellar photospheres are much hotter than 1 K. For example, the Sun's photosphere is around 5800 K. If T1 and T2 are on the order of thousands of K, then 1/T is on the order of 0.001 K^-1, so 0.693 K^-1 would be way too large, which suggests that perhaps the approximation ΔE/k ≈ 1 K is not valid here. Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k is exactly 1 K. So:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K

Which is:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1

But if T1 and T2 are, say, 5000 K, then 1/T is 0.0002 K^-1, so the difference 0.693 K^-1 is way larger. That can't be. So this suggests that either the temperatures are around 1 K, which is impossible for stars, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the algebra. Let's check again.

We have:

ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J

k = 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K

Therefore, ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K. So that's correct.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But this would require that 1/T2 - 1/T1 is a positive number, so 1/T2 > 1/T1, which implies that T1 > T2.

But if T1 is greater than T2, then star_1 is hotter, which makes sense because it has more excitation. But how does this equation look?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to relate T1 and T2 through the equation T1 = T2 / ln(2), but that seems not directly.

Wait, let's consider if we can write:

From the equation:

ΔE/(k T1) = ΔE/(k T2) - ln 2

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE

But since ΔE = k * 1 K, then (k ln 2)/ΔE = ln 2 / 1 K

Therefore,

1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln 2 / 1 K

But again, unless T1 and T2 are around 1 K, which they are not, this seems problematic.

Wait, maybe the key is that if ΔE/k = 1 K, then the equation simplifies. Let's write:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / (ΔE/k) = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But this would mean that 1/T2 = 1/T1 + 0.693 K^-1

But since T1 and T2 are much larger than 1 K, 1/T1 and 1/T2 are very small, so adding 0.693 K^-1 would make 1/T2 way larger, which would mean T2 is way smaller. But stars have temperatures of thousands of K, so 1/T is about 1e-3 or 1e-4 K^-1. Adding 0.693 K^-1 would make 1/T2 ≈ 0.693 K^-1, so T2 ≈ 1.44 K, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the energy difference is not 1.38e-23 J, or there is a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe the energy difference is actually given as 1.38 x 10^-19 J? Because then ΔE/k would be about 1e4 K, which is more reasonable for stellar temperatures. But the problem states 1.38 x 10^-23 J. That seems too small. Maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is conceptual, and the answer is that T1 is lower than T2? But if star_1 has more excitation, then it should be hotter. Wait, in the Boltzmann factor, higher temperature leads to higher population in the excited state. So if star_1 has more excitation (twice as much), then T1 should be higher than T2. So the equation must reflect that T1 > T2.

But according to the equation we derived:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln 2 * k)/ΔE

Given that ΔE/k = 1 K, so (ln 2 * k)/ΔE = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

So:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 K^-1

But if T2 is, say, 5000 K, then 1/T2 = 0.0002 K^-1, so 1/T1 = 0.0002 - 0.693 ≈ -0.6928 K^-1, which would give a negative temperature, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that our approach is wrong or the problem has unrealistic numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is not 1.38e-23 J but something else. Wait, but the problem states it's approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Let me check the value of k: Boltzmann constant is 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE is exactly equal to k * 1 K. Therefore, the energy difference corresponds to k*T for T=1 K. But stars have much higher temperatures, so this energy difference is way too small. Typically, atomic energy level differences are on the order of electron volts. 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.38e-23 J is about 0.000086 eV, which is a very small energy difference, corresponding to transitions in the microwave or infrared range, maybe rotational transitions. But for stellar photospheres, which have temperatures of thousands of K, the relevant transitions are in the visible range, which are a few eV. So this energy difference seems too small. Maybe it's a typo and should be 1.38e-18 J or something. But assuming the problem is as stated, perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario.

But given that, maybe the correct relation is T1 = T2 / ln(2), but let's check.

Wait, let's suppose that T1 and T2 are such that ΔE/(k T) is small. If the thermal energy k*T is much larger than ΔE, then the exponential terms can be approximated. But in our case, ΔE = k*1 K, so if T is 5000 K, then ΔE/(k T) = 1/5000, which is small. So maybe we can use the approximation exp(-x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

But let's see:

Starting from:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

If ΔE/(k T) is small, then exp(-ΔE/(k T)) ≈ 1 - ΔE/(k T)

So:

1 - ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 2 [1 - ΔE/(k T2) ]

Which gives:

1 - ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 2 - 2 ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) ≈ 1 - 2 ΔE/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) ≈ -1 + 2 ΔE/(k T2)

But this leads to:

ΔE/(k T1) + 1 ≈ 2 ΔE/(k T2)

But since ΔE/(k T) is very small (since T is large), the left-hand side is approximately 1, so 1 ≈ 2 ΔE/(k T2)

But ΔE/k is 1 K, so 1 ≈ 2*(1 K)/T2 => T2 ≈ 2 K

But again, this is unrealistic for stars. Therefore, perhaps the assumption that ΔE/(k T) is small is invalid here, but given that ΔE/k =1 K and T is thousands of K, ΔE/(k T) is 1/5000, which is indeed small. But even then, the result is nonsensical, implying T2 is about 2 K. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or my approach.

Wait, but maybe the problem isn't assuming a two-level system. Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). But if the lower level is the ground state and the upper level is an excited state, then n2 is the population of the excited state. If star_1 has twice the excitation, meaning n2 is twice as much as in star_2. But if the lower level is not the ground state, but another excited state, but the problem says "a specific energy level," so maybe they are considering the ratio of populations in two specific levels, say level m and level n, and in star_1, the ratio is twice that in star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of iron atoms in a particular excited state relative to the total, but LTE assumes that the population follows the Boltzmann distribution, so the ratio of populations in two levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one, and in star_1, this ratio is twice that in star_2. So then:

For star_1: n_upper / n_lower = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_star2

Which leads to the same equation as before.

But given the energy difference ΔE = k*1 K, which is very small, the exponent ΔE/(kT) would be 1/T. For a star at 5000 K, this is 0.0002, so the exponent is -0.0002, so exp(-0.0002) ≈ 0.9998. Therefore, the ratio n_upper/n_lower ≈ g2/g1 * 0.9998. If g2/g1 is 1, then the ratio is almost 1. So to have star_1's ratio be twice that of star_2's, when the ratios are both close to 1, would require that star_1 has a ratio of, say, 1.9996 and star_2 has 0.9998, but that would mean the ratio is approximately 2, but in reality, the difference is tiny. However, given that the energy difference is so small, the excitation is almost equal, and a factor of 2 difference would require a significant temperature difference. But with the given numbers, this seems impossible because of the small ΔE.

Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and ΔE is meant to be 1.38e-18 J, which would make ΔE/k ≈ 1e5 K, which is more reasonable for stellar temperatures. Then, the equation would involve temperatures around 1e4 K, making the term ΔE/(kT) on the order of 0.1 to 10, which is manageable.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to use the Boltzmann equation without considering the approximation, leading to an exponential relation between the temperatures. Let's go back to the key equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Let's take the ratio:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 2

Which simplifies to:

exp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = 2

Taking natural logarithm:

ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2

Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Given that ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J and k = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K, this simplifies to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K

So:

1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^{-1}

This is the equation relating T1 and T2. Therefore, the correct equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 * k / ΔE, which, given the values, simplifies to 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 K^{-1}

But since the problem asks for the equation, not the numerical value, the general form is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * k / ΔE

Therefore, the answer should be an equation that states this relationship. If the options were given, it would likely be one of the forms we derived. Since the user hasn't provided options, but asks to write the correct equation, we can present it as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Or equivalently,

T1 = [1/T2 - (k ln 2)/ΔE]^{-1}

But the more standard form would be the first one. However, given that the problem mentions "effective temperatures," which are related to the blackbody radiation, but since the question is about excitation temperatures in LTE, the relation derived via the Boltzmann equation is appropriate.

Therefore, the correct equation is:

1/T₁ - 1/T₂ = - (k ln 2)/ΔE

But wait, in our derivation, we had 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE, which can be written as:

1/T₁ = 1/T₂ - (k ln 2)/ΔE

But depending on how the answer is presented, it might be written as:

exp(ΔE/(k T₁)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T₂))

But that's another way of writing the original equation.

Alternatively, multiplying both sides by T1*T2:

T1 - T2 = (k ln 2 / ΔE) T1 T2

But this complicates things.

Given the problem statement, the most direct equation derived is:

1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = (ln 2) k / ΔE

So this is the correct relation between T₁ and T₂. Therefore, the answer should be this equation. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the problem is from a multiple-choice context, perhaps the answer is expressed as:

T₁ = \frac{\Delta E}{k \ln 2} / (1 + \frac{\Delta E}{k T₂ \ln 2})

But this seems too convoluted. Alternatively, if we consider that when you invert the equation:

exp(ΔE/(k T1)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))

Then:

exp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)) = 1/2

Take natural log:

ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) = -ln 2

Which gives:

1/T1 - 1/T2 = - (k ln 2)/ΔE

Or:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Therefore, the equation is 1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Given that the problem states the energy difference ΔE is 1.38 x 10^-23 J, which is equal to k * 1 K, this simplifies to:

1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = ln 2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K⁻¹

But since the problem likely expects an equation in terms of the symbols T₁, T₂, ΔE, k, and not numerical values, the answer is:

\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}

So boxed:

\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}

Let's see if this can be rearranged to any of the standard options. However, since the answer options aren't provided, I need to deduce the correct relation based on standard forms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to solve for T1 in terms of T2.\n\nStarting from:\n\nΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)\n\nMultiply both sides by k/ΔE:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nThen, 1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, if we denote (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln2)/ΔE, but this is a possible relation. However, maybe we can express T1 in terms of T2.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take the ratio of the two population ratios:\n\n(n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nTherefore, ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhich leads to 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nSo this is the equation relating T1 and T2. Let's check units:\n\nΔE is in Joules, k is in J/K, so (k ln2)/ΔE has units (J/K * 1) / J = 1/K. Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 has units 1/K, which is consistent. So this equation is dimensionally correct.\n\nAlternatively, solving for T1 in terms of T2:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nThen,\n\nT1 = 1 / [1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE ]\n\nBut this is a bit complicated. Alternatively, if we write T1 in terms of T2, perhaps we can invert the equation. Alternatively, if the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is Boltzmann's constant (~1.38e-23 J/K), then (k ln2)/ΔE would be (1.38e-23 J/K * ln2)/1.38e-23 J) = ln2 / K. So (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / K, which would be 0.693 / K. Wait, but that would make the RHS of the equation (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2 / K. Wait, but if ΔE = k * something? Let me check.\n\nWait, if ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (since k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T0, where T0 is 1 K. So ΔE/k = 1 K. Then (k ln2)/ΔE = (k ln2)/(k*1 K) ) = ln2 / K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K. But that seems odd. Wait, but perhaps this is a trick. Let me check the numbers.\n\nΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J. k = 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE is approximately equal to k. So ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore, (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / 1 K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 / K. But how would that help? Let me see.\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers. Let me compute (k ln2)/ΔE:\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nln2 ≈ 0.693\n\nΔE = 1.38e-23 J\n\nThus, (k ln2)/ΔE = (1.38e-23 * 0.693) / 1.38e-23 = 0.693 ≈ ln2.\n\nSo (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / (ΔE/k) )? Wait, no. Wait, if ΔE = k*T, then T = ΔE/k. So here, T would be ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1 K. So T = 1 K. But that seems like a very low temperature, but perhaps this is just a coincidence in the numbers.\n\nBut in our equation, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE. Since ΔE/k = 1 K, then this becomes 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 / K. Therefore, if we rearrange:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693\n\nBut this would require T1 and T2 to be in Kelvin. However, this seems problematic because if T2 is, say, 1000 K, then 1/T2 is 0.001, subtracting 0.693 would give a negative value, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps my approach is flawed, or maybe the temperatures are such that T2 is very low? But stars typically have much higher temperatures.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-express the equation correctly. From the previous steps:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nBut since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is approximately the same value (1.38e-23 J/K), then (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K. Therefore:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 / K\n\nBut this would imply that 1/T2 is greater than 1/T1 by 0.693 K^-1, meaning that T1 is greater than T2 because the reciprocal is smaller. So T1 must be hotter than T2. This makes sense because if star_1 has a higher excitation (twice as excited), then it should be hotter. Because higher temperature would lead to more population in the excited state.\n\nBut how can we express T1 in terms of T2? Let's try plugging in some numbers. Suppose T2 is 1000 K. Then 1/T2 = 0.001 K^-1. Then 1/T1 = 0.001 - 0.693 ≈ -0.692 K^-1. Which is impossible because temperature can't be negative. So this suggests that T2 must be low enough such that 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE is positive. Wait, but if ΔE = k*1 K, then (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 K^-1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1. Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1. Therefore, if T2 is, say, 2 K, then 1/T2 = 0.5 K^-1, so 1/T1 = 0.5 - 0.693 = -0.193, which is still negative. Wait, this seems problematic.\n\nBut stars have photospheres with temperatures in thousands of Kelvin, so even if T2 is 5000 K, 1/T2 is 0.0002 K^-1, and 0.0002 - 0.693 is negative. This suggests that my equation might be inverted. Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = 2\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\nΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2\n\nThus,\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln2\n\nBut since ΔE = k * 1 K (approximately), then this becomes:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K\n\nBut as we saw, for any reasonable stellar temperature (T2 in thousands of K), 1/T2 is very small, so 1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation in the sign.\n\nWait, let's check the original setup. The problem states that star_1 has more excitation than star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2. Let's make sure that when we take the ratio, the exponent has the correct sign.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, the population ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). The ratio of these is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). And this ratio is equal to 2, as given.\n\nSo, exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = 2\n\nTaking ln:\n\nΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nGiven that ΔE ≈ k, this becomes approximately:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 / K\n\nBut as discussed, for typical stellar temperatures (say T2 = 5000 K), 1/T2 is 0.0002 K^-1, so 0.0002 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693, which would imply 1/T1 ≈ 0.0002 - 0.693 ≈ -0.6928, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem assumes T2 is very low (unlikely for a star), or there's a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the direction of the ratio. Let's double-check:\n\nIf star_1 has a higher excitation (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2, then:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))\n\nDivide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T1)):\n\n1 = 2 * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me re-express:\n\n(n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))\n\nDivide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) = 2\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2\n\nSo this is correct as before. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nBut given that ΔE ≈ k, this becomes 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 ≈ 0.693 K^-1. So unless T2 is on the order of 1 K, which is impossible for stars, this suggests that the temperatures must be such that 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive and equal to 0.693 K^-1, but that would require T1 to be negative unless T2 is less than 1/0.693 ≈ 1.44 K. Which is not possible for stars. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or my approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the energy difference is not ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, but higher. Let me check the given ΔE: 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Since k = 1.38e-23 J/K, this means ΔE = k * 1 K. Therefore, if T is in Kelvin, then ΔE/(k T) = (k*1 K)/(k T) = 1 K / T. So if T is 1000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 0.001, which is small. Therefore, the exponent would be 1/T2 - 1/T1 multiplied by ΔE/k ≈ 1 K, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) * 1 K = ln2. Therefore:\n\n(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut again, for stellar temperatures, this leads to negative 1/T1. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have intended ΔE to be much larger, so that (k ln2)/ΔE is a small number. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference is given in a different unit or there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should keep the equation in terms of symbols without plugging in numbers.

The correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, based on the Boltzmann distribution under LTE conditions, is derived from the ratio of excited states. Given that star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2 for the same energy transition:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Boltzmann Equation:**  
   For a specific energy level transition with energy difference \( \Delta E \), the population ratio in each star is:  
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
   \]
   For star_1 and star_2, this becomes:  
   \[
   \frac{(n_2/n_1)_1}{(n_2/n_1)_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = 2
   \]

2. **Simplify the Ratio:**  
   Taking the ratio and solving:  
   \[
   \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2
   \]

3. **Take Natural Logarithm:**  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2
   \]

4. **Solve for Temperatures:**  
   Rearranging gives the relationship:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}
   \]

**Final Equation:**  
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}
\]  

This equation correctly relates the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) based on the given excitation ratio and energy difference.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)

Rearranging terms:

ΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE

But let me check the signs again. Starting from:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)):

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2)) ) = 2

So, exponentiate the sum:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)

So, solving for temperatures:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

But the problem asks for the equation relating T1 and T2. Let's see if this can be rearranged to any of the standard options. However, since the answer options aren't provided, I need to deduce the correct relation based on standard forms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve for T1 in terms of T2.

Starting from:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

Then, 1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, if we denote (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln2)/ΔE, but this is a possible relation. However, maybe we can express T1 in terms of T2.

Alternatively, let's consider the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps take the ratio of the two population ratios:

(n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Therefore, ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which leads to 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

So this is the equation relating T1 and T2. Let's check units:

ΔE is in Joules, k is in J/K, so (k ln2)/ΔE has units (J/K * 1) / J = 1/K. Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 has units 1/K, which is consistent. So this equation is dimensionally correct.

Alternatively, solving for T1 in terms of T2:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

Then,

T1 = 1 / [1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE ]

But this is a bit complicated. Alternatively, if we write T1 in terms of T2, perhaps we can invert the equation. Alternatively, if the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is Boltzmann's constant (~1.38e-23 J/K), then (k ln2)/ΔE would be (1.38e-23 J/K * ln2)/1.38e-23 J) = ln2 / K. So (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / K, which would be 0.693 / K. Wait, but that would make the RHS of the equation (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2 / K. Wait, but if ΔE = k * something? Let me check.

Wait, if ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (since k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T0, where T0 is 1 K. So ΔE/k = 1 K. Then (k ln2)/ΔE = (k ln2)/(k*1 K) ) = ln2 / K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K. But that seems odd. Wait, but perhaps this is a trick. Let me check the numbers.

ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J. k = 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K. So ΔE is approximately equal to k. So ΔE/k ≈ 1 K. Therefore, (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / 1 K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 / K. But how would that help? Let me see.

But let's plug in the numbers. Let me compute (k ln2)/ΔE:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ln2 ≈ 0.693

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J

Thus, (k ln2)/ΔE = (1.38e-23 * 0.693) / 1.38e-23 = 0.693 ≈ ln2.

So (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / (ΔE/k) )? Wait, no. Wait, if ΔE = k*T, then T = ΔE/k. So here, T would be ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1 K. So T = 1 K. But that seems like a very low temperature, but perhaps this is just a coincidence in the numbers.

But in our equation, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE. Since ΔE/k = 1 K, then this becomes 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 / K. Therefore, if we rearrange:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693

But this would require T1 and T2 to be in Kelvin. However, this seems problematic because if T2 is, say, 1000 K, then 1/T2 is 0.001, subtracting 0.693 would give a negative value, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps my approach is flawed, or maybe the temperatures are such that T2 is very low? But stars typically have much higher temperatures.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-express the equation correctly. From the previous steps:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is approximately the same value (1.38e-23 J/K), then (k ln2)/ΔE ≈ ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K. Therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693 / K

But this would imply that 1/T2 is greater than 1/T1 by 0.693 K^-1, meaning that T1 is greater than T2 because the reciprocal is smaller. So T1 must be hotter than T2. This makes sense because if star_1 has a higher excitation (twice as excited), then it should be hotter. Because higher temperature would lead to more population in the excited state.

But how can we express T1 in terms of T2? Let's try plugging in some numbers. Suppose T2 is 1000 K. Then 1/T2 = 0.001 K^-1. Then 1/T1 = 0.001 - 0.693 ≈ -0.692 K^-1. Which is impossible because temperature can't be negative. So this suggests that T2 must be low enough such that 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE is positive. Wait, but if ΔE = k*1 K, then (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 K^-1 ≈ 0.693 K^-1. Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1. Therefore, if T2 is, say, 2 K, then 1/T2 = 0.5 K^-1, so 1/T1 = 0.5 - 0.693 = -0.193, which is still negative. Wait, this seems problematic.

But stars have photospheres with temperatures in thousands of Kelvin, so even if T2 is 5000 K, 1/T2 is 0.0002 K^-1, and 0.0002 - 0.693 is negative. This suggests that my equation might be inverted. Let me check the steps again.

Starting from:

exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = 2

Taking natural logarithm:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2

Thus,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln2

But since ΔE = k * 1 K (approximately), then this becomes:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K

But as we saw, for any reasonable stellar temperature (T2 in thousands of K), 1/T2 is very small, so 1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation in the sign.

Wait, let's check the original setup. The problem states that star_1 has more excitation than star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2. Let's make sure that when we take the ratio, the exponent has the correct sign.

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, the population ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). The ratio of these is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). And this ratio is equal to 2, as given.

So, exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = 2

Taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2

Which leads to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

Given that ΔE ≈ k, this becomes approximately:

1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 / K

But as discussed, for typical stellar temperatures (say T2 = 5000 K), 1/T2 is 0.0002 K^-1, so 0.0002 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.693, which would imply 1/T1 ≈ 0.0002 - 0.693 ≈ -0.6928, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem assumes T2 is very low (unlikely for a star), or there's a mistake in the sign.

Wait, maybe I messed up the direction of the ratio. Let's double-check:

If star_1 has a higher excitation (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2, then:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T1)):

1 = 2 * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me re-express:

(n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2

Which is:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) = 2

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

So this is correct as before. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

But given that ΔE ≈ k, this becomes 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ ln2 ≈ 0.693 K^-1. So unless T2 is on the order of 1 K, which is impossible for stars, this suggests that the temperatures must be such that 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive and equal to 0.693 K^-1, but that would require T1 to be negative unless T2 is less than 1/0.693 ≈ 1.44 K. Which is not possible for stars. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem setup or my approach.

Wait, but maybe the energy difference is not ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, but higher. Let me check the given ΔE: 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Since k = 1.38e-23 J/K, this means ΔE = k * 1 K. Therefore, if T is in Kelvin, then ΔE/(k T) = (k*1 K)/(k T) = 1 K / T. So if T is 1000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 0.001, which is small. Therefore, the exponent would be 1/T2 - 1/T1 multiplied by ΔE/k ≈ 1 K, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) * 1 K = ln2. Therefore:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But again, for stellar temperatures, this leads to negative 1/T1. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have intended ΔE to be much larger, so that (k ln2)/ΔE is a small number. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference is given in a different unit or there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should keep the equation in terms of symbols without plugging in numbers. The correct relation is:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

Therefore, rearranged, this gives:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

This is the equation relating T1 and T2. Therefore, if we were to express this as an equation to select from given options, it would be:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = (k ln2)/ΔE

Which can also be written as:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - (k ln2)/ΔE

Alternatively, multiplying both sides by T1*T2:

T2 - T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE * T1*T2

But this complicates things. The most straightforward equation is the one involving the reciprocals:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

Therefore, the correct equation should relate the reciprocals of the temperatures with a term involving Boltzmann's constant, the natural log of 2, and the energy difference. Given that the problem asks which equation is correct, and assuming the options include this reciprocal relation, that would be the answer.

Let\'s see the possible options (though they aren\'t listed here, but perhaps we need to figure out the form).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is based on the actual number in the excited state. If star_1 has twice the excitation, perhaps n2_1 = 2 n2_2. But in LTE, the ratio n2/n1 depends on temperature, but if both stars have different temperatures, then their n1 (population of lower level) could differ as well. Wait, but the problem states "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So maybe the fraction of iron atoms in that specific energy level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, if the specific energy level is level 2, then (n2/N)_1 = 2*(n2/N)_2, where N is the total number of iron atoms. But if the total number is the same? Probably not, but in LTE, the ratio n2/N is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Wait, but actually, the population ratio between two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, but if considering the population in a single energy level relative to the total, it\'s a bit different. However, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", which is more likely referring to the ratio of populations in that level compared to another (probably the ground state). So going back, the original approach.\n\nSo, if (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2, then proceeding as before:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2*exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\nΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)\n\nMultiply both sides by k/ΔE:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nAlternatively, if we take the inverse, but perhaps the answer is in terms of exponentials. Let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:\n\n[(n2/n1)_1]/[(n2/n1)_2] = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))] = exp[ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)]\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 = exp[ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)]\n\nTaking natural logarithm:\n\nln(2) = ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)\n\nSame as before. So, this equation relates T1 and T2. The question is which equation is correct. Since the problem is multiple-choice (implied by "which of these equations"), but the options aren\'t given here. However, the user hasn\'t provided the options, so perhaps we need to derive the correct relation.\n\nGiven that, the equation connecting T1 and T2 is:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nAlternatively:\n\n(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nSo, if we have to present the equation, it\'s either of these forms. But perhaps the answer is expressed as T1 = ... or T2 = ... Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, solving for T1 in terms of T2:\n\nStarting from ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nMultiply both sides by k/ΔE:\n\n(k/ΔE) ln2 = 1/T2 - 1/T1\n\nThen,\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nThus,\n\nT1 = [1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE]^-1\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, if the problem expects a ratio between temperatures, perhaps expressed as T1 = T2 * something. Let\'s think.\n\nBut the equation is transcendental and can\'t be simplified into a direct proportionality unless approximations are made. However, given that the energy difference is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J. Let\'s compute (ΔE)/(k) to see if that corresponds to a temperature.\n\nk is Boltzmann constant: ~1.38 x 10^-23 J/K.\n\nSo, ΔE/k = (1.38 x10^-23 J)/(1.38 x10^-23 J/K) = 1 K. Wait, that\'s interesting. The energy difference divided by k is 1 K. Therefore, (ΔE/k) = 1 K. Therefore, the term (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / (ΔE/k) ) = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1. So, the equation becomes:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / (ΔE/k) => 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut given that ΔE/k = 1 K, perhaps the problem is designed such that when you compute the equation, the temperatures can be related with a simplified expression. Alternatively, if ΔE = k*T, but here ΔE is k*1 K, so very small energy difference. However, stars have photospheres with temperatures of thousands of Kelvins, so 1 K is negligible? Wait, but maybe in this case, since ΔE/k = 1 K, which is much smaller than typical stellar temperatures, maybe the exponent is small. Let\'s check.\n\nIf T is a typical stellar temperature, say 5000 K, then ΔE/(k*T) = (1 K)/T, so 1/5000 ≈ 0.0002. Therefore, the exponent is small, and we can approximate the exponential as 1 - ΔE/(k*T). But in this problem, the ratio of the populations is a factor of 2, so the exponential term can\'t be approximated as linear. Therefore, the exact expression must be used.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to write the relation as:\n\nT1 = [ (1/T2) - (k ln2)/ΔE ]^{-1}\n\nBut given that ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k=1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = 1 K, so (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K. Therefore, substituting into the equation:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 / K\n\nBut this seems dimensionally inconsistent. Wait, 1/T2 is 1/Kelvin, and 0.693 / K is 0.693 1/K, so subtracting gives 1/Kelvin. Then, T1 is in Kelvin.\n\nBut maybe the answer is presented as:\n\n(1/T1) = (1/T2) - (ln2)/ (ΔE/k)\n\nBut since ΔE/k = 1 K, this would be:\n\n(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2 / (1 K)\n\nBut written as:\n\n(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2*(k/ΔE)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since ΔE = k*1 K, then:\n\n(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2*(1/(1 K)) )\n\nBut this is problematic because the units would be 1/K. So, if you have 1/T1 [which is 1/K] equals 1/T2 [1/K] minus ln2 [dimensionless] over 1 K. So, the units do match. So, 1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln2)/ (1 K). Therefore, T1 = 1/[1/T2 - ln2/(1 K)].\n\nBut this seems non-standard. However, given the numbers, since ΔE/k = 1 K, the equation simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the ratio T1/T2 or T2/T1.\n\nWait, if ΔE/k = 1 K, then the equation:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) => ln2 = (1 K)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nBut ln2 is dimensionless, so 1 K*(1/T2 - 1/T1) must be dimensionless. Wait, that\'s not possible. So, perhaps there was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, ΔE is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J. The value of k is 1.38 x10^-23 J/K. Therefore, ΔE/k is (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1 K. Therefore, ΔE/k = 1 K.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) => ln2 = (1 K)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nBut the left side is dimensionless, and the right side has units of Kelvin*(1/Kelvin) = dimensionless. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, ln2 = (1/T2 - 1/T1) * 1 K\n\nTherefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K\n\nBut ln2 is ~0.693, so:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1\n\nBut how would this relate the temperatures? If we consider T1 and T2 in Kelvin, then 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1. So, for example, if T2 is higher than T1, then 1/T2 is less than 1/T1, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 would be negative. But here it\'s positive, so that would require that T2 < T1. Wait, but if star_1 has more excitation (higher population in the excited state), which typically requires higher temperature. Because higher temperature leads to more population in higher energy states.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann factor, higher temperature means higher population in excited states. So if star_1 has more excitation (n2/n1 is higher), then T1 should be higher than T2. But according to the equation we derived, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = positive, which implies that 1/T2 > 1/T1, so T2 < T1. Which is consistent. So T1 is hotter than T2, which makes sense.\n\nBut the problem is to find the equation relating T1 and T2, given that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the correct equation is:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nBut given that ΔE/k = 1 K, then (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / 1 K = 0.693 / K\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 / K\n\nBut since temperatures are in Kelvin, this equation is dimensionally consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is expressed as:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(ΔE/(k T2))\n\nBut wait, let\'s check. From the original ratio:\n\n(n2/n1)_1 = 2 (n2/n1)_2\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 2\n\nWhich is:\n\nexp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = 2\n\nTaking natural log:\n\nΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, this can be rewritten as:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T2)) / exp(ΔE/(k T1)) = 2\n\nOr:\n\nexp(ΔE/(k T1)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))\n\nBut I think the key equation is the one involving the reciprocals of temperatures:\n\nΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)\n\nWhich, given ΔE/k = 1 K, simplifies to:\n\n(1 K)/T2 - (1 K)/T1 = ln2\n\nDividing both sides by 1 K:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K\n\nBut ln2 is dimensionless, so the units are 1/K.\n\nThus, the equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K\n\nBut since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but the original problem mentions "which of these equations...", and since in the problem statement ΔE is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J, which is equal to k*1 K (since k=1.38x10^-23 J/K), then ΔE = k*T_*, where T_* =1 K. Therefore, the equation can be written using T_* = ΔE/k =1 K.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / T_*\n\nBut T_* is 1 K, so:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K\n\nBut since T_* is 1 K, then perhaps it\'s written as:\n\n(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln2) * (k/ΔE)\n\nBut k/ΔE = 1/(1 K)\n\nTherefore, the equation is as above.\n\nBut without seeing the options, it\'s hard to pick, but considering standard treatments, the correct relation is:\n\nln(n2/n1)_1 - ln(n2/n1)_2 = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nBut given that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 (n2/n1)_2, the left side becomes ln(2), leading to:\n\nln2 = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhich is the key equation. Therefore, the correct equation should relate T1 and T2 via:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nGiven that ΔE =1.38e-23 J and k=1.38e-23 J/K, this simplifies to:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K\n\nTherefore, the equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / T_*, where T_* = ΔE/k =1 K.\n\nBut since the problem mentions the energy difference is approximately 1.38 x10^-23 J, which is k*1 K, then T_* =1 K, therefore:\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K\n\nBut since the temperatures are in Kelvin, this equation is dimensionally consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is 1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln2 / (ΔE/k)\n\nBut since ΔE/k =1 K, it\'s 1/T1 =1/T2 - ln2 /1 K\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be presented as T1 = 1/(1/T2 - ln2/(ΔE/k))\n\nBut given the multiple ways to express it, but likely the answer is:\n\n(1/T1) = (1/T2) - (k ln2)/ΔE\n\nSo, boxed, that would be:\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{k \\ln 2}{\\Delta E}}\n\nThis seems to be the correct equation based on the derivation.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390728, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4004, prompt_tokens=672, total_tokens=4676, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves two stars where the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, with an energy difference of \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming LTE, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. 

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state is given by:
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Given \( \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_1 = 2 \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_2 \), we equate the Boltzmann factors:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm and simplifying:
\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln 2 - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \times 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln 2}{1 \, \text{K}}
\]

Thus, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}
\]

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)

Rearranging terms...

ΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Then:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)

Alternatively:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

But the question is asking which equation is correct. Let's see the possible options (though they aren't listed here, but perhaps we need to figure out the form).

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is based on the actual number in the excited state. If star_1 has twice the excitation, perhaps n2_1 = 2 n2_2. But in LTE, the ratio n2/n1 depends on temperature, but if both stars have different temperatures, then their n1 (population of lower level) could differ as well. Wait, but the problem states "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So maybe the fraction of iron atoms in that specific energy level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, if the specific energy level is level 2, then (n2/N)_1 = 2*(n2/N)_2, where N is the total number of iron atoms. But if the total number is the same? Probably not, but in LTE, the ratio n2/N is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Wait, but actually, the population ratio between two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, but if considering the population in a single energy level relative to the total, it's a bit different. However, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", which is more likely referring to the ratio of populations in that level compared to another (probably the ground state). So going back, the original approach.

So, if (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2, then proceeding as before:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2*exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Taking natural logs:

-ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k*T2)

Then, rearranged:

ΔE/(k*T2) - ΔE/(k*T1) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)

Which can be written as:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

Alternatively, if we take the inverse, but perhaps the answer is in terms of exponentials. Let's see.

Alternatively, if we take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:

[(n2/n1)_1]/[(n2/n1)_2] = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))] = exp[ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Therefore:

2 = exp[ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Taking natural logarithm:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which leads to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k/ΔE) * ln(2)

Same as before. So, this equation relates T1 and T2. The question is which equation is correct. Since the problem is multiple-choice (implied by "which of these equations"), but the options aren't given here. However, the user hasn't provided the options, so perhaps we need to derive the correct relation.

Given that, the equation connecting T1 and T2 is:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

Alternatively:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln2)/ΔE

So, if we have to present the equation, it's either of these forms. But perhaps the answer is expressed as T1 = ... or T2 = ... Let me check.

Alternatively, solving for T1 in terms of T2:

Starting from ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

(k/ΔE) ln2 = 1/T2 - 1/T1

Then,

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

Thus,

T1 = [1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE]^-1

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, if the problem expects a ratio between temperatures, perhaps expressed as T1 = T2 * something. Let's think.

But the equation is transcendental and can't be simplified into a direct proportionality unless approximations are made. However, given that the energy difference is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J. Let's compute (ΔE)/(k) to see if that corresponds to a temperature.

k is Boltzmann constant: ~1.38 x 10^-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/k = (1.38 x10^-23 J)/(1.38 x10^-23 J/K) = 1 K. Wait, that's interesting. The energy difference divided by k is 1 K. Therefore, (ΔE/k) = 1 K. Therefore, the term (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / (ΔE/k) ) = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1. So, the equation becomes:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / (ΔE/k) => 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 K^-1

But given that ΔE/k = 1 K, perhaps the problem is designed such that when you compute the equation, the temperatures can be related with a simplified expression. Alternatively, if ΔE = k*T, but here ΔE is k*1 K, so very small energy difference. However, stars have photospheres with temperatures of thousands of Kelvins, so 1 K is negligible? Wait, but maybe in this case, since ΔE/k = 1 K, which is much smaller than typical stellar temperatures, maybe the exponent is small. Let's check.

If T is a typical stellar temperature, say 5000 K, then ΔE/(k*T) = (1 K)/T, so 1/5000 ≈ 0.0002. Therefore, the exponent is small, and we can approximate the exponential as 1 - ΔE/(k*T). But in this problem, the ratio of the populations is a factor of 2, so the exponential term can't be approximated as linear. Therefore, the exact expression must be used.

But perhaps the problem expects us to write the relation as:

T1 = [ (1/T2) - (k ln2)/ΔE ]^{-1}

But given that ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k=1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = 1 K, so (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / 1 K ≈ 0.693 / K. Therefore, substituting into the equation:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 / K

But this seems dimensionally inconsistent. Wait, 1/T2 is 1/Kelvin, and 0.693 / K is 0.693 1/K, so subtracting gives 1/Kelvin. Then, T1 is in Kelvin.

But maybe the answer is presented as:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - (ln2)/ (ΔE/k)

But since ΔE/k = 1 K, this would be:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2 / (1 K)

But written as:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2*(k/ΔE)

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, since ΔE = k*1 K, then:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - ln2*(1/(1 K)) )

But this is problematic because the units would be 1/K. So, if you have 1/T1 [which is 1/K] equals 1/T2 [1/K] minus ln2 [dimensionless] over 1 K. So, the units do match. So, 1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln2)/ (1 K). Therefore, T1 = 1/[1/T2 - ln2/(1 K)].

But this seems non-standard. However, given the numbers, since ΔE/k = 1 K, the equation simplifies.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the ratio T1/T2 or T2/T1.

Wait, if ΔE/k = 1 K, then the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) => ln2 = (1 K)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

But ln2 is dimensionless, so 1 K*(1/T2 - 1/T1) must be dimensionless. Wait, that's not possible. So, perhaps there was a miscalculation.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J. The value of k is 1.38 x10^-23 J/K. Therefore, ΔE/k is (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1 K. Therefore, ΔE/k = 1 K.

So, substituting into the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) => ln2 = (1 K)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

But the left side is dimensionless, and the right side has units of Kelvin*(1/Kelvin) = dimensionless. So, that works.

Therefore, ln2 = (1/T2 - 1/T1) * 1 K

Therefore, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K

But ln2 is ~0.693, so:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1

But how would this relate the temperatures? If we consider T1 and T2 in Kelvin, then 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.693 K^-1. So, for example, if T2 is higher than T1, then 1/T2 is less than 1/T1, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 would be negative. But here it's positive, so that would require that T2 < T1. Wait, but if star_1 has more excitation (higher population in the excited state), which typically requires higher temperature. Because higher temperature leads to more population in higher energy states.

But according to the Boltzmann factor, higher temperature means higher population in excited states. So if star_1 has more excitation (n2/n1 is higher), then T1 should be higher than T2. But according to the equation we derived, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = positive, which implies that 1/T2 > 1/T1, so T2 < T1. Which is consistent. So T1 is hotter than T2, which makes sense.

But the problem is to find the equation relating T1 and T2, given that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the correct equation is:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (k ln2)/ΔE

But given that ΔE/k = 1 K, then (k ln2)/ΔE = ln2 / 1 K = 0.693 / K

Therefore, substituting:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - 0.693 / K

But since temperatures are in Kelvin, this equation is dimensionally consistent.

Alternatively, if the answer is expressed as:

exp(ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(ΔE/(k T2))

But wait, let's check. From the original ratio:

(n2/n1)_1 = 2 (n2/n1)_2

Which is:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 2

Which is:

exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = 2

Taking natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2

Which is the same equation as before. So, this can be rewritten as:

exp(ΔE/(k T2)) / exp(ΔE/(k T1)) = 2

Or:

exp(ΔE/(k T1)) = (1/2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))

But I think the key equation is the one involving the reciprocals of temperatures:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Which, given ΔE/k = 1 K, simplifies to:

(1 K)/T2 - (1 K)/T1 = ln2

Dividing both sides by 1 K:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K

But ln2 is dimensionless, so the units are 1/K.

Thus, the equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / K

But since the user hasn't provided the options, but the original problem mentions "which of these equations...", and since in the problem statement ΔE is given as 1.38 x10^-23 J, which is equal to k*1 K (since k=1.38x10^-23 J/K), then ΔE = k*T_*, where T_* =1 K. Therefore, the equation can be written using T_* = ΔE/k =1 K.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / T_*

But T_* is 1 K, so:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K

But since T_* is 1 K, then perhaps it's written as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln2) * (k/ΔE)

But k/ΔE = 1/(1 K)

Therefore, the equation is as above.

But without seeing the options, it's hard to pick, but considering standard treatments, the correct relation is:

ln(n2/n1)_1 - ln(n2/n1)_2 = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But given that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 (n2/n1)_2, the left side becomes ln(2), leading to:

ln2 = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which is the key equation. Therefore, the correct equation should relate T1 and T2 via:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln2)/ΔE

Given that ΔE =1.38e-23 J and k=1.38e-23 J/K, this simplifies to:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K

Therefore, the equation is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / T_*, where T_* = ΔE/k =1 K.

But since the problem mentions the energy difference is approximately 1.38 x10^-23 J, which is k*1 K, then T_* =1 K, therefore:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln2 / 1 K

But since the temperatures are in Kelvin, this equation is dimensionally consistent.

Therefore, the correct equation is 1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln2 / (ΔE/k)

But since ΔE/k =1 K, it's 1/T1 =1/T2 - ln2 /1 K

Alternatively, the equation can be presented as T1 = 1/(1/T2 - ln2/(ΔE/k))

But given the multiple ways to express it, but likely the answer is:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) - (k ln2)/ΔE

So, boxed, that would be:

\boxed{\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{k \ln 2}{\Delta E}}

This seems to be the correct equation based on the derivation.
