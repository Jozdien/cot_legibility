To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X-Y) to transition from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we compare the energy differences for rotational and vibrational transitions. 

1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
   \]
   Convert to kg:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference (ΔE_rot):**
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum (p):**
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}
   \]

Considering significant figures (with the least being 1 from My, R, and ω), the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule (X-Y) would absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given parameters are the masses of the atoms (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s). Hmm, let's start by recalling what the fundamental state and the next state would be in the rotation-vibration model.

First, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think means both the vibrational and rotational ground states. The next lowest energy state could involve either a vibrational excitation, a rotational excitation, or both. But since the question mentions the "next state with the lowest possible energy," I need to compare the energy differences for vibrational and rotational transitions to see which is smaller. Because rotational energy levels are typically closer together than vibrational ones, maybe the next state is a rotational excitation. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both, but the fundamental state usually refers to the vibrational ground state. So maybe the next state would be a combination of a vibrational and rotational transition? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

In the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Evib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2,...), and the rotational energy levels are Erot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number (J=0,1,2,...) and I is the moment of inertia. The total energy is then E = Evib + Erot.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that would be v=0 and J=0. The next lowest energy state could be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational excitation). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let's calculate both energy differences. First, the vibrational energy difference: ΔEvib = Evib(v=1) - Evib(v=0) = ħω. The rotational energy difference for the first rotational excitation: ΔErot = Erot(J=1) - Erot(J=0) = ħ²/(2I)*(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/(I).

So we need to compare ħω and ħ²/(I). Let's compute these values.

First, compute the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The masses are given in amu, so we need to convert them to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / 3.6531e-26

First multiply numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0 * 1e-53 = 1.10e-52 kg²

Then divide by 3.6531e-26 kg: 1.10e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

So μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

Then, the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Now compute ΔErot = ħ² / I

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Then ΔErot = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Now compute ΔEvib = ħω

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s

So ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J

Comparing ΔEvib ≈ 4.218e-20 J and ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J, the rotational energy difference is much smaller. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental would be the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Wait, but in some models, vibrational and rotational transitions have different selection rules. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when considering the vibration-rotation interaction, there can be simultaneous changes in v and J. But in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), if the molecule absorbs a photon, the transition would typically follow the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transition (Δv = ±1) would require a photon with energy ħω, but also, during vibrational transitions, the rotational state can change by ΔJ = ±1. So, when the molecule undergoes a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, it can also change its rotational state from J to J±1. However, if the molecule is initially in v=0, J=0, then the allowed transitions would be to v=1, J=1 (since ΔJ=+1) or v=1, J=-1, but J can't be negative, so only J=1. Therefore, the energy difference would be Evib(v=1) + Erot(J=1) - Evib(v=0) - Erot(J=0) = ħω + (ħ²/(2I))(1*2) = ħω + ħ²/I. But wait, the pure rotational transition (ΔJ=+1, Δv=0) would have energy ħ²/(2I)(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/I. But the vibrational transition with rotational excitation would have energy ħω + ħ²/(2I)(2). So which is lower? The pure rotational transition (ΔE= ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J) or the vibrational transition with rotational (ΔE= ħω + ħ²/(I) ≈ 4.218e-20 + 9.24e-23 ≈ 4.227e-20 J). The pure rotational transition is much lower in energy. Therefore, the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon needs to have energy equal to ΔErot = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J. Then, the momentum of the photon is p = E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. Therefore, p = ΔErot / c. Let's compute that.

But wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible states are either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0) or (v=1, J=1). The energy of (v=0, J=1) is Erot = ħ²/(2I)(1*2) = ħ²/I. The energy of (v=1, J=0) is Evib = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω. The energy of (v=1, J=1) is Evib + Erot = ħω + ħ²/I. So the energy differences from the ground state (0,0) are:

ΔE1 = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J (for J=1, v=0)

ΔE2 = ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J (for v=1, J=0)

ΔE3 = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ 4.218e-20 + 9.24e-23 ≈ 4.227e-20 J (for v=1, J=1)

So the smallest energy difference is ΔE1, so the next lowest energy state is (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon must have energy ΔE1. Therefore, the momentum p = ΔE1 / c.

But wait, let me check if the selection rules allow a pure rotational transition. In the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So a transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. However, in the rotation-vibration model, usually, rotational transitions accompany vibrational transitions because the dipole moment changes with vibration. Wait, but pure rotational transitions (without vibrational changes) are allowed in microwave spectroscopy, while vibrational transitions (with rotational changes) are in infrared. So if the molecule is in the vibrational ground state, can it undergo a pure rotational transition? Yes, if the molecule has a permanent dipole moment. Diatomic molecules like HCl have permanent dipole moments, so they can have pure rotational transitions. But homonuclear diatomic molecules like O2 don't have a permanent dipole moment, so they can't. But in this problem, the molecule is composed of X and Y, which are different atoms (since their masses are different), so it's a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, which does have a permanent dipole moment. Therefore, pure rotational transitions are allowed. Therefore, the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) is allowed, and requires a photon with energy ΔE = ħ²/I.

Therefore, the momentum of the photon would be p = E/c = (ħ²/I)/c.

But let me confirm the units. Let's compute this value.

First, compute ΔErot = ħ² / I ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Speed of light c ≈ 3e8 m/s

So p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, ħ² / I: we had ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

I = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J, yes.

Then p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But the question is asking for the momentum of the photon. Photon momentum is p = E/c, which is correct. So this should be the answer.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state is (v=0, J=1) with energy E = ħ²/(2I)(1)(2) = ħ²/I. But wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I))(1)(2) = ħ²/I. So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is ħ²/I. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering the vibrational transition as the next state, but since the energy required for vibrational is much higher, the rotational transition is the one with lower energy. Therefore, the answer should be p = ħ²/(I c).

But let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the vibrational transition as the fundamental state, but the question says "fundamental state", which usually refers to the lowest vibrational and rotational state, i.e., v=0, J=0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the non-rigid rotor model, where rotation and vibration are coupled. In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B depends on the vibrational state because the bond length changes with vibration. However, in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), the rotational constant would be slightly different than in higher vibrational states, but since we're staying in v=0, maybe that's not a factor here.

Alternatively, if the question is referring to the combined vibration-rotation transition, but as we saw, that requires more energy. So the lowest energy transition is the pure rotational one.

Therefore, the momentum is p = ħ²/(I c). Let's compute that.

But let's plug in the numbers again to be precise.

First, compute I:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) * 1 amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.019e-27 kg

Wait, earlier calculation had μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg, which matches.

Then I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Then ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.204e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Then p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But let me check if there's a different approach. Alternatively, the angular frequency for rotation? Wait, rotational energy is quantized, and the energy levels are spaced by ΔE = ħ²/(2I)( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) = ħ²/(2I)(2J + 2). For J=0 to J=1, ΔE = ħ²/(2I)(2) = ħ²/I, which matches.

Alternatively, using the rotational constant B = ħ/(4πμR²) or something? Wait, the rotational constant B is typically defined as B = ħ/(4πI) in wavenumbers, but in energy terms, B is often expressed as B = ħ²/(2I). Wait, no. Let me recall. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J(J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). So yes, B is ħ²/(2I). Then the energy difference between J and J+1 is E_rot(J+1) - E_rot(J) = B[(J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1)] = B[2J + 2]. For J=0, this is 2B. So ΔE = 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I. So that's correct.

Therefore, the energy difference is indeed ħ²/I, and the momentum is p = ħ²/(I c).

But let's compute this value numerically.

Given:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

c = 3e8 m/s

So p = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46 * 3e8)

First compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Denominator: 1.204e-46 * 3e8 = 3.612e-38 kg·m²/s

So p = 1.112e-68 / 3.612e-38 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But let me check if I made any unit conversion errors. Let's verify the units:

I is in kg·m², correct.

ħ is in J·s, which is kg·m²/s.

So ħ² has units (kg²·m^4)/s²

Divided by I (kg·m²) gives (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m²) = kg·m²/s² = J, which matches energy.

Then dividing by c (m/s) gives J/(m/s) = (kg·m²/s²)/(m/s) = kg·m/s, which is momentum. So units are correct.

Therefore, the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem might expect an expression in terms of the given variables without plugging in the constants. Wait, the problem gives numerical values for Mx, My, R, and ω, so we need to compute the numerical value.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting to consider a vibrational transition instead? Because sometimes the "fundamental" vibrational state refers to v=0, and the next is v=1, but in that case, the energy would be ħω, which is much larger. But the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the smallest possible energy increase. Since rotational energy levels are closer, the answer should be the rotational transition.

But to be thorough, let's compute both possibilities.

If it's a vibrational transition, the energy is ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J

Momentum p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 kg·m/s

But this is much larger than the rotational case. Since the question asks for the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct one.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if there's a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu

Convert to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.019e-27 kg

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m

I = μR² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²

So I ≈ 1.2076e-46 kg·m²

Then ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J

Then p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

Rounding to two significant figures, since the given values are:

Mx = 20 amu (2 sig fig)

My = 2 amu (1 sig fig)

R = 2 angstroms (1 sig fig)

ω = 4e14 rad/s (1 sig fig)

But the answer would be limited by the least number of significant figures, which is 1 from My, R, and ω. However, since we're multiplying and dividing, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least one, which is 1. But 3.07e-31 rounded to 1 sig fig is 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, sometimes in such problems, the given values might be considered to have more sig figs. For example, 20 amu is two, 2 amu is one, 2 angstroms is one, 4e14 is one. So the answer should have one significant figure. But the calculated value is approximately 3.1e-31, which would be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But maybe the problem expects more precision. Let me check the original numbers again.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu (possibly two sig figs), My is 2 amu (one sig fig), R is 2 angstroms (one sig fig), ω is 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig). So the least is one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the exact calculation gave 3.07e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we take two sig figs (since Mx has two), maybe 3.1e-31. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can write it as 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of the variables, but since it asks for the numerical value, we need to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the transition is purely rotational. Let me double-check the selection rules. For vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and ΔJ = ±1. So when a molecule absorbs a photon for a vibrational transition, it can also change its rotational state. Therefore, the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1) is allowed, and the energy difference would be ħω + (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħω + ħ²/I. But this energy is much larger than the pure rotational transition. However, if the photon's energy is just enough to cause a rotational transition, then it's the lower energy one. But in reality, pure rotational transitions are in the microwave range, while vibrational are in infrared. So if the problem is considering the lowest possible energy transition, it's the rotational one.

Therefore, the correct momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check with exact calculation:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818181... amu

Convert to kg: 1.818181... * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.019e-27 kg

I = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46

Calculate numerator: (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = 9.21e-23 J

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

Yes, so 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which rounds to 3.1e-31 with two sig figs or 3e-31 with one. Given the inputs, safest is one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if the question might have intended vibrational. If so, the answer would be p = ħω/c = (1.0545718e-34 * 4e14) / 3e8 = (4.218e-20) / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 kg·m/s. But this is larger, and the question asks for the lowest possible energy, which is rotational.

Therefore, the answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, or 3e-31 with appropriate sig figs. But since the given ω is 4e14 (one sig fig), the answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But to confirm, let's see: if all given values have one sig fig except Mx which has two, but when multiplying and dividing, the number of sig figs is determined by the least. So Mx is 20 (two), My is 2 (one), R is 2 (one), ω is 4e14 (one). So the least is one, so answer is one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the exact value is approximately 3.1e-31, which is closer to 3e-31 than 4e-31. So 3e-31 is correct.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in terms of ħ, μ, R, and ω, but since numerical values are given, we need to compute it.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, but with one sig fig, 3e-31 kg·m/s. However, looking back, the given value for R is 2 angstroms, which is one sig fig, and ω is 4e14 rad/s, also one sig fig. Mx is 20 amu (two sig figs), My is 2 amu (one). The calculation of μ involves multiplication and division: (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818... which is two sig figs divided by two sig figs (since 20+2=22, which is two sig figs?), wait, no. Wait, 20 amu has two sig figs, 2 amu has one. When adding 20 + 2 = 22, the precision is to the ones place, so 22 has two sig figs. Then μ = (20*2)/22, which is 40/22 ≈ 1.818... which has two sig figs because 20 (two) * 2 (one) = 40 (two sig figs), divided by 22 (two sig figs) gives two sig figs. Therefore, μ is two sig figs. Then I = μR², R is one sig fig, so R² is one sig fig. Therefore, I has two sig figs * one sig fig = one sig fig. Then ħ is a known constant, so we take its full precision. Then ħ²/I would have one sig fig. Then divided by c (known constant), so the final result has one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the exact calculation gives 3.07e-31, which is 3.1e-31 when rounded to two sig figs, but since we're limited to one, it's 3e-31.

However, in some contexts, constants like ħ and c are considered exact, so the sig figs are determined by the given values. Since R and ω have one sig fig, the final answer should have one. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But to confirm, let's recompute with R = 2e-10 m (one sig fig), ω = 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig), Mx = 20 amu (two sig figs), My = 2 amu (one sig fig).

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.8 amu (rounding to two sig figs from 1.818... because 20 has two, 2 has one, so 40/22 is two sig figs?)

Wait, when multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least. 20*2 = 40 (two sig figs from 20, one from 2 → one sig fig, but 40 is ambiguous; written as 4e1, which is one sig fig). Wait, no. If you have 20 (two sig figs) * 2 (one sig fig), the product is 40, which has one sig fig because the least is one. But 20 is two, 2 is one, so the product is 40 with one sig fig. Then divided by 22 (two sig figs from 20+2=22), so 40 (one sig fig) / 22 (two sig figs) = 1.8 (two sig figs? Wait, no. When dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least. Here, 40 (one sig fig) divided by 22 (two sig figs) → one sig fig. So μ ≈ 2 amu (one sig fig). Wait, this is conflicting with previous calculation.

This is a bit ambiguous. Let's clarify:

- Mx = 20 amu: trailing zero without decimal is ambiguous, but in scientific notation, 2e1 amu would be one sig fig, but 20 amu is often considered two sig figs.

- My = 2 amu: one sig fig.

When calculating μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My):

Mx + My = 20 + 2 = 22 amu. If Mx is two sig figs and My is one, the sum is 22 amu, which has two sig figs because the last significant figure is in the ones place (the decimal point isn't shown, but 20 is precise to the ones place, and 2 is precise to the ones place, so their sum is 22, precise to the ones place, hence two sig figs.

Then Mx * My = 20 * 2 = 40 amu². Here, 20 has two sig figs, 2 has one, so the product has one sig fig.

Then μ = 40 amu² / 22 amu = 1.818... amu. The numerator has one sig fig, denominator two. When dividing, the result has the least number of sig figs, which is one. Therefore, μ ≈ 2 amu (one sig fig).

But this is a problem because μ is actually 1.818... amu, but with one sig fig, it's 2 amu. However, this seems contradictory because if Mx is two sig figs, the calculation might retain more digits. This is a common ambiguity in sig fig rules when dealing with trailing zeros.

To avoid confusion, perhaps the problem expects us to treat all given values as exact except for the number of decimal places implied. But since the problem gives Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, ω=4e14 rad/s, it's safer to assume that the minimal sig figs are one (from My, R, ω), so the answer should have one sig fig.

Therefore, the momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But given that in the calculation we arrived at approximately 3.07e-31, which is closer to 3.1e-31, but with one sig fig, it's 3e-31.

However, in many textbooks and exams, trailing zeros in numbers like 20 amu are considered significant if specified. For example, 20. amu would be two sig figs, but 20 amu could be ambiguous. If we take Mx as two sig figs and the rest as one, then μ would have two sig figs, I would have two sig figs (since R is one, R² is one, μ is two: I = μ*R², so two * one = one sig fig. Wait, no:

Wait, μ is (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. If Mx is two sig figs, My is one, then the numerator 40 has one sig fig (since 20*2: 20 is two, 2 is one → product is one), denominator 22 is two sig figs. So 40 (one) / 22 (two) = 1.8 (two sig figs? No, because the numerator has one, denominator two: the result has one sig fig). Therefore, μ ≈ 2 amu (one sig fig). Then I = μR² = 2 amu * (2 angstroms)^2. 2 amu is one sig fig, 2 angstroms is one sig fig, so I = 2 * 4 = 8 amu·angstrom² (one sig fig). Converting to kg·m²:

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg

1 angstrom = 1e-10 m

So I = 8 amu·angstrom² * (1.6605e-27 kg/amu) * (1e-10 m/angstrom)^2 = 8 * 1.6605e-27 * 1e-20 = 1.3284e-46 kg·m² (still one sig fig, so 1e-46 kg·m²)

Then ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1e-46 ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1e-46 = 1.112e-22 J (one sig fig: 1e-22 J)

Then p = 1e-22 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s (one sig fig)

So this approach also gives 3e-31 kg·m/s with one sig fig.

Therefore, despite the detailed calculation, considering the sig figs strictly, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the problem might not care about sig figs and just want the numerical value calculated precisely. In that case, it's approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

However, given the options, I think the expected answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s, but to be precise, let's write it as 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check once more with exact numbers:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818181818... amu

Convert to kg: 1.818181818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.019e-27 kg

I = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²

ΔE = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is the precise calculation. Depending on the problem's expectation, this could be written as 3.1e-31 (two sig figs) or 3e-31 (one sig fig). Given the inputs have a mix of one and two sig figs, but the answer is likely expected to be a numerical value without considering sig figs, so 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

But to match the given data's precision, which includes values with one sig fig (My, R, ω), the answer should have one sig fig: 3e-31 kg·m/s.

However, in many educational settings, trailing zeros in numbers like 20 amu are considered significant, so Mx has two, My has one, R has one, ω has one. The reduced mass μ would then have two sig figs (from Mx) in the numerator and denominator, leading to two sig figs. Then I would have two sig figs from μ and one from R², resulting in one sig fig. Then ΔE and p would have one sig fig. So the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

Given the ambiguity, but to adhere strictly to sig fig rules as per the given data, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule (X-Y) would absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given parameters are the masses of the atoms (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s). Hmm, let's start by recalling what the fundamental state and the next state would be in the rotation-vibration model.

First, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think means both the vibrational and rotational ground states. The next lowest energy state could involve either a vibrational excitation, a rotational excitation, or both. But since the question mentions the "next state with the lowest possible energy," I need to compare the energy differences for vibrational and rotational transitions to see which is smaller. Because rotational energy levels are typically closer together than vibrational ones, maybe the next state is a rotational excitation. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both, but the fundamental state usually refers to the vibrational ground state. So maybe the next state would be a combination of a vibrational and rotational transition? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

In the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Evib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2,...), and the rotational energy levels are Erot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number (J=0,1,2,...) and I is the moment of inertia. The total energy is then E = Evib + Erot.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that would be v=0 and J=0. The next lowest energy state could be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational excitation). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let's calculate both energy differences. First, the vibrational energy difference: ΔEvib = Evib(v=1) - Evib(v=0) = ħω. The rotational energy difference for the first rotational excitation: ΔErot = Erot(J=1) - Erot(J=0) = ħ²/(2I)*(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/(I).

So we need to compare ħω and ħ²/(I). Let's compute these values.

First, compute the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The masses are given in amu, so we need to convert them to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / 3.6531e-26

First multiply numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0 * 1e-53 = 1.10e-52 kg²

Then divide by 3.6531e-26 kg: 1.10e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

So μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

Then, the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Now compute ΔErot = ħ² / I

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Then ΔErot = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Now compute ΔEvib = ħω

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s

So ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J

Comparing ΔEvib ≈ 4.218e-20 J and ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J, the rotational energy difference is much smaller. Therefore, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental would be the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Wait, but in some models, vibrational and rotational transitions have different selection rules. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when considering the vibration-rotation interaction, there can be simultaneous changes in v and J. But in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), if the molecule absorbs a photon, the transition would typically follow the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transition (Δv = ±1) would require a photon with energy ħω, but also, during vibrational transitions, the rotational state can change by ΔJ = ±1. So, when the molecule undergoes a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, it can also change its rotational state from J to J±1. However, if the molecule is initially in v=0, J=0, then the allowed transitions would be to v=1, J=1 (since ΔJ=+1) or v=1, J=-1, but J can't be negative, so only J=1. Therefore, the energy difference would be Evib(v=1) + Erot(J=1) - Evib(v=0) - Erot(J=0) = ħω + (ħ²/(2I))(1*2) = ħω + ħ²/I. But wait, the pure rotational transition (ΔJ=+1, Δv=0) would have energy ħ²/(2I)(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/I. But the vibrational transition with rotational excitation would have energy ħω + ħ²/(2I)(2). So which is lower? The pure rotational transition (ΔE= ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J) or the vibrational transition with rotational (ΔE= ħω + ħ²/(I) ≈ 4.218e-20 + 9.24e-23 ≈ 4.227e-20 J). The pure rotational transition is much lower in energy. Therefore, the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon needs to have energy equal to ΔErot = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J. Then, the momentum of the photon is p = E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. Therefore, p = ΔErot / c. Let's compute that.

But wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible states are either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0) or (v=1, J=1). The energy of (v=0, J=1) is Erot = ħ²/(2I)(1*2) = ħ²/I. The energy of (v=1, J=0) is Evib = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω. The energy of (v=1, J=1) is Evib + Erot = ħω + ħ²/I. So the energy differences from the ground state (0,0) are:

ΔE1 = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J (for J=1, v=0)

ΔE2 = ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J (for v=1, J=0)

ΔE3 = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ 4.218e-20 + 9.24e-23 ≈ 4.227e-20 J (for v=1, J=1)

So the smallest energy difference is ΔE1, so the next lowe

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule (X-Y) would absorb when transitioning from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The parameters provided include the masses of the atoms (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s). Let me consider what the fundamental state and next state would be in the rotation-vibration model.

In the fundamental state, both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum. The next lowest energy state could involve either a vibrational excitation, a rotational excitation, or a combination. Since the question asks for the "next state with the lowest possible energy," I need to compare the energy differences to determine which transition requires less energy.

For diatomic molecules, the energy levels combine vibrational and rotational energies. Vibrational energy levels follow Evib = (v + 1/2)ħω where v is the vibrational quantum number, while rotational energy levels follow Erot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1) where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia. The total energy is the sum: E = Evib + Erot.

Starting from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the possible transitions are to (v=1, J=0), (v=0, J=1), or (v=1, J=1). Let me calculate the energy differences for each case.

First, I'll calculate the moment of inertia I. For a diatomic molecule, I = μR² where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass is μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Converting the masses to kg:
Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg
My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

The denominator is 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg
The numerator is 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = approximately 11.0 * 1e-53 = 1.10e-52 kg²

Therefore, μ = 1.10e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

With the bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m, the moment of inertia is:
I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)² = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Now I can calculate the energy differences:
- For rotational transition (v=0, J=1): ΔErot = ħ²/I
  With ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s, ħ² ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²
  ΔErot = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

- For vibrational transition (v=1, J=0): ΔEvib = ħω
  With ω = 4e14 rad/s
  ΔEvib = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J

- For combined transition (v=1, J=1): ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ 4.218e-20 + 9.24e-23 ≈ 4.227e-20 J

Comparing these energy differences, the rotational transition energy (9.24e-23 J) is much smaller than the vibrational transition energy (4.218e-20 J). Therefore, the next lowest energy state would be the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1).

The photon needed for this transition must have energy equal to ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J. The momentum of this photon would be p = E/c, since for photons E = pc.

# OpenAI completion

I need to determine the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule (X-Y) as it transitions from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given values are the masses of the molecules (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s). I should start by clarifying what the fundamental state and the next state are in the rotation-vibration framework.

Initially, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which implies the lowest vibrational and rotational states. The next lowest energy state could involve a vibrational or rotational excitation, or both. Since the question points to "the next state with the lowest possible energy," I need to compare the energy differences between vibrational and rotational transitions. Typically, rotational energy levels are much closer than vibrational ones, suggesting the next state might be a rotational excitation. However, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both types but generally imply the vibrational ground state for the fundamental state. It's possible the next state involves both vibrational and rotational changes.

In the quantum model for diatomic molecules, energy levels combine vibrational and rotational components. The vibrational energy is Evib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2,...), and rotational energy is Erot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1), with J as the rotational quantum number (J=0,1,2,...). So, E = Evib + Erot.

For the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next possible state can be either v=1, J=0 (purely vibrational) or v=0, J=1 (purely rotational). Which has a smaller energy difference?

Let's calculate these differences. First, vibrational energy: ΔEvib = Evib(v=1) - Evib(v=0) = ħω. For rotational excitation: ΔErot = Erot(J=1) - Erot(J=0) = ħ²/I.

We should compare ħω and ħ²/I. Let's calculate.

First, determine the moment of inertia I, I = μR², with μ as the reduced mass. μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Convert the atomic masses to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

Mx = 20 amu = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.6531e-26 kg) ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So, I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Now, calculate ΔErot = ħ² / I

ħ, the reduced Planck's constant, is ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ² ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Calculate ΔEvib = ħω

ω = 4e14 rad/s

ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J

Comparing ΔEvib ≈ 4.218e-20 J and ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J indicates that rotational energy difference is significantly smaller. Thus, the next lowest state is likely the first rotationally excited state (v=0, J=1). But in some cases, vibrational and rotational transitions follow different rules, often allowing simultaneous changes in v and J. From v=0, J=0, changes typically select J=1. Therefore, the energy change will be Evib(v=1) + Erot(J=1) - Evib(v=0) - Erot(J=0) = ħω + ħ²/I. However, a pure rotational transition ΔE = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J seems to be lower. Therefore, the next lowest state is the first rotational state (v=0, J=1), requiring photon energy equal to ΔErot = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J. The momentum of the photon is p = E/c, where E = pc. So, p = ΔErot / c.

Reconsidering: For fundamental state (v=0, J=0), possible states are (v=0, J=1), (v=1, J=0), or (v=1, J=1). Differences are:

ΔE1 = ħ²/I ≈ 9.24e-23 J (for J=1, v=0)

ΔE2 = ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J (for v=1, J=0)

ΔE3 = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ 4.227e-20 J (for v=1, J=1)

The smallest difference, ΔE1, indicates that (v=0, J=1) is the next lower energy state.

Therefore, the photon must have energy ΔE1. Therefore, the momentum p = ΔE1 / c.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when a vibrational transition occurs, the rotational quantum number can also change by ΔJ = ±1. So, when the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), and it absorbs a photon, it can go to (v=1, J=1) with ΔJ=+1 or (v=1, J=-1), but J can\'t be negative, so only (v=1, J=1). Alternatively, if the transition is purely rotational, then from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). But does a purely rotational transition require a photon? The energy for that is much smaller. However, in reality, rotational and vibrational transitions are in different parts of the spectrum. Rotational transitions are in microwave or far-infrared, while vibrational are in infrared. But in the context of the problem, maybe we are to consider that the molecule can undergo either, and the next lowest energy is rotational. But the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy", so the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. Since rotational is smaller, that\'s the one. Therefore, the answer should be the momentum corresponding to ΔErot.\n\nBut let me check if the problem is referring to vibrational or rotational. Wait, the problem says "the molecule is in its fundamental state". The fundamental state in vibration is v=0, but rotational states are also quantized. So the ground state is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be (v=0, J=1) with energy difference ħ²/(2I)(2) = ħ²/I. So the energy of the photon must be that. Then, the momentum p = E/c = (ħ²/I)/c.\n\nBut let\'s compute that. Let\'s plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, compute ħ²/I:\n\nWe already calculated ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J.\n\nSpeed of light c ≈ 3e8 m/s.\n\nTherefore, p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, compute I:\n\nI = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²\n\nThen, E_rot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1). For J=1, E_rot = ħ²/(2I)*2 = ħ²/I.\n\nSo ΔE_rot = ħ²/I.\n\nCompute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s²\n\nThen, ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J, which matches the previous calculation.\n\nThen, p = E / c = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let\'s check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition in the vibrational mode, but the next state would be v=1. But since the energy for vibrational is higher, but the question says "lowest possible energy", which would be rotational. However, in some contexts, the fundamental vibrational state is considered, and transitions are vibrational. But the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, so it\'s a combination. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the combined vibration-rotation transition. But in that case, the energy would be ħω ± ħ²/I, but since the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), the transition to (v=1, J=1) would require energy ħω + ħ²/I. But that\'s higher than the pure rotational transition. So the lowest energy transition is pure rotational. But in reality, pure rotational transitions have lower energy than vibrational. So the answer should be the rotational transition.\n\nBut wait, another thought: in the rotation-vibration model, the vibrational energy is much larger than rotational. So the spacing between vibrational levels is bigger. Therefore, the next lowest energy state would actually be a rotational excitation within the same vibrational state. Therefore, the energy required is just the rotational energy difference. Therefore, the photon\'s momentum is p = ħ²/(I c).\n\nBut let me check units:\n\nħ has units of J·s\n\nI has units of kg·m²\n\nSo ħ²/I has units of (J²·s²)/(kg·m²) = (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s² = J. So that\'s correct. Then, dividing by c (m/s) gives J/(m/s) = (kg·m²/s²)/(m/s) = kg·m/s, which is momentum. So the units check out.\n\nTherefore, the momentum is p = ħ²/(I c). Plugging in the numbers:\n\np = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst compute denominator: 1.204e-46 * 3e8 = 3.612e-38 kg·m³/s\n\nThen, numerator: approx 1.112e-68 J²s²\n\nWait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J·s = kg·m²/s. Therefore, ħ² is (J·s)^2 = kg²·m^4/s². Then, ħ² / (I * c) is (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) ) = (kg·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = m/s. Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, maybe I messed up the units.\n\nWait, let\'s do it step by step.\n\nħ has units of J·s.\n\nI has units of kg·m².\n\nc has units of m/s.\n\nSo ħ² / (I * c) has units of (J²·s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) )\n\nBut J = kg·m²/s², so J² = kg²·m^4/s^4.\n\nTherefore, ħ² / (I * c) has units:\n\n(kg²·m^4/s^4 * s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) ) = (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = (kg·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = m/s.\n\nWait, that\'s velocity? But we\'re expecting momentum, which is kg·m/s. Hmm, so there must be a mistake in the unit analysis. Let me check again.\n\nWait, p = E / c, and E is in Joules (kg·m²/s²). So p = (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s, which is correct. So if E is ħ² / I, then p = (ħ² / I ) / c. So the units would be (kg²·m^4/s² / kg·m²) / (m/s) ) = (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s. Yes, that works. So the previous unit analysis was wrong because I considered ħ² as (J·s)^2, but actually, ħ has units of J·s, so ħ² is J²·s². Then, ħ² / I is (J²·s²) / (kg·m²). But J is kg·m²/s², so J² is kg²·m^4/s^4. Therefore, ħ² / I is (kg²·m^4/s^4 * s²) / kg·m² = kg·m²/s², which is J. Then, dividing by c (m/s) gives kg·m/s. So the units are correct.\n\nTherefore, the momentum is 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute ħ² / I:\n\n(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²s²\n\nI = 1.204e-46 kg·m²\n\nSo 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 = 1.112 / 1.204 * 1e-22 ≈ 0.924 * 1e-22 = 9.24e-23 J\n\nThen, divide by c = 3e8 m/s:\n\n9.24e-23 / 3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg·m/s\n\nSo the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. The angular momentum of the photon is related to its momentum. But in transitions, the angular momentum of the photon causes the change in rotational state. Photons have spin 1, so they can change the angular momentum by ±1ħ, which matches the selection rule ΔJ = ±1. So that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, the momentum of the photon can be calculated using p = ħk, where k is the wave number. But since the energy of the photon is E = ħω_photon = pc, so p = E/c. Which is the same as before. So both methods should give the same result. Let\'s check.\n\nIf we use p = ħk, and k = 2π/λ. But we also have E = ħω_photon = ħc k, so E = ħc k => k = E/(ħc). Then p = ħk = ħ*(E/(ħc)) = E/c, same as before. So either way, p = E/c.\n\nTherefore, the momentum is indeed 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check if the question is asking for the magnitude of the momentum vector, which is a scalar, so yes, just the absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let\'s express it in terms of the given variables symbolically first.\n\nSymbolically, the momentum p = ΔE / c = (ħ² / I) / c = ħ² / (I c). Plugging in I = μR², so p = ħ² / (μ R² c).\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in terms of the given variables:\n\nμ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) * amu_to_kg\n\nBut since the problem gives Mx and My in amu, but we converted to kg, but maybe we can write the formula in terms of the given quantities.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is expected to be numerical. Let me confirm the calculations once again.\n\nCompute μ:\n\nMx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n\nConvert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg, which matches our previous result.\n\nI = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J\n\np = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s\n\nSo approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let\'s see if the problem expects the answer in terms of ħ, μ, R, and ω, or just the numerical value. The problem states to put the final answer in a box, and the given parameters are Mx, My, R, and ω. Wait, but in our calculation, ω wasn\'t used because the transition was purely rotational. However, if the next state was vibrational, we would have used ω. But since we determined that the rotational transition is lower energy, ω is not directly involved in the momentum calculation here. But the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model. Maybe there\'s a different approach?\n\nWait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant is affected by the vibrational state, but since the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), maybe the rotational constant is B0 = ħ/(4πμR²) or something like that. Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as ħ/(4πI), right? So B = ħ/(4πI), and the energy levels are E_rot = B J(J+1). But in terms of wavenumbers, but in energy it\'s E_rot = hc B J(J+1). Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the energy levels for the rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is ΔE = (ħ² / (2I))(1*2 - 0) = ħ² / I, which is what we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference is indeed ħ² / I, leading to the momentum p = ħ² / (I c).\n\nTherefore, the numerical calculation seems correct. So the answer is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me write that in scientific notation with two significant figures, since the given values have one or two significant figures. The given values are Mx=20 amu (two sig figs), My=2 amu (one sig fig), R=2 angstroms (one sig fig), ω=4e14 rad/s (one sig fig). So the least number of sig figs is one, but maybe the answer should have one sig fig. However, in the calculation, we used 20 amu, 2 amu, 2 angstroms, and 4e14 rad/s. The bond length and masses are given with one or two sig figs. The angular frequency is given with one sig fig. However, in the calculation of μ, we had 20 and 2, which are two and one sig figs, so μ would have one sig fig. Then I = μR², which would be one sig fig * one sig fig squared, so one sig fig. Then ħ is a known constant, so we can consider it exact. Then ΔE_rot would have one sig fig, leading to p with one sig fig. So maybe the answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the exact calculation gave 3.08e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we take one sig fig, it\'s 3e-31. But the problem didn\'t specify, but given the inputs, perhaps two sig figs is acceptable. Let\'s check:\n\nMx=20 amu (two sig figs)\n\nMy=2 amu (one sig fig)\n\nR=2 angstroms (one sig fig)\n\nω=4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)\n\nWhen multiplying or dividing, the number of sig figs is the smallest number of sig figs in the inputs. Here, in the calculation of μ, we have 20 * 2 / (20 + 2). The numbers 20 and 2 have two and one sig figs. The sum 20 + 2 = 22, which has two sig figs. Then μ = (20*2)/22 = 40/22 ≈ 1.818... amu. Since 20 has two, 2 has one, the result should have one sig fig. So μ ≈ 2 amu (but actually, 1.818 is approximately 1.8, which is two sig figs). Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the problem expects two sig figs. Alternatively, since the given R is one sig fig, which is used in I = μR², so I would have one sig fig. Then, ħ²/I would have one sig fig, leading to p with one sig fig. So 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut the exact calculation is 3.08e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we take two sig figs, it\'s 3.1e-31. But given the inputs have a mix of one and two sig figs, it\'s safer to go with one sig fig. However, in most cases, unless specified, constants like ħ and c are considered exact, so the sig figs are determined by the given parameters. Since R and My have one sig fig, the final answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check with the exact calculation:\n\nμ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu\n\nConvert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg\n\nI = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nΔE_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J\n\np = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s\n\nSo approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. If we take two sig figs, that\'s 3.1e-31. If one sig fig, 3e-31. Given that R and My are given with one sig fig, but Mx is two, and ω is one. It\'s a bit of a judgment call, but in academic settings, sometimes they expect you to carry through the sig figs of the given values. Since the bond length and My are one sig fig, which are multiplied/divided, leading to one sig fig. So 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s see:\n\nIf R is 2 angstroms (1 sig fig), then R² is 4e-20 m² (1 sig fig)\n\nμ is approx 1.8 amu (two sig figs from 20/22, but 2 amu is one sig fig). Hmm, this is confusing. When multiplying 20 (two sig figs) and 2 (one sig fig), the result should have one sig fig. So μ is 40/22 ≈ 1.8 amu (two sig figs?), but since 2 has one sig fig, maybe μ is 2 amu (one sig fig). But this is ambiguous. In reality, 20 / 22 is 0.909, so 20*2 /22 = 1.818... So if 20 is two sig figs and 2 is one, then the least is one, so μ is 2 amu (one sig fig). Then converting to kg: 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg (but 2 amu is one sig fig, so 3e-27 kg). Then I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m² (one sig fig). Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J (one sig fig). Then p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s (one sig fig). So in this case, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut if we keep more sig figs during the calculation, as done earlier, it\'s approximately 3.1e-31. However, given the problem\'s data, it\'s safer to go with one significant figure. But maybe the problem expects two, considering Mx is 20 (two sig figs). Let\'s see:\n\nIf we take Mx as two sig figs, My as one, R as one, ω as one.\n\nIn μ calculation: 20*2/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 (two sig figs from 20, one from 2: the rule is that in multiplication/division, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise number. Here, 20 has two, 2 has one, so the result should have one. But 40/22 is 1.818..., which with one sig fig is 2. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, maybe intermediate steps can keep more digits, and the final answer is rounded to the least number of sig figs. So if we keep μ as 1.818 amu (three sig figs) for calculation purposes, then convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg (three sig figs). Then I = 3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m² (three sig figs). Then ΔE_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J (three sig figs). Then p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Now, considering the given data, R is 2 angstroms (one sig fig), so I is 1.208e-46 ≈ 1.2e-46 (two sig figs). Then ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 (two sig figs), p = 3.1e-31 (two sig figs). So maybe the answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s with two sig figs. But the problem may accept either. Given that, I think the most accurate answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me check once more. If all given values are considered:\n\n- Mx = 20 amu (two sig figs)\n\n- My = 2 amu (one sig fig)\n\n- R = 2 angstroms (one sig fig)\n\n- ω = 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)\n\nWhen calculating μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Here, 20 has two, 2 has one. In multiplication/division, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is one. But 40/22 is approximately 1.818, which with one sig fig is 2. However, this seems like an overestimation. Alternatively, since 20 is two sig figs and 2 is one, the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, μ ≈ 2 amu. Then converting to kg: 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg (but 2 is one sig fig, so 3e-27 kg). Then I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m² (one sig fig). Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J (one sig fig). Then p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.1e-31 kg·m/s (but with one sig fig, it\'s 3e-31). This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to not worry about sig figs and just compute with the given values as exact. In that case, the answer is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1e-31.\n\nGiven that in academic problems, sometimes the sig figs are not strictly enforced unless specified, and given that the computation steps lead to about 3.1e-31, I will go with two sig figs and write 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut to cross-verify, let\'s compute using another approach. The energy of the photon is ΔE = ħ² / I. The momentum p = ΔE / c = ħ² / (I c). Let\'s plug in the numbers symbolically:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nI = μR² = ((20*2)/(20+2)) amu * (2 angstroms)^2\n\nFirst, convert amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg\n\nSo μ = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg\n\nR = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m\n\nI = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²\n\nThen p = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46 * 3e8) ≈ 1.112e-68 / 3.624e-38 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s\n\nSo approximately 3.07e-31, which rounds to 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the photon should be approximately 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe momentum of the photon should be \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\text{kg·m/s}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445007, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6423, prompt_tokens=2145, total_tokens=8568, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X-Y) to transition from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we need to compare the energy differences for vibrational and rotational transitions. 

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   - Reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
     \]
   - Convert \(\mu\) to kg:
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}
     \]
   - Moment of inertia \(I\):
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Difference**:
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2} \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   - The momentum \(p\) of the photon is given by \(p = \frac{\Delta E}{c}\):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}
     \]

After considering significant figures and the given parameters, the momentum of the photon is:

\[
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg·m/s}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

est energy state is (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon must have energy ΔE1. Therefore, the momentum p = ΔE1 / c.

But wait, let me confirm the selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when a vibrational transition occurs, the rotational quantum number can also change by ΔJ = ±1. So, when the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), and it absorbs a photon, it can go to (v=1, J=1) with ΔJ=+1 or (v=1, J=-1), but J can't be negative, so only (v=1, J=1). Alternatively, if the transition is purely rotational, then from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). But does a purely rotational transition require a photon? The energy for that is much smaller. However, in reality, rotational and vibrational transitions are in different parts of the spectrum. Rotational transitions are in microwave or far-infrared, while vibrational are in infrared. But in the context of the problem, maybe we are to consider that the molecule can undergo either, and the next lowest energy is rotational. But the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy", so the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. Since rotational is smaller, that's the one. Therefore, the answer should be the momentum corresponding to ΔErot.

But let me check if the problem is referring to vibrational or rotational. Wait, the problem says "the molecule is in its fundamental state". The fundamental state in vibration is v=0, but rotational states are also quantized. So the ground state is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be (v=0, J=1) with energy difference ħ²/(2I)(2) = ħ²/I. So the energy of the photon must be that. Then, the momentum p = E/c = (ħ²/I)/c.

But let's compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

First, compute ħ²/I:

We already calculated ΔErot ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

Speed of light c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

Therefore, p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me verify the calculation step by step.

First, compute I:

I = μR² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Then, E_rot = ħ²/(2I) * J(J+1). For J=1, E_rot = ħ²/(2I)*2 = ħ²/I.

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/I.

Compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s²

Then, ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J, which matches the previous calculation.

Then, p = E / c = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition in the vibrational mode, but the next state would be v=1. But since the energy for vibrational is higher, but the question says "lowest possible energy", which would be rotational. However, in some contexts, the fundamental vibrational state is considered, and transitions are vibrational. But the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, so it's a combination. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the combined vibration-rotation transition. But in that case, the energy would be ħω ± ħ²/I, but since the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), the transition to (v=1, J=1) would require energy ħω + ħ²/I. But that's higher than the pure rotational transition. So the lowest energy transition is pure rotational. But in reality, pure rotational transitions have lower energy than vibrational. So the answer should be the rotational transition.

But wait, another thought: in the rotation-vibration model, the vibrational energy is much larger than rotational. So the spacing between vibrational levels is bigger. Therefore, the next lowest energy state would actually be a rotational excitation within the same vibrational state. Therefore, the energy required is just the rotational energy difference. Therefore, the photon's momentum is p = ħ²/(I c).

But let me check units:

ħ has units of J·s

I has units of kg·m²

So ħ²/I has units of (J²·s²)/(kg·m²) = (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m²) ) = kg·m²/s² = J. So that's correct. Then, dividing by c (m/s) gives J/(m/s) = (kg·m²/s²)/(m/s) = kg·m/s, which is momentum. So the units check out.

Therefore, the momentum is p = ħ²/(I c). Plugging in the numbers:

p = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s)

First compute denominator: 1.204e-46 * 3e8 = 3.612e-38 kg·m³/s

Then, numerator: approx 1.112e-68 J²s²

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J·s = kg·m²/s. Therefore, ħ² is (J·s)^2 = kg²·m^4/s². Then, ħ² / (I * c) is (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) ) = (kg·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = m/s. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I messed up the units.

Wait, let's do it step by step.

ħ has units of J·s.

I has units of kg·m².

c has units of m/s.

So ħ² / (I * c) has units of (J²·s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) )

But J = kg·m²/s², so J² = kg²·m^4/s^4.

Therefore, ħ² / (I * c) has units:

(kg²·m^4/s^4 * s²) / (kg·m² * m/s) ) = (kg²·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = (kg·m^4/s²) / (kg·m³/s) ) = m/s.

Wait, that's velocity? But we're expecting momentum, which is kg·m/s. Hmm, so there must be a mistake in the unit analysis. Let me check again.

Wait, p = E / c, and E is in Joules (kg·m²/s²). So p = (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s, which is correct. So if E is ħ² / I, then p = (ħ² / I ) / c. So the units would be (kg²·m^4/s² / kg·m²) / (m/s) ) = (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s. Yes, that works. So the previous unit analysis was wrong because I considered ħ² as (J·s)^2, but actually, ħ has units of J·s, so ħ² is J²·s². Then, ħ² / I is (J²·s²) / (kg·m²). But J is kg·m²/s², so J² is kg²·m^4/s^4. Therefore, ħ² / I is (kg²·m^4/s^4 * s²) / kg·m² = kg·m²/s², which is J. Then, dividing by c (m/s) gives kg·m/s. So the units are correct.

Therefore, the momentum is 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me compute it more accurately.

First, compute ħ² / I:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²s²

I = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

So 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 = 1.112 / 1.204 * 1e-22 ≈ 0.924 * 1e-22 = 9.24e-23 J

Then, divide by c = 3e8 m/s:

9.24e-23 / 3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

So the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if there's another approach. The angular momentum of the photon is related to its momentum. But in transitions, the angular momentum of the photon causes the change in rotational state. Photons have spin 1, so they can change the angular momentum by ±1ħ, which matches the selection rule ΔJ = ±1. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, the momentum of the photon can be calculated using p = ħk, where k is the wave number. But since the energy of the photon is E = ħω_photon = pc, so p = E/c. Which is the same as before. So both methods should give the same result. Let's check.

If we use p = ħk, and k = 2π/λ. But we also have E = ħω_photon = ħc k, so E = ħc k => k = E/(ħc). Then p = ħk = ħ*(E/(ħc)) = E/c, same as before. So either way, p = E/c.

Therefore, the momentum is indeed 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if the question is asking for the magnitude of the momentum vector, which is a scalar, so yes, just the absolute value.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let's express it in terms of the given variables symbolically first.

Symbolically, the momentum p = ΔE / c = (ħ² / I) / c = ħ² / (I c). Plugging in I = μR², so p = ħ² / (μ R² c).

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of the given variables:

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) * amu_to_kg

But since the problem gives Mx and My in amu, but we converted to kg, but maybe we can write the formula in terms of the given quantities.

But perhaps the answer is expected to be numerical. Let me confirm the calculations once again.

Compute μ:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg, which matches our previous result.

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's see if the problem expects the answer in terms of ħ, μ, R, and ω, or just the numerical value. The problem states to put the final answer in a box, and the given parameters are Mx, My, R, and ω. Wait, but in our calculation, ω wasn't used because the transition was purely rotational. However, if the next state was vibrational, we would have used ω. But since we determined that the rotational transition is lower energy, ω is not directly involved in the momentum calculation here. But the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model. Maybe there's a different approach?

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant is affected by the vibrational state, but since the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), maybe the rotational constant is B0 = ħ/(4πμR²) or something like that. Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as ħ/(4πI), right? So B = ħ/(4πI), and the energy levels are E_rot = B J(J+1). But in terms of wavenumbers, but in energy it's E_rot = hc B J(J+1). Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.

Alternatively, the energy levels for the rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is ΔE = (ħ² / (2I))(1*2 - 0) = ħ² / I, which is what we calculated.

Therefore, the energy difference is indeed ħ² / I, leading to the momentum p = ħ² / (I c).

Therefore, the numerical calculation seems correct. So the answer is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me write that in scientific notation with two significant figures, since the given values have one or two significant figures. The given values are Mx=20 amu (two sig figs), My=2 amu (one sig fig), R=2 angstroms (one sig fig), ω=4e14 rad/s (one sig fig). So the least number of sig figs is one, but maybe the answer should have one sig fig. However, in the calculation, we used 20 amu, 2 amu, 2 angstroms, and 4e14 rad/s. The bond length and masses are given with one or two sig figs. The angular frequency is given with one sig fig. However, in the calculation of μ, we had 20 and 2, which are two and one sig figs, so μ would have one sig fig. Then I = μR², which would be one sig fig * one sig fig squared, so one sig fig. Then ħ is a known constant, so we can consider it exact. Then ΔE_rot would have one sig fig, leading to p with one sig fig. So maybe the answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the exact calculation gave 3.08e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we take one sig fig, it's 3e-31. But the problem didn't specify, but given the inputs, perhaps two sig figs is acceptable. Let's check:

Mx=20 amu (two sig figs)

My=2 amu (one sig fig)

R=2 angstroms (one sig fig)

ω=4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)

When multiplying or dividing, the number of sig figs is the smallest number of sig figs in the inputs. Here, in the calculation of μ, we have 20 * 2 / (20 + 2). The numbers 20 and 2 have two and one sig figs. The sum 20 + 2 = 22, which has two sig figs. Then μ = (20*2)/22 = 40/22 ≈ 1.818... amu. Since 20 has two, 2 has one, the result should have one sig fig. So μ ≈ 2 amu (but actually, 1.818 is approximately 1.8, which is two sig figs). Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the problem expects two sig figs. Alternatively, since the given R is one sig fig, which is used in I = μR², so I would have one sig fig. Then, ħ²/I would have one sig fig, leading to p with one sig fig. So 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the exact calculation is 3.08e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. If we take two sig figs, it's 3.1e-31. But given the inputs have a mix of one and two sig figs, it's safer to go with one sig fig. However, in most cases, unless specified, constants like ħ and c are considered exact, so the sig figs are determined by the given parameters. Since R and My have one sig fig, the final answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check with the exact calculation:

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.02e-27 kg

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

ΔE_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. If we take two sig figs, that's 3.1e-31. If one sig fig, 3e-31. Given that R and My are given with one sig fig, but Mx is two, and ω is one. It's a bit of a judgment call, but in academic settings, sometimes they expect you to carry through the sig figs of the given values. Since the bond length and My are one sig fig, which are multiplied/divided, leading to one sig fig. So 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But to confirm, let's see:

If R is 2 angstroms (1 sig fig), then R² is 4e-20 m² (1 sig fig)

μ is approx 1.8 amu (two sig figs from 20/22, but 2 amu is one sig fig). Hmm, this is confusing. When multiplying 20 (two sig figs) and 2 (one sig fig), the result should have one sig fig. So μ is 40/22 ≈ 1.8 amu (two sig figs?), but since 2 has one sig fig, maybe μ is 2 amu (one sig fig). But this is ambiguous. In reality, 20 / 22 is 0.909, so 20*2 /22 = 1.818... So if 20 is two sig figs and 2 is one, then the least is one, so μ is 2 amu (one sig fig). Then converting to kg: 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg (but 2 amu is one sig fig, so 3e-27 kg). Then I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m² (one sig fig). Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J (one sig fig). Then p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s (one sig fig). So in this case, the answer is 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But if we keep more sig figs during the calculation, as done earlier, it's approximately 3.1e-31. However, given the problem's data, it's safer to go with one significant figure. But maybe the problem expects two, considering Mx is 20 (two sig figs). Let's see:

If we take Mx as two sig figs, My as one, R as one, ω as one.

In μ calculation: 20*2/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 (two sig figs from 20, one from 2: the rule is that in multiplication/division, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise number. Here, 20 has two, 2 has one, so the result should have one. But 40/22 is 1.818..., which with one sig fig is 2. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, maybe intermediate steps can keep more digits, and the final answer is rounded to the least number of sig figs. So if we keep μ as 1.818 amu (three sig figs) for calculation purposes, then convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg (three sig figs). Then I = 3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m² (three sig figs). Then ΔE_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J (three sig figs). Then p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Now, considering the given data, R is 2 angstroms (one sig fig), so I is 1.208e-46 ≈ 1.2e-46 (two sig figs). Then ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 (two sig figs), p = 3.1e-31 (two sig figs). So maybe the answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s with two sig figs. But the problem may accept either. Given that, I think the most accurate answer is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check once more. If all given values are considered:

- Mx = 20 amu (two sig figs)

- My = 2 amu (one sig fig)

- R = 2 angstroms (one sig fig)

- ω = 4e14 rad/s (one sig fig)

When calculating μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Here, 20 has two, 2 has one. In multiplication/division, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is one. But 40/22 is approximately 1.818, which with one sig fig is 2. However, this seems like an overestimation. Alternatively, since 20 is two sig figs and 2 is one, the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, μ ≈ 2 amu. Then converting to kg: 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg (but 2 is one sig fig, so 3e-27 kg). Then I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m² (one sig fig). Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J (one sig fig). Then p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.1e-31 kg·m/s (but with one sig fig, it's 3e-31). This is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to not worry about sig figs and just compute with the given values as exact. In that case, the answer is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s, which can be written as 3.1e-31.

Given that in academic problems, sometimes the sig figs are not strictly enforced unless specified, and given that the computation steps lead to about 3.1e-31, I will go with two sig figs and write 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.

But to cross-verify, let's compute using another approach. The energy of the photon is ΔE = ħ² / I. The momentum p = ΔE / c = ħ² / (I c). Let's plug in the numbers symbolically:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = μR² = ((20*2)/(20+2)) amu * (2 angstroms)^2

First, convert amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg

So μ = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

Then p = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46 * 3e8) ≈ 1.112e-68 / 3.624e-38 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.07e-31, which rounds to 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, the momentum of the photon should be approximately 3.1 × 10^-31 kg·m/s.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the photon should be \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg·m/s}}.

So p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nWait, but in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. However, in the rigid rotor model, rotational transitions are considered with fixed bond length. But in the non-rigid rotor model, there\'s a coupling between rotation and vibration. However, the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy" from the fundamental state. If the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0), then the next lowest energy state would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since the vibrational energy spacing is much larger than rotational, the next state would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon\'s energy is the rotational energy difference. But let me check if there\'s a selection rule. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. So, if the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), it can transition to (v=0, J=1) by absorbing a photon with energy corresponding to the rotational transition. Alternatively, it can transition to (v=1, J=0) with a photon of higher energy, but since the question asks for the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the answer. Therefore, the momentum of the photon is p = ΔErot / c. But let me confirm the calculation again.\n\nWait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B is not exactly ħ²/(2I) because the bond is not rigid. However, the problem says "modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)", but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate the rotational energy as Erot = B J(J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). The non-rigidity might introduce a correction, but maybe the problem expects us to use the rigid rotor formula here. Let\'s proceed with that.\n\nSo, the energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is Erot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = 2B. Wait, but B is ħ²/(2I), so Erot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. So that\'s correct. So ΔErot = ħ²/I. Then, as calculated, that\'s 9.24e-23 J. Then, the photon\'s momentum is E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when a molecule undergoes a rotational transition, the photon\'s angular momentum must account for the change in the molecule\'s angular momentum. Photons have spin 1, so they can change the angular momentum by ±1. Therefore, the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. The energy of the photon is then equal to the energy difference between these states. Therefore, the momentum of the photon is p = E/c. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had considered a vibrational transition, the energy would be much higher, but since the question asks for the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the answer. Therefore, the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculations again for any errors.\n\nFirst, reduced mass:\n\nMx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. That\'s correct.\n\nBond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Then, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B (since E_rot = B J(J+1), so from J=0 to J=1, ΔE = B(1*2 - 0) = 2B). Wait, earlier I thought ΔE was ħ²/I, which is 2B. So 2B would be 9.2e-23 J, which matches the previous calculation. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the photon\'s energy is 9.24e-23 J, and momentum p = E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the exponent: 1e-23 divided by 1e8 is 1e-31, so 9.24/3 ≈ 3.08, so 3.08e-31. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had considered a vibrational transition, the energy would be ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.22e-20 J, which is much larger. Therefore, the correct answer is the rotational transition\'s photon momentum, 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if there\'s any other possible transition. For example, in the non-rigid rotor model, there\'s a correction term, but perhaps the problem expects the rigid rotor answer. Alternatively, maybe the question is about vibrational transition. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), then the next possible states are (v=0, J=1) and (v=1, J=0). Since the vibrational energy is much higher, the next state would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the answer should be the rotational transition. So the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both vibration and rotation are excited, but that would require more energy than just a rotational transition. So the lowest possible energy transition is rotational. Therefore, the answer is the momentum corresponding to the rotational energy difference. So the final answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nCalculating μ again:\n\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nI = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.\n\nB = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Then, ΔE = 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J. Correct.\n\nPhoton momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Similarly, 2 amu is one sig fig. R is 2 angstroms, one sig fig. ω is 4e14, one sig fig. So all given data has one significant figure.

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X-Y) to transition from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we compare the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference**:
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) \). For the transition \( J=0 \rightarrow J=1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2} \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}
   \]

Since the rotational energy difference is much smaller than the vibrational energy difference, the transition to the next lowest energy state involves a rotational excitation. The momentum of the absorbed photon is:

\[
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. However, in the rigid rotor model, rotational transitions are considered with fixed bond length. But in the non-rigid rotor model, there's a coupling between rotation and vibration. However, the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy" from the fundamental state. If the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0), then the next lowest energy state would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since the vibrational energy spacing is much larger than rotational, the next state would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon's energy is the rotational energy difference. But let me check if there's a selection rule. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. So, if the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), it can transition to (v=0, J=1) by absorbing a photon with energy corresponding to the rotational transition. Alternatively, it can transition to (v=1, J=0) with a photon of higher energy, but since the question asks for the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the answer. Therefore, the momentum of the photon is p = ΔErot / c. But let me confirm the calculation again.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B is not exactly ħ²/(2I) because the bond is not rigid. However, the problem says "modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)", but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate the rotational energy as Erot = B J(J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). The non-rigidity might introduce a correction, but maybe the problem expects us to use the rigid rotor formula here. Let's proceed with that.

So, the energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is Erot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = 2B. Wait, but B is ħ²/(2I), so Erot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. So that's correct. So ΔErot = ħ²/I. Then, as calculated, that's 9.24e-23 J. Then, the photon's momentum is E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, another thought: when a molecule undergoes a rotational transition, the photon's angular momentum must account for the change in the molecule's angular momentum. Photons have spin 1, so they can change the angular momentum by ±1. Therefore, the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. The energy of the photon is then equal to the energy difference between these states. Therefore, the momentum of the photon is p = E/c. So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, if the problem had considered a vibrational transition, the energy would be much higher, but since the question asks for the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the answer. Therefore, the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculations again for any errors.

First, reduced mass:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. That's correct.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Then, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B (since E_rot = B J(J+1), so from J=0 to J=1, ΔE = B(1*2 - 0) = 2B). Wait, earlier I thought ΔE was ħ²/I, which is 2B. So 2B would be 9.2e-23 J, which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.

Therefore, the photon's energy is 9.24e-23 J, and momentum p = E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the exponent: 1e-23 divided by 1e8 is 1e-31, so 9.24/3 ≈ 3.08, so 3.08e-31. Correct.

Alternatively, if the problem had considered a vibrational transition, the energy would be ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.22e-20 J, which is much larger. Therefore, the correct answer is the rotational transition's photon momentum, 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if there's any other possible transition. For example, in the non-rigid rotor model, there's a correction term, but perhaps the problem expects the rigid rotor answer. Alternatively, maybe the question is about vibrational transition. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), then the next possible states are (v=0, J=1) and (v=1, J=0). Since the vibrational energy is much higher, the next state would be (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the answer should be the rotational transition. So the momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Let me check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both vibration and rotation are excited, but that would require more energy than just a rotational transition. So the lowest possible energy transition is rotational. Therefore, the answer is the momentum corresponding to the rotational energy difference. So the final answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check the exact numbers again.

Calculating μ again:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Then, ΔE = 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So rounding to two significant figures, since the given data has two significant figures (Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, ω=4e14 rad/s). So 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. Alternatively, 3.1e-31, but let me check if the given values have more precision. The angular frequency is given as 4*10^14, which is one significant figure. Hmm, but the masses are 20 and 2, which are one and one, but maybe 20 could be two. If 20 is two sig figs, then 20. amu, but the problem states "20 amu" without a decimal, so maybe one sig fig. Similarly, 2 amu is one sig fig. R is 2 angstroms, one sig fig. ω is 4e14, one sig fig. So all given data has one significant figure. Therefore, the answer should be given to one significant figure: 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the calculation gives 3.08e-31, which is approximately 3.1e-31. But with one sig fig, it's 3e-31. Wait, but maybe the problem expects more precision. Let me check again.

Wait, the given values:

Mx = 20 amu (possibly two sig figs if written as 20. amu, but as written, 20 amu is ambiguous. In many contexts, trailing zeros without a decimal are considered ambiguous, but in scientific notation, 20 could be one or two. Similarly, My=2 amu is one sig fig. R=2 angstroms is one sig fig. ω=4e14 rad/s is one sig fig. So perhaps the answer should be given to one significant figure. Then, 3e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if the calculation gives exactly 3.0e-31. Let's recalculate with exact numbers.

ΔE = ħ² / I. Let's compute this precisely.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

ΔE = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.207e-23 J

Then, p = 9.207e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.069e-31 kg·m/s

So approximately 3.07e-31. If we take one significant figure, that's 3e-31. If two, 3.1e-31. The problem might expect two sig figs, given that some values like Mx=20 could be two. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the answer is 3.1e-31. Alternatively, the problem might want the answer in terms of the given values without considering sig figs. Let me check if the answer is expected in a boxed format with units. The problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So probably, they want the numerical value calculated precisely as per the given numbers, even if they have few sig figs. But let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: sometimes in rotational spectroscopy, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), but here we need to calculate in Joules. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the photon's momentum in terms of the energy. Since E = hc/λ, and p = h/λ, so p = E/c. Therefore, the momentum is indeed E/c. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if the problem might have intended a vibrational transition. Wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), then the next state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The energy difference for vibration is much larger, so the rotational transition is lower energy. Therefore, the correct transition is rotational, and the photon's momentum is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. So I think that's the answer.

But if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), and transitions to v=1, then J can change by ±1. However, the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be either a pure rotational transition (ΔJ=+1, v=0) or a vibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=0 or ±1). Since the rotational energy difference is much smaller, the next state would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon\'s energy must match ΔErot. Then, the photon\'s momentum is p = E/c = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1(1+1) - 0(0+1)) / c. Wait, the rotational energy is Erot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So, ΔErot = (ħ²/(2I)) (1(1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I.

The given values are the masses of the atoms (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s).

1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:
   - The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) state.
   - The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either a vibrational (v=1, J=0) or rotational (v=0, J=1) transition.

2. **Energy Differences**:
   - Vibrational energy difference: \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega\)
   - Rotational energy difference: \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}\)
   - Compare these energy differences to determine the smaller one.

3. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   - Reduced mass \(\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}\)
   - Convert masses to kg: \(M_x = 20 \text{ amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kg}\), \(M_y = 2 \text{ amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}\)
   - \(\mu = \frac{3.321 \times 10^{-26} \times 3.321 \times 10^{-27}}{3.321 \times 10^{-26} + 3.321 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}\)
   - Bond length \(R = 2 \text{ angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}\)
   - Moment of inertia \(I = \mu R^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg·m}^2\)

4. **Energy Calculations**:
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}\)
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}\)

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The rotational energy difference is smaller, so the next state is (v=0, J=1).
   - Photon momentum \(p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}\)

The momentum of the absorbed photon should be \(\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}\).

However, in molecular transitions, rotational and vibrational transitions have different selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. However, when a vibrational transition occurs, there can be a simultaneous change in J (ΔJ = ±1), leading to rovibrational spectra. But if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), and transitions to v=1, then J can change by ±1. However, the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be either a pure rotational transition (ΔJ=+1, v=0) or a vibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=0 or ±1). Since the rotational energy difference is much smaller, the next state would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon's energy must match ΔErot. Then, the photon's momentum is p = E/c = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1(1+1) - 0(0+1)) / c. Wait, the rotational energy is Erot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So, ΔErot = (ħ²/(2I)) (1(1+1) - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I. So, ΔErot = ħ²/I. Therefore, p = ΔErot / c = (ħ²)/(I c). Let me compute that.

First, compute ħ²/(I c):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

I = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

c = 3e8 m/s

So, ħ²/(I c) = (1.112e-68 J²·s²) / (1.204e-46 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s) = (1.112e-68) / (3.612e-38) J·s/(kg·m²·m/s) )

Wait, units: J = kg·m²/s², so J·s = kg·m²/s. Then, denominator is kg·m²·m/s = kg·m³/s. So, the units of the entire expression would be (kg·m²/s² * s) / (kg·m³/s) ) = (kg·m²/s) / (kg·m³/s) ) = 1/m. So, the units would be 1/m, which is the same as momentum (kg·m/s) divided by ħ (J·s). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check again.

Wait, p = E/c. E is in Joules, c in m/s. So, E/c has units (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s, which is momentum. So, correct. So, p = ΔErot / c = (ħ²/(I)) / c.

So, plugging in the numbers:

ΔErot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Then, p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But let me check the calculation again.

First, compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s²

Then, divide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Then, divide by c: 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

So, the photon's momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, another thought: in rotational transitions, the photon's angular momentum must account for the change in rotational state. The photon carries angular momentum of ±ħ, which matches the ΔJ = ±1 selection rule. However, the linear momentum of the photon is related to its energy and direction. But in this case, the problem just asks for the magnitude of the photon's momentum, which is E/c. So, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, if the transition was vibrational, the energy would be much higher. But since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state. Therefore, the answer should be p ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let me check if there's a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, the reduced mass μ: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So, μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. Then, I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². So, that's correct. Then, ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J. Then, p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So, approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check if the rotational energy is indeed ħ²/(2I) * (J(J+1) - J_initial(J_initial +1)). For J=0 to J=1, it's (2 - 0) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I. So, yes, ΔErot = ħ²/I. So, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, if the transition was vibrational, the energy would be ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J, which is much larger. Therefore, the next state is rotational, and the photon's momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. So, the answer is \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since ΔErot is smaller, the next state is (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon's momentum is indeed 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. However, I need to confirm if the selection rules allow such a transition. For pure rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, which is allowed. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. So, a pure rotational transition is allowed, and the photon's energy is ΔErot. Therefore, the answer is correct.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the absorbed photon should be \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}.
