# Original Question

A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.
What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?

(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)

To determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we must account for relativistic effects due to the high velocity (0.2c). Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The time experienced in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is dilated compared to the ejecta's proper time (Δt' = 50 s). The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  
   Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in Galaxy Frame**:  
   The ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is \( v = 0.2c = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The ejecta travels approximately **3,060,000 kilometers** (rounded to three significant figures) in the Galaxy's reference frame.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, special relativity, right? Because they mention inertial frames and high velocity—60,000 km/s is like 20% the speed of light. Wait, speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2c. 

Alright, so the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's rest frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 0.2c. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

So, first, I need to figure out the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, but we need to know how much time that corresponds to in the Galaxy's frame. Then, multiply that time by the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame to get the distance. 

Wait, but velocity is relative. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c towards it, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just subtract like that. If two frames are moving relative to each other at velocity v, then the velocity of one in the other's frame is v. But here, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 0.2c. So that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, is that correct? Because in special relativity, if S is the Galaxy frame and S' is the ejecta frame moving at velocity u relative to S, then in S', the Galaxy center would be moving at -u. But if the speed is 0.2c, then u is 0.2c. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. But wait, that seems like Galilean addition, but actually, in special relativity, if the frames are moving at v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. So maybe in this case, since the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c, then the Galaxy frame sees the ejecta moving at 0.2c. So the relative velocity is 0.2c. 

But wait, that can't be right. Because in special relativity, velocities don't add that way. Wait, but if the ejecta is moving at v in the Galaxy frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -v. But if the speed is non-relativistic, then it's approximately true. But 0.2c is 20% the speed of light, which is not negligible. So maybe we need to use the Lorentz transformation here. 

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So they are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy center at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, or vice versa? Wait, the problem says: "From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it." So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the ejecta. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity u. But according to the relativistic velocity transformation, if in S' (ejecta frame), the Galaxy center is moving at v = -0.2c (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta), then in the Galaxy frame S, the ejecta is moving at u = 0.2c. Wait, but that's the non-relativistic result. But in reality, we need to use the velocity transformation formula. 

Wait, the velocity transformation in special relativity is given by:

If an object has velocity u in frame S, then in frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, the velocity u' is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But in this case, the Galaxy center is at rest in frame S (Galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving at u towards the center. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving at u' = -0.2c. So we can set up the equation:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But here, v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy). So v is the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame, which is u. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

Let me denote:

- S: Galaxy frame (center of Galaxy is at rest)
- S': Ejecta frame (ejecta is at rest)
- In S', the Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at 0.2c.

We need to find the velocity of the ejecta in S (Galaxy frame). 

In S', the velocity of the Galaxy center (which is the rest frame S) is u' = -0.2c (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta). 

The velocity transformation formula from S to S' is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But here, u is the velocity of the Galaxy center in S, which is 0 (since it's at rest in S), and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is for transforming the velocity of an object from S to S'. 

Wait, let's recall: If an object has velocity u in S, then its velocity in S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to S) is u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). 

But in this case, the object is the Galaxy center, which has u = 0 in S. So substituting into the formula:

u' = (0 - v)/(1 - 0) = -v

But we know that in S', the Galaxy center is moving at u' = -0.2c. Therefore:

-v = -0.2c => v = 0.2c

Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame S is v = 0.2c. 

So even with special relativity, the velocity is 0.2c. Because the Galaxy center is at rest in S, and the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards it. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta's speed is 0.2c. 

Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is velocity multiplied by time. But the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. 

Wait, time dilation. The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is 50 seconds. But since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, the time in the Galaxy frame will be longer due to time dilation. 

The time dilation formula is:

Δt = γΔt'

Where Δt' is the proper time (in the moving frame, here the ejecta), and γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

So first, calculate γ for v = 0.2c.

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s (given)

v²/c² = (0.2c)²/c² = 0.04

So γ = 1/√(1 - 0.04) = 1/√0.96 ≈ 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

So Δt = γΔt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds

Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, approximately 51.03 seconds have passed. 

Then, the distance the ejecta travels is:

distance = velocity * time = 0.2c * 51.03 s

But 0.2c is 60,000 km/s, so:

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km

But wait, the problem says to find the distance in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame. So according to this calculation, it's approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check if I did the time dilation correctly. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, the gamma factor is about 1.02, so 50 seconds in ejecta is about 51 seconds in Galaxy. Multiply by 60,000 km/s gives 3.06 million km. 

Alternatively, maybe we need to consider length contraction? Wait, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is just velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. Since in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time elapsed is Δt = γΔt', so distance is v * γΔt'. 

Alternatively, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, the distance covered would be 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's in the ejecta's frame. However, the problem asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. 

But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time elapsed is longer due to time dilation. So the distance should be 0.2c * γ * 50 s. Which is 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

But another way to think about it: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving 3,000,000 km in 50 seconds. But due to length contraction, the distance in the Galaxy frame would be longer. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. If in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, then the distance between the ejecta and the center is contracted in the ejecta's frame. 

So, let's denote L as the distance in the Galaxy frame, and L' as the distance in the ejecta's frame. Then L' = L / γ. 

But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so the distance covered is L' = v * t' = 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Therefore, L = L' * γ = 3,000,000 km * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the distance in the Galaxy frame is approximately 3,061,800 km. 

But let's check the exact calculation. 

First, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). 

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so γ ≈ 1.0206. 

Then, Δt = γ * Δt' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. 

Then, distance = 0.2c * 51.03 s = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Alternatively, using L = L' * γ = 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

So either way, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let's compute it more precisely. 

First, calculate γ:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) 

sqrt(0.96) can be calculated as:

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798

So γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

So γ ≈ 1.020620726

Then, Δt = 50 s * γ ≈ 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

Then, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km

So approximately 3,061,862 km. But the problem might want the answer in some rounded form. However, given that the velocity is given as exactly 60,000 km/s and time as 50 seconds, but considering that gamma is approximately 1.0206, the exact answer would be 50 * 60,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km. But maybe we need to keep more decimals. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the classical calculation, ignoring relativistic effects? But the velocity is 0.2c, which is significant enough that relativistic effects should be considered. The problem also mentions that both frames are inertial, which hints that special relativity should be used. 

But let's check: if we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time in the Galaxy frame is the same as in the ejecta's frame, so distance would be 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But the problem says to consider them as inertial frames, so we should use relativity. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. But let's see if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, using Lorentz transformation for the coordinates. 

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the event of the ejecta being at rest, and the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. After 50 seconds in S', the Galaxy center has moved a distance of x' = -0.2c * 50 s = -3,000,000 km (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta). 

But we need to find the coordinates in the Galaxy frame (S). The Lorentz transformation from S' to S is:

x = γ(x' + vt')

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c²)

Here, v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy), which is 0.2c. 

So, x' = -3e6 km, t' = 50 s. 

First, convert units to consistent ones. Let's use km and seconds, with c = 300,000 km/s. 

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s

γ = 1.020620726

Compute x:

x = γ(x' + v t') = 1.020620726 * (-3,000,000 km + 60,000 km/s * 50 s)

Calculate inside the brackets:

-3,000,000 km + 60,000 * 50 = -3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 0 km

Wait, that can't be. If x' is the position of the Galaxy center in S', which at t' = 50 s is at x' = -3e6 km. Then transforming to S:

x = γ(x' + v t') = γ(-3e6 km + 60,000 km/s * 50 s) = γ(-3e6 + 3e6) = γ*0 = 0

But that suggests that in the Galaxy frame, the Galaxy center is always at x = 0, which makes sense. But we need to find how far the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy frame. Wait, the ejecta is at rest in S', so in S, the ejecta is moving at v = 0.2c. 

But the event we are considering is at t' = 50 s in S', where the Galaxy center is at x' = -3e6 km. But in S, the Galaxy center is at x = 0, and the ejecta's position at time t in S can be found by the Lorentz transformation. 

Wait, maybe I need to find the position of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame. The ejecta is at rest at x' = 0 in S'. So in S, its position is x = γ(x' + v t') = γ(0 + v t') = γ v t'

But t' is 50 s. So x = γ v t' = 1.0206 * 60,000 * 50 ≈ 1.0206 * 3,000,000 ≈ 3,061,800 km

Yes, that's the same result as before. So the ejecta has moved 3,061,800 km in the Galaxy frame. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let's check the calculation again with exact gamma:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So x = 1.020620726 * 60,000 * 50

First, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000

Then, 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km

So approximately 3,061,862 km. But the problem might expect rounding to two decimal places or something, but since the given numbers are 60,000 km/s and 50 s, which are exact, but gamma is approximate. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using gamma as exactly 1.02, but that's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore relativistic effects, but the mention of inertial frames and the high speed suggests otherwise. 

Wait, let's see: if we ignore relativity, then the distance is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But with relativity, it's about 3,061,862 km. The difference is about 61,862 km, which is significant. 

But the problem says "Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference." So it's definitely a special relativity problem. Therefore, the answer should consider time dilation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let's check if there's another way to get confused here. For example, if someone incorrectly uses time contraction instead of dilation, but no. The moving clock (ejecta's frame) runs slower, so 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame correspond to longer time in the Galaxy's frame. 

Alternatively, someone might think that since in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving 0.2c for 50 seconds, so the distance is 3e6 km, and then in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length contracted, so actual distance is longer by gamma. But that also gives the same result. 

Yes, because in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center moves is L' = v t' = 0.2c * 50 = 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is L = L' * gamma, because length in the ejecta's frame is contracted. So L = 3e6 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

So all methods converge to the same answer. 

Therefore, the ejecta travels approximately 3,061,862 km in the Galaxy's frame. Depending on rounding, but likely the answer is 3.06 x 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km if rounded to three significant figures. 

But let's check the given numbers. The velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is two significant figures. The time is 50 seconds, which is also two significant figures. So the answer should have two significant figures. 

60,000 km/s is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s (two sig figs), 50 s is 5.0 x 10^1 s (two sig figs). Then the distance would be 6.0 x 10^4 * 5.0 x 10^1 * 1.0206 ≈ 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km when rounded to two significant figures. 

But wait, 3.06 is three significant figures. If we strictly adhere to two sig figs, it's 3.1 million km. But maybe the problem expects more precision. Let's see:

The gamma factor is approximately 1.0206, which is an increase of about 2%. So 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800. If the original numbers have two sig figs, then 3.1e6 km. But the problem might state the answer as 3.06e6 km. 

But the problem might not specify, but given that 60,000 is written as sixty thousand (which could be considered as one or two sig figs depending on if the trailing zeros are significant). However, in scientific notation, 60,000 km/s would be 6 x 10^4 km/s if one sig fig, or 6.0 x 10^4 if two. Since it's written as sixty thousand, probably two sig figs. Similarly, 50 seconds is two sig figs. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.1 x 10^6 km, which is 3,100,000 km. But our calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million. So with two sig figs, 3.1 million km. 

But maybe the problem expects the exact calculation without rounding gamma. Let's compute gamma more accurately. 

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

Compute sqrt(0.96):

0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25

sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/sqrt(25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ (2*2.44949)/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.979796

Thus, gamma = 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020620726

So gamma ≈ 1.020620726

Then, 50 * gamma ≈ 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

Then, 51.0310363 s * 60,000 km/s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So approximately 3,061,862 km. 

But given the input has two significant figures, the answer should be 3.1 million km. However, the problem might accept the precise answer. Let's check the options if this were a multiple-choice, but since it's a written answer, we need to see what's expected. 

But the problem says "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" and the answer should be in kilometers, I assume. 

Given that, and the precise calculation is approximately 3,061,862 km, but with two sig figs, it's 3.1e6 km. However, the problem might want the exact value considering gamma. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is designed to ignore relativistic effects, but the mention of inertial frames suggests otherwise. 

Wait, another way: if we use the velocity addition formula incorrectly. Suppose someone thinks that the Galaxy sees the ejecta moving at higher speed. But no, the velocity transformation as we did earlier shows that the speed is 0.2c. 

Alternatively, if the problem had said that in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, then the distance would be 0.2c * 50 s = 3e6 km. But the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c. So we have to account for time dilation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,862 km. But since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures, the answer should be rounded to two significant figures: 3.1 million kilometers. 

But maybe the problem expects the answer as 3 * 10^6 km, but that would be ignoring relativity. 

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo and the velocity is non-relativistic, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is relativistic. 

Given that, I think the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But to check, let's see if there's a different approach. 

Alternatively, using the invariant spacetime interval. 

The spacetime interval between the two events (ejecta at rest at t'=0 and t'=50 s) is:

In S' (ejecta frame), the events are at (x'=0, t'=0) and (x'=0, t'=50 s). 

The spacetime interval is s² = (c t')² - (x')² = (c * 50)^2 - 0 = (c * 50)^2

In S (Galaxy frame), the events are at (x1, t1) and (x2, t2), where x2 - x1 = distance traveled by ejecta = d, and t2 - t1 = Δt. 

The spacetime interval is s² = (c Δt)^2 - (d)^2

Since the interval is invariant:

(c Δt)^2 - d² = (c * 50)^2

But we also know that d = v Δt, where v = 0.2c. 

So substituting d = 0.2c Δt:

(c Δt)^2 - (0.2c Δt)^2 = (c * 50)^2

Factor out (c Δt)^2:

(c Δt)^2 (1 - 0.04) = (c * 50)^2

Divide both sides by c²:

Δt² (0.96) = 50²

So Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.031 s

Then, d = 0.2c * 51.031 ≈ 0.2 * 300,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.031 ≈ 3,061,860 km

So this method also gives the same result. 

Therefore, the answer is 3,061,860 km. 

Given that, the problem might expect the answer in kilometers with commas, so 3,061,860 km. But since the problem is in Chinese (from the original context), maybe it's written as 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But the exact answer is approximately 3,061,860 km, which can be written as 3.06 million kilometers. 

So I think that's the answer.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so there's this problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, special relativity, right? Because they mention inertial frames and high velocity—60,000 km/s is like 20% the speed of light. Wait, speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2c. 

Alright, so the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's rest frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 0.2c. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

So, first, I need to figure out the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, but we need to know how much time that corresponds to in the Galaxy's frame. Then, multiply that time by the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame to get the distance. 

Wait, but velocity is relative. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c towards it, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just subtract like that. If two frames are moving relative to each other at velocity v, then the velocity of one in the other's frame is v. But here, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 0.2c. So that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, is that correct? Because in special relativity, if S is the Galaxy frame and S' is the ejecta frame moving at velocity u relative to S, then in S', the Galaxy center would be moving at -u. But if the speed is 0.2c, then u is 0.2c. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. But wait, that seems like Galilean addition, but actually, in special relativity, if the frames are moving at v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. So maybe in this case, since the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c, then the Galaxy frame sees the ejecta moving at 0.2c. So the relative velocity is 0.2c. 

But wait, that can't be right. Because in special relativity, velocities don't add that way. Wait, but if the ejecta is moving at v in the Galaxy frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -v. But if the speed is non-relativistic, then it's approximately true. But 0.2c is 20% the speed of light, which is not negligible. So maybe we need to use the Lorentz transformation here. 

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So they are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy center at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, or vice versa? Wait, the problem says: "From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it." So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the ejecta. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity u. But according to the relativistic velocity transformation, if in S' (ejecta frame), the Galaxy center is moving at v = -0.2c (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta), then in the Galaxy frame S, the ejecta is moving at u = 0.2c. Wait, but that's the non-relativistic result. But in reality, we need to use the velocity transformation formula. 

Wait, the velocity transformation in special relativity is given by:

If an object has velocity u in frame S, then in frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, the velocity u' is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But in this case, the Galaxy center is at rest in frame S (Galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving at u towards the center. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving at u' = -0.2c. So we can set up the equation:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But here, v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy). So v is the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame, which is u. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

Let me denote:

- S: Galaxy frame (center of Galaxy is at rest)
- S': Ejecta frame (ejecta is at rest)
- In S', the Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at 0.2c.

We need to find the velocity of the ejecta in S (Galaxy frame). 

In S', the velocity of the Galaxy center (which is the rest frame S) is u' = -0.2c (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta). 

The velocity transformation formula from S to S' is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

But here, u is the velocity of the Galaxy center in S, which is 0 (since it's at rest in S), and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is for transforming the velocity of an object from S to S'.

In this supernova ejecta problem, I need to determine how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during 50 seconds of the ejecta's proper time. The problem involves special relativity since the velocity is significant at 60,000 km/s, which equals 0.2c (20% of the speed of light).

According to the problem, from the ejecta's reference frame, the Galactic center approaches at 60,000 km/s (0.2c). This means that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving toward the center at 0.2c - the relative velocity is the same in both frames, just with opposite directions.

To solve this, I need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds elapse in the ejecta's frame. Then I can multiply this time by the ejecta's velocity (0.2c) to calculate the distance traveled.

When dealing with special relativity, I need to be careful about reference frames. If S represents the Galaxy frame and S' represents the ejecta frame, then the ejecta is moving at velocity v relative to S. From S', the Galaxy center moves at velocity -v (the negative sign indicating opposite direction).

The velocity transformation in special relativity isn't as simple as in Galilean relativity. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), but I need to be precise about which velocities I'm transforming.

Since both frames are inertial (moving at constant velocity relative to each other), and the Galaxy center is stationary in the Galaxy frame while the ejecta is stationary in its own frame, I can determine that the ejecta moves at 0.2c toward the Galactic center in the Galaxy's reference frame.

There's a problem involving a supernova ejecta traveling towards the center of the Galaxy. The task is to determine how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. This involves special relativity, considering inertial frames and high velocity—60,000 km/s, which is 20% the speed of light (0.2c). 

In the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. To find out how much distance the ejecta covers in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds from the ejecta's frame, we first need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame. Special relativity implies we must consider proper time and time dilation. 

Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, we need to use the Lorentz transformation to relate this to the time interval in the Galaxy's frame. The problem states that 50 seconds elapse in the ejecta's frame, so we'll determine the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, considering the time dilation effect. 

Furthermore, according to special relativity, velocities don't simply add; the velocity transformation must be used. Given the velocity of the Galaxy center in the ejecta's frame is -0.2c (moving towards it), we use the relativistic velocity transformation formula:

\( u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c²}} \)

Here, in the Galaxy frame S, the ejecta moves at velocity u towards the Galaxy center. The velocity v is for relating the frames. We solve for the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy by setting u' to -0.2c and applying the formula appropriately. This helps correctly understand the motion and determine the distance traveled by converting the time to the Galaxy's frame and using the correct velocity.

But according to the problem, u\' = -0.2c. Therefore, -v = -0.2c, so v = 0.2c. Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. \n\nWait, that seems like the Galilean result. But according to special relativity, if S\' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S will have velocity -v in S\'. But here, the problem states that in S\', the Galaxy center (which is at rest in S) is moving at -0.2c. Therefore, v = 0.2c. So the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the Galaxy center in the Galaxy frame. \n\nTherefore, the relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 0.2c, and in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. \n\nBut then, the problem is asking: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta\'s frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the Galaxy\'s frame. \n\nSo, first, we need to calculate the time dilation factor. The time experienced in the ejecta\'s frame (proper time) is 50 seconds. But the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy. So the time in the Galaxy frame would be longer due to time dilation. \n\nWait, but the ejecta is moving, so the proper time (the time measured in the ejecta\'s frame) is the shortest. The time in the Galaxy frame would be gamma multiplied by the proper time. \n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04. Therefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. \n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy frame is gamma * tau, where tau is 50 seconds. So t = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is velocity * time = 0.2c * 51.03 seconds. \n\nBut 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, so we don\'t have to worry about acceleration or anything. But is this the correct approach? \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is using the Lorentz transformation. The event of the ejecta moving for 50 seconds in its own frame. In the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So in 50 seconds, the Galaxy center would have moved a distance of 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, but the time is different. \n\nWait, but maybe we can use length contraction? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since in the ejecta\'s frame, the time is 50 seconds, and the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is decreasing at 0.2c. So in 50 seconds, the distance covered would be 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance should be the same? Wait, no, because of relativity of simultaneity. \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'):\n\n- The ejecta is at rest at position x\' = 0.\n\n- The Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at v = -0.2c (i.e., velocity u\' = -0.2c).\n\n- After 50 seconds in S\', the Galaxy center has moved closer to the ejecta by distance d\' = |u\'| * t\' = 0.2c * 50 s.\n\nBut in the Galaxy frame (S):\n\n- The Galaxy center is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u = 0.2c.\n\n- The time in S is t = gamma * (t\' + (v x\')/c²). But since the event is at x\' = 0 (the ejecta\'s position), then t = gamma * t\'.\n\nSo t = gamma * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels is u * t = 0.2c * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. \n\nSo in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves 3,061,800 km, which is longer due to time dilation. \n\nBut wait, in the Galaxy frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center would be contracted. Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame. So if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c for 51.03 seconds, then the distance is 0.2c * 51.03. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the invariant spacetime interval. \n\nThe proper time tau is 50 seconds. The spacetime interval between the two events (ejecta at rest at t\'=0 and t\'=50) is:\n\nIn S\' (ejecta frame):\n\n- Event 1: (t\'=0, x\'=0)\n\n- Event 2: (t\'=50, x\'=0)\n\nSo the spacetime interval is s² = (c t\')² - (x\')² = (c * 50)^2 - 0 = (50c)^2.\n\nIn S (Galaxy frame):\n\n- Event 1: (t1, x1)\n\n- Event 2: (t2, x2)\n\nThe spacetime interval is s² = (c(t2 - t1))² - (x2 - x1)^2 = (50c)^2.\n\nBut in S, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, so x2 - x1 = 0.2c * (t2 - t1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(c Δt)^2 - (0.2c Δt)^2 = (50c)^2\n\nc² Δt² (1 - 0.04) = 2500 c²\n\nΔt² * 0.96 = 2500\n\nΔt = sqrt(2500 / 0.96) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s\n\nSo same result as before. Then, the distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check the calculation again.\n\n0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km. Yes.\n\nBut the problem says "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So according to the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving for 51.03 seconds, so the distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach where the answer is different. For example, using length contraction. \n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, the distance covered is 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy frame, this distance would be length contracted. Wait, but the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is different in the two frames. \n\nWait, in the Galaxy frame, the distance the ejecta travels is just its speed multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. So that\'s 0.2c * gamma * tau. Which is 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nAlternatively, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center moves 3,000,000 km in 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy frame, that distance is length contracted. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. So the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center in the Galaxy frame is longer. \n\nWait, if in the ejecta\'s frame, the distance to the Galaxy center is L\' = 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, then in the Galaxy frame, the distance would be L = gamma * L\', because the ejecta sees the Galaxy center moving, so the proper length (in Galaxy frame) is longer. \n\nWait, length contraction formula is L = L\' / gamma. Wait, no. If an object has proper length L0 in its rest frame, then in a frame moving relative to it, the length is L = L0 / gamma. \n\nBut here, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is L\' = 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance would be L = gamma * L\', because the ejecta is moving, so the distance is contracted? Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two events (ejecta at t\'=0 and t\'=50) in the ejecta\'s frame correspond to two events in the Galaxy\'s frame separated by 51.03 seconds, and the distance between those two events is 0.2c * 51.03. \n\nBut I think the first approach is correct. Using time dilation to get the Galaxy frame time, then multiplying by velocity. \n\nSo the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. But let\'s compute it more precisely. \n\nFirst, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma ≈ 1.0206. \n\nThen, t = gamma * 50 ≈ 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = 0.2c * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. \n\nFirst, gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let\'s compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ (2*2.449)/5 ≈ 4.898/5 ≈ 0.9796. \n\nSo gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9796 ≈ 1.0208. \n\nThen, t ≈ 1.0208 * 50 ≈ 51.04 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = 60,000 * 51.04 ≈ 3,062,400 km. \n\nBut the difference is minimal. Depending on the precision, maybe the answer is 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut let\'s check with exact value. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nSo sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 2*2.44949 /5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796. \n\nThus, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo t = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of gamma, but since it\'s numerical, we can round it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. \n\nWait, another way: the proper time tau is 50 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame. \n\nBut tau^2 = t^2 - (x/c)^2. Since x = v t, so tau^2 = t^2 - (v t / c)^2 = t^2 (1 - v²/c²). Therefore, t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma tau. \n\nThen, x = v t = v gamma tau. \n\nSo x = v gamma tau. \n\nGiven v = 0.2c, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1.0206, tau = 50 s. \n\nSo x = 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50. \n\nBut 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. \n\nSo x = 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps asking for the distance in the Galaxy frame corresponding to the ejecta\'s 50 seconds, considering length contraction instead. \n\nWait, if in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then in the Galaxy frame, that distance would be longer by gamma. So 3,000,000 km * gamma ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, both methods give the same answer. So the distance is approximately 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut the problem might want an exact answer. Let\'s compute it more precisely. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = 5 sqrt(6) / 12 ≈ 5*2.44949 /12 ≈ 12.24745 /12 ≈ 1.02062. \n\nSo gamma ≈ 1.02062. \n\nThen, t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, x = 0.2c * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km. \n\nBut given that the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s (exactly 0.2c), and time is 50 seconds in the ejecta frame, the exact answer would be:\n\nx = v * gamma * tau = 0.2c * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)) * 50\n\nBut 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, so:\n\nx = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50\n\nBut 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo x = 60,000 * 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nSo approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer in some rounded form. Maybe to three significant figures. 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut let\'s see. 3,061,862 is approximately 3.06 million km. \n\nAlternatively, if they want it in kilometers without scientific notation, 3,060,000 km. But given the precise calculation is 3,061,862, maybe they expect 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. \n\nBut maybe the exact answer is 50 light-seconds multiplied by 0.2c and gamma. Wait, 50 seconds is time, but 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake here. Let me check units. \n\nWait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 50 seconds in ejecta frame. \n\nIn Galaxy frame, time is 50 * gamma ≈ 51.03 s. \n\nDistance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nYes, that\'s correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler and expects Galilean relativity, but given the speed is 0.2c, which is significant, special relativity should be considered. \n\nBut if we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and 50 seconds in ejecta frame is 50 seconds in Galaxy frame. Then distance would be 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But the problem says to consider them as inertial frames, so we must consider time dilation. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let me check with another method. \n\nUsing Lorentz transformation. \n\nThe two events are:\n\nIn S\' (ejecta frame):\n\n- Event 1: (t\' = 0, x\' = 0)\n\n- Event 2: (t\' = 50, x\' = 0)\n\nWe need to find the coordinates in S (Galaxy frame). \n\nLorentz transformation:\n\nt = gamma (t\' + (v x\')/c²)\n\nx = gamma (x\' + v t\')\n\nFor Event 2:\n\nx\' = 0, t\' = 50\n\nSo,\n\nt = gamma (50 + (v * 0)/c²) = gamma * 50\n\nx = gamma (0 + v * 50) = gamma * v * 50\n\nTherefore, x = gamma * v * 50\n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSince v = 0.2c, gamma = 1.0206, so x = 1.0206 * 0.2c * 50. \n\nWhich is 1.0206 * 0.2 * 50 * c. \n\nBut 0.2 * 50 = 10, so 1.0206 * 10 * c. \n\nWait, no. Wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then multiplied by gamma ≈ 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km. \n\nYes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps tricking us. It says "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance is x = v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame. Since t = gamma * tau, then x = v * gamma * tau. \n\nYes, which is what we calculated. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let me check with exact gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo x = 0.2c * 50 * gamma = 0.2c * 50 * 1.020620726\n\n0.2c is 60,000 km/s, so:\n\nx = 60,000 * 50 * 1.020620726 = 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nSo approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer in a certain format. Maybe rounded to the nearest 1,000 km, which would be 3,062,000 km. Or maybe as 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut given the options, perhaps the exact answer is 3,061,862 km, but since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures (60,000 km/s is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s), and time to two significant figures (50 seconds), then the answer should be to two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km. Wait, 60,000 is two sig figs (6 and 0), but actually, 60,000 could be ambiguous. If it\'s written as 60,000 with a decimal, 6.0 x 10^4, then two sig figs. But if it\'s written as 60000 without a decimal, it\'s ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 6.0 x 10^4 is two sig figs, 6 x 10^4 is one. \n\nBut the problem states "60 000 km/s" with a space, which might be the European way of writing 60,000. So maybe it\'s two significant figures. Then 50 seconds is two sig figs. So the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut 3,061,862 is approximately 3.1 million when rounded to two sig figs. \n\nBut wait, 3,061,862 is 3.061862 x 10^6, which is 3.1 x 10^6 with two sig figs. \n\nBut if the problem expects three sig figs, since 60,000 could be three (if the trailing zeros are significant), but usually, trailing zeros without a decimal are not significant. So 60,000 is two sig figs. 50 is two sig figs. So the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut the exact calculation is approximately 3.06 million, which is 3.06 x 10^6, which is three sig figs. \n\nHmm, the problem might not specify, but given the inputs are two sig figs, the answer should be two. But in the calculation, gamma is approximately 1.0206, which is five sig figs. But since the given velocity is 60,000 km/s (two sig figs) and time is 50 s (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs. \n\nBut 3,061,862 km is approximately 3.1 million km. But 3.06 is three sig figs. Wait, 3.06 is three, 3.1 is two. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects three sig figs because 60,000 is written as two but maybe considered more. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might state the answer as 3.06 million km. \n\nBut given that in the problem statement, the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is precise (maybe exact), and 50 seconds is exact. So perhaps the answer should be exact. But since gamma is irrational, it\'s impossible. So they might expect the answer as 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity, but the problem mentions inertial frames and high velocity, so relativity should be considered. \n\nBut given that the difference between 3,000,000 and 3,061,862 is about 2%, which is significant. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nSo I think the answer is \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446262, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5662, prompt_tokens=1445, total_tokens=7107, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame, we need to account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation. 

1. **Relative Velocity**: The ejecta and the Galaxy are moving towards each other at a relative velocity of 60,000 km/s (0.2c).

2. **Time Dilation**: The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time, τ) is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is dilated and can be calculated using the Lorentz factor (γ):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   The time in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   t = \gamma \tau \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is the product of the velocity and the dilated time:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \times t = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.03 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,800 \text{ km}
   \]

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

So if the Galaxy center is at rest in S, then in S', its velocity is u' = -v/(1 - 0) = -v. But according to the problem, u' = -0.2c. Therefore, -v = -0.2c, so v = 0.2c. Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. 

Wait, that seems like the Galilean result. But according to special relativity, if S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S will have velocity -v in S'. But here, the problem states that in S', the Galaxy center (which is at rest in S) is moving at -0.2c. Therefore, v = 0.2c. So the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the Galaxy center in the Galaxy frame. 

Therefore, the relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 0.2c, and in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. 

But then, the problem is asking: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the Galaxy's frame. 

So, first, we need to calculate the time dilation factor. The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is 50 seconds. But the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy. So the time in the Galaxy frame would be longer due to time dilation. 

Wait, but the ejecta is moving, so the proper time (the time measured in the ejecta's frame) is the shortest. The time in the Galaxy frame would be gamma multiplied by the proper time. 

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04. Therefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. 

So, the time in the Galaxy frame is gamma * tau, where tau is 50 seconds. So t = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. 

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is velocity * time = 0.2c * 51.03 seconds. 

But 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, so we don't have to worry about acceleration or anything. But is this the correct approach? 

Wait, but another way to think about it is using the Lorentz transformation. The event of the ejecta moving for 50 seconds in its own frame. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So in 50 seconds, the Galaxy center would have moved a distance of 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, but the time is different. 

Wait, but maybe we can use length contraction? Hmm. 

Alternatively, since in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, and the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is decreasing at 0.2c. So in 50 seconds, the distance covered would be 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance should be the same? Wait, no, because of relativity of simultaneity. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify. 

Let me denote:

In the ejecta's frame (S'):

- The ejecta is at rest at position x' = 0.

- The Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at v = -0.2c (i.e., velocity u' = -0.2c).

- After 50 seconds in S', the Galaxy center has moved closer to the ejecta by distance d' = |u'| * t' = 0.2c * 50 s.

But in the Galaxy frame (S):

- The Galaxy center is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it at u = 0.2c.

- The time in S is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c²). But since the event is at x' = 0 (the ejecta's position), then t = gamma * t'.

So t = gamma * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels is u * t = 0.2c * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. 

So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves 3,061,800 km, which is longer due to time dilation. 

But wait, in the Galaxy frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center would be contracted. Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame. So if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c for 51.03 seconds, then the distance is 0.2c * 51.03. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the invariant spacetime interval. 

The proper time tau is 50 seconds. The spacetime interval between the two events (ejecta at rest at t'=0 and t'=50) is:

In S' (ejecta frame):

- Event 1: (t'=0, x'=0)

- Event 2: (t'=50, x'=0)

So the spacetime interval is s² = (c t')² - (x')² = (c * 50)^2 - 0 = (50c)^2.

In S (Galaxy frame):

- Event 1: (t1, x1)

- Event 2: (t2, x2)

The spacetime interval is s² = (c(t2 - t1))² - (x2 - x1)^2 = (50c)^2.

But in S, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, so x2 - x1 = 0.2c * (t2 - t1).

Therefore:

(c Δt)^2 - (0.2c Δt)^2 = (50c)^2

c² Δt² (1 - 0.04) = 2500 c²

Δt² * 0.96 = 2500

Δt = sqrt(2500 / 0.96) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s

So same result as before. Then, the distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check the calculation again.

0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km. Yes.

But the problem says "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So according to the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving for 51.03 seconds, so the distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

But let me check if there's another approach where the answer is different. For example, using length contraction. 

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, the distance covered is 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy frame, this distance would be length contracted. Wait, but the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is different in the two frames. 

Wait, in the Galaxy frame, the distance the ejecta travels is just its speed multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. So that's 0.2c * gamma * tau. Which is 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Alternatively, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves 3,000,000 km in 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy frame, that distance is length contracted. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. So the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center in the Galaxy frame is longer. 

Wait, if in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the Galaxy center is L' = 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, then in the Galaxy frame, the distance would be L = gamma * L', because the ejecta sees the Galaxy center moving, so the proper length (in Galaxy frame) is longer. 

Wait, length contraction formula is L = L' / gamma. Wait, no. If an object has proper length L0 in its rest frame, then in a frame moving relative to it, the length is L = L0 / gamma. 

But here, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is L' = 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance would be L = gamma * L', because the ejecta is moving, so the distance is contracted? Wait, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the two events (ejecta at t'=0 and t'=50) in the ejecta's frame correspond to two events in the Galaxy's frame separated by 51.03 seconds, and the distance between those two events is 0.2c * 51.03. 

But I think the first approach is correct. Using time dilation to get the Galaxy frame time, then multiplying by velocity. 

So the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. But let's compute it more precisely. 

First, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). 

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma ≈ 1.0206. 

Then, t = gamma * 50 ≈ 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds. 

Then, distance = 0.2c * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km. 

But let me check with exact calculation. 

First, gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96):

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ (2*2.449)/5 ≈ 4.898/5 ≈ 0.9796. 

So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9796 ≈ 1.0208. 

Then, t ≈ 1.0208 * 50 ≈ 51.04 seconds. 

Then, distance = 60,000 * 51.04 ≈ 3,062,400 km. 

But the difference is minimal. Depending on the precision, maybe the answer is 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But let's check with exact value. 

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). 

So sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 2*2.44949 /5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796. 

Thus, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020620726. 

So t = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds. 

Then, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. 

So approximately 3,061,862 km. 

But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of gamma, but since it's numerical, we can round it. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, another way: the proper time tau is 50 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame. 

But tau^2 = t^2 - (x/c)^2. Since x = v t, so tau^2 = t^2 - (v t / c)^2 = t^2 (1 - v²/c²). Therefore, t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma tau. 

Then, x = v t = v gamma tau. 

So x = v gamma tau. 

Given v = 0.2c, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1.0206, tau = 50 s. 

So x = 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50. 

But 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 

So x = 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Same result. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check if the question is perhaps asking for the distance in the Galaxy frame corresponding to the ejecta's 50 seconds, considering length contraction instead. 

Wait, if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then in the Galaxy frame, that distance would be longer by gamma. So 3,000,000 km * gamma ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Same result. 

Therefore, both methods give the same answer. So the distance is approximately 3,061,800 km. 

But the problem might want an exact answer. Let's compute it more precisely. 

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = 5 sqrt(6) / 12 ≈ 5*2.44949 /12 ≈ 12.24745 /12 ≈ 1.02062. 

So gamma ≈ 1.02062. 

Then, t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds. 

Then, x = 0.2c * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km. 

But given that the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s (exactly 0.2c), and time is 50 seconds in the ejecta frame, the exact answer would be:

x = v * gamma * tau = 0.2c * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)) * 50

But 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, so:

x = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50

But 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 1.020620726

So x = 60,000 * 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So approximately 3,061,862 km. 

But the problem might want the answer in some rounded form. Maybe to three significant figures. 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But let's see. 3,061,862 is approximately 3.06 million km. 

Alternatively, if they want it in kilometers without scientific notation, 3,060,000 km. But given the precise calculation is 3,061,862, maybe they expect 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. 

But maybe the exact answer is 50 light-seconds multiplied by 0.2c and gamma. Wait, 50 seconds is time, but 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check units. 

Wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 50 seconds in ejecta frame. 

In Galaxy frame, time is 50 * gamma ≈ 51.03 s. 

Distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler and expects Galilean relativity, but given the speed is 0.2c, which is significant, special relativity should be considered. 

But if we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and 50 seconds in ejecta frame is 50 seconds in Galaxy frame. Then distance would be 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But the problem says to consider them as inertial frames, so we must consider time dilation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. 

But let me check with another method. 

Using Lorentz transformation. 

The two events are:

In S' (ejecta frame):

- Event 1: (t' = 0, x' = 0)

- Event 2: (t' = 50, x' = 0)

We need to find the coordinates in S (Galaxy frame). 

Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²)

x = gamma (x' + v t')

For Event 2:

x' = 0, t' = 50

So,

t = gamma (50 + (v * 0)/c²) = gamma * 50

x = gamma (0 + v * 50) = gamma * v * 50

Therefore, x = gamma * v * 50

Which is the same as before. 

Since v = 0.2c, gamma = 1.0206, so x = 1.0206 * 0.2c * 50. 

Which is 1.0206 * 0.2 * 50 * c. 

But 0.2 * 50 = 10, so 1.0206 * 10 * c. 

Wait, no. Wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then multiplied by gamma ≈ 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km. 

Yes, same result. 

Therefore, the answer is 3,061,800 km. 

But let me check if the question is perhaps tricking us. It says "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance is x = v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame. Since t = gamma * tau, then x = v * gamma * tau. 

Yes, which is what we calculated. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. 

But let me check with exact gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So x = 0.2c * 50 * gamma = 0.2c * 50 * 1.020620726

0.2c is 60,000 km/s, so:

x = 60,000 * 50 * 1.020620726 = 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So approximately 3,061,862 km. 

But the problem might want the answer in a certain format. Maybe rounded to the nearest 1,000 km, which would be 3,062,000 km. Or maybe as 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But given the options, perhaps the exact answer is 3,061,862 km, but since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures (60,000 km/s is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s), and time to two significant figures (50 seconds), then the answer should be to two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km. Wait, 60,000 is two sig figs (6 and 0), but actually, 60,000 could be ambiguous. If it's written as 60,000 with a decimal, 6.0 x 10^4, then two sig figs. But if it's written as 60000 without a decimal, it's ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 6.0 x 10^4 is two sig figs, 6 x 10^4 is one. 

But the problem states "60 000 km/s" with a space, which might be the European way of writing 60,000. So maybe it's two significant figures. Then 50 seconds is two sig figs. So the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km. 

But 3,061,862 is approximately 3.1 million when rounded to two sig figs. 

But wait, 3,061,862 is 3.061862 x 10^6, which is 3.1 x 10^6 with two sig figs. 

But if the problem expects three sig figs, since 60,000 could be three (if the trailing zeros are significant), but usually, trailing zeros without a decimal are not significant. So 60,000 is two sig figs. 50 is two sig figs. So the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km. 

But the exact calculation is approximately 3.06 million, which is 3.06 x 10^6, which is three sig figs. 

Hmm, the problem might not specify, but given the inputs are two sig figs, the answer should be two. But in the calculation, gamma is approximately 1.0206, which is five sig figs. But since the given velocity is 60,000 km/s (two sig figs) and time is 50 s (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs. 

But 3,061,862 km is approximately 3.1 million km. But 3.06 is three sig figs. Wait, 3.06 is three, 3.1 is two. 

But maybe the problem expects three sig figs because 60,000 is written as two but maybe considered more. Hmm. 

Alternatively, the problem might state the answer as 3.06 million km. 

But given that in the problem statement, the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is precise (maybe exact), and 50 seconds is exact. So perhaps the answer should be exact. But since gamma is irrational, it's impossible. So they might expect the answer as 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity, but the problem mentions inertial frames and high velocity, so relativity should be considered. 

But given that the difference between 3,000,000 and 3,061,862 is about 2%, which is significant. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

So I think the answer is \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}.

Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, time dilation occurs. The time experienced in the moving frame (ejecta) is the proper time, and the time in the Galaxy frame will be longer.\n\nThe time dilation formula is t = γ * t\', where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04. Therefore, γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy frame would be t = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is velocity * time: 0.2c * 51.03 s.\n\nBut wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km. But this seems straightforward. However, I need to check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the Lorentz transformation for position and time. Let me think.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the event of the Galactic center moving towards it. The ejecta is at rest, so in S\', the Galactic center is moving at -0.2c. The time in S\' is 50 seconds. So, the position of the Galactic center in S\' after 50 seconds would be x\' = -0.2c * 50 s. But in S\', the ejecta is at x\' = 0, and the Galactic center is moving towards it from some initial position. However, the problem states that part of the ejecta is moving towards the center. Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler.\n\nWait, the question is: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"\n\nSo, in the ejecta\'s own frame (S\'), 50 seconds pass. During this time, in the Galaxy\'s frame (S), how much time passes, and how far does the ejecta move?\n\nSince the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in S, the time in S is longer due to time dilation. So, t_S = γ * t_S\'. Then, distance is v * t_S = 0.2c * γ * 50 s.\n\nBut let\'s compute this.\n\nFirst, compute γ:\n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s (given)\n\nv²/c² = (0.2c)^2 / c² = 0.04\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\nSo, t_S = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds\n\nThen, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nBut wait, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. So, the time dilation adds an extra 0.2c * 1.03 s ≈ 61,800 km. So total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut is this correct? Let me check with Lorentz transformations.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the time is t\' = 50 s. The event we are considering is the ejecta moving in the Galaxy frame. Wait, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the distance it travels is 0.2c multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time in the Galaxy frame is related to the ejecta\'s proper time via time dilation. So, the calculation above is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using Lorentz transformations. Let\'s consider the coordinates.\n\nIn S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at v = 0.2c. The coordinates in S are (x, t). In S\', the ejecta is at rest, so the coordinates in S\' are (x\', t\').\n\nThe Lorentz transformations are:\n\nx = γ(x\' + vt\')\n\nt = γ(t\' + (v x\')/c²)\n\nBut in the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the ejecta is at x\' = 0. So, the position of the ejecta in S is x = γ(v t\'). Wait, but t\' is the time in S\' when the ejecta is at x\' = 0. So, x = γ(v t\')?\n\nWait, no. Let\'s think. The ejecta is at rest at x\' = 0 in S\'. So, in S, the position of the ejecta at time t in S is x = v t. But we need to relate t in S to t\' in S\'.\n\nThe time in S when the ejecta\'s clock shows t\' = 50 s. Since the ejecta is moving at v in S, the time in S is t = γ t\' (time dilation). Therefore, x = v t = v γ t\'.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, x = 0.2c * γ * 50 s. Which gives the same result as before. So, 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let\'s compute the spacetime interval. The proper time τ is 50 s. The spacetime interval is invariant:\n\nc² τ² = c² t² - x²\n\nBut in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves x = v t, so:\n\nc² τ² = c² t² - v² t² = t² (c² - v²)\n\nTherefore, t = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = γ τ\n\nWhich is the time dilation formula. Then, x = v t = v γ τ\n\nSo, x = v γ τ = 0.2c * γ * 50 s\n\nWhich again gives the same result. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut let me compute this precisely.\n\nFirst, compute γ:\n\nv = 0.2c\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, γ ≈ 1.020620726\n\nThen, t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds\n\nThen, x = 0.2c * t\n\nBut 0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792.458 km/s ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s\n\nSo, x ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ ?\n\nCompute 59,958.4916 * 50 = 2,997,924.58 km\n\nThen, 59,958.4916 * 1.0310363 ≈ 59,958.4916 * 1 = 59,958.4916\n\nPlus 59,958.4916 * 0.0310363 ≈ 59,958.4916 * 0.03 = 1,798.75475\n\nPlus 59,958.4916 * 0.0010363 ≈ 62.14 km\n\nTotal ≈ 59,958.4916 + 1,798.75475 + 62.14 ≈ 61,819.38635 km\n\nSo total x ≈ 2,997,924.58 + 61,819.38635 ≈ 3,059,743.966 km ≈ 3,059,744 km\n\nWhich is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, rounding to three significant figures, 3.06 × 10^6 km.\n\nBut the problem states "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach where perhaps length contraction is involved. Wait, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galactic center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta\'s frame, the distance to the Galactic center would be contracted. But the problem is not asking about the distance between the ejecta and the Galactic center, but rather the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame during 50 seconds of its own time.\n\nTherefore, the previous calculation is correct. The answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check the exact value again.\n\nAlternatively, using exact values:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6 × 10^4 km/s\n\nc = 299,792.458 km/s ≈ 3 × 10^5 km/s\n\nBut 0.2c = 0.2 × 299,792.458 ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s, which is approximately 6 × 10^4 km/s as given in the problem. So, the problem states 60,000 km/s, which is an exact value. So, perhaps we can take v = 0.2c exactly, with c = 3 × 10^5 km/s. Let\'s check:\n\nIf c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. So, the problem uses c = 3 × 10^5 km/s for simplicity. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nBut if we use exact fractions, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798, so γ ≈ 1.0206.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, so that calculations are simpler. Let\'s check:\n\nIf c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 6 × 10^4 km/s = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206\n\nThen, t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s\n\nThen, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nBut if we use c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, and the exact calculation would be:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = 50 s * γ ≈ 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nBut since the problem gives v = 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c if c is taken as 3 × 10^5 km/s, then perhaps we can use exact values. Let\'s see:\n\nIf c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = 5/(2*2.44949) ≈ 5/4.89898 ≈ 1.0206\n\nBut sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.89898\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798\n\nSo, γ ≈ 1.0206\n\nTherefore, t = 50 s * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km\n\nBut if we use more precise c:\n\nc = 299,792.458 km/s\n\nv = 60,000 km/s\n\nThen, v/c = 60,000 / 299,792.458 ≈ 0.200138\n\nSo, v/c ≈ 0.200138, so (v/c)^2 ≈ 0.040055\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.040055) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 1 / 0.97976 ≈ 1.0207\n\nSo, t ≈ 1.0207 * 50 ≈ 51.035 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 * 51.035 ≈ 3,062,100 km\n\nBut the problem states the velocity as exactly 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c if c is exactly 300,000 km/s. So, perhaps the problem expects us to use c = 3.0 × 10^5 km/s for simplicity, leading to γ = 1.0206, t = 51.03 s, and distance ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut let\'s check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, maybe using the velocity addition formula or considering that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. But since both are inertial frames, the relative velocity is the same in both frames, just opposite in direction. So, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. Therefore, the distance is simply velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time in the Galaxy frame is longer than the proper time in the ejecta\'s frame due to time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct as done before.\n\nAlternatively, if we ignore special relativistic effects and use classical mechanics, the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But since the velocity is 0.2c, relativistic effects are non-negligible. The time dilation factor is about 1.02, so the distance is about 3,061,800 km. Therefore, the answer should take into account the time dilation.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. The key is that in the ejecta\'s frame, 50 seconds pass. In the Galaxy\'s frame, the time is longer by γ. Therefore, the distance is v * γ * t\'.\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. To be precise, using the exact numbers:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = 50 s * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nRounded to three significant figures, that\'s 3.06 × 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation with c = 3 × 10^5 km/s:\n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = 50 s * γ ≈ 51.0310363 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nBut since the problem gives v as exactly 60,000 km/s, and if we take c as exactly 3 × 10^5 km/s, then the calculation is exact:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (250) / (2*sqrt(6)) = 125 / sqrt(6) ≈ 125 / 2.44949 ≈ 51.031 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 * 51.031 ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of exact expression. Let\'s see:\n\ndistance = v * γ * t\'\n\n= 0.2c * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)) * 50\n\n= 0.2c * 50 / sqrt(0.96)\n\n= 10c / sqrt(0.96)\n\nBut c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, so:\n\ndistance = 10 * 3 × 10^5 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\n= 3 × 10^6 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\nBut sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5\n\nTherefore, distance = 3 × 10^6 / (2*sqrt(6)/5) = 3 × 10^6 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (15 × 10^6) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (7.5 × 10^6) / sqrt(6)\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\n= (7.5 × 10^6) * sqrt(6) / 6\n\n= (7.5 / 6) × 10^6 × sqrt(6)\n\n= 1.25 × 10^6 × sqrt(6)\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.44949\n\nSo, 1.25 × 10^6 × 2.44949 ≈ 3,061,862.5 km\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\nBut since the problem might expect a numerical answer, likely rounded to three significant figures, which would be 3.06 × 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km. However, depending on the problem\'s expectation, maybe they want the exact expression. But given that the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s (which is exact 0.2c if c=3e5 km/s), and the time is 50 seconds, the answer is 3,061,862 km approximately. But since the problem might use approximate values, perhaps 3.06 million km.\n\nAlternatively, if we use c=3e5 km/s, then:\n\ndistance = 0.2c * γ * t\' = 0.2*3e5 km/s * (1/sqrt(0.96)) *50 s = 0.2*3e5*50 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\n= 3e5 *10 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\n= 3e6 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\nsqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798\n\nSo, 3e6 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer as 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. However, given that the exact calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.061862 x 10^6 km, rounding to three significant figures would be 3.06 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, and in its own frame, 50 seconds pass. The distance in the Galaxy frame is simply velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame, which is time-dilated. So, yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. However, to ensure precision, let\'s use the exact value of γ and compute the distance.\n\nAlternatively, using the invariant spacetime interval:\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame, the time between events (start and end of 50 seconds) is Δt\' = 50 s, and since the ejecta is stationary in its frame, Δx\' = 0. The spacetime interval is:\n\ns² = (cΔt\')² - (Δx\')² = (c*50)^2\n\nIn the Galaxy frame, the spacetime interval is:\n\ns² = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2\n\nSince the interval is invariant:\n\n(c*50)^2 = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2\n\nBut in the Galaxy frame, Δx = vΔt, since the ejecta is moving at velocity v.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(c*50)^2 = (cΔt)^2 - (vΔt)^2\n\n=> c²*2500 = Δt²(c² - v²)\n\n=> Δt² = c²*2500 / (c² - v²)\n\n=> Δt = (c*50) / sqrt(c² - v²) = 50 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 50γ\n\nWhich is the time dilation formula. Then, Δx = vΔt = v*50γ\n\nWhich is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is consistent.\n\nThus, the distance is v*γ*50. With v=0.2c and γ=1.0206, the distance is approximately 3,061,800 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Given the problem\'s data, the most precise answer within three significant figures is 3.06 × 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. However, the exact calculation gives about 3,061,862 km, which rounds to 3.06 × 10^6 km.\n\nBut let me check once more with exact numbers:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s\n\nt\' = 50 s\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60000 / 299792.458)^2)\n\nFirst, compute v/c:\n\n60000 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.200138\n\nv²/c² ≈ (0.200138)^2 ≈ 0.040055\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.040055) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 1 / 0.97976 ≈ 1.0207\n\nt = γ * 50 ≈ 1.0207 * 50 ≈ 51.035 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 * 51.035 ≈ 3,062,100 km\n\nBut this is with more precise c. However, the problem states the velocity as exactly 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c if c is 300,000 km/s. So, if we take c=3e5 km/s, then:\n\nv/c = 0.2 exactly\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nRounded to three significant figures, this is 3.06 × 10^6 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. The problem might expect the answer in meters or kilometers, but since the velocity is given in km/s, the answer is in kilometers. So, the final answer is approximately 3.06 × 10^6 km, which can be written as 3,060,000 km. However, to be precise, it\'s 3,061,862 km, but likely rounded to three significant figures, 3.06 million km.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a different answer. For example, if they consider that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so the distance covered in the ejecta\'s frame is 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, and then applying length contraction.

Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * γ * 50 s, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, the boxed answer should be \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ejecta travels approximately \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446533, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5876, prompt_tokens=483, total_tokens=6359, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   - The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is \( t' = 50 \) seconds.
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame \( t \) is:
     \[
     t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}

Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c.

But the problem is about the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (50 seconds) and the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, time dilation occurs. The time experienced in the moving frame (ejecta) is the proper time, and the time in the Galaxy frame will be longer.

The time dilation formula is t = γ * t', where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04. Therefore, γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in the Galaxy frame would be t = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame is velocity * time: 0.2c * 51.03 s.

But wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km. But this seems straightforward. However, I need to check if this is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the Lorentz transformation for position and time. Let me think.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the event of the Galactic center moving towards it. The ejecta is at rest, so in S', the Galactic center is moving at -0.2c. The time in S' is 50 seconds. So, the position of the Galactic center in S' after 50 seconds would be x' = -0.2c * 50 s. But in S', the ejecta is at x' = 0, and the Galactic center is moving towards it from some initial position. However, the problem states that part of the ejecta is moving towards the center. Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler.

Wait, the question is: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the ejecta's own frame (S'), 50 seconds pass. During this time, in the Galaxy's frame (S), how much time passes, and how far does the ejecta move?

Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in S, the time in S is longer due to time dilation. So, t_S = γ * t_S'. Then, distance is v * t_S = 0.2c * γ * 50 s.

But let's compute this.

First, compute γ:

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s (given)

v²/c² = (0.2c)^2 / c² = 0.04

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

So, t_S = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds

Then, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km

But wait, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. So, the time dilation adds an extra 0.2c * 1.03 s ≈ 61,800 km. So total is 3,061,800 km.

But is this correct? Let me check with Lorentz transformations.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the time is t' = 50 s. The event we are considering is the ejecta moving in the Galaxy frame. Wait, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the distance it travels is 0.2c multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time in the Galaxy frame is related to the ejecta's proper time via time dilation. So, the calculation above is correct.

Alternatively, using Lorentz transformations. Let's consider the coordinates.

In S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at v = 0.2c. The coordinates in S are (x, t). In S', the ejecta is at rest, so the coordinates in S' are (x', t').

The Lorentz transformations are:

x = γ(x' + vt')

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c²)

But in the ejecta's frame (S'), the ejecta is at x' = 0. So, the position of the ejecta in S is x = γ(v t'). Wait, but t' is the time in S' when the ejecta is at x' = 0. So, x = γ(v t')?

Wait, no. Let's think. The ejecta is at rest at x' = 0 in S'. So, in S, the position of the ejecta at time t in S is x = v t. But we need to relate t in S to t' in S'.

The time in S when the ejecta's clock shows t' = 50 s. Since the ejecta is moving at v in S, the time in S is t = γ t' (time dilation). Therefore, x = v t = v γ t'.

Which is the same as before. So, x = 0.2c * γ * 50 s. Which gives the same result as before. So, 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But let me check with another approach. Let's compute the spacetime interval. The proper time τ is 50 s. The spacetime interval is invariant:

c² τ² = c² t² - x²

But in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves x = v t, so:

c² τ² = c² t² - v² t² = t² (c² - v²)

Therefore, t = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = γ τ

Which is the time dilation formula. Then, x = v t = v γ τ

So, x = v γ τ = 0.2c * γ * 50 s

Which again gives the same result. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But let me compute this precisely.

First, compute γ:

v = 0.2c

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020620726

So, γ ≈ 1.020620726

Then, t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

Then, x = 0.2c * t

But 0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792.458 km/s ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s

So, x ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ ?

Compute 59,958.4916 * 50 = 2,997,924.58 km

Then, 59,958.4916 * 1.0310363 ≈ 59,958.4916 * 1 = 59,958.4916

Plus 59,958.4916 * 0.0310363 ≈ 59,958.4916 * 0.03 = 1,798.75475

Plus 59,958.4916 * 0.0010363 ≈ 62.14 km

Total ≈ 59,958.4916 + 1,798.75475 + 62.14 ≈ 61,819.38635 km

So total x ≈ 2,997,924.58 + 61,819.38635 ≈ 3,059,743.966 km ≈ 3,059,744 km

Which is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, rounding to three significant figures, 3.06 × 10^6 km.

But the problem states "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let me check if there's another approach where perhaps length contraction is involved. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the Galactic center would be contracted. But the problem is not asking about the distance between the ejecta and the Galactic center, but rather the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame during 50 seconds of its own time.

Therefore, the previous calculation is correct. The answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check the exact value again.

Alternatively, using exact values:

v = 60,000 km/s = 6 × 10^4 km/s

c = 299,792.458 km/s ≈ 3 × 10^5 km/s

But 0.2c = 0.2 × 299,792.458 ≈ 59,958.4916 km/s, which is approximately 6 × 10^4 km/s as given in the problem. So, the problem states 60,000 km/s, which is an exact value. So, perhaps we can take v = 0.2c exactly, with c = 3 × 10^5 km/s. Let's check:

If c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. So, the problem uses c = 3 × 10^5 km/s for simplicity. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

But if we use exact fractions, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798, so γ ≈ 1.0206.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, so that calculations are simpler. Let's check:

If c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 6 × 10^4 km/s = 60,000 km/s.

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206

Then, t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s

Then, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km

But if we use c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, and the exact calculation would be:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

t = 50 s * γ ≈ 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

But since the problem gives v = 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c if c is taken as 3 × 10^5 km/s, then perhaps we can use exact values. Let's see:

If c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, then:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = 5/(2*2.44949) ≈ 5/4.89898 ≈ 1.0206

But sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.89898

Alternatively, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798

So, γ ≈ 1.0206

Therefore, t = 50 s * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km

But if we use more precise c:

c = 299,792.458 km/s

v = 60,000 km/s

Then, v/c = 60,000 / 299,792.458 ≈ 0.200138

So, v/c ≈ 0.200138, so (v/c)^2 ≈ 0.040055

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.040055) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 1 / 0.97976 ≈ 1.0207

So, t ≈ 1.0207 * 50 ≈ 51.035 s

distance = 60,000 * 51.035 ≈ 3,062,100 km

But the problem states the velocity as exactly 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c if c is exactly 300,000 km/s. So, perhaps the problem expects us to use c = 3.0 × 10^5 km/s for simplicity, leading to γ = 1.0206, t = 51.03 s, and distance ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But let's check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, maybe using the velocity addition formula or considering that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. But since both are inertial frames, the relative velocity is the same in both frames, just opposite in direction. So, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. Therefore, the distance is simply velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame. But the time in the Galaxy frame is longer than the proper time in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.

Therefore, the calculation is correct as done before.

Alternatively, if we ignore special relativistic effects and use classical mechanics, the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But since the velocity is 0.2c, relativistic effects are non-negligible. The time dilation factor is about 1.02, so the distance is about 3,061,800 km. Therefore, the answer should take into account the time dilation.

But let me confirm once more. The key is that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. In the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer by γ. Therefore, the distance is v * γ * t'.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. To be precise, using the exact numbers:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

t = 50 s * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

Rounded to three significant figures, that's 3.06 × 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km.

But let me check the exact calculation with c = 3 × 10^5 km/s:

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

t = 50 s * γ ≈ 51.0310363 s

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

But since the problem gives v as exactly 60,000 km/s, and if we take c as exactly 3 × 10^5 km/s, then the calculation is exact:

γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 1.020620726

t = 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (250) / (2*sqrt(6)) = 125 / sqrt(6) ≈ 125 / 2.44949 ≈ 51.031 s

distance = 60,000 * 51.031 ≈ 3,061,860 km

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of exact expression. Let's see:

distance = v * γ * t'

= 0.2c * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)) * 50

= 0.2c * 50 / sqrt(0.96)

= 10c / sqrt(0.96)

But c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, so:

distance = 10 * 3 × 10^5 / sqrt(0.96) km

= 3 × 10^6 / sqrt(0.96) km

But sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5

Therefore, distance = 3 × 10^6 / (2*sqrt(6)/5) = 3 × 10^6 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (15 × 10^6) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (7.5 × 10^6) / sqrt(6)

Rationalizing the denominator:

= (7.5 × 10^6) * sqrt(6) / 6

= (7.5 / 6) × 10^6 × sqrt(6)

= 1.25 × 10^6 × sqrt(6)

sqrt(6) ≈ 2.44949

So, 1.25 × 10^6 × 2.44949 ≈ 3,061,862.5 km

Which matches the previous result.

But since the problem might expect a numerical answer, likely rounded to three significant figures, which would be 3.06 × 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km. However, depending on the problem's expectation, maybe they want the exact expression. But given that the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s (which is exact 0.2c if c=3e5 km/s), and the time is 50 seconds, the answer is 3,061,862 km approximately. But since the problem might use approximate values, perhaps 3.06 million km.

Alternatively, if we use c=3e5 km/s, then:

distance = 0.2c * γ * t' = 0.2*3e5 km/s * (1/sqrt(0.96)) *50 s = 0.2*3e5*50 / sqrt(0.96) km

= 3e5 *10 / sqrt(0.96) km

= 3e6 / sqrt(0.96) km

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798

So, 3e6 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km

But the problem might expect the answer as 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. However, given that the exact calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.061862 x 10^6 km, rounding to three significant figures would be 3.06 x 10^6 km.

But let me check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, and in its own frame, 50 seconds pass. The distance in the Galaxy frame is simply velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame, which is time-dilated. So, yes, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. However, to ensure precision, let's use the exact value of γ and compute the distance.

Alternatively, using the invariant spacetime interval:

In the ejecta's frame, the time between events (start and end of 50 seconds) is Δt' = 50 s, and since the ejecta is stationary in its frame, Δx' = 0. The spacetime interval is:

s² = (cΔt')² - (Δx')² = (c*50)^2

In the Galaxy frame, the spacetime interval is:

s² = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2

Since the interval is invariant:

(c*50)^2 = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2

But in the Galaxy frame, Δx = vΔt, since the ejecta is moving at velocity v.

Therefore:

(c*50)^2 = (cΔt)^2 - (vΔt)^2

=> c²*2500 = Δt²(c² - v²)

=> Δt² = c²*2500 / (c² - v²)

=> Δt = (c*50) / sqrt(c² - v²) = 50 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 50γ

Which is the time dilation formula. Then, Δx = vΔt = v*50γ

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is consistent.

Thus, the distance is v*γ*50. With v=0.2c and γ=1.0206, the distance is approximately 3,061,800 km.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Given the problem's data, the most precise answer within three significant figures is 3.06 × 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. However, the exact calculation gives about 3,061,862 km, which rounds to 3.06 × 10^6 km.

But let me check once more with exact numbers:

v = 60,000 km/s

t' = 50 s

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60000 / 299792.458)^2)

First, compute v/c:

60000 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.200138

v²/c² ≈ (0.200138)^2 ≈ 0.040055

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.040055) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 1 / 0.97976 ≈ 1.0207

t = γ * 50 ≈ 1.0207 * 50 ≈ 51.035 s

distance = 60,000 * 51.035 ≈ 3,062,100 km

But this is with more precise c. However, the problem states the velocity as exactly 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c if c is 300,000 km/s. So, if we take c=3e5 km/s, then:

v/c = 0.2 exactly

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

t = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 s

distance = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

Rounded to three significant figures, this is 3.06 × 10^6 km.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. The problem might expect the answer in meters or kilometers, but since the velocity is given in km/s, the answer is in kilometers. So, the final answer is approximately 3.06 × 10^6 km, which can be written as 3,060,000 km. However, to be precise, it's 3,061,862 km, but likely rounded to three significant figures, 3.06 million km.

But let me check if the problem expects a different answer. For example, if they consider that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c, so the distance covered in the ejecta's frame is 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, and then applying length contraction. But that would be incorrect because the question asks for the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame, not the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer due to time dilation. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * γ * 50 s, which is the same as before.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, the boxed answer should be \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.

Then, distance is v * t = 0.2c * γ * τ. \n\nBut let\'s compute this. \n\nFirst, compute γ for v = 0.2c. \n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. \n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo, t = γ * τ ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance in Galaxy frame: v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nBut maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta\'s frame, the distance the Galaxy center travels in 50 seconds is 0.2c * 50 s. But since in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving, we need to use length contraction. Wait, perhaps the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy frame. \n\nWait, the question is: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"\n\nSo, in the ejecta\'s frame, 50 seconds pass. In that time, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so the distance covered by the Galaxy center in the ejecta\'s frame is 0.2c * 50 s. But the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy\'s frame. \n\nBut in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is not 50 seconds, but longer due to time dilation. So, the time in Galaxy\'s frame is t = γ * τ, where τ is 50 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * t. \n\nBut that\'s the same as before. So, 0.2c * γ * τ. \n\nBut let\'s compute that. \n\n0.2c is 60,000 km/s. \n\nγ ≈ 1.0206. \n\nSo, 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check if there\'s another approach. \n\nAlternatively, using Lorentz transformation for coordinates. \n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the Galaxy center is moving at -0.2c. The event is the ejecta traveling for 50 seconds in its own frame. Let\'s say in S\', the ejecta is at rest, so the Galaxy center moves from x\' = x0\' to x\' = x0\' + v * t\', where v is -0.2c. But the distance the Galaxy center moves in S\' is 0.2c * 50 s. But the problem is to find the distance the ejecta moves in S (Galaxy frame) during the same interval. \n\nBut in S, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time in S is t = γ (t\' + (v x\') / c²). But since the events are at the same position in S\' (the ejecta is at rest in S\'), so x\' = 0. Therefore, t = γ t\'. \n\nTherefore, the time in S is γ * t\', so t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s. Then, distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering classical physics, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is relativistic. So, relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the answer must be calculated using special relativity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting length contraction. In the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy\'s frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance in the Galaxy\'s frame would be longer. \n\nWait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy\'s frame. So, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time elapsed in the Galaxy\'s frame is t = γ * τ, where τ is 50 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * t. \n\nAlternatively, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, then in 50 seconds of its own time, how much time passes in the Galaxy\'s frame? \n\nYes, that\'s the time dilation. So, t = γ τ. Then, distance is v t = v γ τ. \n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: \n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1.0206\n\nt = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nSo, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check the exact value. \n\nFirst, compute γ precisely. \n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, t ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds\n\nThen, distance: 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363\n\nCalculate 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000\n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 ≈ 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.0310363 ≈ 1,862.178\n\nTotal ≈ 3,000,000 + 1,862.178 ≈ 3,001,862.178 km\n\nWait, that\'s different from before. Wait, 51.0310363 is 50 * 1.020620726. So, 50 * 1.0206 is 51.03. Then, 60,000 * 51.03 is 3,061,800. But 51.0310363 is 51.0310363, so 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 60,000 * 50 + 60,000 * 1.0310363 = 3,000,000 + 61,862.178 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check if the problem is expecting a different approach. For example, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and in its own frame, 50 seconds pass, then the distance in the Galaxy frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame, which is time-dilated. So, yes, that\'s the same as above. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c, so the distance covered in the ejecta\'s frame is 0.2c * 50 s. Then, in the Galaxy\'s frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance would be longer. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy\'s frame. So, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time in the Galaxy\'s frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, the distance is 0.2c * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy\'s frame. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 s. Then, in the Galaxy\'s frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance (in the Galaxy\'s frame) would be γ times that. \n\nBut let\'s see. \n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center moves a distance of d\' = v * t\' = 0.2c * 50 s. \n\nIn the Galaxy\'s frame, this distance is d = d\' * γ, because length contraction works the other way. If in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy is moving, then the distance measured in the ejecta\'s frame is contracted. So, the proper length (in the Galaxy\'s frame) would be longer by γ. \n\nTherefore, d = γ * d\' = γ * 0.2c * 50. \n\nWhich is the same as before: 0.2c * γ * 50 = 0.2c * t, where t = γ * 50. \n\nSo, same result. \n\nTherefore, either way, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50. \n\nSo, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. \n\nγ ≈ 1.0206. \n\nSo, 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nBut let\'s compute it more accurately. \n\nFirst, compute 0.2c * 50 s. \n\n0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792 km/s ≈ 59,958.4 km/s. \n\nBut the problem states 60,000 km/s, so perhaps we can take 0.2c as exactly 60,000 km/s. \n\nSo, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. \n\nBut then multiplied by γ ≈ 1.0206, so 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s a mistake here. \n\nWait, the problem says "when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame". So, the time interval in the ejecta\'s frame is 50 seconds. The distance in the Galaxy\'s frame is the velocity of the ejecta (0.2c) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy\'s frame. The time in the Galaxy\'s frame is longer due to time dilation. \n\nAlternatively, the proper time is the time in the ejecta\'s frame. The proper time τ is related to the time in the Galaxy\'s frame t by τ = t / γ. Therefore, t = τ * γ. \n\nTherefore, the distance is v * t = v * γ * τ. \n\nYes, that\'s the same as before. \n\nSo, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50. \n\nTherefore, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. \n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo, 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km. \n\nSo, approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer. Let\'s compute it more precisely. \n\nFirst, compute γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo, exact value is 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)). \n\nBut perhaps we can write the answer in terms of exact expressions. \n\nBut the problem probably expects a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved classically, but given the speed is 0.2c, relativistic effects are non-negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is simply 0.2c * 50 s, but that would be 3,000,000 km. But that would ignore time dilation. \n\nBut the problem states that both frames are inertial, so we must use special relativity. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. \n\nGiven v = 0.2c, τ = 50 s. \n\nt = γ τ. \n\ndistance = v t = v γ τ. \n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. \n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo, distance = 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km. \n\nRounded to, say, three significant figures, that\'s 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects more precise calculation. Let\'s compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9797959. \n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.020620726. \n\nSo, 1.020620726 * 50 = 51.0310363. \n\nMultiply by 60,000: 60,000 * 51.0310363. \n\nFirst, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. \n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 = 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.0310363 = 60,000 + 1,862.178 = 61,862.178. \n\nTotal distance: 3,000,000 + 61,862.178 = 3,061,862.178 km. \n\nSo, approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer in kilometers with three significant figures. The given speed is 60,000 km/s, which is two significant figures (if the trailing zeros are not significant), but maybe it\'s three (60.0 thousand). The time is 50 seconds, which is one or two significant figures. But the answer should probably be given with two significant figures. \n\nWait, the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s. If that\'s three significant figures (60.0 thousand), then the answer should be three significant figures. 3,061,862 is approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is three significant figures. \n\nAlternatively, if the velocity is two significant figures (6.0 x 10^4 km/s), then the answer would be two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut the problem states "60 000 km/s" with a space, which might be the European way of writing 60,000, so three significant figures. \n\nBut maybe the answer is expected to be exact. Let\'s see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use the velocity addition formula. Wait, but the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy\'s frame is given as 0.2c. The problem states: "From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it." So, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c. \n\nIn special relativity, if the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c in the ejecta\'s frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy\'s frame. So, the velocity is reciprocal. \n\nTherefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy\'s frame is 0.2c. \n\nTherefore, the distance is 0.2c multiplied by the time in the Galaxy\'s frame. \n\nBut the time in the ejecta\'s frame is 50 seconds. So, using time dilation, the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is t = γ * τ. \n\nTherefore, distance = 0.2c * γ * τ. \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3,061,862 km. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s another way. \n\nAlternatively, using spacetime intervals. The spacetime interval between the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta\'s frame) is invariant. \n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the two events are at the same location (since the ejecta is at rest), so the spacetime interval is purely time-like: (c τ)^2 = (c t\')^2 - (x\')^2. Since x\' = 0, the interval is c τ. \n\nIn the Galaxy\'s frame (S), the interval is (c t)^2 - (d)^2, where d is the distance traveled. \n\nTherefore, (c τ)^2 = (c t)^2 - d^2. \n\nBut d = v t, so substituting:\n\n(c τ)^2 = (c t)^2 - (v t)^2 = t^2 (c² - v²)\n\nTherefore, t = c τ / sqrt(c² - v²) = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = γ τ. \n\nThen, d = v t = v γ τ. \n\nWhich is the same result as before. \n\nTherefore, the distance is v γ τ. \n\nSo, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50 s. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check the exact value again. \n\nv = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s\n\nγ = 1.020620726\n\nτ = 50 s\n\nd = 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 3,061,862.178 km\n\nRounded to three significant figures, 3.06 x 10^6 km. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer in meters or with more precision. However, given the inputs, three significant figures are appropriate. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem states 60,000 km/s as exact, then the answer is 3,061,862 km. But likely, the answer is expected to be written in scientific notation with three significant figures. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy moves 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then, in the Galaxy\'s frame, this distance is length-contracted, so the actual distance is longer by γ. \n\nTherefore, distance in Galaxy\'s frame = 3,000,000 km * γ ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. \n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 3.06 x 10^6 kilometers. \n\nBut let me check if the problem might have a different approach. For example, using relativistic velocity addition. But since the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames, perhaps it\'s straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had different velocities, but in this case, it\'s reciprocal. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ejecta travels approximately \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446791, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5142, prompt_tokens=532, total_tokens=5674, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   - The time experienced by the ejecta (proper time) is 50 seconds.
   - The Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is:
     \[
     t = \gamma \times \tau = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is 0.2c (60,000 km/s).
   - The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times t = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.03 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,862 \text{ km}
     \]

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame is approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6}\) kilometers.

Alternatively, since the problem states both frames are inertial and the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, perhaps the time experienced by the ejecta (50 seconds) is the proper time. Then, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. The distance would be velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. 

But wait, proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object. If the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, then the proper time (τ) is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) would be γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Then, the distance would be u * t = 0.2c * γ * τ. 

But let's check. The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v = 0.2c, v²/c² = 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98, so γ ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0206. Therefore, t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * 51.03 s. 

But 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. But wait, that's 3.06 million kilometers. But maybe this is the correct approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c. The time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. So, t = γ * τ. Then, distance is v * t = 0.2c * γ * τ. 

But let's compute this. 

First, compute γ for v = 0.2c. 

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. 

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. 

So, t = γ * τ ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds. 

Then, distance in Galaxy frame: v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. 

But maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center travels in 50 seconds is 0.2c * 50 s. But since in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, we need to use length contraction. Wait, perhaps the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy frame. 

Wait, the question is: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. In that time, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so the distance covered by the Galaxy center in the ejecta's frame is 0.2c * 50 s. But the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. 

But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is not 50 seconds, but longer due to time dilation. So, the time in Galaxy's frame is t = γ * τ, where τ is 50 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * t. 

But that's the same as before. So, 0.2c * γ * τ. 

But let's compute that. 

0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 

γ ≈ 1.0206. 

So, 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

But perhaps the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. But let me check if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, using Lorentz transformation for coordinates. 

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving at -0.2c. The event is the ejecta traveling for 50 seconds in its own frame. Let's say in S', the ejecta is at rest, so the Galaxy center moves from x' = x0' to x' = x0' + v * t', where v is -0.2c. But the distance the Galaxy center moves in S' is 0.2c * 50 s. But the problem is to find the distance the ejecta moves in S (Galaxy frame) during the same interval. 

But in S, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time in S is t = γ (t' + (v x') / c²). But since the events are at the same position in S' (the ejecta is at rest in S'), so x' = 0. Therefore, t = γ t'. 

Therefore, the time in S is γ * t', so t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s. Then, distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering classical physics, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is relativistic. So, relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the answer must be calculated using special relativity. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting length contraction. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving 0.2c * 50 s. But in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. 

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is t = γ * τ, where τ is 50 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * t. 

Alternatively, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, then in 50 seconds of its own time, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? 

Yes, that's the time dilation. So, t = γ τ. Then, distance is v t = v γ τ. 

So, plugging in the numbers: 

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1.0206

t = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s

distance = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km

So, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check the exact value. 

First, compute γ precisely. 

γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020620726

So, t ≈ 1.020620726 * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

Then, distance: 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363

Calculate 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000

60,000 * 1.0310363 ≈ 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.0310363 ≈ 1,862.178

Total ≈ 3,000,000 + 1,862.178 ≈ 3,001,862.178 km

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, 51.0310363 is 50 * 1.020620726. So, 50 * 1.0206 is 51.03. Then, 60,000 * 51.03 is 3,061,800. But 51.0310363 is 51.0310363, so 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 60,000 * 50 + 60,000 * 1.0310363 = 3,000,000 + 61,862.178 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km. 

So, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check if the problem is expecting a different approach. For example, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and in its own frame, 50 seconds pass, then the distance in the Galaxy frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame, which is time-dilated. So, yes, that's the same as above. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c, so the distance covered in the ejecta's frame is 0.2c * 50 s. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance would be longer. 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, the distance is 0.2c * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. 

Alternatively, if we consider that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 s. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. So, the actual distance (in the Galaxy's frame) would be γ times that. 

But let's see. 

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves a distance of d' = v * t' = 0.2c * 50 s. 

In the Galaxy's frame, this distance is d = d' * γ, because length contraction works the other way. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving, then the distance measured in the ejecta's frame is contracted. So, the proper length (in the Galaxy's frame) would be longer by γ. 

Therefore, d = γ * d' = γ * 0.2c * 50. 

Which is the same as before: 0.2c * γ * 50 = 0.2c * t, where t = γ * 50. 

So, same result. 

Therefore, either way, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50. 

So, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 

γ ≈ 1.0206. 

So, 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

But let's compute it more accurately. 

First, compute 0.2c * 50 s. 

0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792 km/s ≈ 59,958.4 km/s. 

But the problem states 60,000 km/s, so perhaps we can take 0.2c as exactly 60,000 km/s. 

So, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. 

But then multiplied by γ ≈ 1.0206, so 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check if there's a mistake here. 

Wait, the problem says "when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame". So, the time interval in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. The distance in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity of the ejecta (0.2c) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. 

Alternatively, the proper time is the time in the ejecta's frame. The proper time τ is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame t by τ = t / γ. Therefore, t = τ * γ. 

Therefore, the distance is v * t = v * γ * τ. 

Yes, that's the same as before. 

So, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50. 

Therefore, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. 

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. 

So, 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km. 

So, approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let's compute it more precisely. 

First, compute γ:

γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.020620726. 

So, exact value is 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)). 

But perhaps we can write the answer in terms of exact expressions. 

But the problem probably expects a numerical answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved classically, but given the speed is 0.2c, relativistic effects are non-negligible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is simply 0.2c * 50 s, but that would be 3,000,000 km. But that would ignore time dilation. 

But the problem states that both frames are inertial, so we must use special relativity. 

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check with exact numbers. 

Given v = 0.2c, τ = 50 s. 

t = γ τ. 

distance = v t = v γ τ. 

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. 

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726. 

So, distance = 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km. 

Rounded to, say, three significant figures, that's 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But maybe the problem expects more precise calculation. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. 

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9797959. 

Therefore, γ ≈ 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.020620726. 

So, 1.020620726 * 50 = 51.0310363. 

Multiply by 60,000: 60,000 * 51.0310363. 

First, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 

60,000 * 1.0310363 = 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.0310363 = 60,000 + 1,862.178 = 61,862.178. 

Total distance: 3,000,000 + 61,862.178 = 3,061,862.178 km. 

So, approximately 3,061,862 km. 

But the problem might want the answer in kilometers with three significant figures. The given speed is 60,000 km/s, which is two significant figures (if the trailing zeros are not significant), but maybe it's three (60.0 thousand). The time is 50 seconds, which is one or two significant figures. But the answer should probably be given with two significant figures. 

Wait, the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s. If that's three significant figures (60.0 thousand), then the answer should be three significant figures. 3,061,862 is approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is three significant figures. 

Alternatively, if the velocity is two significant figures (6.0 x 10^4 km/s), then the answer would be two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km. 

But the problem states "60 000 km/s" with a space, which might be the European way of writing 60,000, so three significant figures. 

But maybe the answer is expected to be exact. Let's see. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use the velocity addition formula. Wait, but the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given as 0.2c. The problem states: "From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it." So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c. 

In special relativity, if the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame. So, the velocity is reciprocal. 

Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is 0.2c. 

Therefore, the distance is 0.2c multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. 

But the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So, using time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = γ * τ. 

Therefore, distance = 0.2c * γ * τ. 

Which is the same as before. 

Therefore, the answer is 3,061,862 km. 

But let me check if there's another way. 

Alternatively, using spacetime intervals. The spacetime interval between the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame) is invariant. 

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events are at the same location (since the ejecta is at rest), so the spacetime interval is purely time-like: (c τ)^2 = (c t')^2 - (x')^2. Since x' = 0, the interval is c τ. 

In the Galaxy's frame (S), the interval is (c t)^2 - (d)^2, where d is the distance traveled. 

Therefore, (c τ)^2 = (c t)^2 - d^2. 

But d = v t, so substituting:

(c τ)^2 = (c t)^2 - (v t)^2 = t^2 (c² - v²)

Therefore, t = c τ / sqrt(c² - v²) = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = γ τ. 

Then, d = v t = v γ τ. 

Which is the same result as before. 

Therefore, the distance is v γ τ. 

So, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50 s. 

Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

So, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check the exact value again. 

v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s

γ = 1.020620726

τ = 50 s

d = 60,000 * 1.020620726 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 3,061,862.178 km

Rounded to three significant figures, 3.06 x 10^6 km. 

But the problem might want the answer in meters or with more precision. However, given the inputs, three significant figures are appropriate. 

Alternatively, if the problem states 60,000 km/s as exact, then the answer is 3,061,862 km. But likely, the answer is expected to be written in scientific notation with three significant figures. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. 

But let me check once more. 

Alternatively, if the problem is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves 0.2c * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is length-contracted, so the actual distance is longer by γ. 

Therefore, distance in Galaxy's frame = 3,000,000 km * γ ≈ 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km. 

Same result. 

Therefore, the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. 

So, the final answer is approximately 3.06 x 10^6 kilometers. 

But let me check if the problem might have a different approach. For example, using relativistic velocity addition. But since the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames, perhaps it's straightforward. 

Alternatively, if the problem had different velocities, but in this case, it's reciprocal. 

Therefore, the answer is 3.06 million kilometers. 

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.
