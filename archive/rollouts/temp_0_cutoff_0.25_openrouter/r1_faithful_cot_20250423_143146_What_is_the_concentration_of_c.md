The concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution can be determined using the stability constant (Kf) of the Ca-EDTA complex. The dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large Kf value. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Reaction and Expression:**
   \[
   \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
   \]
   The stability constant is:
   \[
   K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}
   \]

2. **Let [Ca²⁺] = x:**
   Since the complex dissociates 1:1, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x. The concentration of undissociated complex is approximately 0.02 M (as x is negligible).

3. **Substitute into Kf:**
   \[
   5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

4. **Solve for x:**
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \\
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Significant Figures:**
   Given Kf has 1 significant figure, the answer is rounded to **6 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

**Answer:**  
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}.

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, right? And the temperature is 25°C, which probably means standard conditions. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, right?

Let me recall. The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The stability constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA, that means the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it will produce Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. However, because EDTA is a strong chelating agent and the Kf is very large (5x10^10), the dissociation should be minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ should be very low.

But how do I calculate it exactly? Let me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of Ca²⁺ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, because they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio. The concentration of Ca-EDTA²⁻ would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5x10^10

So, 0.02 / x² = 5x10^10

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(10^-13) = 2*(10^-6.5). But 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. So 2*3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M. So approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. Wait, but let me check the math again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5x10^10 is 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 0.004x10^-10 = 4x10^-13. Then the square root of 4x10^-13 is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 1/sqrt(10^13), but maybe it's easier to write it as 2 x 10^(-13/2) = 2 x 10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16 x 10^-7, so 2 x 3.16 x 10^-7 ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Is that right?

Wait, but let me check if my assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid. If x is ~6.3e-7, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.01999994, which is very close to 0.02, so the approximation is definitely valid. So that's good.

Alternatively, if I didn't make that approximation, the equation would be:

Kf = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) = 5e10

But since x is so small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so the approximation holds. Therefore, the answer should be x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

But maybe I should express it more precisely. Let's compute 0.02 / 5e10:

0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Since 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7, so 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7 M. So approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Rounding to two significant figures, since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure?) Wait, Kf is 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. But the concentration is given as 0.02 M, which is two significant figures. Hmm, the problem says 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, and KCa-EDTA is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig. So the answer should probably be given to one significant figure, but maybe two. Let me check.

If Kf is one sig fig, then the answer should be one sig fig. But the initial concentration is two. Hmm, in such cases, the rule is that the number of significant figures in the result is determined by the least precise measurement. Since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs), the result should be reported with 1 sig fig. So 6e-7 M. But maybe the problem expects two sig figs. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the Kf is written as 5.0x10^10, but it's written as 5x10^10. So one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the answer is expected to be more precise. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as 2 x 10^-6.5, but that's not a standard form. Alternatively, using exact exponent:

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 2 * 10^-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 6.3245 * 10^-7. So 6.3 x 10^-7 M. But given the sig figs, maybe 6 x 10^-7 M. However, sometimes in such problems, even with one sig fig in K, if the concentration is given with two, they might expect two. But I'm not sure. Let me see if there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should write the exact expression. The concentration of Ca²⁺ is sqrt( (0.02) / Kf ). So sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. But converting 10^-6.5 to scientific notation: 10^-6.5 = 3.1623e-7, so 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7. So approximately 6.3e-7 M. If we take two sig figs, 6.3e-7. If one, 6e-7. The problem says "0.02 M" which is two sig figs, and K is 5e10 (one sig fig). So the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6e-7 M. But maybe the answer is expected to be 6.3e-7. Let me check similar problems.

Wait, another way: Let's write the expression again.

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the complex dissociates into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ in a 1:1 ratio, let [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x. Then, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = 0.02 / x² = 5e10

Therefore, x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M

So, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Given the significant figures, maybe 6 x 10^-7 M. But perhaps the answer is expected to be in two sig figs because 0.02 has two. However, Kf has one. In such cases, the rule is that when multiplying or dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement. Here, 0.02 (2 sig figs) divided by 5e10 (1 sig fig) would result in 1 sig fig. So the answer should be 6e-7 M. But maybe the problem expects two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Kf is considered to have two sig figs? Wait, the problem states KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. If it's written as 5x10^10, that's one sig fig. If it were 5.0x10^10, that's two. So I think it's one. Therefore, the answer should be one sig fig. So 6e-7 M. But I need to check if that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Let me see. If I write 6.3e-7, that's two sig figs. But given that K is one sig fig, perhaps it's better to write 6e-7. However, in practice, sometimes people give more decimals even if sig figs are limited. But I think the strict answer would be 6e-7 M. However, let me check with exact calculation.

Wait, let's do it without approximation. Let's not assume x is negligible. So:

Kf = (0.02 - x) / (x²) = 5e10

But since Kf is so large, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x is negligible. But let's check. If x is 6.3e-7, then 0.02 - 6.3e-7 ≈ 0.01999937, which is still 0.02 for all practical purposes. So the approximation is valid. Therefore, the answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which rounds to 6e-7 M with one sig fig.

But maybe the question expects the answer in two sig figs, considering 0.02 has two. Let me think. The concentration is given as 0.02 M (two decimal places, but in terms of sig figs, it's two: the 2 is the second sig fig). The Kf is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig. When you multiply or divide, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least. So 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13, which is one sig fig (since 5e10 is one). Then sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is still one sig fig. So the answer should be 6e-7 M (one sig fig). Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6 x 10^-7 M.

But to confirm, let's see. If Kf were 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), then the answer would have two sig figs. But since it's 5x10^10, one sig fig. So yes, 6e-7 M. However, sometimes people might present it as 6.3e-7 for better accuracy, but strictly following sig figs, it's 6e-7. I think in the context of a problem like this, they might want the more precise answer even if sig figs are limited, but I'm not sure. Let me check similar example problems.

For example, if you have a similar problem where Kf is 1e10 and concentration is 0.01 M, the answer would be sqrt(0.01 / 1e10) = sqrt(1e-12) = 1e-6, so 1e-6 M. So one sig fig. So following that, here it's 6e-7. So I think the answer is 6 x 10^-7 M. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. Yes. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So approximately 6.3e-7, but with one sig fig, 6e-7. So I think that's the answer.

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, right? And the temperature is 25°C, which probably means standard conditions. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, right?

Let me recall. The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The stability constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA, that means the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it will produce Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. However, because EDTA is a strong chelating agent and the Kf is very large (5x10^10), the dissociation should be minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ should be very low.

But how do I calculate it exactly? Let me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of Ca²⁺ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, because they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio. The concentration of Ca-EDTA²⁻ would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5x10^10

So, 0.02 / x² = 5x10^10

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(10^-13) = 2*(10^-6.5). But 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. So 2*3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M. So approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. Wait, but let me check the math again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5x10^10 is 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 0.004x10^-10 = 4x10^-13. Then the square root of 4x10^-13 is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 1/sqrt(10^13), but maybe it's easier to write it as 2 x 10^(-13/2) = 2 x 10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16 x 10^-7, so 2 x 3.16 x

I need to determine the calcium ion concentration in a solution containing 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA complex. Since the pH is ideal, EDTA is fully deprotonated, and we're at standard conditions (25°C). The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5×10^10, which represents the equilibrium constant for complex formation.

The Ca-EDTA complex formation can be expressed as:
Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

With the stability constant equation:
Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Starting with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA, some will dissociate into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. However, since EDTA is a strong chelating agent with a large Kf value, dissociation should be minimal, resulting in very low free Ca²⁺ concentration.

To calculate this exactly, I'll let x represent the Ca²⁺ concentration. Since Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ dissociate in a 1:1 ratio, [EDTA⁴⁻] would also be x. The Ca-EDTA²⁻ concentration would be 0.02 - x, but since x is likely very small compared to 0.02, I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Substituting into the Kf expression:
5×10^10 = 0.02 / (x × x)

Solving for x²:
x² = 0.02 / (5×10^10) = (2×10^-2) / (5×10^10) = (2/5)×10^-12 = 0.4×10^-12 = 4×10^-13

Taking the square root:
x = √(4×10^-13) = 2×10^-6.5

Working this out: 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 × 10^-0.5 ≈ 10^-6 × 0.3162 ≈ 3.162×10^-7
So 2×3.162×10^-7 ≈ 6.324×10^-7 M, or approximately 6.32×10^-7 M.

Let me verify: 0.02 divided by 5×10^10 equals 4×10^-13, and the square root is 2×10^-6.5, which equals 2×3.16×10^-7 or about 6.32×10^-7 M.

Alright, I need to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal, implying that EDTA is completely deprotonated, and the temperature is 25°C, which likely indicates standard conditions. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. This stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, correct?

Let me think this through. The formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The stability constant Kf is defined as:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Given that the solution is 0.02 M in terms of stoichiometric Ca-EDTA, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. However, upon dissociation, it will produce Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Because EDTA is a strong chelating agent and the Kf is very large (5x10^10), dissociation should be minimal. Thus, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ should be extremely low.

So, how can I calculate it exactly? Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ as x. Consequently, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be x, due to the 1:1 dissociation ratio. Therefore, the concentration of Ca-EDTA²⁻ will be approximately 0.02 - x. Since Kf is very large, x will be negligible compared to 0.02, allowing us to approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 for simplicity.

Inserting these into the Kf equation:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5x10^10

Thus, 0.02 / x² = 5x10^10

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Now, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Hang on, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(10^-13) = 2 * (10^-6.5). But 10^-6.5 is equal to 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. Thus, 2 * 3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M. So it's approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. Let me just verify the calculations once more.

Alright, 0.02 divided by 5x10^10 equals 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 0.004x10^-10 = 4x10^-13. Therefore, the square root of 4x10^-13 is 2x10^-6.5. But expressing 10^-6.5 as 1/sqrt(10^13), it might be clearer to write it as 2 x 10^(-13/2) = 2 x 10^-6.5. Considering 10^-6.5 is roughly 3.16 x 10^-7, then 2 x 3.16 ≈ 6.32x10^-7.

So sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 = 2*31622.7766 ≈ 63245.553\n\nTherefore, x = ( -1 + 63245.553 ) / (1e11 ) ≈ 63244.553 / 1e11 ≈ 6.324e-7 M. So that's 6.324 x 10^-7 M, which matches the initial approximation.

Alternatively, 6.32 x 10^-7 M if we want to be more precise.

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start with the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant \( K_f \) is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}
\]

Assuming the dissociation of Ca-EDTA is minimal, let the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) be \( x \). The concentration of \( \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \) is approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2} = 5 \times 10^{10}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}
\]

Verification using the quadratic equation confirms the approximation is valid. Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

10^-7 = 6.32 x 10^-7 M. So, the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But let me verify if the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid. If x is ~6.3e-7, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.01999994, which is very close to 0.02. So the approximation is definitely valid here. So the error introduced by the approximation is negligible.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Let me check if that makes sense. Since Kf is very large, the complex is very stable, so the free Ca²⁺ should be very low, which matches with 6.3e-7. That seems reasonable.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the exact equation without approximation. Let's see:

Kf = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) = 5e10

But since x is so small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so the approximation is valid. Solving exactly would give:

0.02 - x = 5e10 * x²

But rearranged as 5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's solve it.

Quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c = 0. Here, a = 5e10, b = 1, c = -0.02.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Plugging in:

x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*5e10*(-0.02))]/(2*5e10)

Calculate discriminant:

sqrt(1 + 4*5e10*0.02) = sqrt(1 + 4e9*0.02) = sqrt(1 + 8e7) ≈ sqrt(8e7) ≈ approx 8944.27 (since sqrt(8e7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(1e7) = 2.828*3162.28 ≈ 8944.27)

So x = [-1 ± 8944.27]/(1e11)

We discard the negative root because concentration can't be negative:

x = (8944.27 - 1)/1e11 ≈ 8943.27 / 1e11 ≈ 8.94327e-8

Wait, that's approximately 8.94e-8 M. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, this is confusing. Wait, when I approximated, I got 6.3e-7, but solving the quadratic gives 8.94e-8. That's an order of magnitude difference. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me check again.

The equation is:

5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0

So a = 5e10, b = 1, c = -0.02

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(5e10)*(-0.02) = 1 + 4*5e10*0.02

Calculate 4*5e10*0.02 = 4*0.02*5e10 = 0.08*5e10 = 4e9

So D = 1 + 4e9 ≈ 4e9

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 = 2*31622.7766 ≈ 63245.553

So x = [-1 ± 63245.553]/(2*5e10) = [-1 ± 63245.553]/1e11

Taking the positive root:

x = (63245.553 - 1)/1e11 ≈ 63244.553 / 1e11 ≈ 6.3244553e-7

Which is approximately 6.32e-7 M, which matches the initial approximation. Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah! Wait, in my first quadratic calculation, I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me check again.

Original discriminant calculation:

sqrt(1 + 4*5e10*0.02) = sqrt(1 + 4*1e9) = sqrt(1 + 4e9) ≈ sqrt(4e9) because 4e9 is much larger than 1. So sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 = 2*31622.7766 ≈ 63245.553

Therefore, x = ( -1 + 63245.553 ) / (1e11 ) ≈ 63244.553 / 1e11 ≈ 6.324e-7 M. So that's 6.324 x 10^-7 M, which matches the initial approximation. So my first quadratic solution was wrong because I miscalculated the 4*5e10*0.02. It's 4*5e10*0.02 = 0.08e10 = 8e8? Wait, no:

Wait, 4*5e10*0.02 = 4*0.02*5e10 = 0.08*5e10 = 0.4e10 = 4e9. Yes, that's correct. So sqrt(4e9) is 63245.553. So the correct value is ~6.32e-7. So the approximation was correct, and my first quadratic attempt had an error in calculation. So the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But let me check with another approach. Since Kf is 5e10, which is the formation constant. The dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf = 2e-11.

The dissociation is Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

So Kd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 2e-11

Assuming that [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M, then:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * (1e-6 / sqrt(10)) ≈ 2 * 1e-6 / 3.162 ≈ 6.32e-7 M

Same result. So this confirms it. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But let me express it in scientific notation properly. 6.3e-7 M is 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Alternatively, 6.32 x 10^-7 M if we want to be more precise. But since the given Kf is 5e10, which has one significant figure (well, 5x10^10 is one significant figure), but 0.02 M has two significant figures. So maybe we should report two significant figures. So 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

Alternatively, if Kf is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure, then the answer should be one significant figure, which would be 6 x 10^-7 M. But the problem states KCa-EDTA as 5x10^10. If that's considered two significant figures (if the 5 is exact), but usually 5x10^10 is one significant figure. Hmm. The initial concentration is 0.02 M, which is two significant figures.

But given the data, two significant figures is appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is written as 2 x 10^-6.5 M, but that's not standard. So converting 6.3e-7 M is 6.3 x 10^-7 M, which is 0.63 x 10^-6 M, or 0.63 µM. But in terms of concentration, 6.3e-7 M is acceptable.

So, after all that, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA solution at pH 10 and 25°C is calculated using the stability constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Equilibrium Expression:**
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \quad K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]

2. **Let \( x = [\text{Ca}^{2+}] \):**  
   Since dissociation is minimal, assume \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \), and \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \).

3. **Substitute into \( K_f \):**
   \[
   5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The concentration of free calcium ions is **6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

In such cases, the number of significant figures in the answer is determined by the least precise measurement.

But maybe the problem expects two sig figs. Let me check the original numbers again. The problem states 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, and Kf is 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one sig fig. So, 6x10^-7 M. But in my calculation, I got 6.32x10^-7. So, 6x10^-7. Alternatively, if the problem allows two sig figs, maybe 6.3x10^-7. But given the Kf is one sig fig, perhaps 6x10^-7 is better. However, in some contexts, constants are considered exact, so maybe 0.02 is two sig figs. Hmm. The problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". The 0.02 has two sig figs, and Kf is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig). So, the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 is 6.32x10^-7. So, 6.3x10^-7. If we take two sig figs, 6.3x10^-7. If one, 6x10^-7. The problem says "0.02 M", which is two sig figs, but Kf is 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one sig fig. So, 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7. Let me check some references. For example, in analytical chemistry, when dealing with such calculations, sometimes the stability constant is considered to have one significant figure, but if the concentration is given with two, perhaps the answer is given with two. But in most cases, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise value. Since Kf is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, in practice, people might report it as 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. The problem might expect the exact value, so perhaps 2x10^-6.5, but that\'s not a standard form. Alternatively, 6.3x10^-7. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5x10^10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 6.5 in the exponent is 6 + 0.5, so 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316. So, 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. So, 6.3e-7. So, 6.3x10^-7 M. Since 0.02 has two sig figs, and Kf has one, but the answer is determined by the least number of sig figs, which is one. So, 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. The problem might not care about significant figures and just wants the exact value. Let me check the exact calculation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the answer as 2x10^-6.5, but that\'s not standard. So, converting 10^-6.5 to 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 = 6.32x10^-7. So, 6.32x10^-7 M. Rounding to two significant figures, 6.3x10^-7. If the problem expects two sig figs, that\'s the answer. If one, 6x10^-7. Since the problem states 0.02 M (two sig figs) and Kf as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check if the approximation is correct. Let me redo the calculation without approximating 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\nIf I don\'t make that approximation, then:\n\nKf = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) = 5e10\n\nSo, 0.02 - x = 5e10 * x^2\n\nRearranging:\n\n5e10 x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let\'s solve it.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 5e10, b = 1, c = -0.02\n\nDiscriminant D = b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(5e10)*(-0.02) = 1 + 4*(5e10)*(0.02) = 1 + 4*(1e9) = 1 + 4e9 ≈ 4e9\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 = 2*3.162e4 ≈ 6.324e4\n\nThus, x = [-1 ± 6.324e4] / (2*5e10)\n\nSince the negative root would give a negative concentration, we take the positive root:\n\nx = [ -1 + 6.324e4 ] / (1e11) ≈ (6.324e4 - 1)/1e11 ≈ 6.324e4 / 1e11 ≈ 6.324e-7\n\nWhich is approximately 6.324x10^-7 M, which matches our previous approximation. Therefore, even without the approximation, the result is the same. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M, which rounds to 6.3x10^-7 M with two significant figures or 6x10^-7 with one. Since the problem gives Kf as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 M (2 sig figs), the answer should be given to one significant figure. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in some textbooks or contexts, when the concentration is given with more sig figs, they might retain more. But given that Kf is only one sig fig, the precision is limited by that. So, 6x10^-7 M.\n\nBut let me check another approach. The formula for the concentration of the metal ion in a 1:1 complex is:\n\n[M] = sqrt( [ML] / Kf )\n\nBut wait, in this case, [ML] is 0.02 M. So, [Ca²⁺] = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Since the problem may expect the answer in two sig figs, given that 0.02 is two, but Kf is one. Hmm. Maybe the answer is 6x10^-7. Alternatively, the problem might not care about sig figs and just wants the numerical value. In that case, 6.3x10^-7. But since the user hasn\'t specified, perhaps present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M, noting that it\'s approximately. Alternatively, if precise, 2/sqrt(5)x10^-6.5. But that\'s not helpful. So, 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it more precisely. Let\'s compute sqrt(4e-13):\n\nsqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5) = 2*(10^(-13/2)) = 2*10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.316227766 ≈ 3.16227766e-7. Therefore, 2*3.16227766e-7 ≈ 6.32455532e-7. So, approximately 6.325e-7. So, 6.32x10^-7 M. Therefore, 6.32x10^-7 M. If we round to two decimal places, 6.3x10^-7. If one sig fig, 6x10^-7. But given the problem\'s data, I think 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable. However, since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should technically be 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is presented as 6.3x10^-7. Let me check some example problems. For example, in the textbook "Quantitative Chemical Analysis" by Harris, similar problems are solved, and the number of sig figs is determined by the given data. If Kf is given with one sig fig, then the answer is given with one. So, 6x10^-7. But since 0.02 is two, maybe two. Hmm. It\'s a bit ambiguous, but I think the safest is to go with two sig figs because 0.02 is two. But Kf is one. Wait, but Kf is a stability constant, which is often known with more precision. Maybe in reality, Kf would be given with more sig figs, but here it\'s given as 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one. Therefore, 6x10^-7. But I need to check. For example, if Kf is 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), then the answer would be 6.3x10^-7. But since it\'s 5x10^10 (one), the answer is 6x10^-7. So, I think the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, the exact calculation gives 6.32x10^-7. So, maybe the problem expects the exact value. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C". The pH being ideal probably means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y^4-), so we don\'t have to consider the protonation states. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward. So, the answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. But given the options, maybe the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7. So, 6.3e-7. So, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. But since Kf is given with one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, the problem might just want the answer without considering sig figs. Let me see. If I write 6.3x10^-7, that\'s acceptable. Alternatively, 6.32x10^-7. But given that the user might expect a concise answer, 6.3x10^-7 is reasonable. So, I\'ll go with 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check once more. The calculation is:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA] / Kf ) = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Yes. So, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. However, considering significant figures, since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm. Let me see. If Kf is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M (two sig figs), then the number of sig figs in the answer is determined by the least precise value, which is Kf with one. Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. So, rounding 6.3x10^-7 to one sig fig gives 6x10^-7. Therefore, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check if the problem expects that. Since the user hasn\'t specified, but in most cases, such problems expect the answer considering the given sig figs. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, if the problem is from a source that doesn\'t care about sig figs, then 6.3x10^-7. But given that Kf is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, I think 6x10^-7 is the correct way. So, I\'ll present both possibilities but state that due to the one significant figure in Kf, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, the exact value is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. But the problem might just want the exact value. Let me check similar problems. For example, in the example problems I\'ve seen, even if Kf is given with one sig fig, they sometimes report the answer with two sig figs if the concentration is given with two. But I think the strict rule is to go with the least number of sig figs. Therefore, 6x10^-7. But I\'m a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2x10^-7. Wait, no. Wait, the calculation is clear. It\'s 6.3x10^-7. So, perhaps the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Given that, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. The significant figure consideration is a bit ambiguous here, but since the problem provides the concentration with two sig figs, and Kf with one, but the answer is more influenced by the Kf\'s precision. However, in practice, when dealing with log K values or stability constants, they are often known to more significant figures, but here it\'s given as 5x10^10, which is one. Therefore, strictly, the answer is 6x10^-7. But I think the problem expects the numerical answer as 6.3x10^-7. Let me check the calculation once again. If I use exact values:\n\nKf = 5x10^10\n\n[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M\n\nAssuming dissociation is x, then:\n\n5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x²)\n\nAssuming x << 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThus, x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Since the approximation holds, this is valid. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10^-7 M. Given that, I think this is the answer they expect, regardless of significant figures. So, I\'ll go with 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444191, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4326, prompt_tokens=835, total_tokens=5161, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start with the formation reaction of the complex:

\[ \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \]

The stability constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), which is defined as:

\[ K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \]

Given that the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, we assume minimal dissociation, so the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are both \( x \). The concentration of \(\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}\) is approximately 0.02 M (since \( x \) is very small).

Substituting into the stability constant expression:

\[ K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \]

\[ x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} \]

\[ x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]

\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} \]

\[ x = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \]

Converting \( 10^{-6.5} \) to a decimal:

\[ 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \]

Thus,

\[ x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \]

Considering significant figures, the stability constant \( K_f \) is given with one significant figure, and the concentration of Ca-EDTA is given with two significant figures. However, the calculation shows the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \) M.

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. 

But let me check if the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid. If x is ~6.3x10^-7, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.01999937, which is very close to 0.02. So the approximation is indeed valid, and the error introduced is negligible. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, to express this in scientific notation with one significant figure, since the given Kf is 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures). However, since Kf is given with one significant figure, the answer should probably be rounded to one significant figure, which would be 6x10^-7 M. But the problem states 0.02 M, which is two significant figures, so maybe the answer should be 6.3x10^-7 M. Wait, but Kf is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. Hmm. In such cases, the number of significant figures in the answer is determined by the least precise measurement. Since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and the concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs), the answer should be given to one significant figure. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the problem expects two sig figs. Let me check the original numbers again. The problem states 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, and Kf is 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one sig fig. So, 6x10^-7 M. But in my calculation, I got 6.32x10^-7. So, 6x10^-7. Alternatively, if the problem allows two sig figs, maybe 6.3x10^-7. But given the Kf is one sig fig, perhaps 6x10^-7 is better. However, in some contexts, constants are considered exact, so maybe 0.02 is two sig figs. Hmm. The problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". The 0.02 has two sig figs, and Kf is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig). So, the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 is 6.32x10^-7. So, 6.3x10^-7. If we take two sig figs, 6.3x10^-7. If one, 6x10^-7. The problem says "0.02 M", which is two sig figs, but Kf is 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one sig fig. So, 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7. Let me check some references. For example, in analytical chemistry, when dealing with such calculations, sometimes the stability constant is considered to have one significant figure, but if the concentration is given with two, perhaps the answer is given with two. But in most cases, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise value. Since Kf is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, in practice, people might report it as 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. The problem might expect the exact value, so perhaps 2x10^-6.5, but that's not a standard form. Alternatively, 6.3x10^-7. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5x10^10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 6.5 in the exponent is 6 + 0.5, so 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316. So, 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. So, 6.3e-7. So, 6.3x10^-7 M. Since 0.02 has two sig figs, and Kf has one, but the answer is determined by the least number of sig figs, which is one. So, 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. The problem might not care about significant figures and just wants the exact value. Let me check the exact calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the answer as 2x10^-6.5, but that's not standard. So, converting 10^-6.5 to 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 = 6.32x10^-7. So, 6.32x10^-7 M. Rounding to two significant figures, 6.3x10^-7. If the problem expects two sig figs, that's the answer. If one, 6x10^-7. Since the problem states 0.02 M (two sig figs) and Kf as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check if the approximation is correct. Let me redo the calculation without approximating 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

If I don't make that approximation, then:

Kf = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) = 5e10

So, 0.02 - x = 5e10 * x^2

Rearranging:

5e10 x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let's solve it.

Let me write it as:

5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 5e10, b = 1, c = -0.02

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(5e10)*(-0.02) = 1 + 4*(5e10)*(0.02) = 1 + 4*(1e9) = 1 + 4e9 ≈ 4e9

Therefore, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 = 2*3.162e4 ≈ 6.324e4

Thus, x = [-1 ± 6.324e4] / (2*5e10)

Since the negative root would give a negative concentration, we take the positive root:

x = [ -1 + 6.324e4 ] / (1e11) ≈ (6.324e4 - 1)/1e11 ≈ 6.324e4 / 1e11 ≈ 6.324e-7

Which is approximately 6.324x10^-7 M, which matches our previous approximation. Therefore, even without the approximation, the result is the same. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M, which rounds to 6.3x10^-7 M with two significant figures or 6x10^-7 with one. Since the problem gives Kf as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 M (2 sig figs), the answer should be given to one significant figure. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in some textbooks or contexts, when the concentration is given with more sig figs, they might retain more. But given that Kf is only one sig fig, the precision is limited by that. So, 6x10^-7 M.

But let me check another approach. The formula for the concentration of the metal ion in a 1:1 complex is:

[M] = sqrt( [ML] / Kf )

But wait, in this case, [ML] is 0.02 M. So, [Ca²⁺] = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Since the problem may expect the answer in two sig figs, given that 0.02 is two, but Kf is one. Hmm. Maybe the answer is 6x10^-7. Alternatively, the problem might not care about sig figs and just wants the numerical value. In that case, 6.3x10^-7. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M, noting that it's approximately. Alternatively, if precise, 2/sqrt(5)x10^-6.5. But that's not helpful. So, 6.3x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5) = 2*(10^(-13/2)) = 2*10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.316227766 ≈ 3.16227766e-7. Therefore, 2*3.16227766e-7 ≈ 6.32455532e-7. So, approximately 6.325e-7. So, 6.32x10^-7 M. Therefore, 6.32x10^-7 M. If we round to two decimal places, 6.3x10^-7. If one sig fig, 6x10^-7. But given the problem's data, I think 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable. However, since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should technically be 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is presented as 6.3x10^-7. Let me check some example problems. For example, in the textbook "Quantitative Chemical Analysis" by Harris, similar problems are solved, and the number of sig figs is determined by the given data. If Kf is given with one sig fig, then the answer is given with one. So, 6x10^-7. But since 0.02 is two, maybe two. Hmm. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think the safest is to go with two sig figs because 0.02 is two. But Kf is one. Wait, but Kf is a stability constant, which is often known with more precision. Maybe in reality, Kf would be given with more sig figs, but here it's given as 5x10^10, which is one. So, the answer should be one. Therefore, 6x10^-7. But I need to check. For example, if Kf is 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), then the answer would be 6.3x10^-7. But since it's 5x10^10 (one), the answer is 6x10^-7. So, I think the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, the exact calculation gives 6.32x10^-7. So, maybe the problem expects the exact value. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C". The pH being ideal probably means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y^4-), so we don't have to consider the protonation states. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward. So, the answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. But given the options, maybe the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7. So, 6.3e-7. So, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. But since Kf is given with one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, the problem might just want the answer without considering sig figs. Let me see. If I write 6.3x10^-7, that's acceptable. Alternatively, 6.32x10^-7. But given that the user might expect a concise answer, 6.3x10^-7 is reasonable. So, I'll go with 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check once more. The calculation is:

[Ca²⁺] = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA] / Kf ) = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Yes. So, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. However, considering significant figures, since Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm. Let me see. If Kf is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M (two sig figs), then the number of sig figs in the answer is determined by the least precise value, which is Kf with one. Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. So, rounding 6.3x10^-7 to one sig fig gives 6x10^-7. Therefore, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check if the problem expects that. Since the user hasn't specified, but in most cases, such problems expect the answer considering the given sig figs. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, if the problem is from a source that doesn't care about sig figs, then 6.3x10^-7. But given that Kf is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, I think 6x10^-7 is the correct way. So, I'll present both possibilities but state that due to the one significant figure in Kf, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, the exact value is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. But the problem might just want the exact value. Let me check similar problems. For example, in the example problems I've seen, even if Kf is given with one sig fig, they sometimes report the answer with two sig figs if the concentration is given with two.

Wait, the calculation is clear. It's 6.3x10^-7. So, perhaps the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Given that, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. The significant figure consideration is a bit ambiguous here, but since the problem provides the concentration with two sig figs, and Kf with one, but the answer is more influenced by the Kf's precision. However, in practice, when dealing with log K values or stability constants, they are often known to more significant figures, but here it's given as 5x10^10, which is one. Therefore, strictly, the answer is 6x10^-7. But I think the problem expects the numerical answer as 6.3x10^-7. Let me check the calculation once again. If I use exact values:

Kf = 5x10^10

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M

Assuming dissociation is x, then:

5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x²)

Assuming x << 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

Thus, x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7

Therefore, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Since the approximation holds, this is valid. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10^-7 M. Given that, I think this is the answer they expect, regardless of significant figures. So, I'll go with 6.3x10^-7 M.


**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.
