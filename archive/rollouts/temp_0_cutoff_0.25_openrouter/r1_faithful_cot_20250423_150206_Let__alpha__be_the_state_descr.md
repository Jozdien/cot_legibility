To calculate the probability of measuring the electron in each of the eigenstates of the given operator and the average value of the operator, we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the state |alpha⟩**:
   The state |alpha⟩ is given as proportional to \((1+i)| \uparrow \rangle + (2-i)| \downarrow \rangle\). The normalization constant is found by calculating the norm:
   \[
   |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)| \uparrow \rangle + (2-i)| \downarrow \rangle \right]
   \]

2. **Identify the operator and its eigenstates**:
   The operator \(A\) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli-X matrix, which are:
   \[
   | +x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle), \quad | -x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle)
   \]
   with eigenvalues \(\pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\).

3. **Calculate the probabilities**:
   - Inner product with \(| +x \rangle\):
     \[
     \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
     \]
     Probability: \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \)
   - Inner product with \(| -x \rangle\):
     \[
     \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
     \]
     Probability: \( \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \)

4. **Calculate the average value**:
   Using the probabilities and eigenvalues:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
   \]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

Okay, so I need to calculate the probability of measuring an electron in each of the eigenstates of a given operator, and also find the average value of that operator. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, I should probably normalize the state to make sure it's a valid quantum state. Then, the operator in question has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, let's write down the state |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, I need to find the normalization constant. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Let's compute that. 

|1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. 

|2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. 

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]. 

Okay, so |alpha> normalized is 1/sqrt(7) times that combination. Got that.

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we have |up> and |down> as basis states), the matrix should look like:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

So this is the Pauli matrix sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates for the x-direction spin. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But since the operator here is scaled by hbar/2, the eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2. 

Therefore, the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of sigma_x, with eigenvalues ±hbar/2. So, the eigenstates are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>) and |−x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>). 

To find the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |−x> basis and then square the coefficients. Alternatively, compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate and take the modulus squared.

Let me do that. Let's compute <+x | alpha> and <-x | alpha>.

First, write |alpha> normalized:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>]

Compute <+x | alpha>:

<+x| = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| + <down| )

So,

<+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| + <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7))[ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

Multiply out the terms:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ <up|(1+i)|up> + <up|(2 - i)|down> + <down|(1+i)|up> + <down|(2 - i)|down> ]

Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, <up|down> = 0 and vice versa. So:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)<up|up> + 0 + 0 + (2 - i)<down|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify the numerator:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + 0i = 3

Therefore, <+x | alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, compute <-x | alpha>:

<-x| = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| - <down| )

So,

<-x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| - <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7))[ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

Multiply out:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ <up|(1+i)|up> - <up|(2 - i)|down> - <down|(1+i)|up> + <down|(2 - i)|down> ]

Again, orthonormal basis:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i)<up|up> - 0 - 0 + (2 - i)<down|down> ]

Wait, no. Wait, let's check each term:

First term: <up|(1+i)|up> = (1 + i)

Second term: - <up|(2 - i)|down> = - (2 - i) <up|down> = 0

Third term: - <down|(1 + i)|up> = - (1 + i) <down|up> = 0

Fourth term: + <down|(2 - i)|down> = (2 - i)

So total:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Wait, same as before? Wait, no. Wait, no, in the case of <-x|, the fourth term is positive (2 - i), but the first term is (1 + i), so adding them:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3. Wait, same as before? That can't be. Wait, but that would mean that both probabilities are the same? But that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of <-x | alpha>, the calculation is:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, let me re-examine the expansion. The <-x| is (1/sqrt(2))( <up| - <down| ), so when we take the inner product with |alpha>, which is (1/sqrt(7))[ (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], then:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ <up|(1 + i)|up> - <down|(1 + i)|up> + <up|(2 - i)|down> - <down|(2 - i)|down> ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step. The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

So distributing the multiplication:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ <up|(1 + i)|up> + <up|(2 - i)|down> - <down|(1 + i)|up> - <down|(2 - i)|down> ]

Now, evaluate each term:

1. <up|(1 + i)|up> = (1 + i) <up|up> = 1 + i
2. <up|(2 - i)|down> = (2 - i) <up|down> = 0
3. - <down|(1 + i)|up> = - (1 + i) <down|up> = 0
4. - <down|(2 - i)|down> = - (2 - i) <down|down> = - (2 - i)

Therefore, combining terms:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + 0 + 0 - (2 - i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i - 2 + i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So, <-x | alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Therefore, the inner products are:

<+x | alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14)

<-x | alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are the modulus squared of these amplitudes.

First, for |<+x | alpha>|^2 = |3 / sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 / 14

Second, |<-x | alpha>|^2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2. Let's compute that:

The modulus squared of (-1 + 2i) is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 / 14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for the + and - eigenstates, respectively. Let me check that they add up to 1: 9 + 5 = 14, so 14/14 = 1. Good.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha | A | alpha>.

Alternatively, since we have the probabilities of the eigenstates, the average value is the sum of probability * eigenvalue. The eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So:

Average value = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 - 5)/14 * hbar/2 = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) = hbar/7.

Wait, let me check that again:

(9/14)(hbar/2) - (5/14)(hbar/2) = (9 - 5)/14 * hbar/2 = 4/14 * hbar/2 = (4 * hbar) / 28 = hbar / 7. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, compute it directly using the matrix representation.

Given |alpha> is a vector [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So, <alpha | A | alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Let me compute that.

First, write |alpha> as a vector:

|alpha> = 1/sqrt(7) [1 + i, 2 - i]^T

So, conjugate transpose is 1/sqrt(7) [1 - i, 2 + i]

Multiply by A:

A|alpha> = hbar/2 * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Wait, since A is hbar/2 times the Pauli X matrix. So:

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Then, <alpha | A | alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [1 - i, 2 + i] * (hbar/2) * [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Multiply the scalars: (1/sqrt(7)) * (hbar/2) * (1/sqrt(7)) = hbar/(2*7) = hbar/14

Now, compute the dot product:

[1 - i, 2 + i] • [2 - i, 1 + i] = (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i)

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i*i = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding both terms: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

Therefore, the dot product is 2. So, <alpha | A | alpha> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7. Which matches the previous result. Good.

Therefore, the average value is hbar/7.

So, summarizing:

Probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |−x>) are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively. The average value of A is hbar/7.

**Final Answer**
The probabilities are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

Okay, so I need to calculate the probability of measuring an electron in each of the eigenstates of a given operator, and also find the average value of that operator. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, I should probably normalize the state to make sure it's a valid quantum state. Then, the operator in question has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, let's write down the state |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, I need to find the normalization constant. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Let's compute that. 

|1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. 

|2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. 

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]. 

Okay, so |alpha> normalized is 1/sqrt(7) times that combination. Got that.

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we have |up> and |down> as basis states), the matrix should look like:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

So this is the Pauli matrix sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates for the x-direction spin. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But since the operator here is scaled by hbar/2, the eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2. 

Therefore, the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of sigma_x, with eigenvalues ±hbar/2. So, the eigenstates are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>) and |−x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>). 

To find the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the

I need to compute the probability of finding an electron in each eigenstate of a specific operator, and determine the operator's expectation value. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I should first normalize this state to ensure it represents a valid quantum state. The operator has a matrix representation with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 in the off-diagonal positions. Let me work through this systematically.

Let's begin by writing out state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. For normalization, I need to calculate the normalization constant using the coefficients (1+i) and (2-i). The squared norm equals |1+i|² + |2-i|².

Calculating |1+i|² gives (1)² + (1)² = 2.

For |2-i|², we get (2)² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5.

The total squared norm is therefore 2 + 5 = 7, making the normalized state |alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Now, considering the operator A with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, the 2×2 matrix representation is:

[ 0     ħ/2  ]
[ ħ/2   0    ]

This is the Pauli matrix σₓ multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenstates of σₓ are the x-direction spin eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which equal (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, respectively. Since our operator A equals (ħ/2)σₓ, its eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

Therefore, operator A has the same eigenstates as σₓ, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The eigenstates are |+x> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>) and |-x> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).

To find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the

To calculate the probability of measuring an electron in each eigenstate of a specified operator, and to find the operator's average value, I first need to normalize the given state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Normalizing ensures a valid quantum state. The operator's matrix is such that its diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Let’s proceed step by step.

First, express the state |alpha>, given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Determining the normalization constant requires finding the squared norm of the coefficients (1+i) and (2-i): 

|1+i|^2 equals (1)^2 + (1)^2, which is 2.
|2−i|^2 equals (2)^2 + (−1)^2, which results in 4 + 1 = 5.

Thus, the total squared norm is 2 + 5 = 7. The normalized state becomes (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]. 

So, the normalized |alpha> is 1/sqrt(7) multiplied by that combination.

Now, consider the operator A where the matrix elements A_ij equal hbar/2 when i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Given the basis states |up> and |down>, this results in the 2x2 matrix:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

This matrix equals the Pauli matrix sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x, related to x-direction spin, are |+x> and |−x>, expressed as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively, with eigenvalues ±hbar/2 due to the hbar/2 scaling.

Consequently, the eigenstates of operator A mirror those of sigma_x, with corresponding eigenvalues ±hbar/2. The eigenstates are thus |+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>) and |−x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>).

To calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate, I need to re-express the state |alpha> using these eigenstates.

Let's compute <+x | alpha> and <-x | alpha>.\n\nFirst, write |alpha> normalized:\n\n|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>]\n\nCompute <+x | alpha>:\n\n<+x| = 1/sqrt(2)(<up| + <down|)\n\nSo,\n\n<+x | alpha> = 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]\n\nBut <up|up> = 1, <down|down> = 1, and <up|down> = <down|up> = 0.

The state \( | \alpha \rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2-i) | \text{down} \rangle \). To normalize this state, we calculate the norm squared of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2-i) | \text{down} \rangle \right]
\]

The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \), which are \( | +x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle + | \text{down} \rangle) \) and \( | -x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle - | \text{down} \rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in these eigenstates, we compute the inner products:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the modulus squared of these coefficients:

\[
| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle |^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14}
\]

\[
| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle |^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14}
\]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value of the operator is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

|+x> and |−x> basis and then square the coefficients. Alternatively, compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate and take the modulus squared.

Let me do that. Let's compute <+x | alpha> and <-x | alpha>.

First, write |alpha> normalized:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>]

Compute <+x | alpha>:

<+x| = 1/sqrt(2)(<up| + <down|)

So,

<+x | alpha> = 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> = 1, <down|down> = 1, and <up|down> = <down|up> = 0. Therefore,

<+x | alpha> = 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Simplify:

= 1/sqrt(14) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] = 1/sqrt(14) [3 + 0i] = 3/sqrt(14)

Therefore, the probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14.

Similarly, compute <-x | alpha>:

<-x| = 1/sqrt(2)(<up| - <down|)

So,

<-x | alpha> = 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> - (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Again, cross terms are zero:

= 1/sqrt(2) [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * 1 - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Simplify:

= 1/sqrt(14) [ (1 + i - 2 + i) ] = 1/sqrt(14) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So, the coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2]/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for |+x> and |−x> eigenstates, respectively.

Alternatively, since probabilities must add up to 1, 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1, which checks out.

Now, the average value of operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we have the probabilities of the eigenstates, the average value is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. The eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So, average value = (hbar/2)(9/14) + (-hbar/2)(5/14) = (9/14 - 5/14) hbar/2 = (4/14) hbar/2 = (2/7) hbar/2 = (1/7) hbar.

Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, compute <A> directly.

Given A is the matrix:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

So, in matrix form, the operator A is:

( hbar/2 ) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So, to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, we can write |alpha> as a vector. The state |alpha> is normalized as 1/sqrt(7) [1 + i, 2 - i]^T.

So, the bra vector is 1/sqrt(7) [1 - i, 2 + i].

Then, A acting on |alpha> is hbar/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [1 + i, 2 - i]^T / sqrt(7)

Compute that:

First component: 0*(1 + i) + 1*(2 - i) = 2 - i

Second component: 1*(1 + i) + 0*(2 - i) = 1 + i

So, A|alpha> = hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) [2 - i, 1 + i]^T

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of <alpha| and A|alpha>:

1/sqrt(7) [1 - i, 2 + i] * hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) [2 - i, 1 + i]^T

Multiply the scalars: (1/sqrt(7)) * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) = hbar/(14)

Now, compute the dot product:

(1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i)

First term: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2)(1) + (2)(i) + (i)(1) + (i)(i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding both terms: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

Therefore, the inner product is hbar/(14) * 2 = hbar/7

So, the average value is hbar/7, which matches the previous result. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, and the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but let me just confirm once again. The eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So, the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 -5)/14 * hbar/2 = 4/14 * hbar/2 = (4/28) hbar = hbar/7. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is probabilities 9/14 and 5/14 for the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, and average value hbar/7.

**Final Answer**
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value of the operator is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To calculate the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of the given operator and the average value of the operator, we start by normalizing the state \( | \alpha \rangle \).

The state \( | \alpha \rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2-i) | \text{down} \rangle \). The normalization constant is found by calculating the squared norm of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2-i) | \text{down} \rangle \right]
\]

The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \), whose eigenstates are \( | +x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle + | \text{down} \rangle) \) and \( | -x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle - | \text{down} \rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

Expressing \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of \( | +x \rangle \) and \( | -x \rangle \):

\[
| \text{up} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| +x \rangle + | -x \rangle), \quad | \text{down} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| +x \rangle - | -x \rangle)
\]

Substituting these into \( | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| +x \rangle + | -x \rangle) + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| +x \rangle - | -x \rangle) \right]
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (3) | +x \rangle + (-1 + 2i) | -x \rangle \right]
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
\text{Probability for } | +x \rangle: \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}
\]
\[
\text{Probability for } | -x \rangle: \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14}
\]

For the average value of the operator \( A \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \):

\[
A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{pmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 - i \\ 1 + i \end{pmatrix}
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 - i & 2 + i \end{pmatrix} \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 - i \\ 1 + i \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{14} \left[ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) \right]
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
(1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) = (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2
\]

Thus, the average value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{14} \times 2 = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value of the operator is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

|+x> and |-x> states and compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

First, let's write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]

Express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/√2

|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/√2

Substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)(|+x> + |-x>)/√2 + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>)/√2]

Combine terms:

= (1/√(14)) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

= (1/√(14)) [ (1+i + 2 - i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 - i))|-x> ]

Simplify coefficients:

For |+x>:

(1 + i + 2 - i) = 3

For |-x>:

(1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)

Therefore:

|alpha> = (1/√(14)) [3|+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x>]

The coefficients are 3/√14 and (-1 + 2i)/√14.

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

Probability for |+x>:

|3/√14|² = 9/14

Probability for |-x>:

|(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = [(-1)^2 + (2)^2]/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for |+x> and |-x> respectively.

Alternatively, since the operator is A = (ħ/2)σₓ, the average value can be calculated as <alpha|A|alpha>.

First, compute the matrix product. Let's write |alpha> as a vector:

|alpha> = (1/√7)[1+i, 2-i]^T

Then A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So A|alpha> = (ħ/2√7)[ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T

Then <alpha|A|alpha> = (ħ/(2√7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 - i - 2i + i² = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2 + 2i + i + i² = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding them: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

Therefore, <A> = (ħ/(2√7)) * 2 = ħ/(√7)

But wait, let me check the calculation again. Wait, the inner product is (1/√7)(1 - i, 2 + i) multiplied by (ħ/(2√7))(2 - i, 1 + i). So the inner product is (1/√7)(ħ/(2√7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Which is (ħ/(2*7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Calculating (1 - i)(2 - i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i*i

= 2 - i - 2i + (-1)

= 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

(2 + i)(1 + i):

= 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i

= 2 + 2i + i + (-1)

= 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding these: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

So <A> = (ħ/(14)) * 2 = ħ/7

Wait, but that contradicts the previous result. Wait, no, let's check the factors again.

Original |alpha> is (1/√7)[1+i, 2 - i]

So <alpha| is (1/√7)[1 - i, 2 + i]

A|alpha> is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * (1/√7)[1+i, 2 - i] = (ħ/(2√7)) [2 - i, 1 + i]

Then <alpha|A|alpha> is (1/√7)[1 - i, 2 + i] * (ħ/(2√7)) [2 - i, 1 + i]^T

Which is (1/√7)(ħ/(2√7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

= (ħ/(2*7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

As before, which gives 2, so total is (ħ/(14)) * 2 = ħ/7

But earlier, when I thought of expressing in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, so the expectation value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (9 -5)/14 * ħ/2 = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7)(ħ/2) = ħ/7

Yes, that matches. So the average value is ħ/7.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and the average value is ħ/7.

**Final Answer**
The probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value of the operator is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To solve the problem, we first normalize the given state and then determine the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the specified operator, followed by calculating the average value of the operator.

**1. Normalize the State |α⟩:**
The state is given as |α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2−i)|down⟩. The normalization constant is found by calculating the norm:
\[
\text{Norm} = |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\left[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2−i)|down⟩\right]
\]

**2. Eigenstates of Operator A:**
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
This is the Pauli-X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the x-direction spin:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩)
\]
with eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

**3. Measurement Probabilities:**
Calculate the inner products of |α⟩ with |+x⟩ and |-x⟩.

- **For |+x⟩:**
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}[(1−i) + (2+i)] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
Probability: \( \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \)

- **For |-x⟩:**
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}[(1−i) - (2+i)] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
Probability: \( \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \)

**4. Average Value of Operator A:**
\[
⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{14} \times 2 = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

**Final Results:**
- **Probabilities:** \( \frac{9}{14} \) (for |+x⟩) and \( \frac{5}{14} \) (for |-x⟩)
- **Average Value:** \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \)

\[
\boxed{\text{Probabilities: } \frac{9}{14} \text{ and } \frac{5}{14}, \quad \text{Average Value: } \frac{\hbar}{7}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Alternatively, compute the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate and take the squared magnitude.

First, compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:

⟨+x | alpha⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))(⟨up| + ⟨down|) * (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>]

Multiplying out the terms:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)⟨up|up> + (1+i)⟨up|down> + (2−i)⟨down|up> + (2−i)⟨down|down> ]

Since ⟨up|up> = ⟨down|down> = 1 and ⟨up|down> = ⟨down|up> = 0, this simplifies to:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] = (1/sqrt(14))(3 + 0i) = 3/sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, compute the inner product with |−x>:

⟨−x | alpha⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))(⟨up| - ⟨down|) * (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>]

Expanding:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)⟨up|up> - (1+i)⟨up|down> + (2−i)⟨down|up> - (2−i)⟨down|down> ]

Again, cross terms vanish:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] = (1/sqrt(14))( -1 + 2i )

The magnitude squared is | -1 + 2i |² divided by 14. The magnitude squared of -1 + 2i is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Thus, the probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Verifying that the probabilities sum to 1: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1. Correct.

Alternatively, since the operator A is represented by the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], the average value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩. Let's compute this.

Expressing |alpha> as a vector: (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2−i]^T.

Applying A to |alpha> gives (hbar/2) [ (2−i), (1+i) ]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ is (1/sqrt(7)) [1−i, 2+i] * (hbar/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [2−i, 1+i]^T.

Multiplying out:

= (hbar/(2*7)) [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1−i)(2−i) = 2 - i - 2i + i² = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i² = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding them: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

Thus, ⟨A⟩ = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7 ≈ 0.1429 hbar.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2, the average can also be calculated as (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 -5)/14 * hbar/2 = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) = hbar/7, which matches. So that's correct.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, respectively, and the average value is hbar/7.
