To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Volume:**
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}
   \]

2. **Determine Moles of Each Component:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**
     \[
     0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - **HCl (strong acid):**
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺}
     \]
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**
     \[
     0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \implies 0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻}
     \]

3. **Neutralization Reactions:**
   - **HCl and Ba(OH)₂:**
     \[
     \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}
     \]
     Moles of H⁺ (0.08 mol) react with 0.08 mol OH⁻, leaving:
     \[
     0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH⁻}
     \]
   - **Remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:**
     \[
     \text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}
     \]
     0.05 mol OH⁻ reacts with 0.05 mol CH₃COOH, leaving:
     \[
     0.10 \, \text{mol OH⁻} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻}
     \]

4. **Calculate [OH⁻] and pH:**
   - **Concentration of OH⁻:**
     \[
     [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - **pOH and pH:**
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38
     \]
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
The pH of the solution is \(\boxed{12.62}\).

Okay, so I need to find the pH of a solution that's made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, let's start by breaking this down step by step. 

First, I remember that when you mix different solutions, the first thing to do is calculate the total volume. The total volume here would be 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL. Let me add those up: 500 + 400 is 900, plus 300 is 1200 mL. So the total volume is 1.2 liters. That might be useful later when considering concentrations after mixing.

Now, the components here are a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide). Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water, right? And barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will also completely dissociate. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when we mix these together, there might be a neutralization reaction between the acids and the base. So I need to figure out how much of the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react, and then see what's left over.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component. For acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, I might need to consider its dissociation, but maybe after accounting for any neutralization. 

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

For barium hydroxide: Ba(OH)2. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. These will react in a neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O. So let's see which one is in excess. 

H+ from HCl: 0.08
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

Subtracting the two: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left. So the OH- is in excess. But wait, there's also the acetic acid. Acetic acid can donate H+ as well, but since we have excess OH-, the OH- might react with the acetic acid. 

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. In the presence of a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Let me think. The reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O. But since OH- is a strong base, it will take protons from wherever it can. So first, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize each other, and then the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid.

So first, let's handle the strong acid and strong base neutralization. 

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

They react in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.08 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Now, these 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The reaction is:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O

So each mole of OH- will consume one mole of CH3COOH. We have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So the OH- is in excess here as well. The OH- will neutralize all the acetic acid and still have some left over.

So, moles of OH- after reacting with HCl: 0.10
Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05

So, OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 moles of OH-. Therefore, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Now, the total solution volume is 1.2 L. The remaining OH- concentration is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L. Let me calculate that: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, the pOH is -log10(0.0417). Let me compute that. 

First, 0.0417 is approximately 4.17 x 10^-2. The log of 4.17 is about 0.62, so log(4.17 x 10^-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.38. Then pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. 

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my steps again. 

First, moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.

So total OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. 

But wait, is that correct? Because after neutralizing the strong acid, the OH- is reacting with the weak acid. But since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid completely. So the calculation seems right. 

But let me think again. If there's excess OH- after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH, then the solution will be basic, and the pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration. So yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the numbers again.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08. Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18. Neutralization: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10.

Then, CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. OH- will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO- and 0.05 mol H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Total OH- concentration: 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. 

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the pOH calculation again. 

If [OH-] = 0.0417 M, then pOH = -log(4.17 x 10^-2). Let's compute this more accurately. 

log(4.17) = log(4) + log(1.0425) ≈ 0.6020 + 0.018 ≈ 0.620. So log(4.17 x 10^-2) = 0.620 - 2 = -1.380. So pOH = 1.380. Then pH = 14 - 1.380 = 12.62. 

Yes, that seems right. 

But wait, another way to check: 0.0417 M OH- is approximately 4.17 x 10^-2. The [H+] would be 1e-14 / 4.17e-2 ≈ 2.4e-13. Then pH = -log(2.4e-13) ≈ 12.62. Yep, same result. 

So the pH is approximately 12.62. 

But let me think again if there's any other factors. For example, the acetate ion (CH3COO-) that's formed from the reaction of OH- with CH3COOH. Since we have a solution with excess OH-, the acetate ion is a weak base, but in a strongly basic solution, its contribution to the pH would be negligible compared to the excess OH-. So we can safely ignore it. 

Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the excess OH- concentration. 

So the answer should be pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check if I considered all the steps correctly. 

Wait, another thing: when mixing solutions, the volumes are additive. So 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L. That's correct. 

Moles calculations:

- CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Correct.

- HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+. Correct.

- Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol, which gives 0.18 mol OH-. Correct.

Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol each, leaving 0.10 mol OH-. Then, OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-. Correct.

Concentration of OH-: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Correct.

So all steps check out. Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. 

But maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let me compute the pOH more accurately. 

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. 

Taking the negative log:

log(0.041666...) = log(4.1666... x 10^-2) = log(4.1666...) + log(10^-2). 

log(4.1666) is approximately 0.6198. So log(0.041666) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. 

Therefore, pOH = 1.3802, so pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. If three decimal places, 12.620. But usually, pH is given to two decimal places. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects a different approach. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way: after the neutralization, we have excess OH- of 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 1/24 ≈ 0.04167 M. 

So pOH = -log(1/24) = log(24). log(24) = log(2.4 x 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1 ≈ 0.3802 + 1 = 1.3802. So pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198. 

Yes, same result. 

Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. 

But let me check once more if I considered all possible reactions. For example, does the acetate ion affect the pH? In a strongly basic solution, the acetate ion is a weak base, but since we have excess OH-, the contribution of acetate to the pH is negligible. The hydroxide ion concentration is way higher than any contribution from acetate hydrolysis. So we can ignore it. 

Therefore, the final pH is 12.62. 

But wait, maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me see. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of reactions. Let me think: when you mix a strong acid and a strong base, they neutralize first. Then, the remaining strong base will react with the weak acid. 

Yes, that's correct. Because strong acids and bases react first, then the remaining strong base or acid will react with weak acids or bases. 

So the steps are correct. 

Therefore, the pH is 12.62. 

But to be thorough, let's write out all the reactions:

1. HCl → H+ + Cl- (complete dissociation)
2. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH- (complete dissociation)
3. H+ + OH- → H2O (neutralization)
4. Remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O

Calculations:

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

Neutralization: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O
Remaining OH-: 0.10

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05
Reaction with OH-: 0.05 OH- + 0.05 CH3COOH → 0.05 CH3COO- + 0.05 H2O
Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05

Total volume: 1.2 L
[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M
pOH = 1.38
pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62

Yes, all steps are correct. So the pH is 12.62. 

I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So I'll go with pH ≈ 12.62. But to be precise, maybe we need to use more exact values. Let me check the exact calculation for [OH-].

0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M. 

Taking the log:

log(0.041666...) = log(1/24) = -log(24) ≈ -1.3802. 

So pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198. 

Rounded to two decimal places, 12.62. If three decimal places, 12.620. 

But depending on the problem's requirement, two decimal places are standard. 

Therefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.

Okay, so I need to find the pH of a solution that's made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, let's start by breaking this down step by step.

Let me add those up: 500 + 400 is 900, plus 300 is 1200 mL. So the total volume is 1.2 liters. That might be useful later when considering concentrations after mixing.

Now, the components here are a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide). Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water, right? And barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will also completely dissociate. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when we mix these together, there might be a neutralization reaction between the acids and the base. So I need to figure out how much of the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react, and then see what's left over.

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

For barium hydroxide: Ba(OH)2. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. These will react in a neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O. So let's see which one is in excess. 

H+ from HCl: 0.08
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

Subtracting the two: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left. So the OH- is in excess. But wait, there's also the acetic acid. Acetic acid can donate H+ as well, but since we have excess OH-, the OH- might react with the acetic acid. 

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. In the presence of a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Let me think.

I need to determine the pH of a solution formed by combining 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Let me approach this systematically.

Initially, I'll calculate the total volume of the mixture. Adding 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL gives me 1200 mL or 1.2 liters. This will be important when considering the final concentrations of species in the solution.

The mixture contains three components: acetic acid (a weak acid), hydrochloric acid (a strong acid), and barium hydroxide (a strong base). HCl, being a strong acid, will completely dissociate in water. Similarly, barium hydroxide, a strong base, will fully dissociate. Acetic acid, being weak, won't completely dissociate. When these solutions mix, neutralization reactions will occur between the acids and the base, so I need to determine how much H+ from the acids reacts with OH- from the base.

Let me calculate the moles of each component. For acetic acid: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of H+ ions (since it's a strong acid). For barium hydroxide: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, there are 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH- ions.

The H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) will react with some of the OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles) in a neutralization reaction (H+ + OH- → H2O). After this reaction, there remains 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- in excess.

With excess OH- present, it will also react with the acetic acid. Since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid according to the reaction: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O. The OH- will take protons from any available source. So after the H+ from HCl neutralizes some OH-, the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid.

I need to determine the pH of a solution created by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Let's break this down step by step.

First, when mixing solutions, it's necessary to calculate the total volume. In this case, the total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL. Adding these gives 500 + 400 = 900, and 900 + 300 = 1200 mL, equaling 1.2 liters. This might be important later for determining post-mixing concentrations.

The components included are a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide). As a strong acid, HCl will completely dissociate in water, and as a strong base, barium hydroxide will fully dissociate too. Acetic acid, being a weak acid, won't completely dissociate. However, mixing these may result in neutralization between the acids and the base, so I need to find out how much H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react and what's left over.

I'll calculate the moles of each component. For acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, its dissociation might matter after accounting for neutralization.

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Being a strong acid, it donates 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

For barium hydroxide: the concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L, so moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- per mole, OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. These react in a neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O. Let's see which is in excess:

H+ from HCl: 0.08
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

Subtracting the two gives 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. Thus, OH- is in excess. But acetic acid can donate H+, and with excess OH-, it might react with it.

Acetic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of a strong base, OH- will deprotonate it. Thus, OH- will react with CH3COOH: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O. Because OH- is a strong base, it will remove protons wherever available. Therefore, after H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize, the excess OH- reacts with acetic acid.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}
   \]

2. **Calculate the moles of each component:**
   - **CH3COOH (weak acid):**
     \[
     0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles}
     \]
   - **HCl (strong acid):**
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+
     \]
   - **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**
     \[
     0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)}_2 \rightarrow 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^-
     \]

3. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl and OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
     \[
     0.08 \, \text{moles H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{moles OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O} \quad (\text{remaining OH}^- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles})
     \]
   - **Remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH3COOH:**
     \[
     0.10 \, \text{moles OH}^- + 0.05 \, \text{moles CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow 0.05 \, \text{moles CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \quad (\text{remaining OH}^- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles})
     \]

4. **Calculate the concentration of remaining OH⁻:**
   \[
   \text{Concentration of OH}^- = \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Determine pH:**
   - **pOH:**
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38
     \]
   - **pH:**
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62
     \]

The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid.

So first, neutralize H+ (from HCl) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2):

H+ (0.08 moles) + OH- (0.18 moles) → H2O, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

But then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the acetic acid (0.05 moles). Let's check the stoichiometry here. Each mole of OH- can deprotonate one mole of CH3COOH. So if we have 0.10 moles OH- and 0.05 moles CH3COOH, the OH- will react with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO-, and there will still be some OH- left over.

So:

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles
OH- remaining after HCl neutralization: 0.10 moles

Reaction: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O

Moles of OH- used: 0.05 (since that's the amount of CH3COOH)
Moles of OH- remaining: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles

So now, after all reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left in solution. The total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, the pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. 

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me go through each step again.

First, moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.08 moles H+ reacts with 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is in excess here (0.10 vs 0.05), all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, converting to CH3COO-, and we have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- left.

So the total OH- concentration is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pOH = -log(0.0417). Let me calculate that. 

log(0.0417) is log(4.17 x 10^-2) ≈ log(4.17) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH = 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That seems high, but considering we have excess OH- after neutralizing the acids, maybe that's correct.

But wait, is there anything else I need to consider? The acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base. If there's excess OH-, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH-, and the acetate ion's basicity might be negligible in comparison. Because the concentration of OH- is already 0.0417 M, which is quite high (pH ~12.6), the contribution from acetate ions (which would make the solution more basic) would be minimal. So maybe we can ignore it. 

Alternatively, if there were no excess OH- and we had a buffer solution of acetate and some weak acid, we would need to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But in this case, since there's excess strong base, the pH is determined by the concentration of OH- from the excess Ba(OH)2 after all reactions. So I think the calculation is correct.

But let me check once more. Let's verify the moles step by step.

1. HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

2. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 mol OH-.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 mol OH-.

5. Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Total volume: 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 12.62. 

Yes, that seems right. So the pH should be approximately 12.62. 

But wait, another thought: when you mix a strong base with a weak acid, the reaction goes to completion. So the OH- will deprotonate the weak acid completely. So in this case, since there's more OH- than CH3COOH, all the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO-, and there's still OH- left. So the solution is strongly basic due to the excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH-.

Alternatively, if there were more CH3COOH than OH-, then we would have a buffer solution. But in this case, OH- is in excess, so the pH is just from the leftover OH-.

Therefore, the answer should be pH ≈ 12.62. Let me check the calculation again.

0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. 

pOH = -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38. 

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. 

Yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use more precise logarithms. Let's compute log(0.041666). 

0.041666 is 4.1666 x 10^-2. 

log(4.1666) is approximately 0.6198. So log(4.1666 x 10^-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. 

So pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which rounds to 12.62. 

Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. 

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any other reactions. For example, does Ba(OH)2 contribute any other ions? Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. The Ba^2+ is a spectator ion and doesn't participate in acid-base reactions. So we can ignore it. 

Also, after the reactions, the solution contains Ba^2+, Cl- (from HCl), CH3COO- (from the neutralized acetic acid), and the excess OH-. But the pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration. 

Therefore, the final pH is 12.62. 

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

The remaining OH- is 0.10 moles. Since each mole of OH- can deprotonate one mole of CH3COOH, the OH- (0.10 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (since there's only 0.05 moles of CH3COOH available). This will convert all the acetic acid into acetate ions (CH3COO-), and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.\n\nNow, the solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COO- (from the neutralized acetic acid). The total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. The pOH would be -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so the pH is 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. However, I need to check if the acetate ion will hydrolyze and affect the pH. But since there's excess OH- from the strong base, the solution is strongly basic, and the acetate ion's hydrolysis (which produces a small amount of OH-) would be negligible compared to the existing OH- concentration. Therefore, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculations again. Let's go step by step.\n\n1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.\n2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 moles.\n3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 moles H+ reacts with 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n4. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). The reaction is 1:1, so 0.05 moles OH- will neutralize 0.05 moles CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 moles OH-. This leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- remaining.\n5. The total solution volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nBut wait, another way to check: after the initial neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, we have excess OH- of 0.10 moles. Then, the OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, but OH- is a strong base, the reaction should go to completion. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- in solution. So the final [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pH is 12.62. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the order of reactions. Let me confirm. When mixing strong acids and bases, they react first. Then, any excess strong acid or base will determine the pH. If there's excess strong base, then the pH is determined by that. If there's excess strong acid, then pH is determined by that. If they neutralize each other, then the weak acid or base comes into play. In this case, after HCl and Ba(OH)2 react, there's excess OH- which then reacts with the weak acid. Since the OH- is a stronger base than the acetate ion's conjugate base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid completely. So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to pH ~12.62. That seems correct.

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, using more precise calculation for the logarithm: log(0.041666) ≈ log(4.1666×10^-2) = log(4.1666) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The moles of acetic acid are 0.05. The remaining OH- is 0.10 moles. Since each mole of OH- can deprotonate one mole of CH3COOH, the OH- (0.10 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (since there's only 0.05 moles of CH3COOH available). This will convert all the acetic acid into acetate ions (CH3COO-), and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Now, the solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COO- (from the neutralized acetic acid). The total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. The pOH would be -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so the pH is 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. However, I need to check if the acetate ion will hydrolyze and affect the pH. But since there's excess OH- from the strong base, the solution is strongly basic, and the acetate ion's hydrolysis (which produces a small amount of OH-) would be negligible compared to the existing OH- concentration. Therefore, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations again. Let's go step by step.

1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 moles.
3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 moles H+ reacts with 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.
4. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). The reaction is 1:1, so 0.05 moles OH- will neutralize 0.05 moles CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles CH3COO- and consuming 0.05 moles OH-. This leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- remaining.
5. The total solution volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

But wait, another way to check: after the initial neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, we have excess OH- of 0.10 moles. Then, the OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, but OH- is a strong base, the reaction should go to completion. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- in solution. So the final [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pH is 12.62. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the order of reactions. Let me confirm. When mixing strong acids and bases, they react first. Then, any excess strong acid or base will determine the pH. If there's excess strong base, then the pH is determined by that. If there's excess strong acid, then pH is determined by that. If they neutralize each other, then the weak acid or base comes into play. In this case, after HCl and Ba(OH)2 react, there's excess OH- which then reacts with the weak acid. Since the OH- is a stronger base than the acetate ion's conjugate base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid completely. So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to pH ~12.62. That seems correct. So the answer should be pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check the exact calculation.

Calculating [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M. pOH = -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, using more precise calculation for the logarithm: log(0.041666) ≈ log(4.1666×10^-2) = log(4.1666) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. So the pH is approximately 12.62. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{12.62}.

The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So, after neutralization, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Then, this excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.\n\nThe moles of acetic acid are 0.05. The reaction between OH- and CH3COOH is 1:1. So, 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the OH- is 0.10 moles after neutralizing HCl's H+. Then, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O. So, each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of CH3COOH. So, if there's 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, then OH- will deprotonate all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, converting it to CH3COO-, and then there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left. So, the solution will have excess OH- of 0.05 moles, and the total volume is 1.2 L. Then, the concentration of OH- would be 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nMoles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nH+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 react: 0.08 H+ + 0.18 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.\n\nThen, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate all the CH3COOH available. So, 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO- and H2O. The remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nSo, total OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. That seems correct. But let me check if there's any other factors. For example, the acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base, but if there's excess OH- in solution, the pH is dominated by the excess OH-, so the contribution from acetate would be negligible. Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. But let me check calculations again.\n\nWait, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, the reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nSo, each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH. So, if there's 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, then all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remain. So, yes, that's correct. Then, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.6. But let me check if I made any mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and OH- from all sources, then see the net. But since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes H+; Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-; and CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, it will be deprotonated. So, perhaps the steps I took are correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the order of reactions. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will neutralize each other first. Then, any excess H+ or OH- will react with the weak acid or base. But in this case, after neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)2, there's excess OH-, which then reacts with CH3COOH. So, the steps are correct. So, the final excess OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check the exact value of [OH-].\n\n0.05 moles in 1.2 L: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. The pOH is log(1/0.0416667) = log(24) ≈ 1.38. Wait, log(24) is log(2.4 × 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1 ≈ 0.38 + 1 = 1.38. So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, the answer is approximately 12.62. But maybe I should use more precise calculation for the logarithm.\n\nAlternatively, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M. So, [OH-] = 4.16667 × 10^-2 M. The pOH is -log(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log(1/(4.16667 × 10^-2)) = log(24). Let me compute log(24) more accurately. Since log(24) = log(2.4 × 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1. log(2) = 0.3010, log(2.4) = log(2) + log(1.2) = 0.3010 + 0.07918 ≈ 0.3802. So, log(24) ≈ 1.3802. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.3802, pH ≈ 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. But let me check if there's any mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider that when you mix a strong acid and a strong base, the net H+ or OH- is calculated first, then any remaining OH- would react with the weak acid. So, that's exactly what I did. So, the steps are correct. Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62. But let me check if the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH is considered properly.\n\nYes, because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid completely until either the OH- is consumed or the CH3COOH is consumed. Since there's more OH- (0.10 moles) than CH3COOH (0.05 moles), all the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO-, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain. So, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. But maybe the answer expects a more precise value. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for logarithms. Let me compute [OH-] again. 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M. The pOH is -log10(0.0416667). Let's compute this:\n\nlog10(0.0416667) = log10(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log10(4.16667) + log10(10^-2) = log10(4.16667) - 2.\n\nlog10(4) = 0.60206, log10(4.16667) is a bit higher. Let's compute it using linear approximation between 4 and 4.16667. The difference between 4 and 4.16667 is 0.16667. Since log10(4) = 0.60206, and log10(4.2) = log10(4) + log10(1.05) ≈ 0.60206 + 0.021189 = 0.62325. But 4.16667 is 4 + 0.16667, which is 1/6 of the way from 4 to 4.2 (since 0.16667 is 1/6 of 1). So, the increase in log10 from 4 to 4.2 is 0.62325 - 0.60206 = 0.02119 over 0.2 increase in x. So, per 0.1 increase in x, log10 increases by 0.010595. So, 0.16667 is 0.1 * 1.6667, so the increase would be 0.010595 * 1.6667 ≈ 0.01766. Therefore, log10(4.16667) ≈ 0.60206 + 0.01766 ≈ 0.61972. Therefore, log10(4.16667 × 10^-2) ≈ 0.61972 - 2 = -1.38028. Therefore, pOH = -(-1.38028) = 1.38028, so pH = 14 - 1.38028 ≈ 12.6197, which rounds to 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor. For example, the acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base. However, in the presence of excess OH- from the strong base, the contribution of acetate to the pH would be negligible because the solution is already strongly basic. Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the excess OH- concentration, and the acetate ion's hydrolysis can be ignored. Therefore, the pH is indeed approximately 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, if there were no excess OH- after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH, then we would have to consider the acetate ion's effect. But in this case, since there's excess OH-, the pH is determined by that excess. Therefore, the answer should be pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check once more.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-:\n\nHCl provides 0.08 moles H+.\n\nBa(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nCH3COOH can provide up to 0.05 moles H+ if it were to fully dissociate, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't. However, in the presence of a strong base (OH-), the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So, the OH- will react with both the H+ from HCl and the H+ available from CH3COOH.\n\nBut the order of reactions is important. Strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will neutralize first. Then, any remaining OH- will deprotonate the weak acid. So, first, H+ from HCl (0.08) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18) react. The net OH- after that is 0.10. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), leaving 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nTherefore, the final [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. So, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that after neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)2, the solution has excess OH- of 0.10 moles. Then, adding the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) which can donate H+ would react with some of the OH-:\n\nOH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nSo, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will consume 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nTherefore, the same result. So, the pH is 12.62. Therefore, the answer is approximately 12.62. But let me check if the problem states anything about activity coefficients or temperature, but since it's a standard problem, we can assume 25°C and ideal solutions, so activity coefficients are ignored. Therefore, the answer is pH ≈ 12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, maybe to two significant figures, but let's check the data given.\n\nThe concentrations are given as 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.3 M, which have one decimal place, so maybe two significant figures. The volumes are 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL, which are exact, so the significant figures come from the concentrations. So, 0.1 (1 sig fig), 0.2 (1), 0.3 (1). But when calculating moles, 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 (1 sig fig), 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 (1 sig fig), 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 (1 sig fig). Then, when subtracting, 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 (two decimal places, but maybe two sig figs here). Then, 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 (1 sig fig). Then, 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... which would be 0.042 M (two sig figs). Then, pOH = -log(0.042) ≈ 1.376, pH = 12.624, which would round to 12.62 (two decimal places) or 12.6 (two sig figs). But since the given data has one sig fig for concentrations, but the volumes are exact, perhaps the answer should have two sig figs. Wait, but when you multiply 0.1 M (1 sig fig) by 0.5 L (exact), the moles would be 0.05, which is 1 sig fig. Similarly, 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 (1 sig fig), 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 (1 sig fig). Then, when you subtract 0.18 (two sig figs, since 0.09 * 2) - 0.08 (1 sig fig) = 0.10 (two sig figs). Then, subtract 0.05 (1 sig fig) from 0.10 (two sig figs), resulting in 0.05 (1 sig fig). Then, 0.05 / 1.2 (exact) = 0.041666..., which is 0.042 (two sig figs). Then, pOH = -log(0.042) ≈ 1.376, pH = 12.624. So, if we follow sig figs, the answer should be pH = 12.6 (two sig figs). But maybe the problem expects more decimal places. However, given the initial data, it's safer to present two sig figs. Wait, but the volumes are given as 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL. If those are considered as exact (i.e., 3 sig figs), then:\n\n0.1 M (1 sig fig) * 0.500 L (3 sig figs) = 0.05 moles (1 sig fig).\n\n0.2 M (1 sig fig) * 0.400 L (3 sig figs) = 0.08 moles (1 sig fig).\n\n0.3 M (1 sig fig) * 0.300 L (3 sig figs) = 0.09 moles (1 sig fig).\n\nThen, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 (two sig figs? Since 0.09 is 1 sig fig, multiplied by 2, exact, so 0.18 would be two sig figs? Wait, no. If 0.09 has one sig fig, then 0.18 would also have one sig fig, as the 2 is exact. So, 0.18 would be 0.2 (one sig fig). Wait, but 0.09 is one sig fig, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18, which is two decimal places but still one sig fig. So, 0.18 would be considered as 0.2 (one sig fig). But this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for two sig figs in the answer. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the answer is expected to be around 12.6 or 12.62. Since in the calculation steps, we arrived at approximately 12.62, but considering significant figures, maybe 12.6. However, in many cases, pH values are given to two decimal places when possible. But given the initial data's precision, perhaps two decimal places are acceptable. Alternatively, the answer might be 12.62. Let me check with exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let's use more precise values. The exact moles after each step:\n\nHCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nH+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n\nThen, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.10 OH- + 0.05 CH3COOH → 0.05 CH3COO- + 0.05 H2O, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nTotal volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666...

To determine the pH of the solution created by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}
   \]

2. **Determine the moles of each component:**
   - **CH3COOH:** \(0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles}\)
   - **HCl:** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles}\) (contributes \(0.08 \, \text{moles H}^+\))

But first, let's check the initial neutralization between H+ (from HCl) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2). The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So, after neutralization, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Then, this excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.

The moles of acetic acid are 0.05. The reaction between OH- and CH3COOH is 1:1. So, 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, the OH- is 0.10 moles after neutralizing HCl's H+. Then, the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O. So, each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of CH3COOH. So, if there's 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, then OH- will deprotonate all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, converting it to CH3COO-, and then there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left. So, the solution will have excess OH- of 0.05 moles, and the total volume is 1.2 L. Then, the concentration of OH- would be 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Then, pOH is -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify each step again.

First, moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 react: 0.08 H+ + 0.18 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate all the CH3COOH available. So, 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO- and H2O. The remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, total OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. That seems correct. But let me check if there's any other factors. For example, the acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base, but if there's excess OH- in solution, the pH is dominated by the excess OH-, so the contribution from acetate would be negligible. Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62. But let me check calculations again.

Wait, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH. So, if there's 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, then all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remain. So, yes, that's correct. Then, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L. So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M. Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.6. But let me check if I made any mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and OH- from all sources, then see the net. But since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes H+; Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-; and CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, it will be deprotonated. So, perhaps the steps I took are correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the order of reactions. Let me think again.

First, HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will neutralize each other first. Then, any excess H+ or OH- will react with the weak acid or base. But in this case, after neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)2, there's excess OH-, which then reacts with CH3COOH. So, the steps are correct. So, the final excess OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check the exact value of [OH-].

0.05 moles in 1.2 L: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. The pOH is log(1/0.0416667) = log(24) ≈ 1.38. Wait, log(24) is log(2.4 × 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1 ≈ 0.38 + 1 = 1.38. So, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, the answer is approximately 12.62. But maybe I should use more precise calculation for the logarithm.

Alternatively, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M. So, [OH-] = 4.16667 × 10^-2 M. The pOH is -log(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log(1/(4.16667 × 10^-2)) = log(24). Let me compute log(24) more accurately. Since log(24) = log(2.4 × 10^1) = log(2.4) + 1. log(2) = 0.3010, log(2.4) = log(2) + log(1.2) = 0.3010 + 0.07918 ≈ 0.3802. So, log(24) ≈ 1.3802. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.3802, pH ≈ 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. But let me check if there's any mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another way to approach this is to consider that when you mix a strong acid and a strong base, the net H+ or OH- is calculated first, then any remaining OH- would react with the weak acid. So, that's exactly what I did. So, the steps are correct. Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62. But let me check if the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH is considered properly.

Yes, because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid completely until either the OH- is consumed or the CH3COOH is consumed. Since there's more OH- (0.10 moles) than CH3COOH (0.05 moles), all the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO-, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain. So, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So, the pH is approximately 12.62. But maybe the answer expects a more precise value. Let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for logarithms. Let me compute [OH-] again. 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M. The pOH is -log10(0.0416667). Let's compute this:

log10(0.0416667) = log10(4.16667 × 10^-2) = log10(4.16667) + log10(10^-2) = log10(4.16667) - 2.

log10(4) = 0.60206, log10(4.16667) is a bit higher. Let's compute it using linear approximation between 4 and 4.16667. The difference between 4 and 4.16667 is 0.16667. Since log10(4) = 0.60206, and log10(4.2) = log10(4) + log10(1.05) ≈ 0.60206 + 0.021189 = 0.62325. But 4.16667 is 4 + 0.16667, which is 1/6 of the way from 4 to 4.2 (since 0.16667 is 1/6 of 1). So, the increase in log10 from 4 to 4.2 is 0.62325 - 0.60206 = 0.02119 over 0.2 increase in x. So, per 0.1 increase in x, log10 increases by 0.010595. So, 0.16667 is 0.1 * 1.6667, so the increase would be 0.010595 * 1.6667 ≈ 0.01766. Therefore, log10(4.16667) ≈ 0.60206 + 0.01766 ≈ 0.61972. Therefore, log10(4.16667 × 10^-2) ≈ 0.61972 - 2 = -1.38028. Therefore, pOH = -(-1.38028) = 1.38028, so pH = 14 - 1.38028 ≈ 12.6197, which rounds to 12.62. So, the pH is approximately 12.62.

But let me check if there's any other factor. For example, the acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base. However, in the presence of excess OH- from the strong base, the contribution of acetate to the pH would be negligible because the solution is already strongly basic. Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the excess OH- concentration, and the acetate ion's hydrolysis can be ignored. Therefore, the pH is indeed approximately 12.62.

Alternatively, if there were no excess OH- after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH, then we would have to consider the acetate ion's effect. But in this case, since there's excess OH-, the pH is determined by that excess. Therefore, the answer should be pH ≈ 12.62. But let me check once more.

Wait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-:

HCl provides 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles OH-.

CH3COOH can provide up to 0.05 moles H+ if it were to fully dissociate, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't. However, in the presence of a strong base (OH-), the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So, the OH- will react with both the H+ from HCl and the H+ available from CH3COOH.

But the order of reactions is important. Strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will neutralize first. Then, any remaining OH- will deprotonate the weak acid. So, first, H+ from HCl (0.08) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18) react. The net OH- after that is 0.10. Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

Therefore, the final [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M, leading to pH ≈ 12.62. So, this seems correct.

Alternatively, if I consider that after neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)2, the solution has excess OH- of 0.10 moles. Then, adding the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) which can donate H+ would react with some of the OH-:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will consume 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.

Therefore, the same result. So, the pH is 12.62. Therefore, the answer is approximately 12.62. But let me check if the problem states anything about activity coefficients or temperature, but since it's a standard problem, we can assume 25°C and ideal solutions, so activity coefficients are ignored. Therefore, the answer is pH ≈ 12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 12.62. Alternatively, maybe to two significant figures, but let's check the data given.

The concentrations are given as 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.3 M, which have one decimal place, so maybe two significant figures. The volumes are 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL, which are exact, so the significant figures come from the concentrations. So, 0.1 (1 sig fig), 0.2 (1), 0.3 (1). But when calculating moles, 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 (1 sig fig), 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 (1 sig fig), 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 (1 sig fig). Then, when subtracting, 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 (two decimal places, but maybe two sig figs here). Then, 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 (1 sig fig). Then, 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... which would be 0.042 M (two sig figs). Then, pOH = -log(0.042) ≈ 1.376, pH = 12.624, which would round to 12.62 (two decimal places) or 12.6 (two sig figs). But since the given data has one sig fig for concentrations, but the volumes are exact, perhaps the answer should have two sig figs. Wait, but when you multiply 0.1 M (1 sig fig) by 0.5 L (exact), the moles would be 0.05, which is 1 sig fig. Similarly, 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 (1 sig fig), 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 (1 sig fig). Then, when you subtract 0.18 (two sig figs, since 0.09 * 2) - 0.08 (1 sig fig) = 0.10 (two sig figs). Then, subtract 0.05 (1 sig fig) from 0.10 (two sig figs), resulting in 0.05 (1 sig fig). Then, 0.05 / 1.2 (exact) = 0.041666..., which is 0.042 (two sig figs). Then, pOH = -log(0.042) ≈ 1.376, pH = 12.624. So, if we follow sig figs, the answer should be pH = 12.6 (two sig figs). But maybe the problem expects more decimal places. However, given the initial data, it's safer to present two sig figs. Wait, but the volumes are given as 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL. If those are considered as exact (i.e., 3 sig figs), then:

0.1 M (1 sig fig) * 0.500 L (3 sig figs) = 0.05 moles (1 sig fig).

0.2 M (1 sig fig) * 0.400 L (3 sig figs) = 0.08 moles (1 sig fig).

0.3 M (1 sig fig) * 0.300 L (3 sig figs) = 0.09 moles (1 sig fig).

Then, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 (two sig figs? Since 0.09 is 1 sig fig, multiplied by 2, exact, so 0.18 would be two sig figs? Wait, no. If 0.09 has one sig fig, then 0.18 would also have one sig fig, as the 2 is exact. So, 0.18 would be 0.2 (one sig fig). Wait, but 0.09 is one sig fig, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18, which is two decimal places but still one sig fig. So, 0.18 would be considered as 0.2 (one sig fig). But this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for two sig figs in the answer. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the answer is expected to be around 12.6 or 12.62. Since in the calculation steps, we arrived at approximately 12.62, but considering significant figures, maybe 12.6. However, in many cases, pH values are given to two decimal places when possible. But given the initial data's precision, perhaps two decimal places are acceptable. Alternatively, the answer might be 12.62. Let me check with exact calculation.

Alternatively, let's use more precise values. The exact moles after each step:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.10 OH- + 0.05 CH3COOH → 0.05 CH3COO- + 0.05 H2O, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH-.

Total volume: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) = 1.3802.

pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62.

Given that, I think the answer should be pH = 12.62. Therefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.


**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.
