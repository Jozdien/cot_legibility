The compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid** (para-chlorobenzoic acid). Here's the analysis:

1. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) indicate the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes in a ~3:1 ratio).  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂** (exact mass ≈ 156.5, consistent with the observed m/z = 156).

2. **IR Spectroscopy**:  
   - **Broad peak (3500–2700 cm⁻¹)**: O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.  
   - **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, confirming the -COOH group.

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Singlet from the acidic -COOH proton.  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets from the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.  
     - The downfield doublet (8.02 ppm) corresponds to protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.  
     - The upfield doublet (7.72 ppm) corresponds to protons *ortho* to the Cl substituent.  

**Structure**:  
The data align with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, where a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group are in para positions on a benzene ring. This structure explains the molecular weight, chlorine isotope pattern, IR absorption, and NMR splitting patterns.

Okay, let's try to figure out what this compound is. So, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the molecular weight. The peak at 158 is about 32% of the molecular ion's height. Hmm, that ratio of 156 to 158 being roughly 100:32 makes me think there's a chlorine atom in the molecule because chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, in about a 3:1 ratio. So the molecular formula probably includes one chlorine atom. Let me check: the molecular weight is 156. If there's a Cl (35.5), then the rest of the molecule would be 156 - 35.5 = 120.5. Let's round that to 120. So maybe the formula is C7H7ClO2? Wait, adding up: C (12*7=84), H (7), Cl (35.5), O (32). Total is 84 +7 +35.5 +32= 158.5. That's over. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe it's C8H9ClO? Let's check: 12*8=96, 9, 35.5, 16. Total 96+9=105 +35.5=140.5 +16=156.5. Close to 156. But maybe the exact mass would be better. Alternatively, maybe C7H5ClO2? 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Still a bit over, but maybe considering exact masses, it's possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a different combination. Let's think. The molecular ion is 156. If there's one Cl, then 156 -35.5=120.5. So the rest of the molecule is 120.5. Let's see, possible combinations. For example, C6H5O2Cl: 6*12=72, 5*1=5, 2*16=32, Cl=35.5. Total 72+5=77+32=109+35.5=144.5. No. Not matching. Wait, maybe C7H7ClO? 7*12=84, 7*1=7, 35.5, 16. Total 84+7=91+35.5=126.5+16=142.5. No. Hmm. Maybe two oxygens? Let's try C6H4ClO2: 6*12=72, 4*1=4, 35.5, 32. Total 72+4=76+35.5=111.5+32=143.5. Still not 156. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H9ClO. Let's check again: 8*12=96, 9*1=9, 35.5, 16. Total 96+9=105+35.5=140.5+16=156.5. Close to 156. Maybe the exact mass is 156. So the molecular formula is C8H9ClO. But let's check the IR and NMR data.

The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which could indicate an O-H stretch, like a carboxylic acid. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700-1720 cm^-1, and the O-H stretch is broad. So maybe a carboxylic acid with a chlorine substituent. But wait, the molecular formula we thought was C8H9ClO. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH. So the molecular formula would be C8H9ClO2. Wait, but earlier calculation gave 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe the exact mass is 156. Let's check. For C8H9ClO2: C=12*8=108, H=9, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 108+9=117+35.5=152.5+32=184.5? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, molecular formula for a carboxylic acid would be RCOOH. So if the molecular formula is C8H9ClO2, that would be possible. Let me recalculate. 8 carbons: 8*12=96, 9 hydrogens:9, Cl:35.5, O:32. Total 96+9=105+35.5=140.5+32=172.5. That's way over. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The molecular ion is 156. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH. So the molecular weight would be (R) + 45 (for COOH). So R would be 156 -45=111. So R is C6H11Cl? Let's see: C6H11Cl: 6*12=72 +11*1=11 +35.5=35.5. Total 72+11=83+35.5=118.5. That's over 111. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group. The IR peak at 1720 could also be an ester or a ketone. But the broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 might be an O-H, but maybe it's an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Let's look at the NMR. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a very deshielded proton, typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So that supports the presence of a COOH group. Then, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest that there are two protons each, adjacent to substituents. So maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a chlorine. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we have a chlorine substituent, the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 7*12=84 +5*1=5 +35.5 +32=84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. Close to 156. The molecular ion is at 156, so maybe that's it. The chlorine isotope peaks would explain the m/z 158 (156 +2 for Cl-37). The ratio 100:32 is about 3:1, which matches the natural abundance of Cl isotopes (35:37 ~3:1). So the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. That would be para-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the NMR. The aromatic protons: in para-substituted benzoic acid, the protons ortho to the COOH and Cl would be deshielded. The COOH proton is at 11 ppm as a singlet. The aromatic protons would be two doublets. For para-substituted benzoic acid with a Cl in the para position, the ring protons would be two doublets. Wait, but benzoic acid has the COOH group in the para position relative to the substituent. Wait, if the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are Cl and COOH in the para positions. The aromatic protons would be the two protons adjacent to the Cl (ortho to Cl) and the two adjacent to the COOH (ortho to COOH). But in the NMR, there are two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between the two sets of protons would be meta to each other, so the coupling constant J would be around 2 Hz, but in para-substituted benzene rings with two substituents, the protons can be split into two doublets if the substituents are in para positions. Let me think. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. But in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would also be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets. The protons adjacent to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded more, so higher ppm. The protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be slightly deshielded but maybe less so. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are typically around 7.8-8.0 ppm. The Cl substituent is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho protons to Cl would be deshielded. Let me check typical shifts. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0-8.1 ppm, and the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) might be around 7.5-7.7 ppm. The coupling between these protons would be between the ortho and meta positions. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons on adjacent carbons (ortho to each substituent) would be adjacent to each other. So the protons at 2 and 3 would be adjacent. So the coupling between the protons at 2 and 3 would be a meta coupling? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. The benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. The protons at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to position 1 (COOH), and the protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to position 4 (Cl). The protons at 2 and 3 are adjacent to each other (ortho), so they would be coupled with each other. Similarly, protons at 5 and 6 would be adjacent. But in the NMR, we have two doublets. That suggests that each pair of protons (2 and 6, and 3 and 5) are equivalent and each couple to one other set. Wait, maybe the coupling is between the two sets. For example, each proton in the 2 and 6 positions (ortho to COOH) would couple with the protons in the 3 and 5 positions (ortho to Cl), but since they are all part of the same aromatic ring, the splitting could result in doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the meta positions, but that would complicate the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two distinct doublets. Let me check a reference. For example, in 4-nitrobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons ortho to the nitro group are around 8.3 ppm (as a doublet), and those ortho to the COOH are around 7.8 ppm (as a doublet). Similarly, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to Cl would be downfield shifted compared to the protons ortho to COOH. Wait, but Cl is less electron-withdrawing than nitro. So maybe the protons ortho to Cl are around 7.6-7.8 ppm, and those ortho to COOH are around 8.0-8.1 ppm. The NMR given here has 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). That fits with the idea that the higher ppm is the protons ortho to COOH, and the lower ppm is ortho to Cl. The coupling between these would be J = around 8-9 Hz, typical for ortho coupling in aromatic rings. Wait, but in para-substituted rings, the coupling between the two sets of protons would be through the ring, but I think in such cases, each proton is coupled to two adjacent protons, leading to a doublet of doublets. However, if the two protons in each set are equivalent, then the splitting might collapse into a doublet. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two different groups, the protons ortho to each group would each be equivalent and couple with the adjacent protons. But this might result in a doublet for each set if the coupling constants are the same. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets are due to the coupling between the two sets. Let me think. If the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) are each adjacent to protons at positions 3 and 1 (but position 1 is COOH, which doesn't have a proton), so each of these protons (2 and 6) is adjacent to position 3 and 5, which are ortho to Cl. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the NMR data is more straightforward. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two different substituents. The downfield shift of the COOH proton at 11 ppm as a singlet makes sense because carboxylic acid protons are usually around there. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. So putting this all together, the structure is likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2, which has a molecular weight of 156.5. The molecular ion at m/z 156 is close enough, considering possible rounding. The chlorine isotope pattern matches (m/z 156 and 158 in 3:1 ratio). The IR and NMR data fit. So the answer should be 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Okay, let's try to figure out what this compound is. So, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the molecular weight. The peak at 158 is about 32% of the molecular ion's height. Hmm, that ratio of 156 to 158 being roughly 100:32 makes me think there's a chlorine atom in the molecule because chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, in about a 3:1 ratio. So the molecular formula probably includes one chlorine atom. Let me check: the molecular weight is 156. If there's a Cl (35.5), then the rest of the molecule would be 156 - 35.5 = 120.5. Let's round that to 120. So maybe the formula is C7H7ClO2? Wait, adding up: C (12*7=84), H (7), Cl (35.5), O (32). Total is 84 +7 +35.5 +32= 158.5. That's over. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe it's C8H9ClO? Let's check: 12*8=96, 9, 35.5, 16. Total 96+9=105 +35.5=140.5 +16=156.5. Close to 156. But maybe the exact mass would be better. Alternatively, maybe C7H5ClO2? 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Still a bit over, but maybe considering exact masses, it's possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a different combination. Let's think. The molecular ion is 156. If there's one Cl, then 156 -35.5=120.5. So the rest of the molecule is 120.5. Let's see, possible combinations. For example, C6H5O2Cl: 6*12=72, 5*1=5, 2*16=32, Cl=35.5. Total 72+5=77+32=109+35.5=144.5. No. Not matching. Wait, maybe C7H7ClO? 7*12=84, 7*1=7, 35.5, 16. Total 84+7=91+35.5=126.5+16=142.5. No. Hmm. Maybe two oxygens? Let's try C6H4ClO2: 6*12=72, 4*1=4, 35.5, 32. Total 72+4=76+35.5=111.5+32=143.5. Still not 156. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H9ClO. Let's check again: 8*12=96, 9*1=9, 35.5, 16. Total 96+9=105+35.5=140.5+16=156.5. Close to 156. Maybe the exact mass is 156. So the molecular formula is C8H9ClO. But let's check the IR and NMR data.

The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which could indicate an O-H stretch, like a carboxylic acid. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700-1720 cm^-1, and the O-H stretch is broad. So maybe a carboxylic acid with a chlorine substituent. But wait, the molecular formula we thought was C8H9ClO. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH. So the molecular formula would be C8H9ClO2. Wait, but earlier calculation gave 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe the exact mass is 156. Let's check. For C8H9ClO2: C=12*8=108, H=9, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 108+9=117+35.5=152.5+32=184.5? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, molecular formula for a carboxylic acid wou

# Anthropic completion

Let's attempt to determine the identity of this compound. The molecular ion peak appears at m/z 156, indicating the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with approximately 32% of the molecular ion's intensity. This 100:32 ratio between the 156 and 158 peaks suggests the presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37) in roughly a 3:1 ratio. So the molecular formula likely contains one chlorine atom.

If we subtract the atomic weight of chlorine (35.5) from the molecular weight of 156, we get 120.5 for the remainder of the molecule. Let's consider some possible molecular formulas.

For C7H7ClO2: C (84) + H (7) + Cl (35.5) + O (32) = 158.5, which exceeds our target.

For C8H9ClO: C (96) + H (9) + Cl (35.5) + O (16) = 156.5, which is close to 156.

For C7H5ClO2: C (84) + H (5) + Cl (35.5) + O (32) = 156.5, also close.

Let's try other combinations:
C6H5O2Cl: C (72) + H (5) + O (32) + Cl (35.5) = 144.5. Not a match.
C7H7ClO: C (84) + H (7) + Cl (35.5) + O (16) = 142.5. Not a match.
C6H4ClO2: C (72) + H (4) + Cl (35.5) + O (32) = 143.5. Not a match.

Rechecking C8H9ClO: C (96) + H (9) + Cl (35.5) + O (16) = 156.5. This is very close to 156, so the molecular formula could be C8H9ClO considering exact masses.

Examining the IR data, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, potentially indicating an O-H stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which is consistent with carboxylic acids (typically around 1700-1720 cm^-1). This suggests we might have a carboxylic acid with a chlorine substituent.

However, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH, meaning C8H9ClO2. Let's calculate: C (96) + H (9) + Cl (35.5) + O (32) = 172.5, which doesn't match our molecular ion of 156. So we need to reconsider...

Alright, let's work out what this compound is. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, indicating the molecular weight. The peak at 158 is about 32% of the molecular ion's height. This 100:32 ratio between 156 and 158 suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, in a 3:1 ratio. Thus, the molecular formula likely includes one chlorine atom. The molecular weight is 156. With Cl at 35.5, the remainder would be 156 - 35.5 = 120.5, roughly 120. Perhaps the formula is C7H7ClO2? Checking: C (12*7=84), H (7), Cl (35.5), O (32) gives a total of 84 + 7 + 35.5 + 32 = 158.5, slightly over. I may have miscalculated. Another possibility is C8H9ClO. Checking: 12*8=96, 9, 35.5, 16 results in 96+9=105 +35.5=140.5 + 16 = 156.5, close to 156. Perhaps the exact mass would clarify. Alternatively, maybe C7H5ClO2? That gives 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5, again slightly over, but possible with exact masses. Let's explore other combinations. If there's one Cl, then 156 - 35.5 = 120.5. Considering C6H5O2Cl: 6*12=72, 5, 2*16=32, Cl=35.5 totals 72+5=77+32=109+35.5=144.5, not matching. How about C7H7ClO? That's 7*12=84, 7, 35.5, 16 totaling 84+7=91+35.5=126.5+16=142.5, still not right. Perhaps two oxygens are needed? Trying C6H4ClO2: 6*12=72, 4, 35.5, 32 totals 72+4=76+35.5=111.5+32=143.5, not 156. Rechecking C8H9ClO: 8*12=96, 9, 35.5, 16 totals 96+9=105+35.5=140.5+16=156.5, close to 156. The exact mass might be 156, indicating C8H9ClO as the molecular formula. Let's verify with IR and NMR data.

The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, possibly indicating an O-H stretch like in carboxylic acids. A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have carbonyl peaks around 1700-1720 cm^-1, with a broad O-H stretch. This suggests a carboxylic acid with a chlorine substituent. However, if the molecular formula is C8H9ClO, and it’s a carboxylic acid, it should be RCOOH, making it C8H9ClO2. Calculations indicated 156.5, while the molecular ion is at 156. The exact mass might still be 156. Verifying for C8H9ClO2: C=12*8=96, H=9, Cl=35.5, O=32, totals 96+9=105+35.5=140.5+32=172.5. Wait, something isn’t adding up; the calculations need rechecking...

So if the molecular ion is 156, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me check: C7H5ClO2. 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 32. Total 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. That's very close to 156. So maybe that's the formula. So the compound could be a chlorobenzoic acid. For example, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the NMR. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a very deshielded proton, likely the carboxylic acid proton. Then two doublets: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between the two doublets would be para coupling, but in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are actually in the ortho and meta positions. Wait, no. If the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but in this case, maybe one substituent (Cl) and the COOH group. Wait, but benzoic acid has the COOH group attached to the benzene. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are in the para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let me think. The structure would be Cl attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the COOH group. So the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then the remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. But since the substituents are para, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent, and those adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. Then Cl at position 4. So the ring would have COOH at 1, Cl at 4. Then the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. The coupling between H-2 and H-3 would be ortho, and H-2 and H-6 would be para. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets. Let me recall the splitting for para-substituted benzoic acid. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The protons ortho to the COOH group (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and couple with the adjacent protons (H-3 and H-5), which are ortho to Cl. But maybe in this case, the coupling is between the two sets. Let me check typical NMR shifts. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing groups (COOH and Cl) would be deshielded. The COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. The Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded but maybe slightly less than those next to COOH. In the NMR, we have two doublets: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). The higher shift (8.02) would correspond to the protons ortho to COOH, and the lower (7.72) ortho to Cl. The coupling between these would be J = around 8-9 Hz, typical for ortho coupling in aromatic rings. So each proton is coupling with two adjacent protons, but in a para-substituted ring, the symmetry makes them appear as doublets. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different substituents, the protons would split into two doublets. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two sets of protons (ortho to COOH and ortho to Cl) would each be a doublet. The integration would be 2H each, which matches the NMR data. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, which is usually a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, but in the IR, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is typical for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, which is broad due to hydrogen bonding. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is consistent with the carboxylic acid proton, though sometimes it can be broadened, but maybe in this case, it's a sharp singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl (ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid). But the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet. But 11.0 is a bit high, but possible for a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 2-3 ppm? No, wait, no. Wait, no, carboxylic acid protons are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, maybe I confused with something else. Let me confirm. In 1H NMR, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet due to exchange broadening. So the singlet at 11.0 ppm fits. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 is the O-H stretch. So putting this all together, the compound is likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the molecular weight. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 7*12 +5*1 +35.5 +16*2 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, which is close enough considering possible rounding. The isotopic peaks: Cl has about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the molecular ion (M) is 156 (with Cl-35), and M+2 would be 158 (Cl-37). The ratio of M to M+2 is 3:1, but here it's 100% to 32%, which is roughly 3:1, so that matches. Therefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The NMR peaks: the two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the COOH and Cl groups, respectively. The coupling between them would be J = 8-9 Hz. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton.

The unidentified compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here's the analysis:

1. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** corresponds to the molecular weight.  
   - The **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)** indicates the presence of one chlorine atom (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes in a ~3:1 ratio).

2. **IR Spectroscopy**:  
   - **Broad peak (3500–2700 cm⁻¹)**: O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (hydrogen-bonded).  
   - **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Carboxylic acid proton (deshielded, broadened to a singlet due to exchange).  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets from aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene ring.

old be RCOOH. So if the molecular ion is 156, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me check: C7H5ClO2. 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 32. Total 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. That's very close to 156. So maybe that's the formula. So the compound could be a chlorobenzoic acid. For example, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the NMR. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a very deshielded proton, likely the carboxylic acid proton. Then two doublets: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between the two doublets would be para coupling, but in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are actually in the ortho and meta positions. Wait, no. If the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but in this case, maybe one substituent (Cl) and the COOH group. Wait, but benzoic acid has the COOH group attached to the benzene. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are in the para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let me think. The structure would be Cl attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the COOH group. So the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then the remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. But since the substituents are para, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent, and those adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. Then Cl at position 4. So the ring would have COOH at 1, Cl at 4. Then the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. The coupling between H-2 and H-3 would be ortho, and H-2 and H-6 would be para. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets. Let me recall the splitting for para-substituted benzoic acid. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The protons ortho to the COOH group (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and couple with the adjacent protons (H-3 and H-5), which are ortho to Cl. But maybe in this case, the coupling is between the two sets. Let me check typical NMR shifts. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing groups (COOH and Cl) would be deshielded. The COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. The Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded but maybe slightly less than those next to COOH. In the NMR, we have two doublets: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). The higher shift (8.02) would correspond to the protons ortho to COOH, and the lower (7.72) ortho to Cl. The coupling between these would be J = around 8-9 Hz, typical for ortho coupling in aromatic rings. So each proton is coupling with two adjacent protons, but in a para-substituted ring, the symmetry makes them appear as doublets. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different substituents, the protons would split into two doublets. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two sets of protons (ortho to COOH and ortho to Cl) would each be a doublet. The integration would be 2H each, which matches the NMR data. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, which is usually a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, but in the IR, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is typical for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, which is broad due to hydrogen bonding.

But the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet. But 11.0 is a bit high, but possible for a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 2-3 ppm? No, wait, no. Wait, no, carboxylic acid protons are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, maybe I confused with something else. Let me confirm. In 1H NMR, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet due to exchange broadening. So the singlet at 11.0 ppm fits. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 is the O-H stretch. So putting this all together, the compound is likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the molecular weight. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 7*12 +5*1 +35.5 +16*2 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, which is close enough considering possible rounding. The isotopic peaks: Cl has about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the molecular ion (M) is 156 (with Cl-35), and M+2 would be 158 (Cl-37). The ratio of M to M+2 is 3:1, but here it's 100% to 32%, which is roughly 3:1, so that matches. Therefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The NMR peaks: the two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the COOH and Cl groups, respectively. The coupling between them would be J = 8-9 Hz. The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton. All the data fits.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's check: 7*12 +5*1 +35.5 +2*16 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. That's very close to 156. So perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. But how does that fit with the IR?

Close enough considering possible rounding. So molecular formula could be C7H5ClO2. That would correspond to a chlorobenzoic acid. For example, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the NMR. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, but in the data given, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet (s, 1H). However, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad due to exchange, but in some cases, especially if the sample is dry or in a certain solvent, they can appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm. 11 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid. Then, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. If the substituents are in the para positions, like in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's check the coupling. The two doublets with 2H each would be the two sets of protons ortho and meta to the substituents. Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the substituents are at the para position. The carboxylic acid group is at one position, and the chlorine at the para. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let me draw it. The benzene ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (para). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). Wait, but in that case, the protons would split into two doublets. The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to a doublet of doublets, but if the substituents are para, perhaps the symmetry leads to two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (COOH and Cl), the remaining protons would be in two equivalent pairs. For example, if COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 4, then positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (ortho to COOH, meta to Cl), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent (meta to COOH, ortho to Cl). Each pair would be split into doublets. The coupling constants would be different. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that would lead to different splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula would need to account for Cl and COOH. So, if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the structure is Cl-C6H4-COOH. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2, which matches the molecular weight calculation. The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let's check the typical shifts. In benzoic acid, the aromatic protons are deshielded. For 4-substituted benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded. The protons meta to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded. But with a Cl substituent in the para position (position 4), which is electron-withdrawing, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded. Wait, maybe the two doublets are due to the protons ortho to the Cl and the protons ortho to the COOH. Let me check. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 4). The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded and split into a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent protons (positions 3 and 5). The protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would also be deshielded and split into another doublet. However, the coupling between adjacent protons would lead to a doublet of doublets, but due to symmetry, maybe they average into a doublet. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the coupling is between equivalent protons, leading to a simple doublet. Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are from the two sets of protons on the benzene ring. Let me look up typical NMR shifts for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. From references, the aromatic protons in 4-chlorobenzoic acid are two doublets. The protons ortho to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) around 7.5 ppm. The given NMR data has 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), which matches this. The downfield shift of the COOH proton is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet. The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. The molecular ion at m/z 156 with a chlorine isotope pattern (M and M+2 in 3:1 ratio) fits C7H5ClO2.

The compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** with a **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)** indicates the presence of **one chlorine atom** (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes in a 3:1 ratio).  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂** (calculated molecular weight = 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the observed m/z = 156).

2. **IR Spectroscopy**:  
   - **Broad peak (3500–2700 cm⁻¹)**: O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.  
   - **Sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.  

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Singlet from the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets from the aromatic protons on the para-substituted benzene ring. The deshielded protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing groups (-COOH and -Cl) split into two distinct doublets.  

**Structure**:  
The para-substitution pattern (Cl and -COOH groups opposite each other on the benzene ring) explains the symmetry in the NMR peaks. The spectral data align perfectly with **4-chlorobenzoic acid** (Cl-C₆H₄-COOH).  

**Chemical Structure**:

Maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So exact mass would be approximately 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Close enough considering possible rounding. So molecular formula could be C7H5ClO2. That would correspond to a chlorobenzoic acid. For example, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the NMR. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, but in the data given, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet (s, 1H). However, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad due to exchange, but in some cases, especially if the sample is dry or in a certain solvent, they can appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm. 11 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid. Then, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. The coupling between the two doublets suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. If the substituents are in the para positions, like in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's check the coupling. The two doublets with 2H each would be the two sets of protons ortho and meta to the substituents. Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the substituents are at the para position. The carboxylic acid group is at one position, and the chlorine at the para. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let me draw it. The benzene ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (para). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). Wait, but in that case, the protons would split into two doublets. The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to a doublet of doublets, but if the substituents are para, perhaps the symmetry leads to two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (COOH and Cl), the remaining protons would be in two equivalent pairs. For example, if COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 4, then positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (ortho to COOH, meta to Cl), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent (meta to COOH, ortho to Cl). Each pair would be split into doublets. The coupling constants would be different. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that would lead to different splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula would need to account for Cl and COOH. So, if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the structure is Cl-C6H4-COOH. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2, which matches the molecular weight calculation. The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let's check the typical shifts. In benzoic acid, the aromatic protons are deshielded. For 4-substituted benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded. The protons meta to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded. But with a Cl substituent in the para position (position 4), which is electron-withdrawing, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded. Wait, maybe the two doublets are due to the protons ortho to the Cl and the protons ortho to the COOH. Let me check. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 4). The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded and split into a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent protons (positions 3 and 5). The protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would also be deshielded and split into another doublet. However, the coupling between adjacent protons would lead to a doublet of doublets, but due to symmetry, maybe they average into a doublet. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the coupling is between equivalent protons, leading to a simple doublet. Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are from the two sets of protons on the benzene ring. Let me look up typical NMR shifts for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. From references, the aromatic protons in 4-chlorobenzoic acid are two doublets. The protons ortho to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) around 7.5 ppm. The given NMR data has 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), which matches this. The downfield shift of the COOH proton is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet. The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. The molecular ion at m/z 156 with a chlorine isotope pattern (M and M+2 in 3:1 ratio) fits C7H5ClO2. Therefore, the compound is likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
