To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the operator \(\vec{P}\) along the direction \(\vec{n}\). The components of \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by \(\hbar/2\). 

The direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane can be parametrized by an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, giving \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator along this direction is:
\[
P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]
Substituting the Pauli matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\), we get:
\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these, we find the ratio \(a/b = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\). Normalizing the eigenvector, we use trigonometric identities to express the components in terms of \(\theta/2\):
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}}
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of the operator P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector n should be zero. Let me start by recalling the problem statement and breaking it down step by step.

First, the operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given by the corresponding Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are:

For P_x: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
For P_y: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
For P_z: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. Therefore, the components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator along direction n would be:

P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore,

P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Substituting the expressions for P_x and P_z:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the matrix we need to diagonalize is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

But we need the eigenvalue equation:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we can write the equation as:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a two-component vector [a, b]^T. Then the eigenvalue equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Wait, but the eigenvalue is 1 (since we have (ħ/2) multiplying the matrix, and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so when we factor that out, the matrix equation becomes [matrix] * [a; b] = [a; b]. So the equations are:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rearrange these equations:

From the first equation:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b - a = 0
=> (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

From the second equation:

sinθ * a - cosθ * b - b = 0
=> sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0
2) sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

We can write these as a system of linear equations. Let's write them in terms of ratios. Let's solve for a/b or b/a.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ * b
=> a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

Similarly, from equation 2:

sinθ * a = (cosθ + 1) b
=> a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

So we have two expressions for a/b. Let's set them equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Multiply both sides by sinθ (assuming sinθ ≠ 0):

- sin²θ / (cosθ - 1) = cosθ + 1

Multiply both sides by (cosθ - 1):

- sin²θ = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1)

But (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1) = cos²θ - 1 = -sin²θ

So left side: - sin²θ

Right side: - sin²θ

Therefore, the equations are consistent. So we can use either equation to find the ratio a/b.

Let's use equation 2:

a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Alternatively, we can write this as:

a = b * (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the normalization factor.

Let the eigenvector be [A, B]^T, where A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * B

Let’s set B = 1 for simplicity, then A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ. Then the vector is [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T. The norm squared is |A|² + |B|² = [ (cosθ + 1)^2 / sin²θ ] + 1

Let’s compute this:

= (cos²θ + 2 cosθ + 1 + sin²θ)/sin²θ

But cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so:

= (1 + 2 cosθ + 1)/sin²θ
= (2 + 2 cosθ)/sin²θ
= 2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ

Recall that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)

Therefore:

2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ = 2*(2 cos²(θ/2)) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) ) = (4 cos²(θ/2)) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

Wait, but let me check:

Wait, 2(1 + cosθ) = 2*(2 cos²(θ/2)) = 4 cos²(θ/2)

sin²θ = (2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2)^2 = 4 sin²θ/2 cos²θ/2

So 4 cos²θ/2 / (4 sin²θ/2 cos²θ/2) ) = 1 / sin²θ/2

Therefore, the norm squared is 1 / sin²θ/2, so the norm is 1 / sinθ/2. Therefore, the normalization factor is sinθ/2.

But let's see, maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, we can write the normalization factor as sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))/sinθ. Let's compute sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)):

sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2)) = 2 |cos(θ/2)|. Since θ is an angle in the x-z plane, we can assume θ is between 0 and π, so cos(θ/2) is positive. Therefore, sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = 2 cos(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalization factor is 2 cos(θ/2) / sinθ. But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

2 cos(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalization factor is 1 / sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T * sin(θ/2)

But let's compute this:

First, (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * sin(θ/2) = [ (cosθ + 1) * sin(θ/2) ] / sinθ

Note that cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

[ 2 cos²(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) sin(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = cos(θ/2)

Similarly, the second component is 1 * sin(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again.

Starting from the unnormalized vector [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]

Expressed in terms of θ/2:

cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2)

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Therefore, (cosθ + 1)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2)

So the unnormalized vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

The norm squared is cot²(θ/2) + 1 = csc²(θ/2) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

Therefore, the norm is 1 / sin(θ/2), so the normalized vector is sin(θ/2) * [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Yes, that's correct. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Alternatively, in terms of components, this is:

First component: cos(θ/2)

Second component: sin(θ/2)

But let me verify this by plugging back into the eigenvalue equation.

Let’s take the matrix [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] and multiply by [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

First component:

cosθ * cos(θ/2) + sinθ * sin(θ/2)

Second component:

sinθ * cos(θ/2) - cosθ * sin(θ/2)

Let’s compute the first component:

cosθ * cos(θ/2) + sinθ * sin(θ/2)

Using the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, so this is cos(θ - θ/2) = cos(θ/2)

Similarly, the second component:

sinθ * cos(θ/2) - cosθ * sin(θ/2) = sin(θ - θ/2) = sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the result is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, which is exactly the eigenvector, so the eigenvalue is 1. Therefore, when we multiply by ħ/2, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, as required.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But the problem states that the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. However, the answer seems to depend on θ, which is the angle from the z-axis. But perhaps we need to express it in terms of the components of n. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the eigenvector in terms of the components of n. Since n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, then θ = arccos(n_z). Therefore, θ/2 = (1/2) arccos(n_z). But expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_z and n_x might be more complicated. However, using trigonometric identities, we can express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of cosθ.

Recall that:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since θ is in the x-z plane, and n_x = sinθ, we can also write sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x. However, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = n_x, so:

n_x = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

But perhaps it's simpler to leave the answer in terms of θ/2. However, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Since the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, the answer should be expressed in terms of the angle θ, or in terms of n_x and n_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Alternatively, using the expressions in terms of n_x and n_z:

cosθ = n_z

sinθ = n_x

Therefore, cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But we can also note that:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)) )

Wait, since sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = n_x, so sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2))

But substituting cos(θ/2) from above:

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) = n_x / ( sqrt(2(1 + n_z)) )

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, since the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, and θ is the angle from the z-axis, we can express this in terms of n_z and n_x.

But perhaps the answer is expected in terms of θ, or maybe in terms of the components of n. The problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", so maybe we need to express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z. Let's see.

Given that n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Then θ is the angle such that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Therefore, θ = arctan(n_x / n_z). Then θ/2 is half of that angle.

But expressing the eigenvector as [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] is already in terms of θ. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of n_x and n_z. Let's try that.

Since cosθ = n_z and sinθ = n_x, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But we can also relate sin(θ/2) to n_x. Since sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = n_x, so:

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 + n_z))

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, we can write the eigenvector components as:

First component: sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But let's check if this works. Suppose n is along the z-axis (θ=0), then n_z=1, n_x=0. Then the eigenvector would be [1, 0]^T, which is correct for spin-up in z-direction. If n is along the x-axis (θ=π/2), then n_z=0, n_x=1. Then the eigenvector would be [sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2)]^T, which is correct for spin-up in x-direction. So this seems to work.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, using n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, we can also express it in terms of n_x:

sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + sqrt(1 - n_x^2))/2 )

But that's more complicated. The simplest form is in terms of n_z:

First component: sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ, and sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = sin(θ/2), which is also equal to sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ). So both forms are equivalent.

But the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, and the components of n are n_x, 0, n_z with n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, the answer can be expressed in terms of n_z or θ. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of θ, given that it's a quantum mechanics problem where such eigenvectors are commonly expressed using half-angles.

But let's check dimensions. The components of the eigenvector should be numbers, not involving ħ or any operators. Since the direction is arbitrary, the answer should be in terms of the angle θ that defines the direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention an angle θ; it just says an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be expressed in terms of the components of n, i.e., n_x and n_z, with the understanding that n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

But in the previous calculation, we found that the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Since θ is the angle from the z-axis to n, and n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, we can write cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_z:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), we can also express sin(θ/2) as n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)), but that might not simplify things.

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) ]^T

But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero. Therefore, the eigenvector simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, which matches our previous result.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But θ is the angle from the z-axis to the direction n in the x-z plane. Since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, expressing the answer in terms of θ is acceptable. However, if the answer needs to be in terms of n_x and n_z, we can substitute θ using n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, leading to the components expressed as sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ).

But let's verify with an example. Suppose θ = 0, so n is along the z-axis. Then the eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T, which matches both expressions: cos(0) =1, sin(0)=0, and sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )=1, sqrt( (1 -1)/2 )=0.

If θ = π/2, n is along the x-axis. Then cos(θ/2)=cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(θ/2)=sin(π/4)=√2/2, so the eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is correct for the spin-up in the x-direction. Using the other expression with n_z=0: sqrt( (1 +0)/2 )=√(1/2), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=√(1/2), same result.

Therefore, both forms are correct. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of θ, as it's a common way to express eigenvectors for spin-1/2 particles along an arbitrary direction. Alternatively, since the direction is given as a unit vector n in the x-z plane, the answer could be written in terms of n_z or n_x, but given that n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), it's more straightforward to use θ.

But the problem statement doesn't specify whether to express the answer in terms of θ or in terms of n_x and n_z. However, since the direction is arbitrary and the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, the standard answer in quantum mechanics for a spin-1/2 particle in the direction (sinθ, 0, cosθ) is indeed [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. Therefore, this is likely the expected answer.

Alternatively, if we need to express it without θ, using the components of n, then:

First component: sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_z = sqrt(1 - n_x²), but that might not simplify further.

However, the problem might want the answer in terms of θ, given that it's a standard result. Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

But let me check once more by referring to standard quantum mechanics. The general spin-1/2 eigenstate for a direction specified by polar angles θ and φ is:

|+n> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |-z>

In this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector simplifies to:

cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |-z>

Which corresponds to the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T in the basis where |+z> is [1, 0]^T and |-z> is [0, 1]^T.

Therefore, this confirms that the normalized eigenvector is indeed [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Hence, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

But the problem mentions a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so this applies directly.

Therefore, the final answer should be a normalized vector with components [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], where θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis in the x-z plane.

Since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, and doesn't specify a particular parametrization, but mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, it's appropriate to present the answer in terms of θ, which defines the direction n.

Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, to present them as elements of the vector, we can write them in a column vector or in parentheses. The problem specifies "the elements of the normalized eigenvector", so likely expects the two components listed.

Thus, the answer is the normalized eigenvector has elements cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But to confirm, let's check dimensions and ensure everything is correct.

Yes, the eigenvector is normalized because cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) =1. And as verified earlier, when multiplied by the matrix, it gives back the same vector, confirming it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1, which corresponds to +ħ/2 when scaled by ħ/2.

Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of the components of n, but since n is arbitrary and θ is the standard parameter, this should be acceptable.

Alternatively, if we need to express it without θ, using n_x and n_z, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since n_x = sinθ, and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), we can also write:

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 + n_z))

But this complicates the expression. Therefore, the simplest and most standard form is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Given that the problem statement doesn't specify a particular parameterization beyond the direction n in the x-z plane, and θ is the standard angle used for such purposes in quantum mechanics, the answer should be:

The normalized eigenvector has elements cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between the direction n and the positive z-axis in the x-z plane.

But the problem might expect the answer in terms of the components of n, so let's write it using n_z and n_x. Since n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), we can express sin(θ/2) as n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)), but this again leads back to the previous expressions.

However, considering that the problem might want the answer purely in terms of n_x and n_z without θ, but given that n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, we can express the eigenvector components as:

First component: sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Second component: n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) )

But simplifying this:

Second component = n_x / sqrt(2(1 + n_z))

But this is equivalent to sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ), since:

(1 - n_z)/2 = (1 - n_z)/2

But 1 - n_z = 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), so sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = sin(θ/2), which matches.

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), and sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = cos(θ/2), then sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = sin(θ/2), which is consistent.

Therefore, both forms are valid, but the problem might expect the answer in terms of θ. However, since the direction is given as an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane, and the question doesn't specify θ, perhaps the answer should be in terms of n_z and n_x. But given that the eigenvector is typically expressed using half-angle formulas with θ, and the problem is about quantum mechanics where such expressions are standard, the answer is likely expected in terms of θ.

But to cover all bases, let's present both forms and see which one fits.

Wait, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". The answer should technically be in terms of n, but since n is a unit vector with components (n_x, 0, n_z), and the eigenvector can be written using n_z or n_x. However, the standard expression uses the angle θ, which is related to n_z and n_x via n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ.

Therefore, the most precise answer would be in terms of θ, giving the eigenvector as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. However, if the answer must be in terms of n_x and n_z, then:

First component: sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since the problem doesn't specify, and given the context of quantum mechanics, the answer with θ is standard. However, let's check if the problem gives any hint. The operator components are given in terms of matrices, and the question is about finding the eigenvector for a direction in the x-z plane. The answer is likely expected in terms of the angle θ, which defines the direction n.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

But to make sure, let's recall that when you diagonalize the matrix P_n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z, which is (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]], the eigenvectors are indeed [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] and [-sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2)] for eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Therefore, the answer is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, the answer is:

cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2)

Expressed as a vector:

[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

But the problem might want the answer boxed. Since the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}, and considering that the eigenvector is two components, we can write it as a column vector inside a box.

However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of the components of n, but given the information, θ is the angle parameterizing the direction n in the x-z plane, so expressing in terms of θ is appropriate.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Alternatively, if expressed in terms of n_z:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

But since the problem mentions an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane without specifying whether to use n_z or θ, but given that in quantum mechanics the half-angle formulas with θ are standard, the first form is more likely expected.

However, to reconcile both, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of θ, so I will go with the first boxed answer.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of the operator P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector n should be zero. Let me start by recalling the problem statement and breaking it down step by step.

First, the operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given by the corresponding Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are:

For P_x: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
For P_y: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
For P_z: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. Therefore, the components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator along direction n would be:

P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore,

P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Substituting the expressions for P_x and P_z:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the matrix we need to diagonalize is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

But we need the eigenvalue equation:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we can write the equation as:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a two-component vector [a, b]^T. Then the eigenvalue equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Wait, but the eigenvalue is 1 (since we have (ħ/2) multiplying the matrix, and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so when we factor that out, the matrix equation becomes [matrix] * [a; b] = [a; b]. So the equations are:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rearrange these equations:

From the first equation:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b - a = 0
=> (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

From the second equation:

sinθ * a - cosθ * b - b = 0
=> sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0
2) sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

We can write these as a system of linear equations. Let's write them in terms of ratios. Let's solve for a/b or b/a.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ * b
=> a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

Similarly, from equation 2:

sinθ * a = (cosθ + 1) b
=> a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

So we have two expressions for a/b. Let's set them equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Multiply both sides by sinθ (assuming sinθ ≠ 0):

- sin²θ / (cosθ - 1) = cosθ + 1

Multiply both sides by (cosθ - 1):

- sin²θ = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1)

But (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1) = cos²θ - 1 = -sin²θ

So left side: - sin²θ

Right side: - sin²θ

Therefore, the equations are consistent. So we can use either equation to find the ratio a/b.

Let's use equation 2:

a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Alternatively, we can write this as:

a = b * (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the normalization factor.

Let the eigenvector be [A, B]^T, where A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * B

Let’s set B = 1 for simplicity, then A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ. Then the vector is [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T. The norm squared is |A|² + |B|² = [ (cosθ + 1)^2 / sin²θ ] + 1

Let’s compute this:

= (cos²θ + 2 cosθ + 1 + sin²θ)/sin²θ

But cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so:

= (1 + 2 cosθ + 1)/sin²θ
= (2 + 2 cosθ)/sin²θ
= 2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ

Recall that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)

Therefore:

2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ = 2*(2 cos²(θ/2)) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) ) = (4 cos²(θ/2)) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

Wait, but let me check:

Wait, 2(1 + cosθ) = 2*(2 cos²(θ/2)) = 4 cos²(θ/2)

sin²θ = (2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2)^2 = 4 sin²θ/2 cos²θ/2

So 4 cos²θ/2 / (4 sin²θ/2 cos²θ/2) ) = 1 / sin²θ/2

Therefore, the norm squared is 1 / sin²θ/2, so the norm is 1 / sinθ/2. Therefore, the normalization factor is sinθ/2.

But let's see, maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, we can write the normalization factor as sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))/sinθ. Let's compute sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)):

sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2)) = 2 |cos(θ/2)|. Since θ is an angle in the x-z plane, we can assume θ is between 0 and π, so cos(θ/2) is positive. Therefore, sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = 2 cos(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalization factor is 2 cos(θ/2) / sinθ. But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

2 cos(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalization factor is 1 / sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]^T * sin(θ/2)

But let's compute this:

First, (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * sin(θ/2) = [ (cosθ + 1) * sin(θ/2) ] / sinθ

Note that cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

[ 2 cos²(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) sin(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = cos(θ/2)

Similarly, the second component is 1 * sin(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again.

Starting from the unnormalized vector [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ]

Expressed in terms of θ/2:

cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2)

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Therefore, (cosθ + 1)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ]

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of operator P are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, denoted as P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component equals zero.

The Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2 are:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I can parametrize the direction vector n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator along direction n is:
P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

Since n_y = 0, this simplifies to:
P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Substituting the expressions:
P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] ]
P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

For eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvalue equation becomes:
[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Representing |ψ> as [a, b]^T, I get two equations:
cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Rearranging:
(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0
sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

From the first equation:
a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

From the second equation:
a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Setting these equal:
- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

After manipulating this equation, I find that both sides equal -sin²θ, confirming the equations are consistent.

Using the ratio a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ, the unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to [(cosθ + 1)/sinθ, 1]^T.

To normalize, I calculate the norm squared:
|(cosθ + 1)/sinθ|² + |1|² = (2 + 2cosθ)/sin²θ = 2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ

Using trigonometric identities:
1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)

The norm squared equals 1/sin²(θ/2), so the normalization factor is sin(θ/2).

Applying this to the eigenvector:
[(cosθ + 1)/sinθ, 1]^T * sin(θ/2)

Simplifying the first component:
(cosθ + 1)/sinθ * sin(θ/2) = 2cos²(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) / [2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2)

The second component becomes sin(θ/2).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, so I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon aligned along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is composed of the components P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are the Pauli matrices each multiplied by ħ/2. Given that the direction is constrained to the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector n is zero. Let's start by breaking down the problem systematically.

Firstly, P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component corresponds to a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2, described as follows:

For P_x: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
For P_y: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
For P_z: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since n is oriented in the x-z plane, it can be defined using an angle θ from the z-axis. Thus, the components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), and the operator aligned along direction n is expressed as:

P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

With n_y = 0 because n is in the x-z plane, it simplifies to:

P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

By substituting the expressions for P_x and P_z, we have:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] ]

Factoring out ħ/2 gives:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Thus, the matrix needing diagonalization is:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We need the eigenvalue equation:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

This can be written as:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Let |ψ> denote a two-component vector [a, b]^T, forming the equation:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Upon rearranging:

For the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) * a + sinθ * b = 0

For the second equation:

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

These form a system of linear equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) * a + sinθ * b = 0
2) sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

From equation 1:

a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

From equation 2:

a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Equalizing both expressions for a/b provides:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

Solving the identity confirms both equations are consistent. Using equation 2 gives:

a/b = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Equivalently:

a = b * (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

The eigenvector is thus proportional to [(cosθ + 1)/sinθ, 1]^T. To normalize, the vector can be represented as [A, B]^T, where A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * B. Setting B = 1 results in A = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ, leading to the eigenvector [ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ, 1]^T. The norm squared is:

[(cosθ + 1)² / sin²θ] + 1

Simplifying yields:

= (1 + 2 cosθ + 1)/sin²θ
= 2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ

Since 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2):

2(1 + cosθ)/sin²θ simplifies to:

1 / sin²(θ/2)

Thus, the norm is 1 / sin(θ/2), or normalization factor sin(θ/2), resulting in the normalized eigenvector:

[ (cosθ + 1)/sinθ, 1 ]^T * sin(θ/2)

Computing gives us:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

By expressing in terms of θ/2, we find:

cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Then:

(cosθ + 1)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)]

Hence, confirming the normalized eigenvector is indeed:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Therefore, when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, as required. So this checks out.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. But θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane. Alternatively, if we want to express this in terms of the direction vector n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), then θ is the polar angle.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes eigenvectors are written in terms of the azimuthal angle φ, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0. So the spin eigenvector along a direction with polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ=0 is [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". However, the answer might need to be expressed in terms of θ, or maybe in terms of the components of n. Wait, the problem says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So probably in terms of θ, since n is arbitrary. But let me check if the problem expects a numerical answer or in terms of θ.\n\nWait, the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the answer should be in terms of the angle θ that defines the direction n. But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the components of n. Let me see.\n\nGiven that n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the components of the eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a standard form. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate of the spin operator along direction n (polar angle θ, azimuthal angle φ) is given by:\n\n|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T\n\nSince in this case, φ = 0 (because the direction is in the x-z plane, so azimuthal angle is 0), so it simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Therefore, this is the standard result.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, the problem might want the answer in terms of the components of n, which are n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Let me see if we can express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nUsing trigonometric identities:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut since n_x = sinθ, and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:\n\nn_x = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)\n\nTherefore, sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2))\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, since θ is the angle from the z-axis, and n is a unit vector, perhaps expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_z and n_x.\n\nBut given that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, we can write:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut the sign of sin(θ/2) depends on θ. Since θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is non-negative, so we can take the positive square roots.\n\nAlternatively, since n_x = sinθ, we can write sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = n_x\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1, so sqrt(1 - n_z²) = |n_x|. But since θ is from 0 to π, n_x is non-negative (if we take θ from 0 to π, then n_x = sinθ is non-negative). Therefore, n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²)\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of θ. However, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n", so maybe the answer should be expressed in terms of n\'s components. Let me check the standard expression.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the spin eigenstate for a spin-1/2 particle in the direction n with polar angles (θ, φ=0) is:\n\n|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |−z>\n\nWhich corresponds to the vector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T in the standard basis. Therefore, the components are indeed cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, and the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ, which defines the direction n. However, if the problem expects a numerical answer, perhaps there is more to it. Wait, but the problem doesn\'t specify a particular direction, just an arbitrary one in the x-z plane. Therefore, the answer must be in terms of θ or equivalently in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. Alternatively, maybe parametrize the eigenvector as [a, b]^T and find a and b in terms of θ.\n\nBut we already did that and found [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(θ/2) ]\n[ sin(θ/2) ]\n\nTherefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). So unless there\'s a specific coordinate system or a different parametrization expected, this should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to write it in terms of the components of n, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut then the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut this is equivalent to the previous expression. However, depending on the convention, sometimes a phase factor is included, but since we\'re dealing with a real matrix (because the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the eigenvector components are real), the phase is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we use n_x and n_z, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)) )\n\nBut substituting cos(θ/2) into the expression for sin(θ/2):\n\nsin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) ) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 + n_z))\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Therefore, the simplest form is in terms of θ/2.\n\nBut the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n", so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of n. However, since n is given as a direction in the x-z plane, and the components of n are (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1, then expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z would be appropriate.\n\nLet me try that. Let’s express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nGiven that n_z = cosθ, so θ = arccos(n_z). Then:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut also, n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 - n_z² )\n\nBut since n_x² + n_z² = 1, this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nAlternatively, since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z² ), but this might not simplify further.\n\nAlternatively, if we rationalize, we can write:\n\nsqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut this is as simplified as it gets. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of θ, given that it\'s an arbitrary direction. Since the problem mentions "an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", but doesn\'t specify whether to express the answer in terms of θ or in terms of n_x and n_z. However, in quantum mechanics, the standard expression is in terms of the angle θ, so [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.\n\nBut let me check the original problem statement again. It says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" without specifying variables, so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of θ. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a general form without specifying θ, but given that the direction is arbitrary, it\'s necessary to include θ in the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the eigenvectors of the operator P_n, which is in the x-z plane, so the answer is similar to the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates but confined to the x-z plane. Since in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.\n\nTherefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(θ/2) ]\n[ sin(θ/2) ]\n\nHence, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the answer should be presented in a box, probably as a column vector with elements cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).\n\nBut let me verify once more by considering a specific case. For example, if θ = 0, the direction n is along +z. Then the eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T, which matches cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0. If θ = π/2, the direction is along +x. Then θ/2 = π/4, so cos(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/4) = √2/2, so the eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is correct for the +x eigenstate of the Pauli matrix σ_x. Indeed, the eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]^T and [1,-1]^T normalized by 1/√2. So that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, if θ = π, direction along -z. Then θ/2 = π/2, cos(π/2) = 0, sin(π/2) = 1, so the eigenvector is [0, 1]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_z with eigenvalue -1, but wait, no. Wait, if θ = π, then the direction n is along -z. The operator P_n = -P_z, so the eigenvalue equation would be P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, which is equivalent to -P_z |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so P_z |ψ> = - (ħ/2) |ψ>, which has eigenvector [0,1]^T. But according to our formula, when θ = π, cos(θ/2) = cos(π/2) = 0, sin(θ/2) = sin(π/2) = 1, so the eigenvector is [0,1]^T, which is correct. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the general form [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T is correct for the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, where θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are \\boxed{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} and \\boxed{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444271, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3915, prompt_tokens=2379, total_tokens=6294, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the direction \(\vec{n}\) can be parametrized by an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, giving \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator along this direction is given by:

\[
P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]

Substituting the given Pauli matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\) (multiplied by \(\hbar/2\)):

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]

Simplifying the matrix:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to solve the eigenvalue equation \(P_n |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle\). This reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find the ratio \(a/b = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\). Normalizing the eigenvector \([ \cos\theta + 1, \sin\theta ]^T\) (after converting to \(\theta/2\) terms using trigonometric identities), we get:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Verification confirms this eigenvector satisfies the eigenvalue equation. Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \text{ and } \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

= cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2)

So the unnormalized vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

The norm squared is cot²(θ/2) + 1 = csc²(θ/2) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

Therefore, the norm is 1 / sin(θ/2), so the normalized vector is sin(θ/2) * [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Yes, that's correct. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Alternatively, written as a spinor:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But let me verify this by plugging back into the eigenvalue equation.

Let’s take the matrix [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] and multiply by [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

First component:

cosθ * cos(θ/2) + sinθ * sin(θ/2)

Using the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, so this is cos(θ - θ/2) = cos(θ/2)

Second component:

sinθ * cos(θ/2) - cosθ * sin(θ/2)

Using sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB, so this is sin(θ - θ/2) = sin(θ/2)

Therefore, the result is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, which is exactly the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, as required. So this checks out.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. But θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane. Alternatively, if we want to express this in terms of the direction vector n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), then θ is the polar angle.

Alternatively, sometimes eigenvectors are written in terms of the azimuthal angle φ, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0. So the spin eigenvector along a direction with polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ=0 is [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". However, the answer might need to be expressed in terms of θ, or maybe in terms of the components of n. Wait, the problem says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So probably in terms of θ, since n is arbitrary. But let me check if the problem expects a numerical answer or in terms of θ.

Wait, the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the answer should be in terms of the angle θ that defines the direction n. But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the components of n. Let me see.

Given that n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the components of the eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But let me check if there's a standard form. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate of the spin operator along direction n (polar angle θ, azimuthal angle φ) is given by:

|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

Since in this case, φ = 0 (because the direction is in the x-z plane, so azimuthal angle is 0), so it simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Therefore, this is the standard result.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, the problem might want the answer in terms of the components of n, which are n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Let me see if we can express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.

Using trigonometric identities:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since n_x = sinθ, and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

n_x = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Therefore, sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2))

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, since θ is the angle from the z-axis, and n is a unit vector, perhaps expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_z and n_x.

But given that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, we can write:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But the sign of sin(θ/2) depends on θ. Since θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is non-negative, so we can take the positive square roots.

Alternatively, since n_x = sinθ, we can write sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 - n_z²) = n_x

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1, so sqrt(1 - n_z²) = |n_x|. But since θ is from 0 to π, n_x is non-negative (if we take θ from 0 to π, then n_x = sinθ is non-negative). Therefore, n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²)

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of θ. However, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n", so maybe the answer should be expressed in terms of n's components. Let me check the standard expression.

In quantum mechanics, the spin eigenstate for a spin-1/2 particle in the direction n with polar angles (θ, φ=0) is:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |−z>

Which corresponds to the vector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T in the standard basis. Therefore, the components are indeed cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, and the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer should be expressed in terms of θ, which defines the direction n. However, if the problem expects a numerical answer, perhaps there is more to it. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a particular direction, just an arbitrary one in the x-z plane. Therefore, the answer must be in terms of θ or equivalently in terms of n_x and n_z.

But let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe parametrize the eigenvector as [a, b]^T and find a and b in terms of θ.

But we already did that and found [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2) ]
[ sin(θ/2) ]

Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). So unless there's a specific coordinate system or a different parametrization expected, this should be the answer.

Alternatively, if we need to write it in terms of the components of n, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But then the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But this is equivalent to the previous expression. However, depending on the convention, sometimes a phase factor is included, but since we're dealing with a real matrix (because the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the eigenvector components are real), the phase is 1.

Alternatively, if we use n_x and n_z, since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = n_x / (2 cos(θ/2)) )

But substituting cos(θ/2) into the expression for sin(θ/2):

sin(θ/2) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) ) = n_x / sqrt(2(1 + n_z))

But this seems more complicated. Therefore, the simplest form is in terms of θ/2.

But the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n", so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of n. However, since n is given as a direction in the x-z plane, and the components of n are (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1, then expressing the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z would be appropriate.

Let me try that. Let’s express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.

Given that n_z = cosθ, so θ = arccos(n_z). Then:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But also, n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 - n_z² )

But since n_x² + n_z² = 1, this is consistent.

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z² ), but this might not simplify further.

Alternatively, if we rationalize, we can write:

sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But this is as simplified as it gets. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of θ, given that it's an arbitrary direction. Since the problem mentions "an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", but doesn't specify whether to express the answer in terms of θ or in terms of n_x and n_z. However, in quantum mechanics, the standard expression is in terms of the angle θ, so [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But let me check the original problem statement again. It says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" without specifying variables, so perhaps the answer is expected in terms of θ. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a general form without specifying θ, but given that the direction is arbitrary, it's necessary to include θ in the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the eigenvectors of the operator P_n, which is in the x-z plane, so the answer is similar to the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates but confined to the x-z plane. Since in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Therefore, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2) ]
[ sin(θ/2) ]

Hence, the elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Therefore, the answer should be presented in a box, probably as a column vector with elements cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

But let me verify once more by considering a specific case. For example, if θ = 0, the direction n is along +z. Then the eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T, which matches cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0. If θ = π/2, the direction is along +x. Then θ/2 = π/4, so cos(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/4) = √2/2, so the eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is correct for the +x eigenstate of the Pauli matrix σ_x. Indeed, the eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]^T and [1,-1]^T normalized by 1/√2. So that checks out.

Similarly, if θ = π, direction along -z. Then θ/2 = π/2, cos(π/2) = 0, sin(π/2) = 1, so the eigenvector is [0, 1]^T, which is the eigenvector of σ_z with eigenvalue -1, but wait, no. Wait, if θ = π, then the direction n is along -z. The operator P_n = -P_z, so the eigenvalue equation would be P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, which is equivalent to -P_z |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so P_z |ψ> = - (ħ/2) |ψ>, which has eigenvector [0,1]^T. But according to our formula, when θ = π, cos(θ/2) = cos(π/2) = 0, sin(θ/2) = sin(π/2) = 1, so the eigenvector is [0,1]^T, which is correct. So that checks out.

Therefore, the general form [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T is correct for the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, where θ is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The normalized eigenvector of the operator \(\vec{P}\) along the direction \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Operator Along Direction \(\vec{n}\):**
   - Given \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, so \(n_y = 0\).
   - The operator \(P_n = \sin\theta \, P_x + \cos\theta \, P_z\).
   - Substituting the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\):
     \[
     P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
     \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation:**
   - For eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), solve \(P_n |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle\).
   - Let \(|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\), leading to:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     \cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a \\
     \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
     \end{cases}
     \]

3. **Solving the System:**
   - From the first equation: \(a(\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0\).
   - From the second equation: \(a \sin\theta - b(\cos\theta + 1) = 0\).
   - Ratios of \(a/b\) from both equations yield consistency upon simplification.

4. **Eigenvector Components:**
   - Using \(a/b = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\), the unnormalized eigenvector is \(\propto \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta + 1 \\ \sin\theta \end{pmatrix}\).

5. **Normalization:**
   - Compute the norm using trigonometric identities:
     \[
     \sqrt{\left(\frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{2\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin\theta}
     \]

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the operator \(\vec{P}\) in the given direction. The components of \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane are \((\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator \(P_n\) along \(\vec{n}\) is given by:
\[
P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]
Substituting the Pauli matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\):
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
we get:
\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]
To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a
\]
\[
\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b
\]
Rearranging these equations, we find:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1) \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0
\]
\[
\sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1) \cdot b = 0
\]
Solving these, we get the ratio \(a/b = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\). The eigenvector can be written as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Normalizing this vector, we use trigonometric identities:
\[
\cos\theta + 1 = 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \sin\theta = 2\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
This leads to the normalized eigenvector:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

### Final Answer
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). However, since θ is the angle from the z-axis, the direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), and the eigenvector corresponds to spin up along n. The standard result for spin-1/2 particles is that the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T, but since φ = 0 (as the direction is in the x-z plane), the eigenvector simplifies to [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
