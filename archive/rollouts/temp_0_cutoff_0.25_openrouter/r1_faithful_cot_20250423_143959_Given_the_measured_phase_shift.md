To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude \( \text{Im} f(0) \) is given by:
\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

First, we compute each term \((2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l\):

- For \( l = 0 \):
  \[
  (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2 90^\circ = 1 \cdot 1^2 = 1
  \]

- For \( l = 1 \):
  \[
  (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2 67^\circ \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 \approx 2.541
  \]

- For \( l = 2 \):
  \[
  (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2 55^\circ \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 \approx 3.355
  \]

- For \( l = 3 \):
  \[
  (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2 30^\circ = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75
  \]

- For \( l = 4 \):
  \[
  (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2 13^\circ \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554
  \]

Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1014
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \( k \). For 50 MeV electrons, the relativistic momentum \( p \) is:
\[
p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c} \approx \frac{50.51 \text{ MeV}}{c}
\]
where \( E = 50.511 \text{ MeV} \) (kinetic energy plus rest mass energy). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \text{ MeV·fm} \):
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50.51 \text{ MeV}}{197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{9.1014}{0.256} \approx 35.5 \text{ fm}
\]

Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \(\boxed{35.5 \text{ fm}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I assume means that higher phase shifts (like δ₅, δ₆, etc.) are negligible or zero. 

First, I remember that the scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) )

where l is the angular momentum quantum number, k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, θ=0. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

First, let me recall that for θ=0, the Legendre polynomials P_l(cosθ) become P_l(1). I know that P_l(1) = 1 for all l. That simplifies things because each term in the sum will have P_l(1) = 1. So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l )

But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0). Let's compute that. The imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l is sinδ_l * sinδ_l = sin²δ_l, because e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, so multiplying by sinδ_l gives sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part is sin²δ_l. 

Wait, let me check that again. Let's take the term (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l. Let's write e^{iδ_l} as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. Then multiplying by sinδ_l gives:

sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. 

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l. Therefore, the total imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. 

So the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. 

But wait, I need to confirm this. Let me recall the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k) Im f(0). So if I can compute σ_total using the phase shifts, then I can relate it to Im f(0). 

But maybe I can proceed directly. Since the problem gives specific phase shifts up to l=4, and tells me to ignore the rest, the sum will be from l=0 to l=4. 

So first, let's compute each term (2l + 1) sin²δ_l for l=0,1,2,3,4. Then sum them up, multiply by 1/k, and that should give the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0. 

But wait, the problem is about electrons, which are spin-1/2 particles. However, in elastic scattering, if we're considering unpolarized beams and targets, and if the interaction is spin-independent, then the spin might not play a role here. But I need to be careful. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about spin, so maybe we can ignore it. The phase shifts given are probably for each partial wave regardless of spin. So perhaps the formula still holds as in the spinless case. 

Alternatively, if the scattering is from a spin-0 target, then electrons would have their spin interactions, but maybe in the first approximation, the phase shifts are considered without spin-orbit coupling. Hmm. But since the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, which are presumably the result of some potential scattering, and the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is standard for spinless particles. But electrons are spin-1/2. However, in electron scattering experiments, especially at high energies (50 MeV is not that high, but maybe in nuclear physics it's considered high), the spin effects might be incorporated into the phase shifts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified to use the spinless formula. Since the problem doesn't mention spin, I think we can proceed with the standard formula for spinless particles. 

So proceeding under that assumption, let's compute each term. 

Given δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and higher phase shifts are zero. 

First, convert all phase shifts from degrees to radians? Wait, but when we take sine of them, since sine is the same whether the angle is in degrees or radians as long as the calculator is set correctly. But since we are dealing with sin²δ_l, and δ_l is given in degrees, we can compute sin(δ_l) in degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe we can compute sin(90°) = 1, sin(67°), sin(55°), sin(30°)=0.5, sin(13°). Let me compute each term:

For l=0:
(2*0 + 1) sin²(90°) = 1 * (1)^2 = 1

For l=1:
(2*1 + 1) sin²(67°) = 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). Using calculator, sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so squared is ≈ 0.847. So 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541

For l=2:
(2*2 + 1) sin²(55°) = 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, squared ≈ 0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355

For l=3:
(2*3 + 1) sin²(30°) = 7 * (0.5)^2 = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75

For l=4:
(2*4 + 1) sin²(13°) = 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506. 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554

Now sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.541 (l=1) + 3.355 (l=2) + 1.75 (l=3) + 0.4554 (l=4) ≈

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896

6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646

8.646 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1014

So the sum is approximately 9.1014. Then Im f(0) = (1/k) * 9.1014

Now, we need to compute k, the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV. Since electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV (rest mass energy of electron is about 0.511 MeV), we need to use relativistic kinematics to find k.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p / ħ. But we need to compute p for a 50 MeV electron. 

The total energy E of the electron is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. But wait, in scattering problems, sometimes the energy given is the kinetic energy. The problem says "50 MeV electrons", which is likely the kinetic energy. But to be precise, we need to confirm. However, in nuclear physics experiments, the energy of the electrons is often given as kinetic energy. So let's assume T = 50 MeV.

The relativistic relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, where E is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic). So E = T + m c^2 = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Therefore, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (50.511 - 0.511)(50.511 + 0.511) ) = sqrt(50 * 51.022) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV

Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / ħ

But we need to express ħc in units of MeV·fm to make the units work out. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm

Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV / c) / (ħ) = (50.51 / (197.33 MeV·fm)) * c / c ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Wait, let me check the units. 

Momentum p has units of MeV/c. Then, ħ has units of MeV·fm / c (since ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197 MeV·fm / c). Therefore, p / ħ = (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm / c) ) = 1/fm. So k has units of fm⁻¹, which is correct.

So k ≈ 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

But let me compute that more accurately:

50.51 divided by 197.33:

50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256. Let's compute 197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325. 50.51 - 49.3325 = 1.1775. Then 1.1775 / 197.33 ≈ 0.006. So total is approximately 0.256. So k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, Im f(0) = (1 / 0.256 fm⁻¹) * 9.1014 ≈ (9.1014 / 0.256) fm

Compute 9.1014 / 0.256:

First, 0.256 * 35 = 8.96

9.1014 - 8.96 = 0.1414

0.1414 / 0.256 ≈ 0.552

So total is approximately 35.552 fm

Therefore, Im f(0) ≈ 35.55 fm

But wait, the units. The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of length, since the differential cross-section is |f|^2 in units of barns/sr, etc. So fm is a unit of length, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 35.55 fm is 35.55e-15 m. But the problem might expect the answer in units of fm, or in some other unit? Let me check.

But the problem just says to calculate the imaginary part, so the unit should be in femtometers (fm). So 35.55 fm. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let's recast the calculation step by step.

First, compute the momentum p.

Electron kinetic energy T = 50 MeV.

Electron rest mass m = 0.511 MeV/c².

Total energy E = T + m c² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV.

Then, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.46 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈ 50.51 MeV.

Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV / c) / (ħ)

But ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Then, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum = (1 / 0.256 fm⁻¹) * 9.1014 ≈ 3.90625 fm * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm.

So approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let me check the sum again. Let's recalculate the sum of the terms:

l=0: 1*1 = 1

l=1: 3*(sin 67°)^2. Let's compute sin(67°):

sin(60°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, sin(67.5°) ≈ 0.9239, so sin(67°) is about 0.9205, squared is ~0.847. So 3*0.847 ≈ 2.541

l=2: 5*(sin55°)^2. sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, squared ≈ 0.671, 5*0.671 ≈ 3.355

l=3: 7*(sin30°)^2 = 7*(0.25) = 1.75

l=4: 9*(sin13°)^2. sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506, 9*0.0506 ≈ 0.4554

Adding them up:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896

6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646

8.646 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1014

Yes, that's correct. So the sum is approximately 9.1014.

Then, 9.1014 divided by k ≈ 0.256 gives 35.55 fm.

But let me check if there's a factor I missed. The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. The imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, using the optical theorem: σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). If I can compute σ_total from the phase shifts, then Im f(0) = (σ_total * k)/(4π). But σ_total for elastic scattering (since it's mentioned as elastic scattering) is σ_elastic = (4π/k²) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. Wait, but the optical theorem relates σ_total to Im f(0). However, in the case where absorption is present (i.e., inelastic scattering), σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic. But the problem states it's elastic scattering, so maybe σ_total = σ_elastic. Then, σ_elastic = (4π/k²) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. Then, according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). Therefore, equating:

(4π/k²) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l = (4π/k) Im f(0)

Cancel 4π and multiply both sides by k:

(1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l = Im f(0)

Which matches our previous result. So that's a good check. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let me check if the phase shifts are in degrees. Yes, the problem gives them in degrees. But when computing sine of the angles, whether we use degrees or radians is crucial. Since the phase shifts in scattering theory are typically in radians, but the problem gives them in degrees. Wait, this is a critical point. 

Wait, in scattering theory, phase shifts δ_l are dimensionless, but they are typically expressed in radians, not degrees. So if the problem gives phase shifts in degrees, we need to convert them to radians before taking sine. 

Oh no! That might be a mistake in my calculation. I assumed the phase shifts were in degrees and computed sine of degrees, but if δ_l is supposed to be in radians, then 90 degrees is π/2 radians, which is about 1.5708 radians. So sin(π/2) = 1, which is the same as sin(90°). Similarly, 67 degrees in radians is 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.169 radians, sin(1.169) ≈ sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, which is the same as before. Similarly, all the sines would be the same whether we compute in degrees or radians, as long as we use the correct mode on the calculator. Wait, no. Wait, sin(θ) where θ is in radians vs. degrees is different unless converted. For example, sin(90°) = 1, but sin(90 radians) is a different value. But in our case, the problem gives δ_l in degrees, so we need to compute sine of those degrees. However, in scattering theory, phase shifts are usually in radians. So is there a confusion here?

Wait, the problem states the phase shifts are given in degrees: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, etc. So they explicitly say degrees. Therefore, we should take the sine of those angles in degrees. For example, sin(90°) = 1, sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, etc. So my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the sum is 9.1014, and Im f(0) ≈ 35.55 fm.

But let me confirm once again. Suppose δ_l is given in degrees, so when we compute sinδ_l, we need to use degrees. For example, sin(90 degrees) is 1, which is correct. If they had given δ_l in radians, then 90 radians is a large number, but they specified degrees, so we are safe.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But let's check the precision. The given phase shifts are all in whole degrees except δ₂=55 (assuming 55°), δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So maybe we should use more precise sine values.

Let me recalculate the sines with more precision.

For l=0: δ=90°, sin(90°)=1. So term=1*1=1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67°). Let's use calculator: 67 degrees. sin(67)=0.92050485345. Squared: ~0.847. 3*0.847=2.541.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55°)=0.81915204429. Squared: 0.81915^2≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355.

l=3: δ=30°, sin(30°)=0.5. Squared=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13°)=0.2249510543. Squared≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

So the sum is the same as before: ~9.1014.

Therefore, the result is the same. 

Now, the value of k was calculated as 0.256 fm⁻¹. Let me verify that calculation again.

Given E = 50.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.46 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈ 50.51 MeV.

Therefore, p = 50.51 / c (MeV/c).

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ). Since ħc = 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore,

k = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm.

But let's compute 9.1014 / 0.256 precisely:

0.256 * 35 = 8.96

9.1014 - 8.96 = 0.1414

0.1414 / 0.256 = 0.55234375

So total is 35.55234375 fm ≈ 35.55 fm.

But perhaps we need to keep more decimal places in the intermediate steps. Let's see:

k = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256000 approximately. Let's compute 50.51 / 197.33:

197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325

50.51 - 49.3325 = 1.1775

1.1775 / 197.33 ≈ 0.005967

So total k ≈ 0.25 + 0.005967 ≈ 0.255967 ≈ 0.2560 fm⁻¹.

Then, 9.1014 / 0.255967 ≈ ?

Let's compute 9.1014 / 0.255967:

First, 0.255967 * 35 = 8.958845

Subtract from 9.1014: 9.1014 - 8.958845 = 0.142555

0.142555 / 0.255967 ≈ 0.142555 / 0.256 ≈ 0.5565 approximately.

So total is 35 + 0.5565 ≈ 35.5565 fm. So approximately 35.56 fm.

But given the precision of the phase shifts (some are given to two digits, like 55, 30, 13), maybe the answer should be given to three significant figures. The sum was approximately 9.10 (three significant figures), and k is approximately 0.256 (three significant figures). So 9.10 / 0.256 ≈ 35.5. So maybe 35.5 fm. But the initial sum was 9.1014, which is about 9.10, so 9.10 / 0.256 = 35.546875, which is approximately 35.5 fm when rounded to three significant figures.

Alternatively, if the problem expects more precise, maybe 35.5 fm or 35.6 fm. But given that the phase shifts are given in whole degrees (except δ₂=55, which is also whole), the precision is probably limited. So 35.5 fm or 36 fm. But let's check if the sum is 9.1, then 9.1 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55. So maybe the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. 

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact expression. Wait, but the phase shifts are given in degrees, which complicates things. But since we converted them properly, the answer is a numerical value. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Wait, the question says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target". Electrons are leptons and interact via the electromagnetic force. The phase shifts here are likely from solving the Dirac equation for electron scattering, but the problem gives non-relativistic phase shifts? Or is there a different approach? 

Wait, but the problem gives phase shifts, so regardless of the underlying interaction, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is standard. So even for electrons, as long as the phase shifts are given, the same partial wave expansion applies. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.

Therefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction is approximately 35.5 fm. 

But let me check one more thing. The wave number k for electrons. If the electrons are relativistic, we need to use the relativistic expression for k. But k is the magnitude of the wave vector, which is p/ħ. Since we already calculated p using relativistic kinematics, that should be correct. 

Alternatively, if the electron is non-relativistic, then p = sqrt(2mT). But at 50 MeV, the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, using the relativistic formula is correct. 

Yes, so the calculation of k is correct. 

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 35.5 fm. Depending on rounding, 35.5 or 35.6. But given the sum was 9.1014 and k=0.256, 9.1014 / 0.256 = 35.55. So maybe the answer is 35.6 fm. But let's see:

9.1014 divided by 0.256:

0.256 * 35 = 8.96

9.1014 - 8.96 = 0.1414

0.1414 / 0.256 = 0.5523

So total is 35.5523, which is 35.55 fm. So rounding to three significant figures, 35.6 fm. But 35.55 is 35.6 when rounded to three significant figures. However, the original sum was 9.10 (three sig figs), and k was 0.256 (three sig figs). So 9.10 / 0.256 = 35.546875, which is 35.5 when rounded to three sig figs. Because 9.10 has three, 0.256 has three, so the result should have three: 35.5. 

Wait, 9.10 / 0.256:

Let me compute 9.10 / 0.256:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 9100 / 256 ≈ 35.546875. So 35.5 (three sig figs). 

But the question says "Calculate the imaginary part...". It doesn't specify the number of significant figures, but given the phase shifts are given to two significant figures (e.g., 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°), except 90 is exact. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures? Let's see:

The phase shifts are given as:

δ₀=90° (exact, two sig figs),

δ₁=67° (two sig figs),

δ₂=55° (two sig figs),

δ₃=30° (two sig figs),

δ₄=13° (two sig figs).

So all phase shifts are given to two significant figures. Therefore, the sum is 9.1014, which is approximately 9.1 (two sig figs). Then k is 0.256 (three sig figs), but since the phase shifts are two sig figs, the result should be two sig figs. So 9.1 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55, which would be 36 with two sig figs. Wait, 35.55 rounded to two sig figs is 36. 

But wait, 9.1 (two sig figs) divided by 0.256 (three sig figs) is 35.546875, which with two sig figs is 36. 

Alternatively, if k is considered to be three sig figs (0.256), and the sum is two sig figs (9.1), then the result is 35.5 / 1, which is two sig figs: 36. 

But this is getting into the realm of significant figures, which can be ambiguous. However, given the problem gives the phase shifts to two significant figures, except δ₀=90° which is exact, the dominant uncertainty is from the phase shifts. Therefore, the sum is 9.1 (two sig figs), divided by k=0.256 (three sig figs) gives 35.5, which should be rounded to two sig figs: 36. 

But in my detailed calculation, it was 35.55, which is 35.6 with three sig figs, or 36 with two. Since the problem may expect two sig figs, but the options might not specify. However, in physics problems, unless specified, usually use the given significant figures. The given phase shifts are:

90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°. 

90° is exact (if it's a right angle), but the others are two sig figs. So the sum is 9.1 (two sig figs), divided by k=0.256 (three sig figs) gives 35.5, which is three sig figs, but since the least is two, we should present two. So 36. 

But I need to check the exact value again. 9.1 / 0.256 = 35.546875. Rounded to two significant figures is 36. 

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in a certain unit or with a certain precision, but since it's not specified, perhaps writing it as 35.5 fm is acceptable. However, considering that 35.55 is very close to 35.6, but given the sum is 9.10 (if we take three sig figs from the sum), then 35.5. 

But this is a bit ambiguous. However, in the initial sum, the terms were:

l=0: 1.000...

l=1: 2.541...

l=2: 3.355...

l=3: 1.750...

l=4: 0.4554...

Total: 9.1014

So the sum is 9.1014, which is approximately 9.10 (three sig figs). Then k is 0.256 (three sig figs). So 9.10 / 0.256 = 35.546875, which is 35.5 (three sig figs). 

But the problem didn't specify, so maybe we can present it as 35.5 fm. However, in some contexts, 35.5 could be considered three sig figs, but if the phase shifts are given as two sig figs, then perhaps 36 fm. 

Alternatively, the question might expect an exact answer without considering significant figures, just a numerical value. Given that, the precise calculation gives approximately 35.55 fm, which can be written as 35.5 fm or 35.6 fm. 

Given that, and considering that in exams often such approximations are accepted, I think 36 fm is a possible answer, but also 35.5 could be. However, my detailed calculation gives 35.55, which is 35.6 when rounded to three sig figs. 

But to check, let's see the possible options if this were a multiple-choice, but since it's not, we have to decide. Given the problem gives phase shifts to two sig figs, the answer should be to two sig figs. So 36 fm. 

But let me verify once more. If all phase shifts are two sig figs, then each term in the sum is:

l=0: 1.0 (exact)

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°) ≈ 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.5 (two sig figs)

l=2: 5 * sin²(55°) ≈ 5 * 0.67 ≈ 3.4 (two sig figs)

l=3: 7 * 0.25 = 1.8 (two sig figs)

l=4: 9 * 0.05 ≈ 0.45 (two sig figs)

Sum: 1.0 + 2.5 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.45 = 9.15 (which would round to 9.2 with two sig figs). Wait, but this is inconsistent. 

Wait, if each term is rounded to two sig figs before summing:

l=0: 1.0

l=1: 2.5

l=2: 3.4

l=3: 1.8

l=4: 0.45

Sum: 1.0 + 2.5 = 3.5

3.5 + 3.4 = 6.9

6.9 + 1.8 = 8.7

8.7 + 0.45 = 9.15

Rounded to two sig figs: 9.2

Then, k=0.256 (three sig figs), so 9.2 / 0.256 ≈ 35.9375, which would be 36 with two sig figs. 

But this is a different approach, rounding each term first. However, in precise calculations, we should avoid rounding intermediate steps. But if the problem expects two sig figs, then perhaps this is the way. 

But in reality, the correct approach is to carry all the precision through the calculation and round only at the end. Therefore, since the exact sum is 9.1014, which is 9.10 with three sig figs, and k is 0.256 with three, the result is 35.5 with three sig figs. But given the phase shifts are two sig figs, the answer should be two. 

This is a classic issue in significant figures. If all the phase shifts are two sig figs, then the uncertainty in each term is about ±0.5 in the last digit. For example, δ₁=67° ± 0.5°, which would affect sin²δ₁. Similarly for others. Therefore, the total sum has an uncertainty. 

But since this is a calculation problem without uncertainty specified, perhaps we should present the result as 36 fm. 

Alternatively, the question might accept 35.5 fm. Given that, but to be safe, since 35.55 is very close to 36 when considering two sig figs, but if we consider three, it's 35.5. 

But given that the phase shifts beyond l=4 are ignored, which might contribute to the error, but the problem says to ignore them. So the calculation is exact within the given data. 

In conclusion, I think the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. But to match the two sig figs of the given data, it's 36 fm. However, since the sum was 9.10 (three sig figs) and k=0.256 (three sig figs), the division gives 35.5 (three sig figs). Therefore, I will present the answer as 35.5 fm. 

But let me check once more with precise calculation:

k = 50.51 / 197.33 = 0.2560 fm⁻¹

Sum = 9.1014

Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.2560 = 35.55234375 fm ≈ 35.55 fm

Rounded to three significant figures: 35.6 fm

But given the original phase shifts have two significant figures (except δ₀=90°), but δ₀ is exact. So maybe δ₁=67° is two sig figs, δ₂=55° is two, δ₃=30° is two, δ₄=13° is two. So the sum is 9.1 (two sig figs), divided by k=0.256 (three sig figs) gives 35.5 (three sig figs), but since the sum is two, the answer should be two: 36 fm. 

This is a bit confusing, but in academic settings, usually, if a number is given as 90°, it's considered exact (a right angle), so δ₀=90° is exact, and the others are two sig figs. Therefore, the sum would have two sig figs contribution from δ₁ to δ₄, and one exact term. So the sum's precision is dominated by the two sig figs terms. Therefore, the sum is 9.1 (two sig figs), leading to 36 fm. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the problem is from a physics exam, and in such contexts, sometimes exact angles like 90° are considered exact, so their contribution is precise. Then, the other terms contribute with two sig figs. So the sum would be 1 (exact) + 2.5 (two sig figs) + 3.4 (two sig figs) + 1.8 (two sig figs) + 0.45 (two sig figs) = 1 + 2.5 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.45 = 9.15, which is 9.2 with two sig figs. Then, 9.2 / 0.256 ≈ 35.9, which rounds to 36 with two sig figs. 

Therefore, considering that δ₀ is exact and the rest are two sig figs, the answer is 36 fm. 

But this is a bit of a judgment call. Since the problem is from an exam or homework, and given the phase shifts, the expected answer is likely 36 fm. 

However, to ensure, let me see if there's another approach. The optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). If I compute σ_total using the phase shifts, which for elastic scattering is σ_elastic = (4π/k²) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. Then, Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total. But since σ_total = σ_elastic (if no absorption), then Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l, which is the same as before. 

Therefore, the calculation is consistent. 

Given that, and the precise calculation gives 35.55 fm, which is approximately 35.6 fm. But given the problem might expect two significant figures, 36 fm. 

But since the phase shifts are given as whole numbers in degrees, and the calculation yields approximately 35.5 fm, I think the precise answer is 35.5 fm, and in the box, I should put \boxed{35.5 \text{ fm}} or if units are in femtometers, just \boxed{35.5}. But the question says "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." It doesn't specify units, but since f(θ) has units of length, and we calculated it in fm, so 35.5 fm. 

But let me check with another approach. Maybe using the optical theorem. The total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). But σ_total for elastic scattering is also given by σ = sum_{l=0}^∞ σ_l, where σ_l = (4π/k²) (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, σ_total = (4π/k²) sum (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. Therefore, equating:

(4π/k) Im f(0) = (4π/k²) sum (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

Cancel 4π and multiply both sides by k:

Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

Given that, and the result is approximately 35.5 fm. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{35.5 \text{ fm}}.

**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{35.5 \text{ fm}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I assume means that higher phase shifts (like δ₅, δ₆, etc.) are negligible or zero. 

First, I remember that the scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) )

where l is the angular momentum quantum number, k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, θ=0. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

First, let me recall that for θ=0, the Legendre polynomials P_l(cosθ) become P_l(1). I know that P_l(1) = 1 for all l. That simplifies things because each term in the sum will have P_l(1) = 1. So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l )

But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0). Let's compute that. The imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l is sinδ_l * sinδ_l = sin²δ_l, because e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, so multiplying by sinδ_l gives sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part is sin²δ_l. 

Wait, let me check that again. Let's take the term (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l. Let's write e^{iδ_l} as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. Then multiplying by sinδ_l gives:

sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. 

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l. Therefore, the total imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. 

So the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. 

But wait, I need to confirm this. Let me recall the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k) Im f(0). So if I can compute σ_total using the phase shifts, then I can relate it to Im f(0). 

But maybe I can proceed directly. Since the problem gives specific phase shifts up to l=4, and tells me to ignore the rest, the sum will be from l=0 to l=4. 

So first, let's compute each term (2l + 1) sin²δ_l for l=0,1,2,3,4. Then sum them up, multiply by 1/k, and that should give the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0. 

But wait, the problem is about electrons, which are spin-1/2 particles. However, in elastic scattering, if we're considering unpolarized beams and targets, and if the interaction is spin-independent, then the spin might not play a role here. But I need to be careful. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about spin, so maybe we can ignore it. The phase shifts given are probably for each partial wave regardless of spin. So perhaps the formula still holds as in the spinless case. 

Alternatively, if the scattering is from a spin-0 target, then electrons would have their spin interactions, but maybe in the first approximation, the phase shifts are considered without spin-orbit coupling. Hmm. But since the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, which are presumably the result of some potential scattering, and the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is standard for spinless particles. But electrons are spin-1/2. However, in electron scattering experiments, especially at high energies (50 MeV is not that high, but maybe in nuclear physics it's considered high), the spin effects might be incorporated into the phase shifts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified to use the spinless formula. Since the problem doesn't mention spin, I think we can proceed with the standard formula for spinless particles. 

So proceeding under that assumption, let's compute each term. 

Given δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and higher phase shifts are zero. 

First, convert all phase shifts from degrees to radians? Wait, but when we take sine of them, since sine is the same whether the angle is in degrees or radians as long as the calculator is set correctly. But since we are dealing with sin²δ_l, and δ_l is given in degrees, we can compute sin(δ_l) in degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe we can compute sin(90°) = 1, sin(67°), sin(55°), sin(30°)=0.5, sin(13°). Let me compute each term:

For l=0:
(2*0 + 1) sin²(90°) = 1 * (1)^2 = 1

For l=1:
(2*1 + 1) sin²(67°) = 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). Using calculator, sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so squared is ≈ 0.847. So 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541

For l=2:
(2*2 + 1) sin²(55°) = 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, squared ≈ 0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355

For l=3:
(2*3 + 1) sin²(30°) = 7 * (0.5)^2 = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75

For l=4:
(2*4 + 1) sin²(13°) = 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506. 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554

Now sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.541 (l=1) + 3.355 (l=2) + 1.75 (l=3) + 0.4554 (l=4) ≈

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896

6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646

8.646 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1014

So the sum is approximately 9.1014. Then Im f(0) = (1/k) * 9.1014

Now, we need to compute k, the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV. Since electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV (rest mass energy of electron is about 0.511 MeV), we need to use relativistic kinematics to find k.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p / ħ. But we need to compute p for a 50 MeV electron. 

The total energy E of the electron is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. But wait, in scattering problems, sometimes the energy given is the kinetic energy. The problem says "50 MeV electrons", which is likely the kinetic energy. But to be precise, we need to confirm. However, in nuclear physics experiments, the energy of the electrons is often given as kinetic energy. So let's assume T = 50 MeV.

The relativistic relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, where E is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic). So E = T + m c^2 = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Therefore, p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (50.511 - 0.511)(50.511 + 0.511) ) = sqrt(50 * 51.022) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV

Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / ħ

But we need to express ħc in units of MeV·fm to make the units work out. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm

Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV / c) / (ħ) = (50.51 / (197.33 MeV·fm)) * c / c ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Wait, let me check the units. 

Momentum p has units of MeV/c. Then, ħ has units of MeV·fm / c (since ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197 MeV·fm / c). Therefore, p / ħ = (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm / c) ) = 1/fm. So k has units of fm⁻¹, which is correct.

So k ≈ 50

# Anthropic completion

I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for 50 MeV electrons elastically scattering from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, with all higher phase shifts to be ignored.

In partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is given by:
f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) )

Since I need the amplitude along the incident beam direction, θ=0, and P_l(1)=1 for all l. So:
f(0) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l )

To find the imaginary part, I'll expand e^{iδ_l} as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l:
e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l = sinδ_l * cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l

The imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin²δ_l, so:
Im f(0) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

Although electrons are spin-1/2 particles, the problem doesn't mention spin effects, so I'll proceed with the standard formula.

Calculating each term:
For l=0: (2*0 + 1) sin²(90°) = 1 * 1² = 1
For l=1: (2*1 + 1) sin²(67°) = 3 * (0.9205)² ≈ 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541
For l=2: (2*2 + 1) sin²(55°) = 5 * (0.8192)² ≈ 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355
For l=3: (2*3 + 1) sin²(30°) = 7 * (0.5)² = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75
For l=4: (2*4 + 1) sin²(13°) = 9 * (0.22495)² ≈ 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554

The sum of these terms is approximately 9.1014.

For the wave number k, I need to consider that electrons at 50 MeV are relativistic. Assuming 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, the total energy is E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Using the relativistic relation: pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt((50.511)² - (0.511)²) ≈ 50.51 MeV

Therefore: k = p/ħ = (50.51 MeV/c)/(ħ) = 50.51/197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is thus Im f(0) = (1/k) * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, with higher phase shifts considered negligible.

Starting with the scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis, the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) )

where l represents the angular momentum quantum number, k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Since we're interested in the imaginary part of f(0), θ=0, and P_l(1) = 1 for all l, simplifying the expression to:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l )

The imaginary component of e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l is sin²δ_l (because e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, and multiplying by sinδ_l yields sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l). Therefore, the imaginary part is:

Im f(0) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

We'll focus on phase shifts up to l=4, ignoring higher ones:

For l=0:
(2*0 + 1) sin²(90°) = 1 * 1² = 1

For l=1:
(2*1 + 1) sin²(67°) = 3 * (sin(67°))² = 3 * 0.847 = 2.541

For l=2:
(2*2 + 1) sin²(55°) = 5 * (sin(55°))² = 5 * 0.671 = 3.355

For l=3:
(2*3 + 1) sin²(30°) = 7 * 0.25 = 1.75

For l=4:
(2*4 + 1) sin²(13°) = 9 * (sin(13°))² = 9 * 0.0506 = 0.4554

Summing these:

1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1014

This implies Im f(0) = (1/k) * 9.1014.

Calculating k, using the kinetic energy of 50 MeV for relativistic electrons:

Total energy E = 50 MeV (kinetic) + 0.511 MeV (rest mass) ≈ 50.511 MeV.

The relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)² provides:

pc = √((50.511)² - (0.511)²) ≈ √(2551.1) = 50.51 MeV.

Thus, p ≈ 50.51 MeV/c and k = p / ħ. With ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, 

k = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Let\'s compute 50.51 / 197.33:\n\n197.33 * 0.256 ≈ 197.33 * 0.25 + 197.33 * 0.006 ≈ 49.3325 + 1.184 ≈ 50.5165, which is very close to 50.51. So k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.256 fm ≈ 3.906 fm\n\nBut we need to convert this into a unit suitable for the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude has units of length. Since k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is in fm, so f(0) has units of fm. Then Im f(0) is in fm.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the formula. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in terms of the partial wave expansion:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nSo yes, each term is dimensionless (since e^{iδ_l} and sinδ_l are dimensionless, 2l+1 is dimensionless, P_l is dimensionless) multiplied by 1/k, which has units of length. So f(θ) has units of length, which is correct for a scattering amplitude (cross-section is in barns, which is area, and differential cross-section is |f|^2, so |f|^2 has units of area, hence f has units of length).\n\nTherefore, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.1014 ≈ 35.53 fm\n\nBut let me compute that more accurately. \n\nFirst, 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm\n\nMultiply by the sum 9.1014:\n\n3.906 * 9.1014 ≈ 3.906 * 9 + 3.906 * 0.1014 ≈ 35.154 + 0.396 ≈ 35.55 fm\n\nSo approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut let me check the calculation steps again for possible errors. \n\nFirst, the sum of (2l +1) sin²δ_l:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let me recalculate sin(67°). Using calculator, 67 degrees: sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, squared is ~0.847, 3*0.847≈2.541. Correct.\n\nl=2: 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55)=0.8192, squared ~0.671, 5*0.671≈3.355. Correct.\n\nl=3: 7 * sin²(30°)=7*(0.25)=1.75. Correct.\n\nl=4: 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)=0.22495, squared≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.\n\nSum: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541 is 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 is 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 is 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 is 9.1014. Correct.\n\nThen 1/k: calculated as 3.906 fm. \n\nSo 3.906 * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm. \n\nBut the problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut let\'s check if there is a possible mistake in the formula. Wait, the optical theorem says that σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). So if I can compute σ_total from the phase shifts, then I can get Im f(0) = (k σ_total)/(4π). \n\nBut the total cross-section for elastic scattering (since it\'s elastic, σ_total = σ_elastic) can be calculated as the sum over l of (4π/k²)(2l + 1) sin²δ_l. \n\nWait, that formula is σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. \n\nBut according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). Therefore, equating the two expressions:\n\n(4π/k) Im f(0) = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nCancel 4π from both sides:\n\n(1/k) Im f(0) = (1/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nMultiply both sides by k:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nWhich matches our original formula. So that\'s correct. Therefore, our calculation is consistent with the optical theorem. \n\nTherefore, the result is approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut let\'s check the value of k again. The electron\'s momentum. \n\nGiven that the kinetic energy T = 50 MeV. The rest mass m = 0.511 MeV/c². \n\nTotal energy E = T + mc² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV. \n\nThen, the momentum p is sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c\n\nCalculate (50.511)^2 = 50.511*50.511. Let\'s compute 50*50=2500, 50*0.511=25.555, 0.511*50=25.555, 0.511^2≈0.261. So (50 + 0.511)^2 = 50² + 2*50*0.511 + 0.511² = 2500 + 51.1 + 0.261 ≈ 2551.361 MeV²\n\nThen subtract (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 MeV², so we have 2551.361 - 0.261 = 2551.1 MeV²\n\nTherefore, p c = sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV\n\nTherefore, p = 50.51 MeV / c\n\nThen, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ)\n\nBut ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c\n\nTherefore, k = (50.51 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nSo 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. Correct.\n\nTherefore, Im f(0) ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm. \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in units of femtometers (fm) or maybe in inverse MeV or something else? Wait, scattering amplitude has units of length, so femtometers is appropriate. 35.55 fm is 35.55 x 10^-15 meters. \n\nBut let me check if there is a possible error in the calculation of the sum. Let me recalculate each term with more precise sine values.\n\nFor l=1, δ=67°:\n\nsin(67°) = sin(60° + 7°) = sin60 cos7 + cos60 sin7 ≈ 0.8660 * 0.9925 + 0.5 * 0.1219 ≈ 0.8594 + 0.06095 ≈ 0.9203, which squared is ≈ 0.847. So 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541. Correct.\n\nFor l=2, δ=55°:\n\nsin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, squared is 0.8192^2 = 0.671. 5 * 0.671 = 3.355. Correct.\n\nFor l=3, δ=30°, sin(30°)=0.5, squared 0.25, 7*0.25=1.75. Correct.\n\nFor l=4, δ=13°, sin(13°)=0.22495, squared≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.\n\nSum is 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 = 9.1014. Correct.\n\nSo the sum is 9.1014. Multiply by 1/k ≈3.906 fm: 9.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 35.55 fm. \n\nBut let me compute 9.1014 * 3.906 precisely:\n\nFirst, 9 * 3.906 = 35.154\n\n0.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 0.1014*3 = 0.3042; 0.1014*0.906 ≈ 0.0919; total ≈0.3042 + 0.0919 ≈0.3961\n\nSo total ≈35.154 + 0.3961 ≈35.5501 fm. \n\nSo approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut maybe we need to consider more decimal places for k. Let\'s recalculate k:\n\nk = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ ?\n\n50.51 divided by 197.33:\n\n197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325\n\n50.51 - 49.3325 = 1.1775\n\n1.1775 / 197.33 ≈ 0.00596\n\nSo total k ≈0.25 + 0.00596 ≈0.25596 ≈0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nThus, 1/k ≈3.90625 fm\n\nSo 9.1014 * 3.90625 ≈ ?\n\n3.90625 * 9 = 35.15625\n\n3.90625 * 0.1014 ≈0.396\n\nTotal ≈35.15625 + 0.396 ≈35.55225 fm\n\nSo approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut the problem might expect an exact symbolic answer, but given that the phase shifts are given in degrees and the energy is given as 50 MeV, which requires a numerical computation, the answer is a numerical multiple of femtometers. \n\nBut let me check if there is a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of inverse MeV or another unit. Wait, no. Scattering amplitude has dimensions of length, so femtometers is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is expected in units of the electron wavelength or something else. But given that we computed k from the electron\'s momentum, and 1/k is the reduced wavelength, which is about 3.9 fm, and multiplied by the sum, which is about 9.1, leading to 35.5 fm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the Bohr radius or something, but I don\'t think so. Femtometers are standard in nuclear physics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in mb^(1/2) (millibarn square roots), but no, scattering amplitude is in length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in natural units where ħ=c=1, but the calculation here already accounted for the units by using ħc=197.33 MeV fm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. \n\nBut let me check once more if the formula is correct. The imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. \n\nYes, because f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, and the imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l is sin²δ_l. Therefore, summing over all l, multiplying by (2l +1), and then 1/k. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the final answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding, 35.5 or 35.6. But let\'s see:\n\n35.55225 fm ≈35.55 fm, which is 35.55 femtometers. \n\nBut maybe we need to present it with two decimal places as 35.55 fm, or round to three significant figures. The given phase shifts are given in whole degrees except δ₂=55°, which is also a whole number. The energy is given as 50 MeV, which is one significant figure, but in physics problems, sometimes the numbers are considered to have appropriate precision. The phase shifts are given to two significant figures (e.g., 67°, 55°, etc.), so maybe the answer should be given to three significant figures. \n\n35.55 fm is already three significant figures. The sum was 9.1014, which is five significant figures, but the phase shifts are given to two (e.g., 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°), except δ₂=55° is two, δ₃=30° is two, δ₄=13° is two. δ₀=90° is two as well. So all phase shifts are two significant figures. Then, the sum is 9.10 (three significant figures). Then 1/k is 3.906 fm, but the energy is given as 50 MeV (two significant figures), so k is 0.256 fm⁻¹ (three significant figures). \n\nBut when multiplying 9.10 (three sig figs) by 3.906 (four sig figs), the result should have three sig figs: 35.5 fm. \n\nWait, 9.10 * 3.906 = 35.5 (three sig figs). \n\nAlternatively, if the energy is 50 MeV (maybe considered as two sig figs), then k is 0.256 (three sig figs), so 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs). The sum is 9.10 (three sig figs). So 3.906 * 9.10 = 35.5 (three sig figs). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 35.5 fm. \n\nBut in the calculation, we had 35.55, which rounds to 35.6 with three sig figs. Wait, 35.55 with three sig figs is 35.6. Wait, no. 35.55 rounded to three significant figures: the third significant figure is the second 5. The next digit is 5, so we round up. So 35.55 ≈35.6 with three sig figs. \n\nBut the sum was 9.1014, which is approximately 9.10 with three sig figs. 9.10 * 3.906 = 35.5 (if 9.10 is three sig figs and 3.906 is four, the result is three sig figs). Wait, 9.10 * 3.906:\n\n9.10 * 3.906 = ?\n\n9 * 3.906 = 35.154\n\n0.10 * 3.906 = 0.3906\n\nTotal = 35.154 + 0.3906 = 35.5446 ≈35.54\n\nBut with three sig figs, 35.5. Wait, 35.54 is four sig figs. If we have 9.10 (three) * 3.906 (four) = 35.54, which we should round to three sig figs: 35.5. \n\nBut 35.54 rounded to three sig figs is 35.5. \n\nAlternatively, if the original sum is 9.10 (three sig figs) and 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs), then the product is 35.5 (three sig figs). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 35.5 fm. \n\nBut in our precise calculation, it was 35.55, which is 35.6 when rounded to three sig figs. But according to the rules, if the first digit being dropped is 5, we round up. So 35.55 rounded to three sig figs is 35.6. However, if the sum is 9.10 (three sig figs) and 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs), then the product is 35.5446, which is 35.54 when keeping four sig figs, but since we need three, it\'s 35.5. \n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let\'s recall the rules: when multiplying, the number of significant figures in the result is the same as the least number of significant figures in the inputs. \n\nThe sum S = 9.1014. The given phase shifts are all two significant figures (e.g., 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°). Wait, 90° is two sig figs, 67° is two, 55° is two, 30° is two, 13° is two. So when we compute S = Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, each term is calculated with two sig figs. \n\nWait, but actually, when you compute sin²(67°), which is sin(67°)=0.9205, which is four sig figs, but the angle is given as 67°, which is two sig figs. So the uncertainty in the angle would translate to uncertainty in the sine. But since the problem doesn\'t specify uncertainties, we can assume that the given phase shifts are exact. Therefore, we can use the sines to full calculator precision. \n\nBut if the problem gives the phase shifts as exact values (e.g., δ₀=90°, which is exact 90 degrees), then sin(90°)=1 exactly. Similarly, δ₁=67°, exact, sin(67°)=0.9205... etc. So in that case, the sum S can be considered as exact as the given phase shifts. But the problem gives the phase shifts as whole numbers in degrees, so perhaps we should treat them as exact. \n\nHowever, the energy is given as 50 MeV, which is likely two sig figs. Therefore, the calculation of k would have two sig figs. \n\nWait, let\'s recast the calculation with two sig figs for k. \n\nIf the energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E = 50.511 MeV ≈50.5 MeV (three sig figs). But since the kinetic energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E = T + mc² = 50 + 0.511 ≈50.5 MeV, which is three sig figs. But if T is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E is 50.5 MeV (three sig figs). Then, p c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) = sqrt( (50.5)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2550.25 - 0.261) ≈sqrt(2549.99) ≈50.499 MeV. \n\nTherefore, p ≈50.499 / c MeV/c. \n\nThen, k = p / ħ = (50.499 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ≈50.499 / 197.33 ≈0.2558 fm⁻¹ ≈0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). \n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈3.85 fm (since 1/0.26 ≈3.846). \n\nThen, sum S =9.1014. \n\nSo Im f(0) = 3.85 fm * 9.1014 ≈35.0 fm (two sig figs). \n\nBut this is conflicting. If the energy is two sig figs, then k is two sig figs, leading to 1/k=3.8 fm (two sig figs), and sum S=9.1 (two sig figs: since each term is two sig figs? Wait, the sum is 1 + 2.5 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.46 = 1 + 2.5=3.5; 3.5+3.4=6.9; 6.9+1.8=8.7; 8.7+0.46=9.16 ≈9.2 (two sig figs). \n\nWait, if each term in the sum is calculated with two sig figs:\n\nl=0: 1.0 (exact)\n\nl=1: 3 * sin²(67°). sin(67°)=0.92 (two sig figs), squared is 0.85, 3*0.85=2.6 (two sig figs)\n\nl=2:5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°)=0.82 (two sig figs), squared=0.67, 5*0.67=3.4 (two sig figs)\n\nl=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7*0.25=1.8 (two sig figs)\n\nl=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.22 (two sig figs), squared=0.048, 9*0.048=0.43 (two sig figs)\n\nSum:1.0 + 2.6 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.43 =1.0+2.6=3.6; 3.6+3.4=7.0; 7.0+1.8=8.8; 8.8+0.43=9.23≈9.2 (two sig figs)\n\nThen, 1/k=3.8 fm (two sig figs)\n\nIm f(0)=3.8 *9.2=34.96≈35 fm (two sig figs)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 35 fm. \n\nBut this is different from the previous 35.55 fm. The difference comes from rounding during the calculation steps. \n\nBut the problem states "Calculate the imaginary part...". It doesn\'t specify the number of significant figures, but given that the phase shifts are given in whole degrees (maybe implying two sig figs) and the energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), the answer should be given with two significant figures, so 35 fm. \n\nBut in the initial calculation, with more precise intermediate steps, we had 35.55 fm. However, considering the precision of the given data, 35 fm is more appropriate. \n\nBut let me check once more. If the phase shifts are given as integers in degrees, then sin²δ_l can be calculated more precisely. For example, δ=67°, which is 67.0°, so sin(67.0°)=0.9205... So if we use more precise sine values, even if the angles are given as whole numbers, the sine can be calculated to higher precision. \n\nTherefore, if we take the phase shifts as exact angles (e.g., 67.000... degrees), then the sum S can be calculated to higher precision, and only the energy (50 MeV) limits the precision of k. \n\nGiven that, the energy is 50 MeV, which is two sig figs. So k is calculated with two sig figs. \n\nBut in reality, 50 MeV is a common energy and might be considered an exact value in some contexts, but in physics problems, usually, 50 MeV would be two sig figs. \n\nTherefore, combining the exact sum (9.1014) with k=0.256 fm⁻¹ (three sig figs), the result is 35.55 fm, which can be given as 35.6 fm with three sig figs. But since the energy is two sig figs, maybe we should give two sig figs. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might not care about significant figures and just wants the numerical answer. Given that, 35.55 fm can be written as approximately 36 fm. But that seems rough. \n\nAlternatively, check textbooks or examples. In nuclear physics, sometimes calculations are done with three significant figures. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply (1/k) * sum, and the numerical value is left as is. But the problem says "calculate", so probably expects a numerical value. \n\nGiven that, and the possible steps, I think the precise answer is approximately 35.5 fm. Depending on the problem\'s expectation, it could be 35.5, 35.6, or 36 fm. But given that in the initial calculation, with more precise steps, it\'s 35.55, which is 35.6 when rounded to three sig figs. \n\nBut since the phase shifts are given as whole numbers, and the energy as 50 MeV, which is two sig figs, but the calculation of k ended up being three sig figs (0.256), perhaps the answer should be 35.5 fm. \n\nAlternatively, present the answer as 35.5 fm. \n\nBut to check, let\'s see what 35.55 fm is in meters: 35.55 x 10^-15 meters. \n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify units, but since it\'s the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is in femtometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert it to barns^(1/2)? But no, scattering amplitude is in length, cross-section is in barns (area), so |f|^2 is in barns.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts: \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude \( \text{Im} f(0) \) is given by:
\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

First, we calculate each term \((2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l\):
- For \( l = 0 \): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2 90^\circ = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- For \( l = 1 \): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2 67^\circ \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541 \)
- For \( l = 2 \): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2 55^\circ \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355 \)
- For \( l = 3 \): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2 30^\circ = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- For \( l = 4 \): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2 13^\circ \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1014
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \( k \). The electron's momentum \( p \) is found using relativistic kinematics:
\[
E = 50 \text{ MeV} + 0.511 \text{ MeV} \approx 50.511 \text{ MeV}
\]
\[
pc = \sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2} \approx 50.51 \text{ MeV}
\]
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50.51 \text{ MeV}/c}{197.33 \text{ MeV} \cdot \text{fm}/c} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Thus, \( \frac{1}{k} \approx 3.906 \text{ fm} \).

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im} f(0) = 3.906 \text{ fm} \times 9.1014 \approx 35.55 \text{ fm}
\]

Considering significant figures, the answer is rounded to two significant figures:
\[
\boxed{36 \text{ fm}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Calculating 50.51 divided by 197.33:

50.51 / 200 = 0.25255, but since 197.33 is slightly less than 200, the result is slightly higher. Let's compute 50.51 / 197.33:

197.33 * 0.256 ≈ 197.33 * 0.25 + 197.33 * 0.006 ≈ 49.3325 + 1.184 ≈ 50.5165, which is very close to 50.51. So k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 1/k ≈ 1 / 0.256 fm ≈ 3.906 fm

But we need to convert this into a unit suitable for the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude has units of length. Since k is in fm⁻¹, 1/k is in fm, so f(0) has units of fm. Then Im f(0) is in fm.

But let's confirm the formula. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in terms of the partial wave expansion:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

So yes, each term is dimensionless (since e^{iδ_l} and sinδ_l are dimensionless, 2l+1 is dimensionless, P_l is dimensionless) multiplied by 1/k, which has units of length. So f(θ) has units of length, which is correct for a scattering amplitude (cross-section is in barns, which is area, and differential cross-section is |f|^2, so |f|^2 has units of area, hence f has units of length).

Therefore, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.1014 ≈ 35.53 fm

But let me compute that more accurately. 

First, 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm

Multiply by the sum 9.1014:

3.906 * 9.1014 ≈ 3.906 * 9 + 3.906 * 0.1014 ≈ 35.154 + 0.396 ≈ 35.55 fm

So approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let me check the calculation steps again for possible errors. 

First, the sum of (2l +1) sin²δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let me recalculate sin(67°). Using calculator, 67 degrees: sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, squared is ~0.847, 3*0.847≈2.541. Correct.

l=2: 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55)=0.8192, squared ~0.671, 5*0.671≈3.355. Correct.

l=3: 7 * sin²(30°)=7*(0.25)=1.75. Correct.

l=4: 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)=0.22495, squared≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.

Sum: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541 is 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 is 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 is 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 is 9.1014. Correct.

Then 1/k: calculated as 3.906 fm. 

So 3.906 * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm. 

But the problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let's check if there is a possible mistake in the formula. Wait, the optical theorem says that σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). So if I can compute σ_total from the phase shifts, then I can get Im f(0) = (k σ_total)/(4π). 

But the total cross-section for elastic scattering (since it's elastic, σ_total = σ_elastic) can be calculated as the sum over l of (4π/k²)(2l + 1) sin²δ_l. 

Wait, that formula is σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. 

But according to the optical theorem, σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0). Therefore, equating the two expressions:

(4π/k) Im f(0) = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Cancel 4π from both sides:

(1/k) Im f(0) = (1/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Multiply both sides by k:

Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Which matches our original formula. So that's correct. Therefore, our calculation is consistent with the optical theorem. 

Therefore, the result is approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let's check the value of k again. The electron's momentum. 

Given that the kinetic energy T = 50 MeV. The rest mass m = 0.511 MeV/c². 

Total energy E = T + mc² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV. 

Then, the momentum p is sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c

Calculate (50.511)^2 = 50.511*50.511. Let's compute 50*50=2500, 50*0.511=25.555, 0.511*50=25.555, 0.511^2≈0.261. So (50 + 0.511)^2 = 50² + 2*50*0.511 + 0.511² = 2500 + 51.1 + 0.261 ≈ 2551.361 MeV²

Then subtract (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 MeV², so we have 2551.361 - 0.261 = 2551.1 MeV²

Therefore, p c = sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV

Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV / c

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ)

But ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c

Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

So 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. Correct.

Therefore, Im f(0) ≈ 3.906 fm * 9.1014 ≈ 35.55 fm. 

But the problem might expect the answer in units of femtometers (fm) or maybe in inverse MeV or something else? Wait, scattering amplitude has units of length, so femtometers is appropriate. 35.55 fm is 35.55 x 10^-15 meters. 

But let me check if there is a possible error in the calculation of the sum. Let me recalculate each term with more precise sine values.

For l=1, δ=67°:

sin(67°) = sin(60° + 7°) = sin60 cos7 + cos60 sin7 ≈ 0.8660 * 0.9925 + 0.5 * 0.1219 ≈ 0.8594 + 0.06095 ≈ 0.9203, which squared is ≈ 0.847. So 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541. Correct.

For l=2, δ=55°:

sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, squared is 0.8192^2 = 0.671. 5 * 0.671 = 3.355. Correct.

For l=3, δ=30°, sin(30°)=0.5, squared 0.25, 7*0.25=1.75. Correct.

For l=4, δ=13°, sin(13°)=0.22495, squared≈0.0506, 9*0.0506≈0.4554. Correct.

Sum is 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 = 9.1014. Correct.

So the sum is 9.1014. Multiply by 1/k ≈3.906 fm: 9.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 35.55 fm. 

But let me compute 9.1014 * 3.906 precisely:

First, 9 * 3.906 = 35.154

0.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 0.1014*3 = 0.3042; 0.1014*0.906 ≈ 0.0919; total ≈0.3042 + 0.0919 ≈0.3961

So total ≈35.154 + 0.3961 ≈35.5501 fm. 

So approximately 35.55 fm. 

But maybe we need to consider more decimal places for k. Let's recalculate k:

k = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ ?

50.51 divided by 197.33:

197.33 * 0.25 = 49.3325

50.51 - 49.3325 = 1.1775

1.1775 / 197.33 ≈ 0.00596

So total k ≈0.25 + 0.00596 ≈0.25596 ≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Thus, 1/k ≈3.90625 fm

So 9.1014 * 3.90625 ≈ ?

3.90625 * 9 = 35.15625

3.90625 * 0.1014 ≈0.396

Total ≈35.15625 + 0.396 ≈35.55225 fm

So approximately 35.55 fm. 

But the problem might expect an exact symbolic answer, but given that the phase shifts are given in degrees and the energy is given as 50 MeV, which requires a numerical computation, the answer is a numerical multiple of femtometers. 

But let me check if there is a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of inverse MeV or another unit. Wait, no. Scattering amplitude has dimensions of length, so femtometers is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected in units of the electron wavelength or something else. But given that we computed k from the electron's momentum, and 1/k is the reduced wavelength, which is about 3.9 fm, and multiplied by the sum, which is about 9.1, leading to 35.5 fm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the Bohr radius or something, but I don't think so. Femtometers are standard in nuclear physics. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in mb^(1/2) (millibarn square roots), but no, scattering amplitude is in length. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in natural units where ħ=c=1, but the calculation here already accounted for the units by using ħc=197.33 MeV fm. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. 

But let me check once more if the formula is correct. The imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l. 

Yes, because f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, and the imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l is sin²δ_l. Therefore, summing over all l, multiplying by (2l +1), and then 1/k. 

Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

So the final answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding, 35.5 or 35.6. But let's see:

35.55225 fm ≈35.55 fm, which is 35.55 femtometers. 

But maybe we need to present it with two decimal places as 35.55 fm, or round to three significant figures. The given phase shifts are given in whole degrees except δ₂=55°, which is also a whole number. The energy is given as 50 MeV, which is one significant figure, but in physics problems, sometimes the numbers are considered to have appropriate precision. The phase shifts are given to two significant figures (e.g., 67°, 55°, etc.), so maybe the answer should be given to three significant figures. 

35.55 fm is already three significant figures. The sum was 9.1014, which is five significant figures, but the phase shifts are given to two (e.g., 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°), except δ₂=55° is two, δ₃=30° is two, δ₄=13° is two. δ₀=90° is two as well. So all phase shifts are two significant figures. Then, the sum is 9.10 (three significant figures). Then 1/k is 3.906 fm, but the energy is given as 50 MeV (two significant figures), so k is 0.256 fm⁻¹ (three significant figures). 

But when multiplying 9.10 (three sig figs) by 3.906 (four sig figs), the result should have three sig figs: 35.5 fm. 

Wait, 9.10 * 3.906 = 35.5 (three sig figs). 

Alternatively, if the energy is 50 MeV (maybe considered as two sig figs), then k is 0.256 (three sig figs), so 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs). The sum is 9.10 (three sig figs). So 3.906 * 9.10 = 35.5 (three sig figs). 

Therefore, the answer is 35.5 fm. 

But in the calculation, we had 35.55, which rounds to 35.6 with three sig figs. Wait, 35.55 with three sig figs is 35.6. Wait, no. 35.55 rounded to three significant figures: the third significant figure is the second 5. The next digit is 5, so we round up. So 35.55 ≈35.6 with three sig figs. 

But the sum was 9.1014, which is approximately 9.10 with three sig figs. 9.10 * 3.906 = 35.5 (if 9.10 is three sig figs and 3.906 is four, the result is three sig figs). Wait, 9.10 * 3.906:

9.10 * 3.906 = ?

9 * 3.906 = 35.154

0.10 * 3.906 = 0.3906

Total = 35.154 + 0.3906 = 35.5446 ≈35.54

But with three sig figs, 35.5. Wait, 35.54 is four sig figs. If we have 9.10 (three) * 3.906 (four) = 35.54, which we should round to three sig figs: 35.5. 

But 35.54 rounded to three sig figs is 35.5. 

Alternatively, if the original sum is 9.10 (three sig figs) and 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs), then the product is 35.5 (three sig figs). 

Therefore, the answer is 35.5 fm. 

But in our precise calculation, it was 35.55, which is 35.6 when rounded to three sig figs. But according to the rules, if the first digit being dropped is 5, we round up. So 35.55 rounded to three sig figs is 35.6. However, if the sum is 9.10 (three sig figs) and 1/k is 3.906 (four sig figs), then the product is 35.5446, which is 35.54 when keeping four sig figs, but since we need three, it's 35.5. 

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let's recall the rules: when multiplying, the number of significant figures in the result is the same as the least number of significant figures in the inputs. 

The sum S = 9.1014. The given phase shifts are all two significant figures (e.g., 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°). Wait, 90° is two sig figs, 67° is two, 55° is two, 30° is two, 13° is two. So when we compute S = Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l, each term is calculated with two sig figs. 

Wait, but actually, when you compute sin²(67°), which is sin(67°)=0.9205, which is four sig figs, but the angle is given as 67°, which is two sig figs. So the uncertainty in the angle would translate to uncertainty in the sine. But since the problem doesn't specify uncertainties, we can assume that the given phase shifts are exact. Therefore, we can use the sines to full calculator precision. 

But if the problem gives the phase shifts as exact values (e.g., δ₀=90°, which is exact 90 degrees), then sin(90°)=1 exactly. Similarly, δ₁=67°, exact, sin(67°)=0.9205... etc. So in that case, the sum S can be considered as exact as the given phase shifts. But the problem gives the phase shifts as whole numbers in degrees, so perhaps we should treat them as exact. 

However, the energy is given as 50 MeV, which is likely two sig figs. Therefore, the calculation of k would have two sig figs. 

Wait, let's recast the calculation with two sig figs for k. 

If the energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E = 50.511 MeV ≈50.5 MeV (three sig figs). But since the kinetic energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E = T + mc² = 50 + 0.511 ≈50.5 MeV, which is three sig figs. But if T is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E is 50.5 MeV (three sig figs). Then, p c = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) = sqrt( (50.5)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2550.25 - 0.261) ≈sqrt(2549.99) ≈50.499 MeV. 

Therefore, p ≈50.499 / c MeV/c. 

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.499 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ≈50.499 / 197.33 ≈0.2558 fm⁻¹ ≈0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). 

Therefore, 1/k ≈3.85 fm (since 1/0.26 ≈3.846). 

Then, sum S =9.1014. 

So Im f(0) = 3.85 fm * 9.1014 ≈35.0 fm (two sig figs). 

But this is conflicting. If the energy is two sig figs, then k is two sig figs, leading to 1/k=3.8 fm (two sig figs), and sum S=9.1 (two sig figs: since each term is two sig figs? Wait, the sum is 1 + 2.5 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.46 = 1 + 2.5=3.5; 3.5+3.4=6.9; 6.9+1.8=8.7; 8.7+0.46=9.16 ≈9.2 (two sig figs). 

Wait, if each term in the sum is calculated with two sig figs:

l=0: 1.0 (exact)

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°). sin(67°)=0.92 (two sig figs), squared is 0.85, 3*0.85=2.6 (two sig figs)

l=2:5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°)=0.82 (two sig figs), squared=0.67, 5*0.67=3.4 (two sig figs)

l=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7*0.25=1.8 (two sig figs)

l=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.22 (two sig figs), squared=0.048, 9*0.048=0.43 (two sig figs)

Sum:1.0 + 2.6 + 3.4 + 1.8 + 0.43 =1.0+2.6=3.6; 3.6+3.4=7.0; 7.0+1.8=8.8; 8.8+0.43=9.23≈9.2 (two sig figs)

Then, 1/k=3.8 fm (two sig figs)

Im f(0)=3.8 *9.2=34.96≈35 fm (two sig figs)

Therefore, the answer is 35 fm. 

But this is different from the previous 35.55 fm. The difference comes from rounding during the calculation steps. 

But the problem states "Calculate the imaginary part...". It doesn't specify the number of significant figures, but given that the phase shifts are given in whole degrees (maybe implying two sig figs) and the energy is 50 MeV (two sig figs), the answer should be given with two significant figures, so 35 fm. 

But in the initial calculation, with more precise intermediate steps, we had 35.55 fm. However, considering the precision of the given data, 35 fm is more appropriate. 

But let me check once more. If the phase shifts are given as integers in degrees, then sin²δ_l can be calculated more precisely. For example, δ=67°, which is 67.0°, so sin(67.0°)=0.9205... So if we use more precise sine values, even if the angles are given as whole numbers, the sine can be calculated to higher precision. 

Therefore, if we take the phase shifts as exact angles (e.g., 67.000... degrees), then the sum S can be calculated to higher precision, and only the energy (50 MeV) limits the precision of k. 

Given that, the energy is 50 MeV, which is two sig figs. So k is calculated with two sig figs. 

But in reality, 50 MeV is a common energy and might be considered an exact value in some contexts, but in physics problems, usually, 50 MeV would be two sig figs. 

Therefore, combining the exact sum (9.1014) with k=0.256 fm⁻¹ (three sig figs), the result is 35.55 fm, which can be given as 35.6 fm with three sig figs. But since the energy is two sig figs, maybe we should give two sig figs. 

Alternatively, the problem might not care about significant figures and just wants the numerical answer. Given that, 35.55 fm can be written as approximately 36 fm. But that seems rough. 

Alternatively, check textbooks or examples. In nuclear physics, sometimes calculations are done with three significant figures. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply (1/k) * sum, and the numerical value is left as is. But the problem says "calculate", so probably expects a numerical value. 

Given that, and the possible steps, I think the precise answer is approximately 35.5 fm. Depending on the problem's expectation, it could be 35.5, 35.6, or 36 fm. But given that in the initial calculation, with more precise steps, it's 35.55, which is 35.6 when rounded to three sig figs. 

But since the phase shifts are given as whole numbers, and the energy as 50 MeV, which is two sig figs, but the calculation of k ended up being three sig figs (0.256), perhaps the answer should be 35.5 fm. 

Alternatively, present the answer as 35.5 fm. 

But to check, let's see what 35.55 fm is in meters: 35.55 x 10^-15 meters. 

But the problem doesn't specify units, but since it's the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is in femtometers. 

Alternatively, maybe convert it to barns^(1/2)? But no, scattering amplitude is in length, cross-section is in barns (area), so |f|^2 is in barns. But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0), which is in fm. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. 

But given the possible variations in calculation steps and rounding, I think the precise answer is 35.5 fm. However, to match the possible expected answer, maybe it's 36 fm. But I need to check if my calculation of k is correct. 

Wait, let's recalculate k with T=50 MeV (two sig figs):

E = T + mc² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV. 

p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2)/c = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²)/c ≈ sqrt(2551.1 - 0.261)/c ≈sqrt(2550.84)/c ≈50.505/c MeV. 

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.505 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50.505 / 197.33 ≈0.2559 fm⁻¹

1/k ≈3.907 fm

Then, Im f(0) = 3.907 *9.1014 ≈35.55 fm. 

So with more precise k, it's still ≈35.55 fm. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.6 fm when rounded to three significant figures, or 36 fm with two. But given that the problem provides the phase shifts as whole numbers (two sig figs) and energy as 50 MeV (two sig figs), the answer should have two sig figs. Therefore, 36 fm. 

But 35.55 is closer to 36 than 35.5. Wait, 35.55 is 35.55, which is 35.6 in three sig figs, but with two sig figs, it's 36. 

Yes, because with two sig figs, 35.55 rounds to 36. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{36 \text{ fm}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{36 \text{ fm}}

The electron\'s momentum p is given by E = pc for ultra-relativistic particles, but 50 MeV is much larger than the electron\'s rest mass (0.511 MeV), so p ≈ E/c. Therefore, k = p/ħ ≈ (50 MeV/c)/ħ. Converting MeV/c to fm⁻¹: 1 MeV/c ≈ (1e6 eV)/(3e8 m/s) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) ) ≈ 5.06e12 m⁻1 ≈ 5.06e-3 fm⁻¹.

Wait, no, the units should be in length. Alternatively, maybe the answer is unitless if they use natural units where ħ=c=1. But the problem states to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which in standard units is in length. However, in the formula, if k is in fm⁻¹, then 1/k is in fm, and multiplied by the sum (dimensionless) gives fm. So 35.9 fm is correct. But let me check if the phase shifts are in degrees. Yes, they are given in degrees. So the calculation of sin²δ_l is correct. For example, δ₀=90°, sin(90°)=1, so sin²=1. Correct. δ₁=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205. Correct. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But maybe the problem expects a numerical coefficient without units? But the question says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length. So the answer should be in femtometers. But perhaps the problem expects it in terms of inverse MeV? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me check again.\n\nElectron with 50 MeV kinetic energy. The total energy E = kinetic + rest mass = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV. Then, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ). Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹. So 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. Then, multiplying the sum 9.1014 by 3.906 gives approximately 35.5 fm. So the answer is approximately 35.5 femtometers. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 35.5 fm.

Correct.\n\nk = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2560 fm⁻¹. 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. 9.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 35.5 fm. So the imaginary part is approximately 35.5 fm. The problem might expect the answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, so maybe 9.10/k. But since k is 0.256, 9.10/0.256 ≈ 35.5. So yes, 35.5 fm. But let me check if there\'s a factor I missed. For electrons, since they are spin-1/2 particles, the scattering amplitude might have an additional factor. Wait, in the partial wave expansion for spin-1/2 particles, the formula might be different. But the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so maybe it\'s assuming that spin effects are already incorporated into the given phase shifts. The problem statement doesn\'t mention spin, so perhaps we can proceed with the standard formula. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.5 fm. Converting to a boxed value, maybe 36 fm if rounded, but given the precise calculation, 35.5 fm. However, let me check the exact value of 9.1014 * 3.906:\n\n9 * 3.906 = 35.154\n\n0.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 0.396\n\nTotal ≈ 35.154 + 0.396 ≈ 35.55 fm. So approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding during intermediate steps, maybe 35.5 or 35.6. But given that the problem provides phase shifts to the nearest degree, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures. The phase shifts are given as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°, which are all two significant figures except 90° (which is exact). So maybe the answer should be two significant figures. 35.5 rounds to 36. But 35.5 is two significant figures? Wait, 35.5 has three significant figures. If the input data has two significant figures (like 67°, 55°, etc.), then the answer should have two. So 36 fm. Alternatively, since 90° is exact (maybe as a right angle), but the others are two sig figs. So perhaps 36 fm. But the exact calculation gives 35.5, which is 35.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of 1/(2ik) times the sum over (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1), but no, the standard formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. Since the problem might expect the answer in units of inverse MeV or something else, but no, the units should be femtometers. So I think the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. But to check, maybe the question expects a numerical value without units? Unlikely. The problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length. So the answer is about 35.5 fm. So boxed, it would be \\boxed{35.5 \\text{ fm}}.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe there\'s a missing factor of 2. In some references, the scattering amplitude is written as f = (1/2ik) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). In that case, the imaginary part would be different. Let me verify.\n\nIf f = (1/2ik) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ), then expanding e^{2iδ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 = -2 sin²δ_l + i 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part of each term would be (2l+1) * 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l / (2k) ) = (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l / k. But this contradicts the previous approach. Wait, but in the standard partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the initial approach is correct. Therefore, the answer is 35.5 fm.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for 50 MeV electrons elastically scattering from a nuclear target, we use the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ = 0) is given by:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l
\]

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is the coefficient of the imaginary term in the expansion of \( e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l \):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]

Given the phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\), we calculate each term in the sum:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{For } l=0: & \quad (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1^2 = 1 \\
\text{For } l=1: & \quad (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 2.541 \\
\text{For } l=2: & \quad (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 3.355 \\
\text{For } l=3: & \quad (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75 \\
\text{For } l=4: & \quad (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 0.4554 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these contributions:

\[
1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1014
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \(k\). For 50 MeV electrons, the momentum \(p\) is approximately \(50 \, \text{MeV}/c\). Using the conversion \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm} \):

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}/c}{197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

Thus, the inverse wave number is:

\[
\frac{1}{k} \approx 3.95 \, \text{fm}
\]

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \times 9.1014 \approx 3.95 \times 9.1014 \approx 35.5 \, \text{fm}
\]

\[
\boxed{35.5 \, \text{fm}}
\]

But wait, the units. Since k is in fm⁻¹, multiplying by 1/k (fm) gives units of fm², which is a cross-sectional area. However, the scattering amplitude has units of length. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let's check the calculation of k again. The electron's momentum p is given by E = pc for ultra-relativistic particles, but 50 MeV is much larger than the electron's rest mass (0.511 MeV), so p ≈ E/c. Therefore, k = p/ħ ≈ (50 MeV/c)/ħ. Converting MeV/c to fm⁻¹: 1 MeV/c ≈ (1e6 eV)/(3e8 m/s) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) ) ≈ 5.06e12 m⁻1 ≈ 5.06e-3 fm⁻¹. Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, using the conversion factor: 1 fm⁻¹ ≈ 197.33 MeV/c. So, if p = 50 MeV/c, then k = p/(ħc) * ħc ≈ 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹. So my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

Thus, Im f(0) ≈ 9.1014 * 3.95 ≈ 35.9 fm. But the problem might expect the answer in terms of inverse MeV or another unit? Wait, no, the scattering amplitude is typically in units of length (fm). However, in some conventions, the scattering amplitude is dimensionless. Wait, let me check the formula again.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of length. The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Since k has units of inverse length, 1/k has units of length, and each term (2l+1) is dimensionless, e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l is dimensionless, so f(θ) has units of length. Therefore, Im f(0) is in units of length. So 35.9 fm is the answer. But 35.9 fm is 35.9e-15 meters. However, in nuclear physics, cross-sections are often in barns (1 barn = 100 fm²), but the scattering amplitude is in fm. So 35.9 fm seems plausible. But let me check the sum again.

Wait, the sum of the terms:

l=0: 1

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°): sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, so squared is ≈ 0.847. 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541

l=2: 5 * sin²(55°). sin(55) ≈ 0.8192, squared ≈ 0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355

l=3: 7 * sin²(30°). sin(30)=0.5, squared 0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75

l=4: 9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495, squared≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554

Total sum: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1014

Yes, that's correct. Then 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm. So 9.1014 * 3.95 ≈ 35.9 fm. So the imaginary part is approximately 35.9 fm. But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of inverse energy or something else? Wait, no, the units should be in length. Alternatively, maybe the answer is unitless if they use natural units where ħ=c=1. But the problem states to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which in standard units is in length. However, in the formula, if k is in fm⁻¹, then 1/k is in fm, and multiplied by the sum (dimensionless) gives fm. So 35.9 fm is correct. But let me check if the phase shifts are in degrees. Yes, they are given in degrees. So the calculation of sin²δ_l is correct. For example, δ₀=90°, sin(90°)=1, so sin²=1. Correct. δ₁=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205. Correct. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.9 fm. But maybe the problem expects a numerical coefficient without units? But the question says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length. So the answer should be in femtometers. But perhaps the problem expects it in terms of inverse MeV? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me check again.

Electron with 50 MeV kinetic energy. The total energy E = kinetic + rest mass = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV. Then, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ). Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹. So 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. Then, multiplying the sum 9.1014 by 3.906 gives approximately 35.5 fm. So the answer is approximately 35.5 femtometers. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 35.5 fm. But let me check the exact value.

Sum: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 = 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 = 9.1014. Correct.

k = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2560 fm⁻¹. 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm. 9.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 35.5 fm. So the imaginary part is approximately 35.5 fm. The problem might expect the answer in terms of 1/k multiplied by the sum, so maybe 9.10/k. But since k is 0.256, 9.10/0.256 ≈ 35.5. So yes, 35.5 fm. But let me check if there's a factor I missed. For electrons, since they are spin-1/2 particles, the scattering amplitude might have an additional factor. Wait, in the partial wave expansion for spin-1/2 particles, the formula might be different. But the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so maybe it's assuming that spin effects are already incorporated into the given phase shifts. The problem statement doesn't mention spin, so perhaps we can proceed with the standard formula. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.5 fm. Converting to a boxed value, maybe 36 fm if rounded, but given the precise calculation, 35.5 fm. However, let me check the exact value of 9.1014 * 3.906:

9 * 3.906 = 35.154

0.1014 * 3.906 ≈ 0.396

Total ≈ 35.154 + 0.396 ≈ 35.55 fm. So approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding during intermediate steps, maybe 35.5 or 35.6. But given that the problem provides phase shifts to the nearest degree, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures. The phase shifts are given as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, 13°, which are all two significant figures except 90° (which is exact). So maybe the answer should be two significant figures. 35.5 rounds to 36. But 35.5 is two significant figures? Wait, 35.5 has three significant figures. If the input data has two significant figures (like 67°, 55°, etc.), then the answer should have two. So 36 fm. Alternatively, since 90° is exact (maybe as a right angle), but the others are two sig figs. So perhaps 36 fm. But the exact calculation gives 35.5, which is 35.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of 1/(2ik) times the sum over (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1), but no, the standard formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. Since the problem might expect the answer in units of inverse MeV or something else, but no, the units should be femtometers. So I think the answer is approximately 35.5 fm. But to check, maybe the question expects a numerical value without units? Unlikely. The problem says "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude", which has units of length. So the answer is about 35.5 fm. So boxed, it would be \boxed{35.5 \text{ fm}}.

But wait, let me check once more. Maybe there's a missing factor of 2. In some references, the scattering amplitude is written as f = (1/2ik) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). In that case, the imaginary part would be different. Let me verify.

If f = (1/2ik) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ), then expanding e^{2iδ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 = -2 sin²δ_l + i 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part of each term would be (2l+1) * 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l / (2k) ) = (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l / k. But this contradicts the previous approach. Wait, but in the standard partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the initial approach is correct. Therefore, the answer is 35.5 fm. So I think that's the correct result.

However, the units of the scattering amplitude are in femtometers (fm), which is typical for nuclear scattering. The answer should be presented in terms of inverse k, but since k is in fm⁻¹, the units work out. So the imaginary part is approximately 35.55 fm. However, let me check the calculation steps again for accuracy.\n\nWait, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when calculating sine, the calculator must be in degree mode. Let me verify the sine values:\n\nsin(90°) = 1, correct.\n\nsin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so sin²(67°) ≈ 0.847, which matches.\n\nsin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, so sin² ≈ 0.671, correct.\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5, squared is 0.25.\n\nsin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506, correct.\n\nSo the coefficients:\n\nl=0: 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3*0.847=2.541\n\nl=2:5*0.671=3.355\n\nl=3:7*0.25=1.75\n\nl=4:9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nTotal sum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355 = 6.896; +1.75 = 8.646; +0.4554 ≈9.1014.\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Then k is calculated as 0.256 fm⁻¹. So 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm. But let me check the calculation of k again.\n\nWait, the electron\'s kinetic energy is 50 MeV. Since electrons are light, we need to use relativistic formulas. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy: E = K + mc² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. Then, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Solving for pc:\n\npc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.46 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħc) * c. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm. But let me check if the formula for the scattering amplitude is correct. The standard formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) )\n\nWait, hold on! Maybe I made a mistake here. The standard partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nBut another version is:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ)\n\nThese are equivalent because e^{2iδ_l} - 1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Therefore, substituting into the second formula:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1)(2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l) P_l(cosθ) ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nSo both expressions are the same. Therefore, my original formula is correct. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the first formula, when you take the imaginary part of f(0), since f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, then the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sinδ_l * Im(e^{iδ_l}) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sinδ_l * sinδ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 9.1014, divided by k=0.256 fm⁻¹, gives 35.55 fm. However, the problem states to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The units of the scattering amplitude are in length, which is correct. But let me check if there\'s a factor I missed. For example, sometimes the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of the wave number k. Wait, but in the formula, the units of f(θ) should be in length. Since k is in [length]⁻¹, then 1/k is in [length], and the sum is dimensionless, so f(θ) is in [length], which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But let me check the numerical values again. Let\'s compute each term precisely:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1\n\nl=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let\'s compute sin(67°). Using calculator: sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, so squared is ≈0.847. 3*0.847≈2.541\n\nl=2:5 * sin²(55°). sin(55)≈0.8192, squared≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355\n\nl=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75\n\nl=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495, squared≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nSum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 ≈9.1014. Correct.\n\nk=0.256 fm⁻¹. So 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈35.55 fm. So the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But the problem might expect the answer in terms of inverse MeV or something else? Wait, no. The units of the scattering amplitude are in femtometers (fm), which is correct. So the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.6 fm. But let me check if the calculation of k is correct.\n\nGiven that the electron\'s kinetic energy is 50 MeV. The momentum p is calculated using relativistic energy-momentum relation. For electrons, since their rest mass is 0.511 MeV, which is much smaller than 50 MeV, but not negligible. So:\n\nE = K + mc² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV\n\nThen, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nSo, (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2551.46 - 0.261 ≈2551.2\n\npc ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈50.51 MeV\n\nTherefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c\n\nThen, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħc) * c\n\nBut ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm, so:\n\nk = (50.51 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ≈0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈35.55 fm. Rounding to two decimal places, 35.55 fm. But maybe the answer should be given with more precise decimal places or as a fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of inverse k, but no, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has units of length. So 35.55 fm is the answer. However, let me check if there\'s a possible mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: in the partial wave expansion, the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², and the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:\n\nσ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0)\n\nBut here, we are just asked for Im f(0), not the total cross-section. So the formula I used is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But let me check with exact calculation:\n\nSum = 1 + 3*(sin(67))² +5*(sin(55))² +7*(sin(30))² +9*(sin(13))²\n\nCompute each term precisely:\n\nsin(67°): Let\'s use calculator:\n\nsin(67°) = sin(67) ≈0.9205048535\n\nsin²(67°) ≈0.8473291\n\n3*0.8473291≈2.5419873\n\nsin(55°)=0.8191520443, squared≈0.671\n\n5*0.671≈3.355\n\nsin(30°)=0.5, squared=0.25, 7*0.25=1.75\n\nsin(13°)=0.2249510543, squared≈0.0506029, 9*0.0506029≈0.4554261\n\nSum:\n\n1 + 2.5419873 =3.5419873\n\n+3.355 =6.8969873\n\n+1.75 =8.6469873\n\n+0.4554261≈9.1024134\n\nSo more accurately, the sum is ≈9.1024\n\nk=50.51 / 197.33 ≈0.2560 fm⁻¹\n\nThus, Im f(0)=9.1024 /0.2560≈35.556 fm\n\nSo approximately 35.56 fm. Rounding to two decimal places, 35.56 fm. But perhaps the answer is expected in units of 1/MeV or something else? Wait, no. The units of the scattering amplitude f are in femtometers (fm), since k is in fm⁻¹ and 1/k is fm. The sum is dimensionless, so f has units of fm. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on the precision required, maybe round to 36 fm, but given the problem provides phase shifts to the nearest degree, perhaps two decimal places are acceptable. However, let me check if there\'s a possible mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another point: the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons". Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so in principle, there could be spin-flip amplitudes, but in the case of unpolarized scattering and if the target is spinless or if we\'re considering spin-averaged amplitudes, the partial wave expansion might still hold as given. However, the standard partial wave expansion for scattering amplitude usually applies to spinless particles. For electrons, which are spin-1/2, the treatment is more complex, involving Dirac equation phase shifts. However, the problem doesn\'t mention anything about spin, so perhaps we are to proceed with the standard non-relativistic partial wave expansion, assuming spin effects are negligible or already accounted for. Since the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, we can proceed as if it\'s a spinless case.\n\nMoreover, 50 MeV electrons are relativistic (since their kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass of 0.511 MeV), so a relativistic treatment is necessary. However, the problem provides phase shifts, so perhaps we are to use the given phase shifts regardless of the relativistic considerations beyond calculating k. The calculation of k was done relativistically, which is correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.6 fm.\n\nBut let me check another source to confirm the formula for the imaginary part. According to quantum mechanics textbooks, the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part at θ=0 (since all P_l(1)=1) is:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l\n\nWhich is exactly what I used. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding conventions, it could be written as 35.5 fm or 35.6 fm. Given the sum was approximately 9.1024 and k=0.256 fm⁻¹, 9.1024 /0.256 = 35.55625, so 35.56 fm. If the problem expects an exact fraction, but given the phase shifts are in degrees, likely approximate. So boxed as 35.6 fm. However, let me check if the question expects units in terms of 10^-15 m or something else. 1 fm = 1e-15 m, but the answer is just in fm. So the answer is \\boxed{35.6} fm. But maybe the exact value is 35.5 or 36. Wait, let me compute 9.1024 divided by 0.256:\n\n9.1024 /0.256:\n\n0.256 * 35 = 8.96\n\n9.1024 -8.96=0.1424\n\n0.1424 /0.256 ≈0.55625\n\nSo 35.55625, which is 35.56 when rounded to two decimal places, or 35.6 to one decimal. Since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees (except δ₂=55, which is 55 degrees), maybe the answer should be given to three significant figures. The sum is 9.10 (three sig figs), and k is 0.256 (three sig figs), so 9.10 /0.256 = 35.546875 ≈35.5. Wait, 9.10 /0.256:\n\n9.10 divided by 0.256:\n\n0.256 *35 =8.96\n\n9.10 -8.96=0.14\n\n0.14 /0.256=0.546875\n\nSo 35.546875, which is 35.5 when rounded to three significant figures. But 9.10 has three, 0.256 has three, so the result should have three: 35.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects more precise handling. Let me check the exact value of k:\n\nk = 50.51 /197.33 ≈0.2560 fm⁻¹\n\n50.51 divided by 197.33:\n\n197.33 *0.2=39.466\n\n50.51 -39.466=11.044\n\n197.33*0.05=9.8665\n\n11.044 -9.8665=1.1775\n\n197.33*0.006=1.18398, which is a bit more than 1.1775, so approximately 0.2 +0.05 +0.006=0.256, so k≈0.2560 fm⁻¹.\n\nTherefore, 9.1024 /0.2560=35.55625, which is 35.556 fm. So to three significant figures, 35.6 fm. Since 9.1024 is approximately 9.10 (three sig figs), and 0.2560 is three sig figs (0.256), then 9.10 /0.256=35.546875, which is 35.5 when rounded to three sig figs. Wait, but 9.10 is three sig figs, 0.256 is three, so the result is 35.5. Hmm, there\'s a discrepancy here. Let me check:\n\nIf we take 9.10 /0.256:\n\n9.10 ÷0.256:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 9100 /256 ≈35.546875\n\nSo 35.5 when rounded to three significant figures. But 9.10 is three, 0.256 is three, so the result should be three. Therefore, 35.5 fm. However, the initial sum was 9.1014, which is approximately 9.10, so 35.5. But in reality, the sum was 9.1024, which is 9.10, so 35.5. However, depending on strict rounding rules, 35.546875... would round to 35.5. But sometimes, 35.546875 is rounded to 35.5 when keeping three significant figures. Alternatively, if we consider that 9.1024 is more precisely 9.102 (four sig figs), and 0.2560 is four, then 9.102 /0.2560=35.5546875, which is 35.55, rounded to four sig figs. But the given data (phase shifts) have two decimal places for δ₂=55°, which is exact? Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. These are all whole numbers, so maybe two significant figures? For example, δ₂=55° is two sig figs. Then, the sum would be:\n\nEach term:\n\nl=0: 1*1=1 (exact)\n\nl=1:3*sin²(67°). 67° is two sig figs, sin²(67°)=0.847, which is three sig figs. But since 67° is two sig figs, the uncertainty propagates. However, the problem doesn\'t specify uncertainties, so we take the given values as exact. Therefore, the sum is 9.1024, which is approximately 9.10 (three sig figs). Then k=0.2560 (three sig figs). Therefore, 9.10 /0.256=35.5. So the answer is 35.5 fm. But in the calculation, it\'s 35.556, which is closer to 35.6. However, considering significant figures, since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees (two sig figs for 67°, 55°, etc.), except 90° is exact (as a right angle), but maybe all are considered exact. If the phase shifts are exact, then the sum is exact, and k is calculated from 50 MeV (two sig figs? 50 has two, 50.0 would be three). The problem states 50 MeV, which is two sig figs. Then k=0.256 (three sig figs) because 50/197.33 is approx 0.253, but with precise calculation, it\'s 0.256. Wait, 50 MeV is two sig figs, so k=0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). Then Im f(0)=9.1 /0.26≈35. So with two sig figs, 35 fm. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the initial energy is 50 MeV, which is two significant figures. However, when calculating k, we used 50.511 MeV for E, but the problem states 50 MeV. If we strictly take 50 MeV as two sig figs, then E=50 MeV (K=50 MeV), rest mass=0.511 MeV. Then, E_total=50.511 MeV. But if K is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E_total=50.5 MeV (three sig figs). Then, pc= sqrt( (50.5)^2 - (0.511)^2 )≈sqrt(2550.25 -0.261)=sqrt(2549.99)≈50.499 MeV. So pc≈50.5 MeV, then k=50.5 /197.33≈0.256 fm⁻¹ (three sig figs). So if the problem\'s 50 MeV is two sig figs, then k≈0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). Then Im f(0)=9.1 /0.26≈35. So the answer would be 35 fm with two sig figs. However, the phase shifts are given as integers, which are exact, so maybe we should treat them as exact, and the energy 50 MeV as exact. Then, the answer is 35.56 fm, which can be written as 35.6 fm. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps the answer is expected to be approximately 36 fm. But given the precise calculation gives 35.56, which is closer to 35.6. However, in some contexts, scattering amplitudes can be large, but 35 fm seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. According to Landau and Lifshitz Quantum Mechanics, the scattering amplitude is given by:\n\nf(θ) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)\n\nThen, the imaginary part of f(0) would be:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) (1 - cos2δ_l )\n\nBut since e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, so the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l. Therefore, Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) * 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sinδ_l cosδ_l. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no. Wait, let\'s clarify:\n\nIf f(θ) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)\n\nThen, the imaginary part of f(0) is:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) Re(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let\'s compute Im f(0):\n\nf(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1)\n\nSince P_l(1)=1.\n\nTherefore, f(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(cos2δ_l + i sin2δ_l -1 )\n\n= (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)( -2 sin²δ_l + i sin2δ_l )\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l\n\nBut wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no:\n\nWait, f(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )\n\n= (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(cos2δ_l -1 + i sin2δ_l )\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l\n\nBut previously, using the other form of the scattering amplitude:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nThen, Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nBut according to the two different expressions, these should be equal. Therefore:\n\n(1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l\n\nBut this would imply that Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/2) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l\n\nBut this is only true if sin²δ_l = (1/2) sin2δ_l, which implies sinδ_l = cosδ_l, i.e., δ_l=45°, which is not the case here. Therefore, there must be a mistake.\n\nWait, this suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made an error in the derivation. Let me re-examine the two expressions for f(θ):\n\nFirst expression:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nSecond expression:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)\n\nThese should be equivalent. Let\'s check:\n\nExpand the second expression:\n\n(1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (1/(2ik)) (e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) )\n\n= (1/(2ik)) e^{iδ_l} (2i sinδ_l )\n\n= (1/k) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l\n\nTherefore, the two expressions are the same. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) should be the same in both formulations.\n\nBut when we compute Im f(0) using the first expression:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nUsing the second expression:\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )\n\n= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (cos2δ_l + i sin2δ_l -1 )\n\n= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) ( -2 sin²δ_l + i sin2δ_l )\n\nTherefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ -2 Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l + i Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l ]\n\nSeparating into real and imaginary parts:\n\nf(0) = [ (1/(2ik)) (-2 Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) ] + [ (1/(2ik)) (i Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l ) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-2/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (-1/(ik)) Σ ... = (i/k) Σ ... because -1/i = i.\n\nSecond term: (i/(2ik)) Σ ... = (1/(2k)) Σ ...\n\nTherefore, f(0) = (i/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l + (1/(2k)) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of the first term (since it\'s multiplied by i) plus the imaginary part of the second term. But the second term is real, so its imaginary part is zero. Therefore:\n\nIm f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nWhich matches the first derivation. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct. The confusion arose from incorrectly separating the terms, but ultimately, the imaginary part is indeed (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains approximately 35.6 fm. Given that the problem provides phase shifts as whole degrees, and the energy as 50 MeV (possibly two sig figs), but the calculation yields 35.56 fm, which rounds to 35.6 fm.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ = 0° is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

Given the phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\), we calculate each term in the sum:

- For \(l = 0\): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- For \(l = 1\): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541 \)
- For \(l = 2\): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355 \)
- For \(l = 3\): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- For \(l = 4\): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554 \)

Summing these contributions:

\[
1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1014
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \(k\). The total energy \(E\) of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy and rest mass energy:

\[
E = 50 \text{ MeV} + 0.511 \text{ MeV} \approx 50.511 \text{ MeV}
\]

Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
pc = \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2} \approx 50.51 \text{ MeV}
\]

The wave number \(k\) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c} = \frac{50.51 \text{ MeV}}{197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{9.1014}{0.256} \approx 35.56 \text{ fm}
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\boxed{35.6}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Therefore, Im f(0) ≈ 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm.

But wait, the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, so the sum is correct. However, the units of the scattering amplitude are in femtometers (fm), which is typical for nuclear scattering. The answer should be presented in terms of inverse k, but since k is in fm⁻¹, the units work out. So the imaginary part is approximately 35.55 fm. However, let me check the calculation steps again for accuracy.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when calculating sine, the calculator must be in degree mode. Let me verify the sine values:

sin(90°) = 1, correct.

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so sin²(67°) ≈ 0.847, which matches.

sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, so sin² ≈ 0.671, correct.

sin(30°) = 0.5, squared is 0.25.

sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506, correct.

So the coefficients:

l=0: 1*1=1

l=1: 3*0.847=2.541

l=2:5*0.671=3.355

l=3:7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9*0.0506≈0.4554

Total sum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355 = 6.896; +1.75 = 8.646; +0.4554 ≈9.1014.

Yes, that's correct. Then k is calculated as 0.256 fm⁻¹. So 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm. But let me check the calculation of k again.

Wait, the electron's kinetic energy is 50 MeV. Since electrons are light, we need to use relativistic formulas. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy: E = K + mc² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. Then, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Solving for pc:

pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = sqrt(50.511² - 0.511²) ≈ sqrt(2551.46 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c. Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħc) * c. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = 50.51 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹. So that's correct.

Therefore, Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈ 35.55 fm. But let me check if the formula for the scattering amplitude is correct. The standard formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, hold on! Maybe I made a mistake here. The standard partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

But another version is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ)

These are equivalent because e^{2iδ_l} - 1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Therefore, substituting into the second formula:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1)(2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l) P_l(cosθ) ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

So both expressions are the same. Therefore, my original formula is correct. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. So the calculation is correct.

But wait, in the first formula, when you take the imaginary part of f(0), since f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, then the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sinδ_l * Im(e^{iδ_l}) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sinδ_l * sinδ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l. So that's correct.

Therefore, the sum is 9.1014, divided by k=0.256 fm⁻¹, gives 35.55 fm. However, the problem states to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The units of the scattering amplitude are in length, which is correct. But let me check if there's a factor I missed. For example, sometimes the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of the wave number k. Wait, but in the formula, the units of f(θ) should be in length. Since k is in [length]⁻¹, then 1/k is in [length], and the sum is dimensionless, so f(θ) is in [length], which is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But let me check the numerical values again. Let's compute each term precisely:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1*1=1

l=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). Using calculator: sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, so squared is ≈0.847. 3*0.847≈2.541

l=2:5 * sin²(55°). sin(55)≈0.8192, squared≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355

l=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495, squared≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554

Sum: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; 3.541 + 3.355 = 6.896; 6.896 + 1.75 = 8.646; 8.646 + 0.4554 ≈9.1014. Correct.

k=0.256 fm⁻¹. So 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈35.55 fm. So the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But the problem might expect the answer in terms of inverse MeV or something else? Wait, no. The units of the scattering amplitude are in femtometers (fm), which is correct. So the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.6 fm. But let me check if the calculation of k is correct.

Given that the electron's kinetic energy is 50 MeV. The momentum p is calculated using relativistic energy-momentum relation. For electrons, since their rest mass is 0.511 MeV, which is much smaller than 50 MeV, but not negligible. So:

E = K + mc² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV

Then, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

So, (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2551.46 - 0.261 ≈2551.2

pc ≈ sqrt(2551.2) ≈50.51 MeV

Therefore, p = 50.51 MeV/c

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħc) * c

But ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm, so:

k = (50.51 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, Im f(0) = 9.1014 / 0.256 ≈35.55 fm. Rounding to two decimal places, 35.55 fm. But maybe the answer should be given with more precise decimal places or as a fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of inverse k, but no, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has units of length. So 35.55 fm is the answer. However, let me check if there's a possible mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: in the partial wave expansion, the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², and the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0)

But here, we are just asked for Im f(0), not the total cross-section. So the formula I used is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.55 fm. But let me check with exact calculation:

Sum = 1 + 3*(sin(67))² +5*(sin(55))² +7*(sin(30))² +9*(sin(13))²

Compute each term precisely:

sin(67°): Let's use calculator:

sin(67°) = sin(67) ≈0.9205048535

sin²(67°) ≈0.8473291

3*0.8473291≈2.5419873

sin(55°)=0.8191520443, squared≈0.671

5*0.671≈3.355

sin(30°)=0.5, squared=0.25, 7*0.25=1.75

sin(13°)=0.2249510543, squared≈0.0506029, 9*0.0506029≈0.4554261

Sum:

1 + 2.5419873 =3.5419873

+3.355 =6.8969873

+1.75 =8.6469873

+0.4554261≈9.1024134

So more accurately, the sum is ≈9.1024

k=50.51 / 197.33 ≈0.2560 fm⁻¹

Thus, Im f(0)=9.1024 /0.2560≈35.556 fm

So approximately 35.56 fm. Rounding to two decimal places, 35.56 fm. But perhaps the answer is expected in units of 1/MeV or something else? Wait, no. The units of the scattering amplitude f are in femtometers (fm), since k is in fm⁻¹ and 1/k is fm. The sum is dimensionless, so f has units of fm. Therefore, the answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on the precision required, maybe round to 36 fm, but given the problem provides phase shifts to the nearest degree, perhaps two decimal places are acceptable. However, let me check if there's a possible mistake in the approach.

Wait, another point: the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons". Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so in principle, there could be spin-flip amplitudes, but in the case of unpolarized scattering and if the target is spinless or if we're considering spin-averaged amplitudes, the partial wave expansion might still hold as given. However, the standard partial wave expansion for scattering amplitude usually applies to spinless particles. For electrons, which are spin-1/2, the treatment is more complex, involving Dirac equation phase shifts. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about spin, so perhaps we are to proceed with the standard non-relativistic partial wave expansion, assuming spin effects are negligible or already accounted for. Since the problem gives phase shifts δ_l, we can proceed as if it's a spinless case.

Moreover, 50 MeV electrons are relativistic (since their kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass of 0.511 MeV), so a relativistic treatment is necessary. However, the problem provides phase shifts, so perhaps we are to use the given phase shifts regardless of the relativistic considerations beyond calculating k. The calculation of k was done relativistically, which is correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 35.6 fm.

But let me check another source to confirm the formula for the imaginary part. According to quantum mechanics textbooks, the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

Therefore, the imaginary part at θ=0 (since all P_l(1)=1) is:

Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l

Which is exactly what I used. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the final answer is approximately 35.6 fm. Depending on rounding conventions, it could be written as 35.5 fm or 35.6 fm. Given the sum was approximately 9.1024 and k=0.256 fm⁻¹, 9.1024 /0.256 = 35.55625, so 35.56 fm. If the problem expects an exact fraction, but given the phase shifts are in degrees, likely approximate. So boxed as 35.6 fm. However, let me check if the question expects units in terms of 10^-15 m or something else. 1 fm = 1e-15 m, but the answer is just in fm. So the answer is \boxed{35.6} fm. But maybe the exact value is 35.5 or 36. Wait, let me compute 9.1024 divided by 0.256:

9.1024 /0.256:

0.256 * 35 = 8.96

9.1024 -8.96=0.1424

0.1424 /0.256 ≈0.55625

So 35.55625, which is 35.56 when rounded to two decimal places, or 35.6 to one decimal. Since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees (except δ₂=55, which is 55 degrees), maybe the answer should be given to three significant figures. The sum is 9.10 (three sig figs), and k is 0.256 (three sig figs), so 9.10 /0.256 = 35.546875 ≈35.5. Wait, 9.10 /0.256:

9.10 divided by 0.256:

0.256 *35 =8.96

9.10 -8.96=0.14

0.14 /0.256=0.546875

So 35.546875, which is 35.5 when rounded to three significant figures. But 9.10 has three, 0.256 has three, so the result should have three: 35.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects more precise handling. Let me check the exact value of k:

k = 50.51 /197.33 ≈0.2560 fm⁻¹

50.51 divided by 197.33:

197.33 *0.2=39.466

50.51 -39.466=11.044

197.33*0.05=9.8665

11.044 -9.8665=1.1775

197.33*0.006=1.18398, which is a bit more than 1.1775, so approximately 0.2 +0.05 +0.006=0.256, so k≈0.2560 fm⁻¹.

Therefore, 9.1024 /0.2560=35.55625, which is 35.556 fm. So to three significant figures, 35.6 fm. Since 9.1024 is approximately 9.10 (three sig figs), and 0.2560 is three sig figs (0.256), then 9.10 /0.256=35.546875, which is 35.5 when rounded to three sig figs. Wait, but 9.10 is three sig figs, 0.256 is three, so the result is 35.5. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check:

If we take 9.10 /0.256:

9.10 ÷0.256:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 9100 /256 ≈35.546875

So 35.5 when rounded to three significant figures. But 9.10 is three, 0.256 is three, so the result should be three. Therefore, 35.5 fm. However, the initial sum was 9.1014, which is approximately 9.10, so 35.5. But in reality, the sum was 9.1024, which is 9.10, so 35.5. However, depending on strict rounding rules, 35.546875... would round to 35.5. But sometimes, 35.546875 is rounded to 35.5 when keeping three significant figures. Alternatively, if we consider that 9.1024 is more precisely 9.102 (four sig figs), and 0.2560 is four, then 9.102 /0.2560=35.5546875, which is 35.55, rounded to four sig figs. But the given data (phase shifts) have two decimal places for δ₂=55°, which is exact? Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. These are all whole numbers, so maybe two significant figures? For example, δ₂=55° is two sig figs. Then, the sum would be:

Each term:

l=0: 1*1=1 (exact)

l=1:3*sin²(67°). 67° is two sig figs, sin²(67°)=0.847, which is three sig figs. But since 67° is two sig figs, the uncertainty propagates. However, the problem doesn't specify uncertainties, so we take the given values as exact. Therefore, the sum is 9.1024, which is approximately 9.10 (three sig figs). Then k=0.2560 (three sig figs). Therefore, 9.10 /0.256=35.5. So the answer is 35.5 fm. But in the calculation, it's 35.556, which is closer to 35.6. However, considering significant figures, since the given phase shifts are in whole degrees (two sig figs for 67°, 55°, etc.), except 90° is exact (as a right angle), but maybe all are considered exact. If the phase shifts are exact, then the sum is exact, and k is calculated from 50 MeV (two sig figs? 50 has two, 50.0 would be three). The problem states 50 MeV, which is two sig figs. Then k=0.256 (three sig figs) because 50/197.33 is approx 0.253, but with precise calculation, it's 0.256. Wait, 50 MeV is two sig figs, so k=0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). Then Im f(0)=9.1 /0.26≈35. So with two sig figs, 35 fm. But this is conflicting.

Wait, the initial energy is 50 MeV, which is two significant figures. However, when calculating k, we used 50.511 MeV for E, but the problem states 50 MeV. If we strictly take 50 MeV as two sig figs, then E=50 MeV (K=50 MeV), rest mass=0.511 MeV. Then, E_total=50.511 MeV. But if K is 50 MeV (two sig figs), then E_total=50.5 MeV (three sig figs). Then, pc= sqrt( (50.5)^2 - (0.511)^2 )≈sqrt(2550.25 -0.261)=sqrt(2549.99)≈50.499 MeV. So pc≈50.5 MeV, then k=50.5 /197.33≈0.256 fm⁻¹ (three sig figs). So if the problem's 50 MeV is two sig figs, then k≈0.26 fm⁻¹ (two sig figs). Then Im f(0)=9.1 /0.26≈35. So the answer would be 35 fm with two sig figs. However, the phase shifts are given as integers, which are exact, so maybe we should treat them as exact, and the energy 50 MeV as exact. Then, the answer is 35.56 fm, which can be written as 35.6 fm. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the answer is expected to be approximately 36 fm. But given the precise calculation gives 35.56, which is closer to 35.6. However, in some contexts, scattering amplitudes can be large, but 35 fm seems reasonable.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. According to Landau and Lifshitz Quantum Mechanics, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) would be:

Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) (1 - cos2δ_l )

But since e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, so the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l. Therefore, Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) * 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sinδ_l cosδ_l. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify:

If f(θ) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) Re(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ?

Wait, no. Let's compute Im f(0):

f(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1)

Since P_l(1)=1.

Therefore, f(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(cos2δ_l + i sin2δ_l -1 )

= (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)( -2 sin²δ_l + i sin2δ_l )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l

But wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no:

Wait, f(0) = (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

= (1/2ik) Σ (2l +1)(cos2δ_l -1 + i sin2δ_l )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im f(0) = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l

But previously, using the other form of the scattering amplitude:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

Then, Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

But according to the two different expressions, these should be equal. Therefore:

(1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/2k) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l

But this would imply that Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (1/2) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l

But this is only true if sin²δ_l = (1/2) sin2δ_l, which implies sinδ_l = cosδ_l, i.e., δ_l=45°, which is not the case here. Therefore, there must be a mistake.

Wait, this suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made an error in the derivation. Let me re-examine the two expressions for f(θ):

First expression:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

Second expression:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

These should be equivalent. Let's check:

Expand the second expression:

(1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (1/(2ik)) (e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) )

= (1/(2ik)) e^{iδ_l} (2i sinδ_l )

= (1/k) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l

Therefore, the two expressions are the same. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) should be the same in both formulations.

But when we compute Im f(0) using the first expression:

Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Using the second expression:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (cos2δ_l + i sin2δ_l -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) ( -2 sin²δ_l + i sin2δ_l )

Therefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ -2 Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l + i Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l ]

Separating into real and imaginary parts:

f(0) = [ (1/(2ik)) (-2 Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l ) ] + [ (1/(2ik)) (i Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: (-2/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l = (-1/(ik)) Σ ... = (i/k) Σ ... because -1/i = i.

Second term: (i/(2ik)) Σ ... = (1/(2k)) Σ ...

Therefore, f(0) = (i/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l + (1/(2k)) Σ (2l +1) sin2δ_l

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of the first term (since it's multiplied by i) plus the imaginary part of the second term. But the second term is real, so its imaginary part is zero. Therefore:

Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Which matches the first derivation. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct. The confusion arose from incorrectly separating the terms, but ultimately, the imaginary part is indeed (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l.

Therefore, the answer remains approximately 35.6 fm. Given that the problem provides phase shifts as whole degrees, and the energy as 50 MeV (possibly two sig figs), but the calculation yields 35.56 fm, which rounds to 35.6 fm. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{35.6} femtometers.
