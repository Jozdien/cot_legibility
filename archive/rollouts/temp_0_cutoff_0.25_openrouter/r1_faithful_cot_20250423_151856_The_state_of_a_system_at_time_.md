To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we start by noting the given state vector \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and the matrix operator \( P \):

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we verify that 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \) by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic polynomial is found to be \( -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \), giving eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

Next, we find the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \). Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we get the system of equations:
1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \)

This yields \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_1 = -v_3 \). The eigenvector is \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \), which normalizes to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

The given state vector \( \psi \) is not normalized. Its norm is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state vector is \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

The inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector is calculated as:
\[
\left\langle \mathbf{v} \middle| \psi_{\text{normalized}} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:
\[
\left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

Okay, so I need to calculate the probability that measuring the observable P will give 0 at time t. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me start by recalling how to find probabilities in quantum mechanics. 

First, I remember that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, if I can find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then I can project the state vector onto those eigenvectors and compute the probability.

But wait, before that, maybe I should check if 0 is actually an eigenvalue of P. If it's not, then the probability would be zero. Let me verify that. To find the eigenvalues of P, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me write down the matrix P first.

P is:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

So, the matrix looks symmetric, which makes sense since observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and real symmetric matrices are Hermitian. So, eigenvalues should be real. Let me compute the determinant of P - λI.

The matrix P - λI is:
[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

To compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix, I can use the rule for 3x3 determinants. The determinant is:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, let me do this step by step. The determinant is calculated as:

= -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) [ -λ/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/2

Third term is 0.

So overall determinant is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2). Then the second term is + λ/2. So total determinant is -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ. So determinant equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

So, -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0. Therefore, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. Therefore, the probability is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state vector onto all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the matrix is Hermitian, eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and the eigenvectors can form an orthonormal basis.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvectors for λ = 0. Let's solve (P - 0*I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0. So, the system of equations is:

First row: (1/√2)v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third row: (1/√2)v2 = 0

From the first and third equations, we get v2 = 0. Then, from the second equation, (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (a, 0, -a), where a is a real number. To make it a unit vector, we can normalize it. The norm is sqrt(a² + 0 + a²) = sqrt(2a²) = |a|√2. So, choosing a = 1/√2, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, the eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify by applying P to this eigenvector. Let's compute P*(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

First component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) + 0 - 1/2 = 0

Third component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

So, yes, that works. So, the eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Therefore, the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector is the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector. Then, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this projection.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it just says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, perhaps we need to normalize it first before computing the probability. Because probabilities are calculated with respect to the normalized state.

Wait, but in some contexts, the state is given as a vector, and you have to assume it's already normalized. But here, the norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized vector would be ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). But the problem doesn't specify whether the given vector is normalized. Hmm. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are required to be normalized because the total probability must be 1. So, if the problem gives a non-normalized vector, perhaps we need to normalize it first. But maybe the problem is just giving the vector as is, and we can proceed with the given vector, but then the probability would be calculated as |<eigenvector|state>|^2 divided by the norm squared of the state. Wait, no. Let me think.

If the state is given as a vector, say |ψ>, then the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is |<v|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>, where |v> is the eigenvector. Because if the vector isn't normalized, you have to account for that. But in many cases, the state is given as a normalized vector. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't mention normalization. So, perhaps we need to assume that this is the actual state vector, not necessarily normalized. Therefore, to compute the probability, we need to compute |<v|ψ>|^2 divided by <ψ|ψ>.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to proceed without normalizing, but that would be incorrect. Because probabilities must add up to 1. So, if the vector isn't normalized, the probabilities would not sum to 1. Therefore, I think we need to normalize the state vector first.

So, first step: normalize the state vector. The given vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the normalized vector is ψ_normalized = (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Now, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is v = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

So, the inner product <v | ψ_normalized> is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = [ -1/(√2√6) - 1/(√2√6) ] = [ -2/(√12) ] = -2/(2√3) ) = -1/√3.

Therefore, the absolute value squared is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me compute the inner product step by step.

v is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

ψ_normalized is [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]^T.

So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6)

First term: -1/(√2√6) = -1/√12 = -1/(2√3)

Third term: -1/(√2√6) = -1/√12 = -1/(2√3)

Adding them: -1/(2√3) -1/(2√3) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3

So, the inner product is -1/√3, and the square is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. So, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/3.

But let me just verify once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me confirm the eigenvector for λ=0 again. When solving Pv = 0, we had:

First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, the eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Choosing v1 = 1, we get (1, 0, -1). Then, normalized, it's (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). That's correct. So, the eigenvector is correct.

Then, the inner product with the normalized state vector is indeed -1/√3, so the probability is 1/3. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.

But wait, let me check if there's another eigenvector for λ=0. Since the matrix is 3x3 and we have eigenvalues 1, -1, 0, each with multiplicity 1? Let me check the determinant equation again. The characteristic equation was λ(λ² - 1) = 0, so roots at 0, 1, -1. So, each eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 1, so geometric multiplicity should also be 1 since the matrix is diagonalizable (as it's Hermitian). Therefore, there is only one eigenvector (up to scaling) for λ=0. Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the projection is only onto that single eigenvector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer is 1/3. So, boxed, it's \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

So, -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0. T

I need to determine the probability of obtaining 0 when measuring the observable P at time t. The system state is represented by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), and P is a 3×3 matrix. To find probabilities in quantum mechanics, I must remember that the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue equals the squared absolute value of the state vector's projection onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Before proceeding, I should verify if 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If not, the probability would be zero. To identify the eigenvalues of P, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me examine the matrix P first.

P is represented as:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

The matrix is symmetric, which is consistent with observables being represented by Hermitian operators, and real symmetric matrices are Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be real. Now I'll calculate the determinant of P - λI.

The matrix P - λI is:
[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

To find the determinant of this 3×3 matrix, I'll apply the standard formula for 3×3 determinants:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [(1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0)] + 0 * [...]

Let me calculate this step by step:

First term: -λ[λ² - (1/2)] = -λ³ + (λ/2)
Second term: -(1/√2)[(-λ/√2) - 0] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = λ/2
Third term: 0

So the complete determinant equals:
-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:
-λ³ + λ = 0
λ(-λ² + 1) = 0
λ(λ² - 1) = 0

I need to determine the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield a result of 0. The system's state is represented by a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operator P is a 3x3 matrix.

The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, if I can identify the eigenvectors of P associated with the eigenvalue 0, I can project the state vector onto these eigenvectors to calculate the probability.

However, before proceeding, I should verify whether 0 is actually an eigenvalue of P. If 0 isn’t an eigenvalue, the probability would be zero. To identify the eigenvalues of P, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me first write down the matrix P.

Matrix P is:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Let me do this step by step. The determinant becomes:

= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ -λ/√2 ] + 0 [...]

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ]

Second term: - (1/√2) [ -λ/√2 ] = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/2

The third term is 0.

Overall, the determinant is:

-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Let me ensure that’s correct. The first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2). The second term gives + λ/2. Therefore, the total determinant is -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2, resulting in -λ³ + λ. Thus, the determinant equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Therefore, -λ³ + λ = 0 implies λ(-λ² + 1) = 0, leading to λ(λ² - 1) = 0.

So, the system of equations is:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0\n\nSecond row: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v3 = -v1.

If v1 is arbitrary, then the eigenvector is a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So, the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1? Wait, but the characteristic equation had roots 0, 1, -1, each with multiplicity 1. So, the algebraic multiplicity of 0 is 1, so the geometric multiplicity is also 1. Therefore, there is only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) for λ=0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So, the normalized eigenvector would be (1, 0, -1) divided by its norm. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2).

So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the state vector isn\'t normalized. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, i.e., their norm should be 1. Let me check the norm of the given state vector.\n\nThe given state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. So, in order to compute probabilities, I need to normalize it first.\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nTherefore, the inner product <φ|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√2√6) + 0 + (-1)/(√2√6) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **Verify Eigenvalue 0**: The matrix \( P \) is given by:
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\), we find the eigenvalues to be 0, 1, and -1. Thus, 0 is an eigenvalue.

2. **Find Eigenvector for Eigenvalue 0**: Solving \((P - 0I)v = 0\), we get the system of equations:
   - \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0\)
   - \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0 \implies v_1 + v_3 = 0 \implies v_3 = -v_1\)
   - \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0\)

   The eigenvector is of the form \((v_1, 0, -v_1)\). Choosing \(v_1 = 1\), the eigenvector is \((1, 0, -1)\). Normalizing this, we get \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)\).

3. **Normalize the State Vector**: The given state vector is \((-1, 2, 1)\). Its norm is \(\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}\). The normalized state vector is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)\).

4. **Calculate Inner Product**: The inner product of the normalized eigenvector \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)\) with the normalized state vector \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)\) is:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \bigg| \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

5. **Compute Probability**: The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:
   \[
   \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Herefore, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, yes, 0 is an eigenvalue. Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state vector onto all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. But first, I need to find the eigenvectors for λ = 0.

To find the eigenvectors for λ = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0. So, the system of equations is:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v3 = -v1. So, they are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1). Wait, but let me check. If v1 is arbitrary, then the eigenvector is a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So, the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1? Wait, but the characteristic equation had roots 0, 1, -1, each with multiplicity 1. So, the algebraic multiplicity of 0 is 1, so the geometric multiplicity is also 1. Therefore, there is only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples) for λ=0.

Therefore, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So, the normalized eigenvector would be (1, 0, -1) divided by its norm. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Therefore, to find the probability, I need to compute the inner product of the state vector with this eigenvector, then take the square of the absolute value.

But wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me write that as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
         [  2 ]
         [  1 ]

The eigenvector for 0 is |φ> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

So, the inner product <φ|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2.

Then, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

Wait, but probabilities can't be greater than 1. So, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check the inner product again. The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). The eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2. So, the magnitude squared is indeed 2. But the total probability can't be 2. That's impossible. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe the state vector isn't normalized. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, i.e., their norm should be 1. Let me check the norm of the given state vector.

The given state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. So, in order to compute probabilities, I need to normalize it first.

So, the normalized state vector is (1/√6)*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Therefore, the inner product <φ|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√2√6) + 0 + (-1)/(√2√6) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3.

Therefore, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So, the probability is 1/3. That makes sense because probabilities should be between 0 and 1.

Wait, but let me confirm again. Let me go through the steps again to make sure.

1. The given state is [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, normalized state is 1/sqrt(6) [-1, 2, 1].

2. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

3. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3))

Third term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = same as first term, so total is (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3)

Therefore, the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), magnitude squared is 1/3. So, probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/3.

But let me check if there's another eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. Wait, earlier when solving for eigenvectors, we found that the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So, only one eigenvector. Therefore, the probability is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of the eigenvector. Let me check again.

Given that for λ=0, the equations are:

First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 = -v3

Third equation: same as first, v2 = 0

Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. So, normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). That seems correct.

Therefore, the inner product calculation is correct. So, the probability is 1/3.

But let me cross-verify by another method. Another way to compute the probability is to express the state vector as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P, and then the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

But since P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, and corresponding eigenvectors, we can decompose the state vector into these eigenvectors.

But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since we found the eigenvector for 0, and the probability is 1/3, perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the question didn't specify that the state is normalized, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. However, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't specify if it's normalized. So, perhaps we need to normalize it first, which we did, leading to 1/3.

Alternatively, if we don't normalize the state, the probability would be |<φ|ψ>|² / |<ψ|ψ>|, but actually, the formula is |<φ|ψ>|² divided by |<ψ|ψ>| if the state isn't normalized. Wait, no. The probability is given by |<φ|ψ_normalized>|², where ψ_normalized is ψ divided by its norm. So, if ψ is not normalized, you have to normalize it first. So, the answer is indeed 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But let me check once more. Let's compute the inner product without normalizing the state and then divide by the norm squared.

The inner product of the eigenvector (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) with the state (-1, 2, 1) is (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). The norm squared of the state is 6. So, the probability is | -sqrt(2) |² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3. So, same result. Therefore, whether you normalize the state first or account for the norm in the probability, you get 1/3. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring 0 is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the probability of obtaining 0 when measuring the observable \( P \) at time \( t \), we start by verifying if 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \). The matrix \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

We solve the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{pmatrix} = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0
\]

This gives eigenvalues \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). The eigenvalue 0 is valid. Next, we find the eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda = 0\) by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \):

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0 \implies v_1 = -v_3
\end{cases}
\]

The eigenvector is \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 0 \\ -a \end{pmatrix}\). Normalizing, we get \(\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\).

The system's state is given as \(\mathbf{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The norm of \(\mathbf{\psi}\) is \(\sqrt{6}\), so the normalized state is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

The inner product of the eigenvector and the state is:

\[
\left\langle \mathbf{v} \middle| \mathbf{\psi} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}
\]

The absolute value squared is \( (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \). The probability is:

\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1

Therefore, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0 and then compute the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector.

To find the eigenvector for λ = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0. Let's write out the equations:

First row: (0)v₁ + (1/√2)v₂ + (0)v₃ = 0 → (1/√2)v₂ = 0 → v₂ = 0
Second row: (1/√2)v₁ + (0)v₂ + (1/√2)v₃ = 0 → (1/√2)(v₁ + v₃) = 0 → v₁ + v₃ = 0
Third row: (0)v₁ + (1/√2)v₂ + (0)v₃ = 0 → (1/√2)v₂ = 0 → v₂ = 0

So from the first and third equations, v₂ = 0. From the second equation, v₁ = -v₃. Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ = 0 are of the form (a, 0, -a) where a is a complex number. To make it a unit vector, we can normalize it.

The norm of (a, 0, -a) is sqrt(|a|² + 0 + |a|²) = sqrt(2|a|²) = |a|√2. To normalize, set |a|√2 = 1, so |a| = 1/√2. Choosing a real and positive for simplicity, a = 1/√2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, the system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, so perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, the problem states "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." It doesn't specify if it's normalized. Therefore, I need to normalize it first before computing probabilities.

So first, normalize the state vector. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state vector is ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ). But perhaps the problem assumes the state is already normalized? Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", but in quantum mechanics, states are represented by vectors in Hilbert space, which are typically normalized. However, sometimes non-normalized vectors are given, and you have to check. Since the norm here is sqrt(6), which is not 1, so we need to normalize it. Therefore, the actual state vector is ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ). But let me confirm if that's necessary. The probability is the square of the projection of the state onto the eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state. Wait, actually, the formula is |<eigenvector|state>|² divided by the norm squared of the state if the state isn't normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. If the problem gives a non-normalized vector, perhaps it's a typo, or perhaps we need to proceed with the given vector. Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...", so maybe it's already normalized? Let me check again. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state is not normalized. Therefore, to compute probabilities, we need to either normalize the state first or adjust the probability formula accordingly.

The probability is given by |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>, where |v> is the eigenvector (normalized) and |ψ> is the state. Since the eigenvector is already normalized, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² divided by <ψ|ψ>. Alternatively, if we first normalize |ψ>, then the probability is |<v|ψ_normalized>|². Let me do both ways to check.

First, let's compute <v|ψ> where |v> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) and |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). The inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2. Then |<v|ψ>|² is (√2)² = 2. The norm squared of |ψ> is 6, so the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if we normalize |ψ> first: |ψ_normalized> = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). Then <v|ψ_normalized> is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3. The absolute value squared is (1/√3)² = 1/3. So the probability is 1/3. Either way, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/3. Let me verify once again.

Eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). The inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. The square of the absolute value is (√2)^2 = 2. The norm squared of the state is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if the state was supposed to be normalized, but given as (-1, 2, 1), then the user might have made a mistake, but according to the problem statement, it's given as such, so we have to proceed with the given vector. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring 0 is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.
