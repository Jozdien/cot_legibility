To determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point:

**1. After Dilution:**
- Initial volume of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) at 0.05 M.
- Diluted with 20.00 cm³ water, total volume = 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).
- New concentration: \( C = \frac{0.05 \times 0.020}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

**2. 25% Titration:**
- Moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).
- Equivalence point requires 0.001 mol NaOH. 25% of this is \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).
- Volume of 0.1 M NaOH: \( \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.50 \, \text{cm³} \).
- **Reaction:**  
  Remaining CH₃COOH: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Formed CH₃COO⁻: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Total volume: \( 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
  Concentrations:  
  \( [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M} \),  
  \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M} \).  
- **Henderson-Hasselbalch:**  
  \( \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right) \).  
  \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \).  
  \( \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25 \).

**3. Equivalence Point:**
- All CH₃COOH neutralized to CH₃COO⁻: \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total volume: \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.050 \, \text{L} \).  
- \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).  
- **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**  
  \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).  
  \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \).  
  \( \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48 \).  
  \( \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52 \).

**Final Answers:**  
- **At 25% Titration:** pH ≈ **4.25**  
- **At Equivalence Point:** pH ≈ **8.52**

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when we titrate diluted acetic acid with NaOH. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³. Since dilution affects concentration, I should calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³, and V2 is 40.00 cm³. So, solving for M2: (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M2(40.00 cm³). That gives M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's tackle the 25% titration first. 25% titration means we've added 25% of the amount of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point first.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid initially are concentration * volume. The volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Therefore, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10.00 cm³ of NaOH. Then, 25% titration would be 25% of 10.00 cm³, which is 2.50 cm³ of NaOH.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na⁺ + H2O

So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate ion (CH3COO⁻).

Initially, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of CH3COO⁻ produced = 0.00025 moles.

This is a buffer solution now, with both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻). The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let me compute that. 

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so pKa ≈ 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. Let's say approximately 4.73.

Then, [A⁻] is moles of CH3COO⁻ divided by total volume, and [HA] is moles of CH3COOH divided by total volume. The total volume after adding NaOH is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M

Then, log([A⁻]/[HA]) = log(0.005882 / 0.01765) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771

Therefore, pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2529. So approximately 4.25.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Maybe I should be more precise with the pKa. Let's calculate pKa exactly. Ka is 1.85x10^-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator: log(1.85) = 0.2672, so pKa = 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. So 4.7328. Then, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 1/3 is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557. So approximately 4.26. Let's round to two decimal places, so pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence point, we've added 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's verify the moles: 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles, which matches the moles of acetic acid, so that's correct.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ion (CH3COO⁻). The total volume is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻

To find the pH, we need to calculate the Kb for acetate and then determine the concentration of OH⁻.

Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1e-14. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]

Let’s let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Then:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x << 0.02)

So, x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.5 M. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5. Since sqrt(1.081) ≈ 1.04, so x ≈ 1.04e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) ≈ 1.04 * 1e-5.5. But 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Therefore, [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48. Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11) more accurately. Let's compute 1.081e-11. The square root of 1.081 is approximately 1.0395, and the square root of 1e-11 is 1e-5.5, which is 3.1623e-6. So multiplying them: 1.0395 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.287e-6. So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.287e-6. Then pOH = -log10(3.287e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.287e-6) = log(3.287) + log(1e-6) ≈ 0.5169 + (-6) = -5.4831. Therefore, pOH = 5.4831, so pH = 14 - 5.4831 ≈ 8.5169. So approximately 8.52.

But wait, maybe I should use a more precise calculation without the approximation. Let's see. The assumption was that x << 0.02. Let's check if 3.29e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. 0.02 is 2e-2, which is much larger than 3.29e-6, so the approximation holds. So pH ≈ 8.52 at equivalence point.

Alternatively, maybe using the exact expression. Let's try that. The equation is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). If we don't approximate, then:

x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0. Solving quadratic equation:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² + 4 * 1 * 0.02 Kb)] / 2

But since Kb is very small, the term Kb² is negligible compared to 4*0.02*Kb. So sqrt(4*0.02*Kb) = sqrt(0.08*Kb). Let's compute that:

sqrt(0.08 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6. Then x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ 6.576e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6, which is the same as before. So the approximation is valid, and pH is approximately 8.52.

But let me check another way. Maybe using the formula for the pH of a weak base:

pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)

Where pKb = -log(Kb) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267. Then pOH = 0.5*(9.267 - log(0.02)). Log(0.02) = -1.69897. So pOH = 0.5*(9.267 +1.69897) = 0.5*(10.96597) ≈ 5.483, so pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, which matches the previous result. So pH ≈ 8.52 at equivalence.

Therefore, the answers are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at equivalence.

Wait, but let me check if I considered dilution correctly in the buffer solution for 25% titration. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles. Then adding 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.00025 moles of NaOH. The reaction consumes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving 0.00075 moles, and produces 0.00025 moles of acetate. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So concentrations are 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M for acetic acid, and 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M for acetate. Then the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477, so pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So 4.25 or 4.25. Maybe the answer expects two decimal places, so 4.25 and 8.52.

But let me check if the initial dilution was done correctly. Original solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted to 40.00 cm³, so concentration is 0.025 M. Then titrated with NaOH. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that when you dilute the acetic acid, the degree of dissociation changes, but since we are adding a strong base later, maybe the initial pH after dilution isn't required, but in the buffer calculation, the dilution is already considered. Wait, but when we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, but when we add NaOH, the total volume increases. So the calculations I did are correct.

Another check: At equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. Then Kb is 5.4e-10, leading to [OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(0.02*Kb) = sqrt(0.02*5.4e-10) = sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.5, which is 3.28e-6, so pOH ≈ 5.48, pH ≈ 8.52. Correct.

So I think the answers are pH ≈ 4.25 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at equivalence.

Okay, so I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when we titrate diluted acetic acid with NaOH. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³, and V2 is 40.00 cm³. So, solving for M2: (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M2(40.00 cm³). That gives M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's tackle the 25% titration first. 25% titration means we've added 25% of the amount of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point first.

Therefore, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10.00 cm³ of NaOH. Then, 25% titration would be 25% of 10.00 cm³, which is 2.50 cm³ of NaOH.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na⁺ + H2O

So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate ion (CH3COO⁻).

Initially, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of CH3COO⁻ produced = 0.00025 moles.

I need to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. Let me work through this systematically.

Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. To find the new concentration after dilution, I'll use the dilution equation M1V1 = M2V2.

With M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 20.00 cm³, and V2 = 40.00 cm³, I can solve for M2: (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M2(40.00 cm³). This gives M2 = (0.05 × 20)/40 = 0.025 M, which is our diluted acetic acid concentration.

For the titration with 0.1 M NaOH, I first need to determine how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid.

The moles of acetic acid are calculated as concentration × volume: 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Therefore, 0.001 moles of NaOH are needed for the equivalence point.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles/concentration = 0.001/0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs at 10.00 cm³ of NaOH.

For 25% titration, we need 25% of 10.00 cm³, which is 2.50 cm³ of NaOH.

At this point, we've added 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which equals 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and NaOH is:
CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻).

Starting with 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH and adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, we're left with 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles of CH₃COOH, while producing 0.00025 moles of CH₃COO⁻.

This now forms a buffer solution containing both

# OpenAI completion

Sure, here's a paraphrased version of the text:

Alright, I need to determine the pH at both 25% titration and the equivalence point when titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. I'll break down the process step by step.

Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we then dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Since dilution alters concentration, I need to recalculate the concentration of acetic acid post-dilution.

Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, where M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³, and V2 is 40.00 cm³, I solve for M2: (0.05 M)(20.00 cm³) = M2(40.00 cm³). This gives M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M, indicating the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, I will titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's first focus on the 25% titration point. At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH necessary for the equivalence point has been added. So, first, I need to calculate the NaOH volume needed at the equivalence point.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH are equal to the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as concentration times volume. After dilution, the volume is 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 L. Thus, the moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Therefore, the moles of NaOH required at the equivalence point = 0.001 moles. With NaOH concentration at 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.

Hence, the equivalence point occurs at 10.00 cm³ of NaOH. Consequently, 25% titration corresponds to 25% of 10.00 cm³, which equals 2.50 cm³ of NaOH.

At this 25% titration, we've added 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Now, let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na⁺ + H2O

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, creating a mole of acetate ion (CH3COO⁻).

Initially, the moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 moles. The moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 moles. Thus, the moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Simultaneously, the moles of CH3COO⁻ produced = 0.00025 moles.

This results in a buffer solution with both the components ...

So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let me compute that. \n\nLog(1.85x10^-5) is log(1.85) + log(10^-5) ≈ 0.2672 - 5 = -4.7328. So pKa ≈ 4.7328.\n\nThen, [A⁻] is moles of acetate divided by total volume, and [HA] is moles of acetic acid divided by total volume. The total volume after adding NaOH is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M\n\n[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M\n\nThen log([A⁻]/[HA]) = log(0.005882 / 0.01765) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771\n\nTherefore, pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557. So approximately 4.26. Let me check if that makes sense. Since we're at 25% titration, the ratio is 1:3 (A⁻:HA), so the log(1/3) is negative, which lowers the pH below pKa. That seems correct. So pH around 4.26.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.001 moles, which requires 10.00 cm³ as calculated earlier. The total volume at equivalence point is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ion (CH3COO⁻). The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions. The pH will be greater than 7.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw at 25°C is 1x10^-14. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n\nThe Kb expression is:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n\nLet’s let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH⁻] = x, and [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be negligible compared to 0.02).\n\nSo, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5\n\nTherefore, [OH⁻] ≈ 1.04e-5 M\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983\n\npH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11). Let's see, sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.039, sqrt(10^-11) is 10^-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. Wait, but 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. The square root of that is sqrt(1.081) x sqrt(10^-11). sqrt(1.081) is approximately 1.0396, and sqrt(10^-11) is 10^(-11/2) = 10^-5.5 ≈ 3.1623e-6. So multiplying them gives 1.0396 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.287e-6. So x ≈ 3.287e-6. Then [OH⁻] is 3.287e-6, so pOH = -log(3.287e-6) ≈ 5.483. Then pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. Hmm, so my previous calculation was wrong. Let me check where I messed up.\n\nWait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Then Kb = x² / 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. Therefore, [OH⁻] = 3.288e-6, pOH = log(1/[OH⁻]) = log(1/3.288e-6) = log(3.041e5) ≈ 5.483. So pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. So approximately 8.52. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5, which was incorrect. So the correct pH at equivalence point is around 8.52. Let me verify this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the pH of a weak base:\n\npOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)\n\nBut pKb = -log(Kb) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267\n\nThen pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - log(0.02))\n\nlog(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + (-2) ≈ 0.3010 - 2 = -1.699\n\nSo pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 1/2 (10.966) ≈ 5.483\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, which matches the previous result. So pH ≈ 8.52.\n\nBut let me check if the approximation [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 is valid. The value of x is 3.288e-6, which is indeed much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288, which is negligible compared to 0.02). So the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but let me check with exact calculation without approximation. Let's set up the equation:\n\nKb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10\n\nAssuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, but let's solve it exactly.\n\nx² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)\n\nx² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt((5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1.081e-11)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.922e-19\n\n4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11\n\nSo sqrt(2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) since 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.922e-19.\n\nsqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6\n\nTherefore, x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6, which is the same as before. So the approximation was valid. So pH is indeed approximately 8.52.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nAt 25% titration, pH ≈ 4.26\n\nAt equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52\n\nBut let me check the exact value for the 25% titration. Let me recalculate the ratio.\n\nMoles of A⁻ = 0.00025, moles of HA = 0.00075. Total volume 42.5 cm³. So [A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.01765 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. pKa is 4.7328. So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557, which is approximately 4.26. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me use more precise values. Let's compute pKa more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute log(1.85):\n\nLog(1.85) = log(1 + 0.85) ≈ 0.2672 (since log(1.8) ≈ 0.2553, log(1.85) is a bit higher). Let me use calculator-like steps.\n\nUsing natural logarithm: ln(1.85) ≈ 0.6151, then log(1.85) = 0.6151 / ln(10) ≈ 0.6151 / 2.3026 ≈ 0.2671. So pKa ≈ 4.7329.\n\nThen, log(0.3333) is log(1/3) = -log(3) ≈ -0.4771. So pH = 4.7329 - 0.4771 = 4.2558. So pH ≈ 4.26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, when calculating the dilution, is the total volume correctly 40.00 cm³? Yes, 20 + 20 = 40. Then, when adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH, total volume is 42.50 cm³. Correct.\n\nAnother thing: when calculating the concentration of acetate and acetic acid after reaction, since the solution is diluted, but we accounted for that by dividing by 0.0425 L. So that's correct.\n\nAt equivalence point, the solution is 50.00 cm³, 0.05 L, with 0.001 moles of acetate. Correct. Then using Kb to find pH. All steps seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the answers should be approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at equivalence point.\n\nBut let me check standard problems to see if these values make sense. For example, when titrating a weak acid with a strong base, the pH at half-equivalence is equal to pKa. Here, 25% titration is before half-equivalence (which would be at 50% titration). So the pH should be lower than pKa, which matches our result of 4.26 vs pKa ~4.73. At equivalence, since acetate is a weak base, pH should be basic, around 8-9, which 8.52 fits.\n\nTherefore, I think these are the correct values.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is \\boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \\boxed{8.52}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445353, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3623, prompt_tokens=723, total_tokens=4346, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

First, we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid is calculated using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \):

\[
M_2 = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}
\]

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of acetic acid in 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}
\]

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH required are 0.001 moles, which corresponds to:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

For 25% titration, 25% of 10.00 cm³ NaOH (2.50 cm³) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}
\]

This results in a buffer solution with:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}
\]

The total volume is 42.50 cm³. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.7328
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
\log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.01765}\right) \approx -0.4771
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.7328 - 0.4771 \approx 4.26
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ion. The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the hydrolysis of acetate:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]
\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52
\]

### Final Answer

The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

acetic acid and its conjugate base present. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let me compute that. 

Log(1.85x10^-5) is log(1.85) + log(10^-5) ≈ 0.2672 - 5 = -4.7328. So pKa ≈ 4.7328.

Then, [A⁻] is moles of acetate divided by total volume, and [HA] is moles of acetic acid divided by total volume. The total volume after adding NaOH is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M

Then log([A⁻]/[HA]) = log(0.005882 / 0.01765) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771

Therefore, pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557. So approximately 4.26. Let me check if that makes sense. Since we're at 25% titration, the ratio is 1:3 (A⁻:HA), so the log(1/3) is negative, which lowers the pH below pKa. That seems correct. So pH around 4.26.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.001 moles, which requires 10.00 cm³ as calculated earlier. The total volume at equivalence point is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ion (CH3COO⁻). The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions. The pH will be greater than 7.

The Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw at 25°C is 1x10^-14. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]

Let’s let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH⁻] = x, and [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be negligible compared to 0.02).

So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10

Solving for x:

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5

Therefore, [OH⁻] ≈ 1.04e-5 M

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983

pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11). Let's see, sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.039, sqrt(10^-11) is 10^-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. Wait, but 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. The square root of that is sqrt(1.081) x sqrt(10^-11). sqrt(1.081) is approximately 1.0396, and sqrt(10^-11) is 10^(-11/2) = 10^-5.5 ≈ 3.1623e-6. So multiplying them gives 1.0396 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.287e-6. So x ≈ 3.287e-6. Then [OH⁻] is 3.287e-6, so pOH = -log(3.287e-6) ≈ 5.483. Then pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. Hmm, so my previous calculation was wrong. Let me check where I messed up.

Wait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Then Kb = x² / 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. Therefore, [OH⁻] = 3.288e-6, pOH = log(1/[OH⁻]) = log(1/3.288e-6) = log(3.041e5) ≈ 5.483. So pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. So approximately 8.52. 

Wait, but earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5, which was incorrect. So the correct pH at equivalence point is around 8.52. Let me verify this with another approach.

Alternatively, using the formula for the pH of a weak base:

pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)

But pKb = -log(Kb) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267

Then pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - log(0.02))

log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + (-2) ≈ 0.3010 - 2 = -1.699

So pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 1/2 (10.966) ≈ 5.483

Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, which matches the previous result. So pH ≈ 8.52.

But let me check if the approximation [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 is valid. The value of x is 3.288e-6, which is indeed much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288, which is negligible compared to 0.02). So the approximation holds.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but let me check with exact calculation without approximation. Let's set up the equation:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, but let's solve it exactly.

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt((5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1.081e-11)] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.922e-19

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11

So sqrt(2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) since 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.922e-19.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6

Therefore, x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6, which is the same as before. So the approximation was valid. So pH is indeed approximately 8.52.

So summarizing:

At 25% titration, pH ≈ 4.26

At equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52

But let me check the exact value for the 25% titration. Let me recalculate the ratio.

Moles of A⁻ = 0.00025, moles of HA = 0.00075. Total volume 42.5 cm³. So [A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.01765 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. pKa is 4.7328. So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557, which is approximately 4.26. That seems correct.

But let me use more precise values. Let's compute pKa more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute log(1.85):

Log(1.85) = log(1 + 0.85) ≈ 0.2672 (since log(1.8) ≈ 0.2553, log(1.85) is a bit higher). Let me use calculator-like steps.

Using natural logarithm: ln(1.85) ≈ 0.6151, then log(1.85) = 0.6151 / ln(10) ≈ 0.6151 / 2.3026 ≈ 0.2671. So pKa ≈ 4.7329.

Then, log(0.3333) is log(1/3) = -log(3) ≈ -0.4771. So pH = 4.7329 - 0.4771 = 4.2558. So pH ≈ 4.26.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, when calculating the dilution, is the total volume correctly 40.00 cm³? Yes, 20 + 20 = 40. Then, when adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH, total volume is 42.50 cm³. Correct.

Another thing: when calculating the concentration of acetate and acetic acid after reaction, since the solution is diluted, but we accounted for that by dividing by 0.0425 L. So that's correct.

At equivalence point, the solution is 50.00 cm³, 0.05 L, with 0.001 moles of acetate. Correct. Then using Kb to find pH. All steps seem correct.

Therefore, the answers should be approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at equivalence point.

But let me check standard problems to see if these values make sense. For example, when titrating a weak acid with a strong base, the pH at half-equivalence is equal to pKa. Here, 25% titration is before half-equivalence (which would be at 50% titration). So the pH should be lower than pKa, which matches our result of 4.26 vs pKa ~4.73. At equivalence, since acetate is a weak base, pH should be basic, around 8-9, which 8.52 fits.

Therefore, I think these are the correct values.

**Final Answer**

The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

First, calculate pKa from the given Ka of 1.85×10⁻⁵. pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.735.

The concentrations of A⁻ and HA are in the same total volume (40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L).

[A⁻] = 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M
[HA] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.01765 M

Plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.01765) ≈ 4.735 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258

So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now, at the equivalence point (10.00 cm³ NaOH added), all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume is 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) = 0.001 moles (from the reaction), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:
CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻

To find the pH, we need to calculate Kb for acetate. Since Kw = 1×10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1×10⁻¹⁴)/(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41×10⁻¹⁰.

The hydrolysis expression is Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻]/[CH₃COO⁻]. Let x be the concentration of OH⁻. Then:

5.41×10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 (since x is very small)

Solving for x: x² ≈ 5.41×10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02 = 1.082×10⁻¹¹ → x ≈ √(1.082×10⁻¹¹) ≈ 1.04×10⁻⁶ M

Thus, [OH⁻] ≈ 1.04×10⁻⁶ M → pOH = -log(1.04×10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.98 → pH = 14 - 5.98 ≈ 8.02

Therefore, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.02.

I should check if the approximation for x << 0.02 is valid. Since 1.04×10⁻⁶ is much smaller than 0.02, the approximation holds. Also, for the buffer calculation, using Henderson-Hasselbalch was appropriate. The results seem reasonable: a lower pH (acidic) at 25% titration and a slightly basic pH at equivalence due to the acetate ion.

Here, after partial neutralization, we have remaining acetic acid and acetate ions. So yes, it's a buffer. Therefore, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.)\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, compute pKa from the given Ka. Ka = 1.85x10^-5, so pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let me calculate that.\n\nLog(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733.\n\nNow, [A⁻] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of remaining acetic acid. But we need to consider the total volume of the solution after adding NaOH.\n\nThe initial volume after dilution was 40.00 cm³. Adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH brings the total volume to 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.\n\nTherefore, [A⁻] = 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M\n\n[HA] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.01765 M\n\nNow, log([A⁻]/[HA]) = log(0.005882 / 0.01765) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477\n\nTherefore, pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.001 moles, which, as calculated earlier, requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The total volume at equivalence point is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (CH3COO⁻). The moles of acetate ions are 0.001 moles. Therefore, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic. The pH at the equivalence point can be calculated by determining the concentration of OH⁻ ions from the hydrolysis of acetate.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0x10^-14. Therefore, Kb = (1.0x10^-14) / (1.85x10^-5) ≈ 5.405x10^-10.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n\nThe Kb expression is:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n\nAssuming that the concentration of OH⁻ is x, then [CH3COOH] ≈ x and [OH⁻] ≈ x, while [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 - x. Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\nTherefore, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405x10^-10\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx² = 5.405x10^-10 * 0.02 = 1.081x10^-11\n\nx = sqrt(1.081x10^-11) ≈ 1.04x10^-5 M\n\nThis is the concentration of OH⁻. Therefore, pOH = -log(1.04x10^-5) ≈ 4.983\n\nThen, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 4.983 = 9.017\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 9.02.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation for Kb again. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nThen, Kb = x² / 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nlog(1.04) ≈ 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) = log(1.04) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.017 -5 = -4.983. Therefore, pOH = 4.983, so pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, sometimes when dealing with weak bases, the approximation might not hold if x is a significant fraction of the concentration. Let's check if x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02. x is 1.04e-5, which is 0.00000104 M, while 0.02 M is 0.02. The ratio is 0.000052, which is 0.0052%, so the approximation is valid. Therefore, the calculation is okay.\n\nTherefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 9.02.\n\nBut let me check another way. Alternatively, using the formula for the pH of a weak base:\n\npOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)\n\nBut pKb = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267\n\nThen, pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - log(0.02))\n\nlog(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + (-2) ≈ 0.3010 - 2 = -1.699\n\nTherefore, pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 1/2 (10.966) ≈ 5.483\n\nThen, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nWait, this is conflicting with the previous result. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for a weak base is:\n\nFor a weak base B with concentration C and Kb, the approximation when Kb is small:\n\n[OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nWhich is what I did first. So [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which gives pOH ≈ 4.98, pH ≈ 9.02.\n\nAlternatively, the formula pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C) is not correct. Wait, let me recall. The standard formula for a weak base is:\n\nKb = [OH⁻]^2 / (C - [OH⁻])\n\nIf [OH⁻] is small compared to C, then Kb ≈ [OH⁻]^2 / C, so [OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), which is the same as before.\n\nBut the formula pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C) is not standard. Wait, perhaps I confused it with the weak acid formula. For a weak acid, pH = 1/2 (pKa - log C). For a weak base, pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C). Wait, let's check.\n\nLet me derive it. For a weak base B:\n\nB + H2O ↔ HB⁺ + OH⁻\n\nKb = [HB⁺][OH⁻]/[B]\n\nAssuming [HB⁺] ≈ [OH⁻] = x, and [B] ≈ C - x ≈ C.\n\nSo, Kb ≈ x² / C => x = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nThen, [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log( sqrt(Kb * C) ) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nWait, pKb is -log Kb, so log Kb = -pKb. Therefore:\n\npOH = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nTherefore, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nSo, in this case, pKb = 9.267, log C = log(0.02) ≈ -1.699\n\nTherefore, pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 (10.966) ≈ 5.483\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result. Wait, but according to this, pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, but according to the other method, pH is 9.02. Which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, Kb = 5.405e-10, so pKb = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267\n\nlog C = log(0.02) = -1.69897\n\nSo, pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.69897)) = 0.5 (10.96597) ≈ 5.483\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nBut according to the first method, [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which gives pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983, pH ≈ 9.017\n\nWait, so which is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) is derived from the same approximation as [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C). Let's see:\n\nIf [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C), then pOH = -log(sqrt(Kb * C)) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nSo, both methods should give the same result. Wait, but in the first calculation, I calculated [OH⁻] as 1.04e-5, which gives pOH ≈ 4.98, but according to the formula, pOH should be 5.48. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's compute [OH⁻] again. Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M.\n\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983. But according to the formula, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 * 10.966 ≈ 5.483. These two results are different. Why?\n\nAh! Wait, there's a miscalculation here. Wait, pKb is 9.267, log C is -1.699. So, pKb - log C = 9.267 + 1.699 = 10.966. Then, 0.5 * 10.966 ≈ 5.483. But according to the direct calculation, pOH is 4.983. There's a discrepancy of about 0.5. That's significant. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nWait, the formula for a weak base is:\n\npOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nBut wait, if we have a base that hydrolyzes as B + H2O ↔ HB⁺ + OH⁻, then Kb = [HB⁺][OH⁻]/[B]\n\nAssuming [HB⁺] = [OH⁻] = x, and [B] ≈ C, then Kb = x² / C => x = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nTherefore, [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(sqrt(Kb * C)) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)\n\nSo, the formula is correct. Then, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, let's compute using the numbers:\n\nKb = 5.405e-10, so log Kb = log(5.405e-10) ≈ log(5.405) + (-10) ≈ 0.7328 -10 = -9.2672. Therefore, pKb = 9.2672.\n\nlog C = log(0.02) ≈ -1.69897\n\nSo, pKb - log C = 9.2672 - (-1.69897) = 10.96617\n\nThen, 0.5 * 10.96617 ≈ 5.4831, so pOH ≈ 5.4831, pH ≈ 14 - 5.4831 ≈ 8.5169\n\nBut according to the direct calculation:\n\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0395e-5\n\npOH = -log(1.0395e-5) ≈ 4.983\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. How can this be?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let's check the units. Kb is 5.405e-10, C is 0.02 M. So, Kb*C = 1.081e-11, sqrt of that is 1.04e-5, which is correct. Then, pOH is 4.983. But according to the formula, it's 5.483. There's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect?\n\nWait, let's check with another approach. Let's compute [OH⁻] as 1.04e-5, so pOH = 4.983. Then, pH = 9.017. Alternatively, using the formula, pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. These are two different results. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute it step by step without approximations.\n\nThe exact expression is Kb = x² / (C - x). Let's solve it without approximation.\n\nGiven Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M.\n\nSo, 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ 1.04e-5. Let's check if x is indeed negligible:\n\nx = 1.04e-5, which is 0.0000104 M. 0.02 M - 0.0000104 M ≈ 0.0199896 M, which is approximately 0.02 M. So the approximation holds. Therefore, the exact solution would give x ≈ 1.04e-5, pOH ≈ 4.983, pH ≈ 9.017.\n\nBut according to the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C), we get pOH ≈ 5.483, which is different. Therefore, there must be an error in the formula derivation.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's re-express the formula:\n\nIf pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C), then substituting the numbers:\n\npKb = 9.267, log C = -1.699\n\npOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 (10.966) = 5.483\n\nBut according to the direct calculation, pOH is 4.983. This suggests that the formula is incorrect. But how?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is derived from the same approximation as the direct calculation, so they should agree. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let's compute pOH using the exact formula:\n\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983\n\nBut according to the formula, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 5.483\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the formula is not correct. Wait, but where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different type of base. Wait, acetate is a conjugate base, but maybe the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) is for a weak base that is a base by itself, not a conjugate base. Wait, no, the treatment should be the same. Acetate is a weak base, and the same equations apply.\n\nWait, let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute [OH⁻] without approximation.\n\nKb = 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nWe can write this as x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt((5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1.081e-11)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.922e-19\n\n4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11\n\nSo discriminant ≈ 4.324e-11 + 2.922e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.922e-19 is negligible)\n\nTherefore, sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6\n\nThus, x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6\n\nWait, this is different from the previous approximation. Wait, this can't be right. Wait, if the discriminant is sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6, then x ≈ ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6\n\nBut this contradicts the previous approximation. Wait, but this suggests that [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, which would give pOH ≈ 5.483, matching the formula result. But why is there a discrepancy with the initial approximation?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, the equation is Kb = x² / (C - x) = 5.405e-10\n\nC = 0.02 M\n\nSo, x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)\n\nIf we assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, then x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5\n\nBut when solving the quadratic equation, we get x ≈ 3.29e-6. This suggests that the initial assumption that x is negligible is invalid. But 3.29e-6 is still much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 = 2e-2 = 0.02, 3.29e-6 is 0.000329% of 0.02), so the approximation should hold. Therefore, why does the quadratic solution give a different result?\n\nWait, there must be a miscalculation in the quadratic solution.\n\nWait, let's re-express the equation:\n\nx² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)\n\nx² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nWait, but 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11, correct.\n\nSo, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 5.405e-10, c = -1.081e-11\n\nSo discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 - 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = 2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.922e-19 is negligible)\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6\n\nThus, x = [-5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6]/2\n\nWe discard the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:\n\nx = ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6\n\nWait, but this gives x ≈ 3.29e-6 M, which is different from the initial approximation of 1.04e-5 M. This suggests that the initial approximation was wrong. But how?\n\nWait, no, this can't be. If x is 3.29e-6, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.0199967, which is still approximately 0.02. So why is the quadratic solution giving a different result?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check again.\n\nThe correct equation is Kb = x² / (C - x)\n\nGiven Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02\n\nSo, 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.02 - x):\n\n5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x) = x²\n\nWhich is:\n\n1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x = x²\n\nRearranged:\n\nx² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut solving this quadratic equation gives x ≈ 3.29e-6, which is different from the initial approximation. This suggests that the initial assumption that x is negligible is invalid. But 3.29e-6 is still very small compared to 0.02. Wait, 3.29e-6 is 0.000329% of 0.02, so the approximation should hold. Therefore, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a calculation error in the quadratic solution. Let me compute the discriminant again.\n\nD = b² - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 - 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = 2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11\n\nsqrt(4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324)*1e-5.5 ≈ 2.08 * 1e-5.5 ≈ 2.08e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6, which is correct.\n\nThen, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6\n\nBut this suggests that the correct [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, leading to pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.483, which matches the formula result. Therefore, the initial approximation was incorrect. Why?\n\nAh! I see the mistake now. The initial assumption was that x ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), but in reality, when solving the quadratic equation, we get x ≈ 3.29e-6, which is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. But this is not matching. Therefore, the initial approximation was wrong. But why?\n\nWait, no. Wait, sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. But the quadratic solution gives x ≈ 3.29e-6. This is a factor of ~3 difference. This suggests that the approximation x << C is not valid, but 3.29e-6 is still much smaller than 0.02. So why is there such a discrepancy?\n\nWait, this is impossible. There must be a miscalculation. Let me compute sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02):\n\n5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11\n\nsqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6\n\nAh! Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. Therefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ sqrt(1.081) * 3.16e-6 ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6. Therefore, the initial approximation was correct, but I made a mistake in the manual calculation earlier.\n\nWait, so sqrt(1.081e-11) is indeed approximately 3.29e-6, not 1.04e-5. Where did I get 1.04e-5 from earlier?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought that sqrt(1.081e-11) is 1.04e-5, but actually, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 = 3.16e-6. Therefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. Therefore, the correct [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, leading to pOH ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517.\n\nBut why did I initially think it was 1.04e-5? Because I incorrectly calculated sqrt(1.081e-11) as 1.04e-5. That was the mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct [OH⁻] is approximately 3.29e-6 M, pOH ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517.\n\nTherefore, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nBut let's verify this with precise calculation.\n\nCompute sqrt(1.081e-11):\n\n1.081e-11 = 1.081 x 10^-11\n\nsqrt(1.081) ≈ 1.0396\n\nsqrt(10^-11) = 10^-5.5 ≈ 3.1623e-6\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0396 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.288e-6\n\nYes, so [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288e-6, pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517\n\nTherefore, the correct pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThis means my initial calculation was wrong due to a miscalculation of the square root. I incorrectly thought sqrt(1.081e-11) was 1.04e-5, but it's actually 3.29e-6.\n\nTherefore, the correct pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nAt 25% titration, pH ≈ 4.26\n\nAt equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52\n\nI need to check if these results make sense.\n\nAcetic acid is a weak acid, so when titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point should be basic, which matches the pH of ~8.5. The 25% titration is in the buffer region, so pH should be close to pKa. Since pKa is ~4.73, and at 25% titration, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 1/3, so pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25, which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nAt 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26\n\nAt equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pH at 25% titration is \\boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \\boxed{8.52}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445569, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7652, prompt_tokens=750, total_tokens=8402, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Initially, we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid is calculated using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \):

\[
M_2 = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}
\]

For the titration with 0.1 M NaOH, we first determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}
\]

The volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

At 25% titration, 2.50 cm³ of NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid and the moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Remaining CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} - 0.00025 \, \text{mol} = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
\]

The total volume of the solution is 42.50 cm³. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ion. The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Using the hydrolysis of acetate:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \times [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.517
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

(wait, buffer solution is formed when there's a weak acid and its conjugate base. Here, after partial neutralization, we have remaining acetic acid and acetate ions. So yes, it's a buffer. Therefore, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.)

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

First, compute pKa from the given Ka. Ka = 1.85x10^-5, so pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733.

Now, [A⁻] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of remaining acetic acid. But we need to consider the total volume of the solution after adding NaOH.

The initial volume after dilution was 40.00 cm³. Adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH brings the total volume to 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Therefore, [A⁻] = 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

[HA] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.01765 M

Now, log([A⁻]/[HA]) = log(0.005882 / 0.01765) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477

Therefore, pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256

So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.001 moles, which, as calculated earlier, requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The total volume at equivalence point is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (CH3COO⁻). The moles of acetate ions are 0.001 moles. Therefore, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic. The pH at the equivalence point can be calculated by determining the concentration of OH⁻ ions from the hydrolysis of acetate.

The Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0x10^-14. Therefore, Kb = (1.0x10^-14) / (1.85x10^-5) ≈ 5.405x10^-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]

Assuming that the concentration of OH⁻ is x, then [CH3COOH] ≈ x and [OH⁻] ≈ x, while [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 - x. Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Therefore, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405x10^-10

Solving for x:

x² = 5.405x10^-10 * 0.02 = 1.081x10^-11

x = sqrt(1.081x10^-11) ≈ 1.04x10^-5 M

This is the concentration of OH⁻. Therefore, pOH = -log(1.04x10^-5) ≈ 4.983

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 4.983 = 9.017

So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 9.02.

Wait, but let me check the calculation for Kb again. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, Kb = x² / 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.

log(1.04) ≈ 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) = log(1.04) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.017 -5 = -4.983. Therefore, pOH = 4.983, so pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. That's correct.

But wait, sometimes when dealing with weak bases, the approximation might not hold if x is a significant fraction of the concentration. Let's check if x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02. x is 1.04e-5, which is 0.00000104 M, while 0.02 M is 0.02. The ratio is 0.000052, which is 0.0052%, so the approximation is valid. Therefore, the calculation is okay.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 9.02.

But let me check another way. Alternatively, using the formula for the pH of a weak base:

pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)

But pKb = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267

Then, pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - log(0.02))

log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + (-2) ≈ 0.3010 - 2 = -1.699

Therefore, pOH = 1/2 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 1/2 (10.966) ≈ 5.483

Then, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula for a weak base is:

For a weak base B with concentration C and Kb, the approximation when Kb is small:

[OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C)

Which is what I did first. So [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which gives pOH ≈ 4.98, pH ≈ 9.02.

Alternatively, the formula pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C) is not correct. Wait, let me recall. The standard formula for a weak base is:

Kb = [OH⁻]^2 / (C - [OH⁻])

If [OH⁻] is small compared to C, then Kb ≈ [OH⁻]^2 / C, so [OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), which is the same as before.

But the formula pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C) is not standard. Wait, perhaps I confused it with the weak acid formula. For a weak acid, pH = 1/2 (pKa - log C). For a weak base, pOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C). Wait, let's check.

Let me derive it. For a weak base B:

B + H2O ↔ HB⁺ + OH⁻

Kb = [HB⁺][OH⁻]/[B]

Assuming [HB⁺] ≈ [OH⁻] = x, and [B] ≈ C - x ≈ C.

So, Kb ≈ x² / C => x = sqrt(Kb * C)

Then, [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C)

pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log( sqrt(Kb * C) ) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

Wait, pKb is -log Kb, so log Kb = -pKb. Therefore:

pOH = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

Therefore, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

So, in this case, pKb = 9.267, log C = log(0.02) ≈ -1.699

Therefore, pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 (10.966) ≈ 5.483

But this contradicts the previous result. Wait, but according to this, pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, but according to the other method, pH is 9.02. Which is correct?

Wait, there's a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, Kb = 5.405e-10, so pKb = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267

log C = log(0.02) = -1.69897

So, pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.69897)) = 0.5 (10.96597) ≈ 5.483

Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517

But according to the first method, [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which gives pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983, pH ≈ 9.017

Wait, so which is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the math again.

Wait, the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) is derived from the same approximation as [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C). Let's see:

If [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C), then pOH = -log(sqrt(Kb * C)) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

So, both methods should give the same result. Wait, but in the first calculation, I calculated [OH⁻] as 1.04e-5, which gives pOH ≈ 4.98, but according to the formula, pOH should be 5.48. There's a mistake here.

Wait, let's compute [OH⁻] again. Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M.

[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983. But according to the formula, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 * 10.966 ≈ 5.483. These two results are different. Why?

Ah! Wait, there's a miscalculation here. Wait, pKb is 9.267, log C is -1.699. So, pKb - log C = 9.267 + 1.699 = 10.966. Then, 0.5 * 10.966 ≈ 5.483. But according to the direct calculation, pOH is 4.983. There's a discrepancy of about 0.5. That's significant. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula for a weak base is:

pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

But wait, if we have a base that hydrolyzes as B + H2O ↔ HB⁺ + OH⁻, then Kb = [HB⁺][OH⁻]/[B]

Assuming [HB⁺] = [OH⁻] = x, and [B] ≈ C, then Kb = x² / C => x = sqrt(Kb * C)

Therefore, [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * C)

pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(sqrt(Kb * C)) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C) = -0.5 (-pKb + log C) = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

So, the formula is correct. Then, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, let's compute using the numbers:

Kb = 5.405e-10, so log Kb = log(5.405e-10) ≈ log(5.405) + (-10) ≈ 0.7328 -10 = -9.2672. Therefore, pKb = 9.2672.

log C = log(0.02) ≈ -1.69897

So, pKb - log C = 9.2672 - (-1.69897) = 10.96617

Then, 0.5 * 10.96617 ≈ 5.4831, so pOH ≈ 5.4831, pH ≈ 14 - 5.4831 ≈ 8.5169

But according to the direct calculation:

[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0395e-5

pOH = -log(1.0395e-5) ≈ 4.983

Wait, this is a contradiction. How can this be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let's check the units. Kb is 5.405e-10, C is 0.02 M. So, Kb*C = 1.081e-11, sqrt of that is 1.04e-5, which is correct. Then, pOH is 4.983. But according to the formula, it's 5.483. There's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect?

Wait, let's check with another approach. Let's compute [OH⁻] as 1.04e-5, so pOH = 4.983. Then, pH = 9.017. Alternatively, using the formula, pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. These are two different results. Which is correct?

Wait, let's compute it step by step without approximations.

The exact expression is Kb = x² / (C - x). Let's solve it without approximation.

Given Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M.

So, 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ 1.04e-5. Let's check if x is indeed negligible:

x = 1.04e-5, which is 0.0000104 M. 0.02 M - 0.0000104 M ≈ 0.0199896 M, which is approximately 0.02 M. So the approximation holds. Therefore, the exact solution would give x ≈ 1.04e-5, pOH ≈ 4.983, pH ≈ 9.017.

But according to the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C), we get pOH ≈ 5.483, which is different. Therefore, there must be an error in the formula derivation.

Wait, no. Wait, let's re-express the formula:

If pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C), then substituting the numbers:

pKb = 9.267, log C = -1.699

pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 0.5 (10.966) = 5.483

But according to the direct calculation, pOH is 4.983. This suggests that the formula is incorrect. But how?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is derived from the same approximation as the direct calculation, so they should agree. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in one of the steps.

Wait, let's compute pOH using the exact formula:

pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983

But according to the formula, pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.699)) = 5.483

This discrepancy suggests that the formula is not correct. Wait, but where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different type of base. Wait, acetate is a conjugate base, but maybe the formula pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C) is for a weak base that is a base by itself, not a conjugate base. Wait, no, the treatment should be the same. Acetate is a weak base, and the same equations apply.

Wait, let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute [OH⁻] without approximation.

Kb = 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

We can write this as x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt((5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1.081e-11)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.922e-19

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11

So discriminant ≈ 4.324e-11 + 2.922e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.922e-19 is negligible)

Therefore, sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6

Thus, x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6

Wait, this is different from the previous approximation. Wait, this can't be right. Wait, if the discriminant is sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6, then x ≈ ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6

But this contradicts the previous approximation. Wait, but this suggests that [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, which would give pOH ≈ 5.483, matching the formula result. But why is there a discrepancy with the initial approximation?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, the equation is Kb = x² / (C - x) = 5.405e-10

C = 0.02 M

So, x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

If we assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, then x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5

But when solving the quadratic equation, we get x ≈ 3.29e-6. This suggests that the initial assumption that x is negligible is invalid. But 3.29e-6 is still much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 = 2e-2 = 0.02, 3.29e-6 is 0.000329% of 0.02), so the approximation should hold. Therefore, why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, there must be a miscalculation in the quadratic solution.

Wait, let's re-express the equation:

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Wait, but 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11, correct.

So, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a

Here, a = 1, b = 5.405e-10, c = -1.081e-11

So discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 - 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = 2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.922e-19 is negligible)

Therefore, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6

Thus, x = [-5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6]/2

We discard the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:

x = ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6

Wait, but this gives x ≈ 3.29e-6 M, which is different from the initial approximation of 1.04e-5 M. This suggests that the initial approximation was wrong. But how?

Wait, no, this can't be. If x is 3.29e-6, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.0199967, which is still approximately 0.02. So why is the quadratic solution giving a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check again.

The correct equation is Kb = x² / (C - x)

Given Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02

So, 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Multiply both sides by (0.02 - x):

5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x) = x²

Which is:

1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x = x²

Rearranged:

x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Yes, that's correct.

But solving this quadratic equation gives x ≈ 3.29e-6, which is different from the initial approximation. This suggests that the initial assumption that x is negligible is invalid. But 3.29e-6 is still very small compared to 0.02. Wait, 3.29e-6 is 0.000329% of 0.02, so the approximation should hold. Therefore, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps there's a calculation error in the quadratic solution. Let me compute the discriminant again.

D = b² - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 - 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = 2.922e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11

sqrt(4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324)*1e-5.5 ≈ 2.08 * 1e-5.5 ≈ 2.08e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6, which is correct.

Then, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.5755e-6 / 2 ≈ 3.2878e-6

But this suggests that the correct [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, leading to pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.483, which matches the formula result. Therefore, the initial approximation was incorrect. Why?

Ah! I see the mistake now. The initial assumption was that x ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), but in reality, when solving the quadratic equation, we get x ≈ 3.29e-6, which is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. But this is not matching. Therefore, the initial approximation was wrong. But why?

Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. But the quadratic solution gives x ≈ 3.29e-6. This is a factor of ~3 difference. This suggests that the approximation x << C is not valid, but 3.29e-6 is still much smaller than 0.02. So why is there such a discrepancy?

Wait, this is impossible. There must be a miscalculation. Let me compute sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02):

5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6

Ah! Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. Therefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ sqrt(1.081) * 3.16e-6 ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6. Therefore, the initial approximation was correct, but I made a mistake in the manual calculation earlier.

Wait, so sqrt(1.081e-11) is indeed approximately 3.29e-6, not 1.04e-5. Where did I get 1.04e-5 from earlier?

Ah! Here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought that sqrt(1.081e-11) is 1.04e-5, but actually, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 = 3.16e-6. Therefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. Therefore, the correct [OH⁻] is 3.29e-6 M, leading to pOH ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517.

But why did I initially think it was 1.04e-5? Because I incorrectly calculated sqrt(1.081e-11) as 1.04e-5. That was the mistake.

Therefore, the correct [OH⁻] is approximately 3.29e-6 M, pOH ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517.

Therefore, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

But let's verify this with precise calculation.

Compute sqrt(1.081e-11):

1.081e-11 = 1.081 x 10^-11

sqrt(1.081) ≈ 1.0396

sqrt(10^-11) = 10^-5.5 ≈ 3.1623e-6

Therefore, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0396 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.288e-6

Yes, so [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288e-6, pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.483, pH ≈ 8.517

Therefore, the correct pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

This means my initial calculation was wrong due to a miscalculation of the square root. I incorrectly thought sqrt(1.081e-11) was 1.04e-5, but it's actually 3.29e-6.

Therefore, the correct pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

So, to summarize:

At 25% titration, pH ≈ 4.26

At equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52

I need to check if these results make sense.

Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point should be basic, which matches the pH of ~8.5. The 25% titration is in the buffer region, so pH should be close to pKa. Since pKa is ~4.73, and at 25% titration, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 1/3, so pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25, which matches the earlier result.

Therefore, the final answers are:

At 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26

At equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52

**Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.
