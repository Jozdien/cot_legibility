# Original Question

To determine the speed of light in a moving glass relative to a laboratory observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the glass when it is stationary is \( \frac{1}{n} \). When the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass's rest frame) and \( c = 1 \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the laboratory, when the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. 

First, the index of refraction (n) of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v_medium). So, n = c / v_medium. Since the problem states that c = 1, that simplifies things a bit. So, the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary would be v_medium = c / n = 1 / n. 

But in this case, the glass is moving. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame, so we need to calculate the speed of the light relative to the lab frame, taking into account the motion of the glass. 

Wait, so if the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light inside it? Normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is 1/n. But since the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, we need to use velocity addition formulas. But which one? Galilean or relativistic?

The problem doesn't specify whether we should use classical or relativistic physics. But since it's about light, which is inherently related to relativity, I think we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But I need to confirm. 

Wait, but the index of refraction is a material property, which is typically given in the rest frame of the medium. So, when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light? 

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass's rest frame (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, the lab frame is moving at -v relative to the glass). So, to find the speed u in the lab frame, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation for velocity. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²). Since c = 1 here, this simplifies to u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v). 

But u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So substituting that in, we get u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v). 

But wait, is that correct? Let me check. 

Alternatively, if we use Galilean addition, it would just be u = 1/n + v. But in reality, since light speed is involved, we need to use the relativistic formula. 

But here's a thought: in the case where the medium is moving, the Fresnel drag effect comes into play. The Fresnel drag coefficient describes how the speed of light in a moving medium is affected. The formula for the observed speed is (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). But I need to verify this. 

Wait, the Fresnel drag formula is indeed derived using relativistic considerations, but it's an approximation for small velocities v compared to c. The exact formula would require using the relativistic velocity addition. 

But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so maybe we need to use the exact relativistic formula. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the Fresnel drag formula. Let me recall. 

Fresnel's result was that the speed of light in a moving medium is (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). This was later confirmed by Fizeau's experiment, which supported the relativistic formula when velocities are small. 

But Einstein's velocity addition formula gives, for the case where the medium is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at speed u' = c/n in the medium's frame, then the lab frame speed u is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). 

So substituting u' = c/n and c=1, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But the Fresnel formula is (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). 

Wait, these are different. Which one is correct? 

Hmm. Let's see. If we take the relativistic formula and expand it for small v, we can check if it matches the Fresnel drag. 

Let me do that. Let's take u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

If v is small, we can approximate the denominator as 1 + (v/n) ≈ 1/(1 - v/n) using the first term of the Taylor expansion. So, u ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) = (1/n)(1 - v/n) + v(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n - v/n² + v - v²/n. 

Neglecting terms of order v², this becomes 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). Which matches the Fresnel drag formula. 

Therefore, the exact relativistic formula is u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), and the Fresnel formula is the approximation for small v. 

But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so we should use the exact formula. 

But wait, let's think again. The index of refraction n is defined in the rest frame of the medium. When the medium is moving, the actual speed of light in the lab frame would depend on relativistic velocity addition. 

Alternatively, there's a more precise way to calculate this. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is u' = c/n = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). So, using the Lorentz transformation from the glass frame to the lab frame, the velocity u in the lab frame is given by:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c²)

Since c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, if we consider relativistic addition, that's the formula. 

But let me check with an example. Suppose n=1, which would mean the medium is vacuum. Then the speed should be c=1, regardless of v. Plugging n=1 into the formula: (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. Correct. 

If the glass is stationary, v=0, then u = 1/n. Correct. 

If v is very small, then the formula approximates to (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n ≈ 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which is the Fresnel drag. 

So, the exact expression is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me think again. Is there another approach? 

Alternatively, the speed of light in a moving medium can be calculated using the relativistic addition of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium. 

But in this case, the medium is moving at v, and the light is moving at 1/n in the medium's frame. So, using relativistic velocity addition, the lab frame speed is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v*(1/n)). 

Yes, that's the same as before. 

Therefore, the answer should be (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check units. Since c=1, all velocities are in terms of c. So, v is a fraction of c. The formula is dimensionless, which is correct. 

Alternatively, if we write it as ( (1 + n v) / n ) / (1 + v/n ) = (1 + n v)/n * 1/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/ (n(1 + v/n)) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, that's different. Wait, no:

Wait, (1/n + v) is (1 + n v)/n. Then divided by (1 + v/n) which is (n + v)/n. So, (1 + n v)/n divided by (n + v)/n is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

So, the speed u = (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Wait, that's another way to write the same expression. Let me verify:

Original expression: (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Yes, so u = (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Hmm, that's a more symmetric form. 

So, for example, if n=1, u=(1 + v)/(1 + v)=1. Correct. 

If v=0, u=1/n. Correct. 

If n approaches infinity (extremely slow light in medium), u approaches (1 + ∞ v)/(∞ + v) ≈ (∞ v)/∞ = v. Which makes sense, if the light is moving very slowly in the medium, then the observed speed would be approximately the speed of the medium. 

Alternatively, if v approaches 1 (speed of light), then u=(1 + n *1)/(n +1)= (1 +n)/(n +1)=1. So, even if the medium is moving at c, the speed of light in the lab frame is still c. Which is consistent with relativity. 

Therefore, this formula seems to hold. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Alternatively, written as (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But both are equivalent. 

So, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

But let me check some references. 

Wait, in Feynman lectures, for example, he discusses the Fresnel drag coefficient, which is the term (1 - 1/n²) multiplied by the velocity of the medium. But that's an approximation for low velocities. 

The exact formula, according to relativistic velocity addition, is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Here, u' is the speed in the medium's frame, which is c/n. So, substituting, we get (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n c²)) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)). Since c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Yes, so that's the same as before. 

Therefore, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Alternatively, if we factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1 + n v = n (1/n + v)

Denominator: n + v = n (1 + v/n)

So, (1 + n v)/(n + v) = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first is simpler. 

But let me check if there's another approach. 

Suppose we use the Lorentz transformation for the wave number and frequency. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the light has speed u' = c/n, so the phase velocity is c/n. The frequency in the glass's frame is f', and the wavelength is λ' = u'/f' = c/(n f'). 

In the lab frame, moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, we can use the Doppler effect to find the frequency f, and then relate that to the speed u = f λ. 

But this might complicate things. Let's try. 

The Doppler shift formula for light is f = f' sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving towards the observer. Wait, but this is for a source moving towards the observer. In this case, the medium is moving, which complicates things. 

Alternatively, the phase velocity transforms differently. 

The phase velocity in the direction of motion is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Which is the same as the relativistic velocity addition. 

Therefore, this confirms that the phase velocity, which in this case is the speed of light in the medium, transforms according to the relativistic addition formula. 

Therefore, the speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

So, after all these considerations, I think the correct answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is equivalent to (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check with specific numbers. 

Suppose n=2, v=0.5 (in units where c=1). 

Then according to the formula, u = (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5) = (1 +1)/2.5 = 2/2.5 = 0.8. 

Alternatively, using the other form: (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*0.5) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8. Same result. 

If we use Galilean addition, it would be 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, which is incorrect. 

If we use Fresnel drag: (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²) = 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*0.75 = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. Which is different from the exact result 0.8. 

So, the exact formula gives 0.8, Fresnel gives 0.875, Galilean gives 1.0. 

Therefore, the exact relativistic formula is necessary here. 

Therefore, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

But let me check another example. 

Take n=1 (vacuum), v=0.5. Then u=(1 +1*0.5)/(1 +0.5)=1.5/1.5=1. Correct. 

Take n=2, v=0. Then u=(1 +0)/2=0.5. Correct. 

Take v approaching 1. For n=2, v=0.999. Then u=(1 +2*0.999)/(2 +0.999)= (1 +1.998)/2.999=2.998/2.999≈0.999666..., which is just under 1, as expected. 

Yes, so that seems correct. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Alternatively, written as (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But both are equivalent. 

The problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1", so we don't have to worry about units. 

Therefore, the final answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

But let me check if there's a standard form of this. 

In some references, the formula for the velocity of light in a moving medium is given by:

u = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v)/(n c)}

But since c=1, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which is the same as our result. 

Yes, so this seems to be the correct formula. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

I need to determine the speed of light in glass as observed from a laboratory perspective, considering that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Let me start by reviewing some fundamental concepts.

The index of refraction (n) is defined as the ratio between the speed of light in vacuum (c) and the speed in a medium (v_medium), expressed as n = c/v_medium. Since the problem indicates that c = 1, the speed of light in stationary glass would be v_medium = 1/n.

However, in this scenario, the glass is moving. I need to calculate the light's speed relative to the laboratory frame while accounting for the glass's motion in the same direction as the light beam.

This raises the question: how does the glass's motion affect the speed of light within it? In the glass's rest frame, light travels at 1/n, but since the glass is moving relative to the lab, I need to apply velocity addition formulas.

Since we're dealing with light, which is intrinsically related to relativity, the relativistic velocity addition formula seems appropriate, though I should verify this approach.

The index of refraction is typically specified for a medium at rest. So how does the medium's motion influence the observed light speed?

In the glass's rest frame, light moves at speed u' = 1/n. The laboratory frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass frame (since the glass moves at velocity v in the lab frame). To find the speed u in the lab frame, I must apply the Lorentz transformation for velocity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). With c = 1, this simplifies to u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v).

Substituting u' = 1/n, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v).

I should verify this result. Using Galilean addition would simply give u = 1/n + v, but since we're dealing with light speed, the relativistic formula is necessary.

Another consideration is the Fresnel drag effect, which describes how light speed in a moving medium is affected. The formula for observed speed is (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). However, this formula is an approximation for small velocities compared to c. The exact formula would require using t

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the speed of light in glass as observed from a laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam. Let's start by remembering some fundamental concepts.

The index of refraction (\( n \)) of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (\( c \)) to its speed in the medium (\( v_{\text{medium}} \)). Thus, \( n = c / v_{\text{medium}} \). Given that \( c = 1 \), this simplifies the problem somewhat. Hence, the speed of light in stationary glass would be \( v_{\text{medium}} = c / n = 1 / n \).

However, the glass is in motion. The glass moves at a velocity \( v \) parallel to the light beam, observed from the lab frame. We must determine the light's speed relative to the lab frame, factoring in the glass's motion.

Does the motion of the glass change the light's speed within it? Typically, in the glass’s rest frame, the light speed is \( 1/n \). Yet, because the glass moves relative to the lab, we incorporate velocity addition formulas. But, which should we use: Galilean or relativistic?

The problem doesn't specify whether classical or relativistic physics are required. However, since it involves light, which has a natural link to relativity, the relativistic velocity addition formula likely applies here. Still, I should confirm this.

The index of refraction is usually a property measured in the medium's rest frame. How does its movement influence the observed speed of light?

In the glass's rest frame, light speed is \( u' = 1/n \). The lab moves at velocity \( -v \) relative to the glass's rest frame (as the glass moves at \( v \) relative to the lab). To find speed \( u \) in the lab frame, we use the Lorentz transformation for velocity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula becomes \( u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2) \). Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to \( u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v) \).

Given \( u' = 1/n \), substituting gives \( u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) \cdot v) \).

Wait, is that accurate? Let me verify.

Under Galilean addition, \( u \) would be \( 1/n + v \). But because light's speed is involved, the relativistic formula is necessary.

Consider this: when the medium moves, the Fresnel drag effect might apply. The Fresnel drag coefficient shows how light speed in a moving medium changes. The observed speed formula is \( (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n^2) \). I should verify this.

The Fresnel drag formula, derived using relativistic aspects, is an approximation for small velocities \( v \) relative to \( c \). Calculating the exact formula necessitates...

Suppose n=1, which would mean the medium is vacuum. Then the speed of light should be c=1, regardless of v. Plugging n=1 into the formula: (1/1 + v)/(1 + v/1) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1.

So, they are different. \n\nBut which one is correct? \n\nWait, according to special relativity, the exact velocity addition formula should be used. The Fresnel drag is a first-order approximation. Therefore, the correct answer should be the relativistic addition result. \n\nBut let me check some references. \n\nWait, according to the theory of relativity, when a medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by:\n\nu = \\frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v c)/(n c^2)} = \\frac{c/n + v}{1 + v/(n c)}\n\nSince in this problem, c=1, this simplifies to:\n\nu = \\frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n}\n\nWhich is the same as we derived. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nAlternatively, if we write it as (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let\'s check the units. Since c=1, v is a fraction of c. So, all terms are dimensionless. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write it in terms of c, but since c=1, it\'s okay. \n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let me check another source. \n\nWait, according to the Wikipedia article on "Fresnel drag", the formula for the speed of light in a moving medium is:\n\nu = \\frac{c}{n} + v\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\n\nBut this is the first-order approximation. The exact formula, according to the same article, is given by relativistic velocity addition. \n\nSo, the exact formula is indeed (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n c^2)) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)). \n\nSince c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let me check with another example. Suppose n=1 (vacuum), then u=(1 + v)/(1 + v)=1, which is correct. \n\nIf the medium is moving at v=0, then u=1/n, which is correct. \n\nIf the medium is moving at v=0.5c (v=0.5), and n=2, then u=(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25)=1/1.25=0.8, which is less than c. \n\nIf we use the Fresnel drag formula, u=0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25)=0.5 + 0.375=0.875. \n\nBut according to relativity, the exact speed is 0.8. \n\nTherefore, the exact formula is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nTherefore, the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. \n\nAlternatively, consider the Lorentz transformation of the wave vector. The frequency and wave number transform under a Lorentz boost. \n\nIn the rest frame of the glass, the light has speed u\'=1/n, frequency f\', and wavelength λ\'. The relation is u\'=f\' λ\'. \n\nIn the lab frame, moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, the observed frequency and wavelength would be different. \n\nBut perhaps this approach is more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, using four-velocity. \n\nBut maybe the velocity addition is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, think about the time it takes for light to traverse the glass. But since the glass is moving, the length of the glass in the lab frame is contracted, and the light has to catch up to the moving glass. \n\nWait, but this might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, consider two events: light entering the glass and light exiting the glass. \n\nIn the glass\'s rest frame, the time between these events is Δt\' = d\' / u\', where d\' is the thickness of the glass. \n\nIn the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the distance between the entry and exit points is d = γ(d\' + v Δt\'), and the time is Δt = γ(Δt\' + v d\' / c²). \n\nBut the speed in the lab frame would be d / Δt. \n\nBut let\'s try this. \n\nIn the glass\'s rest frame, the light travels a distance d\' in time Δt\' = d\' / (1/n) = n d\'. \n\nIn the lab frame, the length of the glass is contracted: d = d\' / γ, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²). \n\nBut wait, the glass is moving, so in the lab frame, its length is contracted. However, the light has to travel this contracted length plus the distance the glass moves during the time it takes the light to pass through. \n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s use the Lorentz transformation for velocity. \n\nIn the rest frame of the glass (S\'), the speed of light is u\' = 1/n. \n\nThe lab frame (S) is moving at velocity -v relative to S\'. \n\nThe velocity transformation from S\' to S is given by:\n\nu = (u\' + v) / (1 + u\' v)\n\nSince c=1. \n\nTherefore, substituting u\' = 1/n, we get:\n\nu = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) v) = (1 + n v) / (n + v). \n\nWait, no. Wait, numerator is (1/n + v) and denominator is (1 + (v/n)). \n\nBut (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n, and denominator is (1 + v/n) = (n + v)/n. \n\nTherefore, u = [(1 + n v)/n] / [(n + v)/n] = (1 + n v)/(n + v). \n\nWait, that\'s another way to write it. \n\nSo, u = (n v + 1)/(n + v). \n\nBut since the problem states c=1, and all velocities are in terms of c, this is acceptable. \n\nSo, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). \n\nAlternatively, factoring out n in the numerator and denominator:\n\nu = [n(v + 1/n)] / [n(1 + v/n)] = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which is the same as before. \n\nSo, both forms are equivalent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v) or equivalently (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let\'s check units again. If n is dimensionless (which it is, since it\'s a ratio of speeds), and v is a dimensionless fraction of c, then the expression is dimensionless, which matches since c=1. \n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). \n\nAlternatively, written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). \n\nBut both are the same. \n\nAlternatively, we can write it as (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)) but since c=1, it\'s the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let me check with another example. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5. Then:\n\n(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than 1. \n\nIf v approaches 1, then (1 + n)/(n + 1) = 1, which makes sense. If the glass is moving at c, then the speed of light in the lab frame would still be c, as per relativity. \n\nWait, if v approaches 1, then (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) approaches (1 + 1/n)/(1 + 1/n) = 1. So, even if the medium is moving at c, the speed of light in the lab frame is c. That\'s consistent with relativity, since nothing can exceed c. \n\nSimilarly, if v approaches 0, we get 1/n, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). \n\nBut let me check if there\'s a standard formula for this. \n\nYes, according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, when the medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v/c²), where u\' is the speed in the medium\'s rest frame.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**: The speed of light in the glass when it is stationary is \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass.
2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: The observer in the laboratory frame sees the glass moving at velocity \( v \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the laboratory frame \( u \) is given by:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem) and \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
3. **Simplification**: This can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \( n \):
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

he relativistic velocity addition. 

But let's see. If we use the relativistic addition, u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (v)/(n)). 

But if we expand this for small v, we can approximate it as (1/n + v) * (1 - v/n + ...) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n + ... which, to first order, is 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So that matches the Fresnel drag formula. 

But since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, maybe we need to use the exact relativistic formula. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Fresnel drag formula. Let me check the exact expression. 

Wait, the Fresnel drag coefficient is given by u = (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). But this is an approximation. However, the exact expression from relativistic velocity addition would be different. 

Wait, let's do the exact calculation. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is u' = c/n = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). So, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed in the lab frame u is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)

Since c = 1, this becomes:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

So, that's the exact formula. 

But let's check if this is equivalent to the Fresnel drag formula. If we expand this for small v (i.e., v << c = 1), then:

u ≈ (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ...) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n + ... 

So, to first order in v, this is 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which is the Fresnel drag formula. 

But since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, we need to use the exact expression. However, the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, but doesn't specify if it's relativistic or not. 

But in the absence of such specification, perhaps we are to use the exact relativistic formula. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the Fresnel drag formula. But given that the problem is presented in a way that c=1, and the velocity is just v, it's possible that the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. 

Wait, another way to think about it: the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab, then in the lab frame, the speed of light would be the sum of the medium's speed and the light's speed relative to the medium, adjusted relativistically. 

So, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, as we did before. 

Alternatively, if we consider the relativistic addition, then the formula is indeed (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). 

But let's check with an example. Suppose n=1, which would mean the medium is vacuum. Then the speed of light should be c=1, regardless of v. Plugging n=1 into the formula: (1/1 + v)/(1 + v/1) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. Correct. 

Another example: if v=0, then the speed is 1/n, which is correct. 

If n=2 and v=0.5, then the formula gives (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8. Which is less than c, as expected. 

Alternatively, if we use the Fresnel drag formula: (1/2) + 0.5*(1 - 1/4) = 0.5 + 0.5*(0.75) = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. Which is different. 

So, the exact formula gives 0.8, while the Fresnel drag gives 0.875. So, they are different. 

But which one is correct? 

Wait, according to special relativity, the exact velocity addition formula should be used. The Fresnel drag is a first-order approximation. Therefore, the correct answer should be the relativistic addition result. 

But let me check some references. 

Wait, according to the theory of relativity, when a medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by:

u = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v c)/(n c^2)} = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + v/(n c)}

Since in this problem, c=1, this simplifies to:

u = \frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n}

Which is the same as we derived. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, if we write it as (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let's check the units. Since c=1, v is a fraction of c. So, all terms are dimensionless. 

Alternatively, if we want to write it in terms of c, but since c=1, it's okay. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check another source. 

Wait, according to the Wikipedia article on "Fresnel drag", the formula for the speed of light in a moving medium is:

u = \frac{c}{n} + v\left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)

But this is the first-order approximation. The exact formula, according to the same article, is given by relativistic velocity addition. 

So, the exact formula is indeed (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n c^2)) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)). 

Since c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, the answer should be (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check with another example. Suppose n=1 (vacuum), then u=(1 + v)/(1 + v)=1, which is correct. 

If the medium is moving at v=0, then u=1/n, which is correct. 

If the medium is moving at v=0.5c (v=0.5), and n=2, then u=(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25)=1/1.25=0.8, which is less than c. 

If we use the Fresnel drag formula, u=0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25)=0.5 + 0.375=0.875. 

But according to relativity, the exact speed is 0.8. 

Therefore, the exact formula is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, consider the Lorentz transformation of the wave vector. The frequency and wave number transform under a Lorentz boost. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the light has speed u'=1/n, frequency f', and wavelength λ'. The relation is u'=f' λ'. 

In the lab frame, moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, the observed frequency and wavelength would be different. 

But perhaps this approach is more complicated. 

Alternatively, using four-velocity. 

But maybe the velocity addition is sufficient. 

Alternatively, think about the time it takes for light to traverse the glass. But since the glass is moving, the length of the glass in the lab frame is contracted, and the light has to catch up to the moving glass. 

Wait, but this might complicate things. 

Alternatively, consider two events: light entering the glass and light exiting the glass. 

In the glass's rest frame, the time between these events is Δt' = d' / u', where d' is the thickness of the glass. 

In the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the distance between the entry and exit points is d = γ(d' + v Δt'), and the time is Δt = γ(Δt' + v d' / c²). 

But the speed in the lab frame would be d / Δt. 

But let's try this. 

In the glass's rest frame, the light travels a distance d' in time Δt' = d' / (1/n) = n d'. 

In the lab frame, the length of the glass is contracted: d = d' / γ, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²). 

But wait, the glass is moving, so in the lab frame, its length is contracted. However, the light has to travel this contracted length plus the distance the glass moves during the time it takes the light to pass through. 

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. 

Alternatively, let's use the Lorentz transformation for velocity. 

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is u' = 1/n. 

The lab frame (S) is moving at velocity -v relative to S'. 

The velocity transformation from S' to S is given by:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v)

Since c=1. 

Therefore, substituting u' = 1/n, we get:

u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) v) = (1 + n v) / (n + v). 

Wait, no. Wait, numerator is (1/n + v) and denominator is (1 + (v/n)). 

But (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n, and denominator is (1 + v/n) = (n + v)/n. 

Therefore, u = [(1 + n v)/n] / [(n + v)/n] = (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Wait, that's another way to write it. 

So, u = (n v + 1)/(n + v). 

But since the problem states c=1, and all velocities are in terms of c, this is acceptable. 

So, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Alternatively, factoring out n in the numerator and denominator:

u = [n(v + 1/n)] / [n(1 + v/n)] = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which is the same as before. 

So, both forms are equivalent. 

Therefore, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v) or equivalently (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let's check units again. If n is dimensionless (which it is, since it's a ratio of speeds), and v is a dimensionless fraction of c, then the expression is dimensionless, which matches since c=1. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Alternatively, written as (n v + 1)/(n + v). 

But both are the same. 

Alternatively, we can write it as (v + c/n)/(1 + v/(n c)) but since c=1, it's the same as before. 

Therefore, the answer should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check with another example. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5. Then:

(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than 1. 

If v approaches 1, then (1 + n)/(n + 1) = 1, which makes sense. If the glass is moving at c, then the speed of light in the lab frame would still be c, as per relativity. 

Wait, if v approaches 1, then (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) approaches (1 + 1/n)/(1 + 1/n) = 1. So, even if the medium is moving at c, the speed of light in the lab frame is c. That's consistent with relativity, since nothing can exceed c. 

Similarly, if v approaches 0, we get 1/n, which is correct. 

Therefore, the formula seems to hold. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n). 

But let me check if there's a standard formula for this. 

Yes, according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, when the medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v/c²), where u' is the speed in the medium's rest frame. Since u' = c/n, and c=1, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n, we get (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first one is more intuitive since it's expressed in terms of 1/n and v. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

The key steps are:

1. Speed of light in the glass's rest frame: 1/n.

2. Lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass.

3. Use relativistic velocity addition: u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

4. Substitute u' = 1/n.

5. Simplify to get (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).

All checks with examples and consistency with relativity principles seem to confirm this. 

Therefore, the final answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which can be written as \boxed{\dfrac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}}.

Alternatively, if we want to write it in a more compact form, we can factor out 1/n in the numerator and denominator:

\boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

Both forms are equivalent. Depending on the preferred formatting, either is acceptable. Since the problem states c=1, both forms are correct. However, the first form explicitly shows the addition of 1/n and v in the numerator, which might be more intuitive. 

But let me check standard textbooks. 

In Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume I, Chapter 34, he discusses the Fresnel drag coefficient and mentions the relativistic formula. The exact expression is given by the relativistic velocity addition, which matches our result. 

Therefore, the answer is indeed (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

Suppose the glass is stationary (v = 0). Then u = (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n, which is correct. If the glass is moving at v = 1 (speed of light), then u = (1 + n*1)/(n + 1) = (1 + n)/(n + 1) = 1, which is the speed of light in vacuum.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Index of Refraction**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since the speed of light in vacuum \( c = 1 \)).
2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: The speed of light in the laboratory frame is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v}
   \]
   where \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

3. **Substitution**: Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) into the velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

4. **Simplification**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}\).

he relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, but the Fresnel drag formula is derived from relativistic considerations. Let me check the relationship between the two.

The Fresnel drag coefficient (1 - 1/n²) comes from the first-order approximation of the relativistic velocity addition. If we expand the relativistic formula (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) in terms of v (assuming v << c), we can approximate:

(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n. If we ignore the quadratic term (v²/n), we get 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which matches the Fresnel drag formula. So, the exact expression is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), and the Fresnel drag is the first-order approximation.

Therefore, the exact speed observed in the lab frame is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Let me compute this expression:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: 1 + nv

Denominator: n + v

So, u = (1 + nv)/(n + v)

But let me check the algebra:

Original expression: (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n)

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: (1 + nv)

Denominator: n + v

Yes, so u = (1 + nv)/(n + v)

Alternatively, factor out:

u = [n(1/n) + nv]/[n + v] = (1 + nv)/(n + v)

Alternatively, if we write it as (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n), which is the same as (1 + nv)/(n + v).

So, the speed of light in the moving glass as observed in the lab frame is (1 + nv)/(n + v).

But let me verify this with an example. Suppose the glass is stationary (v = 0). Then u = (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n, which is correct. If the glass is moving at v = 1 (speed of light), then u = (1 + n*1)/(n + 1) = (1 + n)/(n + 1) = 1, which is the speed of light in vacuum. That makes sense because if the medium is moving at the speed of light, the light within it would also be moving at c. However, in reality, the medium can't reach v = c, but the formula still gives a consistent result.

Another test: if n = 1 (vacuum), then u = (1 + 1*v)/(1 + v) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct.

If the glass is moving opposite to the light direction (v negative), then the formula still holds. For example, if the glass is moving opposite with speed v, then u = (1 - nv)/(n - v). If n > 1 and v is positive, this could lead to different results, but in our case, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so v is positive.

Therefore, the formula u = (1 + nv)/(n + v) seems correct.

Alternatively, let's consider the relativistic velocity addition. In the glass frame, the light speed is u' = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass. So, using the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v)

Which is exactly the same as before, leading to u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) = (1 + nv)/(n + v)

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame is (1 + nv)/(n + v).

But wait, another thought: the index of refraction is defined in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving, does the index of refraction change? Or is the speed of light in the medium in its rest frame still 1/n, and we just need to add the velocities relativistically?

I think the latter is correct. The index of refraction is a property of the medium in its rest frame, so in that frame, the light speed is 1/n. Then, when the medium is moving, we use the velocity addition formula to get the observed speed in the lab frame.

Therefore, the answer should be (1 + nv)/(n + v).

Alternatively, if we consider the relativistic Doppler effect or other factors, but I think velocity addition is the key here.

Alternatively, some sources might use the formula for the speed of light in a moving medium as (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), which is the Fresnel drag coefficient. But as we saw earlier, this is an approximation for small v. Since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, we need the exact formula.

Therefore, the exact expression is (1 + nv)/(n + v). Let me check units. Since c = 1, v is in units of c. So, if n is dimensionless, then the expression is dimensionless (as speed is in units of c). So, the units check out.

Alternatively, if we write in terms of c, but since c = 1, it's okay.

Therefore, the speed of light in the moving glass as observed in the lab is (1 + nv)/(n + v).

But let me check another example. Let n = 2, v = 0.5.

Then u = (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5) = (1 + 1)/2.5 = 2/2.5 = 0.8.

Alternatively, in the glass rest frame, speed is 0.5. The lab frame is moving at -0.5 relative to the glass. Using velocity addition:

u = (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*0.5) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which matches. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if n = 1.5, v = 0.5:

u = (1 + 1.5*0.5)/(1.5 + 0.5) = (1 + 0.75)/2 = 1.75/2 = 0.875.

In the glass frame, speed is 1/1.5 ≈ 0.6667. Then lab speed is (0.6667 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.6667*0.5) ≈ 1.1667 / 1.3333 ≈ 0.875, which matches.

Therefore, the formula works.

Therefore, the answer is (1 + nv)/(n + v).

But let me check if there's another approach. For example, considering the medium's motion affecting the effective speed.

Alternatively, using Lorentz transformations for the electromagnetic fields in a moving medium, but that might be more complicated. However, the velocity addition approach seems sufficient here.

Alternatively, considering that the speed of light in a medium is due to the phase velocity, and the group velocity. But in this case, since we're talking about the speed of light (presumably phase velocity), the velocity addition should apply.

Alternatively, some sources might state that the speed of light in a moving medium is c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), but as we saw, that's an approximation. Let me check the exact formula.

In the theory of relativity, the correct formula for the velocity of light in a moving medium is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula. So, if the medium is moving at speed v, and in its rest frame the light speed is u' = c/n, then the observed speed u is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since c = 1, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which is the same as (1 + nv)/(n + v).

Therefore, the exact formula is (1 + nv)/(n + v), and the Fresnel drag formula is its approximation when v is small.

Therefore, the answer should be (1 + nv)/(n + v).

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

The Fresnel drag formula is a pre-relativistic formula, but it was later found to be consistent with relativity. However, the relativistic velocity addition gives a different result. Let me check.\n\nSuppose that in the rest frame of the medium, the speed of light is \\( c/n \\). Then, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed in the lab frame where the medium moves at speed \\( v \\) is:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v c/n)/c^2} = \\frac{c/n + v}{1 + v/(n c)} \\)\n\nSince \\( c = 1 \\), this is:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n} \\)\n\nBut the Fresnel drag formula is:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{c}{n} + v \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\)\n\nLet me compute both for small \\( v \\). Let\'s take \\( v \\ll 1 \\). Then, the relativistic formula:\n\n\\( u ≈ (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n^2 - v^2/n \\)\n\nIgnoring \\( v^2 \\) terms:\n\n\\( u ≈ 1/n + v(1 - 1/n^2) \\)\n\nWhich matches the Fresnel drag formula. So, the Fresnel drag is the first-order approximation of the relativistic velocity addition formula for small \\( v \\). Therefore, for non-relativistic speeds, both agree, but for higher speeds, the relativistic formula is more accurate.\n\nSince the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity \\( v \\), but doesn\'t specify that \\( v \\) is small, we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Therefore, the exact speed is \\( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \\).\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose \\( n = 2 \\), \\( v = 0.5 \\). Then:\n\nRelativistic formula: \\( (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8 \\)\n\nFresnel drag: \\( 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*0.75 = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875 \\)\n\nSo, different results. Therefore, if the problem allows for relativistic speeds, the answer is 0.8, but if it\'s non-relativistic, 0.875. However, since the problem doesn\'t specify, but given that in physics when velocities are involved without qualification, especially with light, we should use the relativistic formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Fresnel drag formula. But why?\n\nWait, the problem says "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory". So, the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, but if the glass is moving toward the observer, then the light beam is moving toward the observer as well. So, the glass and the light are moving in the same direction, towards the observer. So, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the glass is in the same direction as the light. So, in the lab frame, the observer sees the glass moving at velocity \\( v \\), and the light is moving through the glass. So, in the glass\'s frame, the light is moving at \\( 1/n \\). Then, the lab frame sees the light moving at \\( (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v) \\).\n\nAlternatively, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer, then the velocity of the glass is in the same direction as the light. So, the velocity addition formula applies as above.\n\nAlternatively, if the glass were moving opposite to the light, we would subtract velocities, but here it\'s the same direction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \\).\n\nBut let me check another source. For example, in the Feynman lectures, he discusses the moving medium. According to Feynman, the speed of light in a moving medium is given by \\( c/n + v(1 - 1/n^2) \\). But he mentions that this is an approximation. However, the exact formula is given by relativity.\n\nAlternatively, Landau and Lifshitz in "The Classical Theory of Fields" discuss the propagation of light in a moving medium. They derive the expression for the velocity of light in a medium moving with velocity \\( \\mathbf{v} \\):\n\n\\( \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} + \\frac{\\mathbf{c}}{n} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{n^2} \\times (\\mathbf{c} \\times \\mathbf{v})}{1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}}{n c^2}} \\)\n\nBut this is for an arbitrary direction. If the velocity is parallel to the direction of light propagation, then the cross product term vanishes, and the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{v + c/n}{1 + (v c)/(n c^2)} = \\frac{v + c/n}{1 + v/(n c)} \\)\n\nWhich, with \\( c = 1 \\), becomes:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{v + 1/n}{1 + v/n} \\)\n\nSo, this matches the relativistic velocity addition formula. Therefore, the correct answer is \\( (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) \\).\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is \\( \\frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \\), after multiplying numerator and denominator by \\( n \\).\n\nWait, let\'s see:\n\n\\( \\frac{v + 1/n}{1 + v/n} = \\frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \\)\n\nYes, multiplying numerator and denominator by \\( n \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \\)\n\nSo, that\'s another way to write it. Both forms are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \\).\n\nBut let me check with an example. If \\( n = 1 \\), which is vacuum, then the speed is \\( (v + 1)/(1 + v) = 1 \\), which is correct. If \\( v = 0 \\), then the speed is \\( 1/n \\), which is correct. If \\( n = 2 \\), \\( v = 0.5 \\), then \\( (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5) = (1 + 1)/2.5 = 2/2.5 = 0.8 \\), which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( v = 0.9 \\), \\( n = 1.5 \\):\n\n\\( (1.5*0.9 + 1)/(1.5 + 0.9) = (1.35 + 1)/2.4 = 2.35/2.4 ≈ 0.979 \\), which is less than 1, as required.\n\nTherefore, the formula seems to hold.\n\nAlternatively, if the glass is moving at speed \\( v \\), and the light is moving in the opposite direction, then the formula would be \\( ( -1/n + v ) / (1 - v/n ) \\), but in this problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so the formula is \\( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \\).\n\nBut let me check another approach. Let\'s use Lorentz transformations. Let the lab frame be \\( S \\), and the glass frame be \\( S\' \\), moving at velocity \\( v \\) relative to \\( S \\). In \\( S\' \\), the speed of light is \\( u\' = 1/n \\). Then, the speed in \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{u\' + v}{1 + u\' v} \\)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n} = \\frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \\).\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is \\( \\frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \\).\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another way to think about this. For example, considering the effective refractive index in the moving medium. However, that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the relativistic addition formula is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Doppler effect. But the Doppler effect relates to frequency and wavelength, not directly to the speed. The speed of light in a medium is a separate consideration.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the motion of the medium might alter the effective permittivity and permeability, hence changing the refractive index. However, that approach is more involved and would require knowledge of the medium\'s properties. But since the problem gives the refractive index \\( n \\), perhaps we can avoid that.\n\nIn conclusion, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the moving glass as observed in the lab frame is \\( (1 + n v)/(n + v) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444450, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3331, prompt_tokens=693, total_tokens=4024, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Speed of Light in Stationary Glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.
2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: When the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory frame, the speed of light in the laboratory frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass's rest frame) and \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum). Substituting these values, we get:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
3. **Simplification**: Multiplying the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

Hmm.

Alternatively, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, if the speed of light in the medium is \( u' = c/n \) in the medium's rest frame, then in the lab frame where the medium moves at speed \( v \), the observed speed \( u \) is:

\( u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}} \)

Since \( c = 1 \), this becomes:

\( u = \frac{(1/n) + v}{1 + (1/n)v} \)

But wait, is this correct? Let me check the direction. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, in the glass's frame, light moves at \( 1/n \). The lab frame sees the glass moving at \( v \), so we need to add the velocities relativistically.

Alternatively, if the medium is moving at velocity \( v \), then the speed of light in the lab frame would be:

\( u = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v c/n)/c^2} = \frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n} \)

Yes, that's the same as before.

But let me think again. Suppose the medium is moving at velocity \( v \), and in the medium's rest frame, the light speed is \( c/n \). Then, using the Lorentz velocity transformation, the lab frame speed is:

\( u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v/c^2} \)

Which, with \( c = 1 \), gives:

\( u = \frac{(1/n) + v}{1 + (v/n)} \)

So, that's the formula. Let's compute this:

\( u = \frac{v + 1/n}{1 + v/n} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\( u = \frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \)

But since \( c = 1 \), the units are consistent. So, the observed speed is \( (1 + n v)/(n + v) \).

Wait, no. Wait, numerator is \( n v + 1 \), denominator is \( n + v \). So, \( u = (n v + 1)/(n + v) \).

But let's check with some known cases. If \( v = 0 \), then \( u = (0 + 1)/(n + 0) = 1/n \), which is correct. If \( n = 1 \), meaning the medium is vacuum, then \( u = (v + 1)/(1 + v) = 1 \), which is correct. If \( v \) approaches 1 (the speed of light), then \( u = (n*1 + 1)/(n + 1) = (n + 1)/(n + 1) = 1 \), which makes sense, as nothing can exceed the speed of light.

Alternatively, if the medium is moving at velocity \( v \), and the light is moving in the same direction, then the speed observed in the lab frame is \( (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) \). Let's compute this for \( n = 2 \), \( v = 0.5 \):

\( (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8 \), which is less than 1. Alternatively, if \( v = 0.5 \), \( n = 1.5 \):

\( (1/1.5 + 0.5)/(1 + (0.5/1.5)) = (0.666... + 0.5)/(1 + 0.333...) = 1.166... / 1.333... ≈ 0.875 \), which is still less than 1.

Alternatively, if the medium moves opposite to the light direction, but in this problem, it's moving in the same direction. So, the formula seems to hold.

But wait, another approach. The phase velocity of light in a moving medium. The phase velocity in the lab frame can be calculated using the formula:

\( v_{\text{phase}} = \frac{c}{n} + v \left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) \)

This is the Fresnel drag coefficient. But this is an approximation for small velocities. However, the exact formula from relativity is different.

Wait, so which one is correct? The Fresnel drag formula is a pre-relativistic formula, but it was later found to be consistent with relativity. However, the relativistic velocity addition gives a different result. Let me check.

Suppose that in the rest frame of the medium, the speed of light is \( c/n \). Then, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed in the lab frame where the medium moves at speed \( v \) is:

\( u = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + (v c/n)/c^2} = \frac{c/n + v}{1 + v/(n c)} \)

Since \( c = 1 \), this is:

\( u = \frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n} \)

But the Fresnel drag formula is:

\( u = \frac{c}{n} + v \left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) \)

Let me compute both for small \( v \). Let's take \( v \ll 1 \). Then, the relativistic formula:

\( u ≈ (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n^2 - v^2/n \)

Ignoring \( v^2 \) terms:

\( u ≈ 1/n + v(1 - 1/n^2) \)

Which matches the Fresnel drag formula. So, the Fresnel drag is the first-order approximation of the relativistic velocity addition formula for small \( v \). Therefore, for non-relativistic speeds, both agree, but for higher speeds, the relativistic formula is more accurate.

Since the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \), but doesn't specify that \( v \) is small, we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Therefore, the exact speed is \( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \).

But let me check with an example. Suppose \( n = 2 \), \( v = 0.5 \). Then:

Relativistic formula: \( (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8 \)

Fresnel drag: \( 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*0.75 = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875 \)

So, different results. Therefore, if the problem allows for relativistic speeds, the answer is 0.8, but if it's non-relativistic, 0.875. However, since the problem doesn't specify, but given that in physics when velocities are involved without qualification, especially with light, we should use the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Fresnel drag formula. But why?

Wait, the problem says "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory". So, the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, but if the glass is moving toward the observer, then the light beam is moving toward the observer as well. So, the glass and the light are moving in the same direction, towards the observer. So, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.

Therefore, the velocity of the glass is in the same direction as the light. So, in the lab frame, the observer sees the glass moving at velocity \( v \), and the light is moving through the glass. So, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at \( 1/n \). Then, the lab frame sees the light moving at \( (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v) \).

Alternatively, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer, then the velocity of the glass is in the same direction as the light. So, the velocity addition formula applies as above.

Alternatively, if the glass were moving opposite to the light, we would subtract velocities, but here it's the same direction.

Therefore, the answer should be \( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \).

But let me check another source. For example, in the Feynman lectures, he discusses the moving medium. According to Feynman, the speed of light in a moving medium is given by \( c/n + v(1 - 1/n^2) \). But he mentions that this is an approximation. However, the exact formula is given by relativity.

Alternatively, Landau and Lifshitz in "The Classical Theory of Fields" discuss the propagation of light in a moving medium. They derive the expression for the velocity of light in a medium moving with velocity \( \mathbf{v} \):

\( \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v} + \frac{\mathbf{c}}{n} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{n^2} \times (\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{v})}{1 + \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{c}}{n c^2}} \)

But this is for an arbitrary direction. If the velocity is parallel to the direction of light propagation, then the cross product term vanishes, and the formula simplifies to:

\( u = \frac{v + c/n}{1 + (v c)/(n c^2)} = \frac{v + c/n}{1 + v/(n c)} \)

Which, with \( c = 1 \), becomes:

\( u = \frac{v + 1/n}{1 + v/n} \)

So, this matches the relativistic velocity addition formula. Therefore, the correct answer is \( (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) \).

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), after multiplying numerator and denominator by \( n \).

Wait, let's see:

\( \frac{v + 1/n}{1 + v/n} = \frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \)

Yes, multiplying numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\( \frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \)

So, that's another way to write it. Both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the answer is \( \frac{n v + 1}{n + v} \).

But let me check with an example. If \( n = 1 \), which is vacuum, then the speed is \( (v + 1)/(1 + v) = 1 \), which is correct. If \( v = 0 \), then the speed is \( 1/n \), which is correct. If \( n = 2 \), \( v = 0.5 \), then \( (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5) = (1 + 1)/2.5 = 2/2.5 = 0.8 \), which is the same as before.

Alternatively, if \( v = 0.9 \), \( n = 1.5 \):

\( (1.5*0.9 + 1)/(1.5 + 0.9) = (1.35 + 1)/2.4 = 2.35/2.4 ≈ 0.979 \), which is less than 1, as required.

Therefore, the formula seems to hold.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving at speed \( v \), and the light is moving in the opposite direction, then the formula would be \( ( -1/n + v ) / (1 - v/n ) \), but in this problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so the formula is \( (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) \).

Therefore, the answer is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

But let me check another approach. Let's use Lorentz transformations. Let the lab frame be \( S \), and the glass frame be \( S' \), moving at velocity \( v \) relative to \( S \). In \( S' \), the speed of light is \( u' = 1/n \). Then, the speed in \( S \) is given by:

\( u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v} \)

Which is the same as before.

Therefore, the answer is \( \frac{1/n + v}{1 + v/n} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. For example, considering the effective refractive index in the moving medium. However, that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the relativistic addition formula is straightforward.

Alternatively, considering the Doppler effect. But the Doppler effect relates to frequency and wavelength, not directly to the speed. The speed of light in a medium is a separate consideration.

Alternatively, considering that the motion of the medium might alter the effective permittivity and permeability, hence changing the refractive index. However, that approach is more involved and would require knowledge of the medium's properties. But since the problem gives the refractive index \( n \), perhaps we can avoid that.

In conclusion, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the moving glass as observed in the lab frame is \( (1 + n v)/(n + v) \).

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.
