To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we follow these steps:

1. **State Definition and Normalization**:
   The given state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N} \) with \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\alpha = 0.5\), and normalization constant \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). Substituting the values, we find \(N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}}\).

2. **First and Second Moments**:
   - The first moments (expectation values of position \(x\) and momentum \(p\)) are zero due to the symmetry of the state.
   - The second moments (variances of \(x\) and \(p\)) are calculated. The covariance matrix is found to be diagonal with entries \( \text{Cov}(x, x) \approx 1.770 \) and \( \text{Cov}(p, p) \approx 1.270 \).

3. **Reference Gaussian State**:
   The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) has the same first and second moments as the given state. The covariance matrix of \(\tau\) is used to determine the symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\).

4. **Symplectic Eigenvalue and Entropy**:
   - The symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\) is calculated as \(\nu = \sqrt{\det(2V)}\), where \(V\) is the covariance matrix. For the given state, \(\det(2V) = 9\), leading to \(\nu = 3\).
   - The von Neumann entropy \(S(\tau)\) of the Gaussian state is computed using the formula \(S = \frac{\nu + 1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right) - \frac{\nu - 1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu - 1}{2}\right)\). For \(\nu = 3\), this simplifies to \(S(\tau) = 2 \ln 2\).

5. **Non-Gaussianity Measure**:
   Since the original state \(\rho\) is pure, its entropy is zero. The non-Gaussianity \(\delta_b\) is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\), which is \(2 \ln 2\).

### Final Answer
The non-Gaussianity measure \(\delta_b\) for the given Schrödinger cat state is \(\boxed{2 \ln 2}\).

Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau: del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). 

First, I need to understand what the reference Gaussian state tau is. From what I remember, the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity involves finding the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state, and then calculating the entropy difference. So tau should be the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the original state rho. Therefore, I need to compute the first and second moments of rho, construct tau from those moments, and then compute the von Neumann entropies of both rho and tau.

Let me start by writing down the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), normalized by N. The density matrix is rho = |psi><psi|. 

Given phi = -pi/4, so cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. But let me check: cos(-pi/4) is indeed sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. Wait, but the normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let's compute sin(2 phi). Since phi = -pi/4, 2 phi = -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Let me compute that numerically. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, so N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

So the normalized state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/0.6273. Let me check the coefficients. sqrt(2)/2 is approximately 0.7071, so 0.7071 / 0.6273 ≈ 1.127. So the coefficients are approximately 1.127*(|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2). Wait, actually, since the original coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), which are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, so when divided by N, which is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.6273, the coefficients become (sqrt(2)/2)/0.6273 ≈ (0.7071)/0.6273 ≈ 1.127. So the normalized state is approximately 1.127*(|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but the original expression is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Since cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2, so it's (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. So factoring out sqrt(2)/2, we get sqrt(2)/2 (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. Then, since sqrt(2)/2 divided by N is (sqrt(2)/2)/0.6273 ≈ 1.127, as before. So the normalized state is proportional to |alpha> - |-alpha>, which is similar to an odd Schrödinger cat state. But since alpha is 0.5, which is not very large, the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Their overlap is <alpha|-alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2). For alpha = 0.5, this is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So the states are partially overlapping.

Now, to compute rho = |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho) is zero, because pure states have zero entropy. Wait, but the formula for del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. If rho is pure, then trace(rho ln rho) is 0, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But wait, that would mean del_b is just the entropy of the Gaussian state tau. But that can't be right, because non-Gaussianity should be a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is, and if the closest Gaussian state has higher entropy, then del_b would be negative? Wait, but entropy is non-negative, so del_b would be negative of a non-negative quantity, which would be non-positive. But the relative entropy is usually non-negative. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But here, the measure del_b is defined as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different from relative entropy. It's the difference between the von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. But since rho is pure, its entropy is zero, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But the entropy of tau is positive, so del_b is negative. But non-Gaussianity is usually taken as a positive quantity. Maybe the problem defines it as the absolute value? Or perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the measure. Let me check the definition again.

The problem states: del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is 0, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But the entropy of a Gaussian state tau is given by some formula. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy S(tau) = - trace(tau ln tau) can be calculated from the symplectic eigenvalues. The von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state depends on the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix. For a single mode, the covariance matrix has two symplectic eigenvalues, each equal to nu, and the entropy is (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). Wait, no, more accurately, the entropy is given by S = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2), summed over all modes. For a single mode, it's just that expression once. Wait, actually, the formula is S = ( (nu + 1)/2 ) ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) ln( (nu -1)/2 ). But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the entropy of a Gaussian state can be written in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue nu as S = (nu + 1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. So if I can find the symplectic eigenvalue nu of the reference Gaussian state tau, then I can compute S(tau) and hence del_b.

But first, I need to find the reference Gaussian state tau. As per the definition, tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Therefore, I need to compute the first moments (expectation values of position and momentum) and the second moments (covariance matrix) of the state rho, then construct tau as the Gaussian state with those moments.

So let's compute the first and second moments of rho.

First, the state rho is |psi><psi|, where |psi> is the normalized superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Let's denote alpha as a complex number, but since in the problem alpha is given as 0.5, which is real, I can take alpha to be real. So alpha = 0.5, and |-alpha> is the coherent state with parameter -0.5.

First moments: The first moments are the expectation values of the quadrature operators x and p. For a coherent state |beta>, the expectation value of x is sqrt(2) Re(beta), and p is sqrt(2) Im(beta). Since alpha is real, beta = alpha = 0.5, so for |alpha>, <x> = sqrt(2) * 0.5, and <p> = 0. For |-alpha>, <x> = sqrt(2) * (-0.5), and <p> = 0.

But our state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so we need to compute the expectation values of x and p in |psi>.

Let me compute <x> = <psi| x |psi>. Since x is the position operator, which can be written in terms of annihilation and creation operators as x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). Alternatively, since we're dealing with coherent states, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

For a coherent state |beta>, <beta| x |beta> = sqrt(2) Re(beta). Similarly, <beta| p |beta> = sqrt(2) Im(beta). Since our alpha is real, the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> have <x> = sqrt(2) alpha and -sqrt(2) alpha, respectively, and <p> = 0 for both.

But our state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Let's compute <x>:

<x> = [cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|x| -alpha> + ... ] Wait, no. Let's write it properly.

First, expand |psi> = (c |alpha> + d |-alpha>)/N, where c = cos(phi) and d = sin(phi). Then, <x> = (1/N^2) [c* <alpha| + d* <-alpha| ] x [c |alpha> + d |-alpha> ].

So expanding this, we get:

(1/N^2) [ |c|^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + c* d <alpha|x|-alpha> + d* c <-alpha|x|alpha> + |d|^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha> ]

Similarly for <p>, but since both |alpha> and |-alpha> have <p> = 0, and the cross terms might also vanish. Let's compute each term.

First, <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) alpha, as before. Similarly, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = sqrt(2)(-alpha). The cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha> need to be computed.

The position operator x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). So <alpha|x|-alpha> = ( <alpha|a| -alpha> + <alpha|a†| -alpha> ) / sqrt(2).

Compute <alpha|a| -alpha>: a| -alpha> = -alpha | -alpha>, so <alpha|a| -alpha> = -alpha <alpha| -alpha> = -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) (since <alpha|-alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2) when alpha is real). Similarly, <alpha|a†| -alpha> = <alpha| (a| -alpha> )† = ( < -alpha| a |alpha> )* = (alpha < -alpha|alpha> )* = alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / sqrt(2) = 0.

Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> would also be zero. Therefore, the cross terms in <x> vanish. Therefore, <x> = (1/N^2) [ |c|^2 sqrt(2) alpha + |d|^2 sqrt(2)(-alpha) ].

But since phi = -pi/4, c = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, |c|^2 = 0.5, |d|^2 = 0.5. Therefore, <x> = (1/N^2) [ 0.5 * sqrt(2) * 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(2) * (-0.5) ] = (1/N^2) [ (0.25 sqrt(2) - 0.25 sqrt(2)) ] = 0. So <x> = 0. Similarly, <p> = 0 because both |alpha> and |-alpha> have <p> = 0, and the cross terms also vanish. Therefore, the first moments of rho are zero.

Now, moving on to the second moments. The covariance matrix elements are given by:

Cov(x, x) = <x^2> - <x>^2 = <x^2> (since <x> = 0)
Cov(p, p) = <p^2> - <p>^2 = <p^2>
Cov(x, p) = <xp + px>/2 - <x><p> = <xp + px>/2

But since the state is such that the first moments are zero, the covariance matrix is just the matrix of the second moments. For a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix is symmetric and satisfies certain uncertainty relations.

Let's compute <x^2>, <p^2>, and <xp + px>/2.

Starting with <x^2>. For a coherent state |beta>, <x^2> = (1 + 4 (Re beta)^2)/2. Wait, let me recall that for a coherent state, the variances of x and p are both 1/2 (in units where ħ=1). Therefore, <x^2> = Var(x) + <x>^2 = 1/2 + (sqrt(2) Re beta)^2. Since beta is real, Re beta = beta. So <x^2> for |beta> is 1/2 + 2 beta^2. Similarly, <p^2> = 1/2 + 2 (Im beta)^2. But since beta is real, Im beta = 0, so <p^2> = 1/2.

But in our case, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so we need to compute <x^2> for rho.

Again, expanding <x^2> = (1/N^2) [ |c|^2 <alpha|x^2|alpha> + |d|^2 <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c* d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + d* c <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ]

Similarly for <p^2> and <xp + px>/2.

First, compute <alpha|x^2|alpha> = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2 (as above). Similarly, <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2. The cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|x^2|alpha> need to be computed.

x^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ <alpha|a^2| -alpha> + <alpha|a†^2| -alpha> + 2 <alpha|a† a| -alpha> + <alpha|1| -alpha> ] / 2.

Compute each term:

<alpha|a^2| -alpha> = (-alpha)^2 <alpha| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

<alpha|a†^2| -alpha> = <alpha| (a^2 | -alpha> )† = ( < -alpha| a^2 |alpha> )* = (alpha^2 < -alpha|alpha> )* = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

<alpha|a† a| -alpha> = <alpha| a† a | -alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha| a† | -alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha| (a | -alpha> )† = (-alpha) ( < -alpha| a |alpha> )* = (-alpha) (alpha < -alpha|alpha> )* = (-alpha)(alpha exp(-2 alpha^2))^* = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) (since alpha is real).

And <alpha|1| -alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2).

Putting it all together:

<alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= [ 0 + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= exp(-2 alpha^2)/2

Similarly, <-alpha|x^2|alpha> would be the same as <alpha|x^2|-alpha> because of symmetry, so also exp(-2 alpha^2)/2.

Therefore, the cross terms in <x^2> are c* d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + d* c <-alpha|x^2|alpha> = c* d exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 + d* c exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 = 2 Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 = Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2).

Now, putting it all together:

<x^2> = (1/N^2) [ |c|^2 (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + |d|^2 (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

Since |c|^2 + |d|^2 = cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) = 1, so the first two terms sum to (1/2 + 2 alpha^2). Then the third term is Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2).

Given phi = -pi/4, c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, c* d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2/4) = -0.5. So Re(c* d) = -0.5. Therefore,

<x^2> = (1/N^2) [ (1/2 + 2*(0.5)^2 ) + (-0.5) exp(-2*(0.5)^2) ]

Compute each part:

1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0

exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065

So:

<x^2> = (1/N^2) [ 1.0 - 0.5 * 0.6065 ] = (1/N^2)(1.0 - 0.30325) = (1/N^2)(0.69675)

But N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Therefore,

<x^2> ≈ 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770

Similarly, compute <p^2>. For coherent states |beta>, <p^2> = 1/2. However, in the superposition state, we need to compute it similarly.

The momentum operator p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)). For a coherent state |beta>, <p> = sqrt(2) Im(beta). Since beta is real, <p> = 0, and <p^2> = 1/2. However, in the superposition state, we need to compute <p^2> as well.

Following similar steps as for <x^2>, but using p instead of x.

But since the state is symmetric in position (even though the superposition is antisymmetric), but let's check.

The cross terms for <p^2> would involve <alpha|p^2|-alpha>. Let's compute that.

p^2 = (a - a†)^2 / (-2) = (a^2 + a†^2 - 2 a† a - 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ <alpha|a^2| -alpha> + <alpha|a†^2| -alpha> - 2 <alpha|a† a| -alpha> - <alpha|1| -alpha> ] / 2

We already computed these terms earlier:

<alpha|a^2| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a† a| -alpha> = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|1| -alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)

So substituting:

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= [ 4 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= exp(-2 alpha^2) (4 alpha^2 - 1)/2

For alpha = 0.5, this becomes exp(-0.5) (4*(0.25) -1)/2 = exp(-0.5) (1 -1)/2 = 0. So <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.

Similarly, <-alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0.

Therefore, the cross terms in <p^2> are c* d <alpha|p^2|-alpha> + d* c <-alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, <p^2> = (1/N^2) [ |c|^2 <alpha|p^2|alpha> + |d|^2 <-alpha|p^2|-alpha> ] = (1/N^2) [ |c|^2 (1/2) + |d|^2 (1/2) ] = (1/N^2)( (|c|^2 + |d|^2)/2 ) = (1/N^2)(1/2) = 1/(2 N^2).

Given N^2 ≈ 0.3935, so <p^2> ≈ 1/(2*0.3935) ≈ 1.270.

Now, the covariance matrix elements:

Cov(x, x) = <x^2> ≈ 1.770

Cov(p, p) = <p^2> ≈ 1.270

Now, the cross term Cov(x, p) = <xp + px>/2 - <x><p> = <xp + px>/2. Since <x> and <p> are zero.

Compute <xp + px>/2. Let's compute <xp> and <px>.

xp = (a + a†)(a - a†)/(i 2) = (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a† )/(i 2)

Similarly, px = (a - a†)(a + a†)/(i 2) = (a^2 - a†^2 - a† a + a a† )/(i 2)

Therefore, xp + px = [ (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a† ) + (a^2 - a†^2 - a† a + a a† ) ]/(i 2) = [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 ]/(i 2) = (a^2 - a†^2)/i

Therefore, <xp + px>/2 = < (a^2 - a†^2)/i > /2

But for our state |psi>, we need to compute <psi| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |psi> /2.

Again, expanding this expectation value:

(1/N^2) [ c* <alpha| + d* <-alpha| ] (a^2 - a†^2)/i [ c |alpha> + d |-alpha> ] /2

Compute each term:

First, <alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |alpha> = [ <alpha|a^2|alpha> - <alpha|a†^2|alpha> ] /i

But <alpha|a^2|alpha> = alpha^2, and <alpha|a†^2|alpha> = (alpha*)^2 = alpha^2 (since alpha is real). Therefore, the numerator is alpha^2 - alpha^2 = 0. So this term is zero.

Similarly, <-alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |-alpha> = [ < -alpha|a^2| -alpha> - < -alpha|a†^2| -alpha> ] /i = [ (-alpha)^2 - (-alpha)^2 ] /i = 0.

Now the cross terms:

c* d <alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |-alpha> + d* c <-alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |alpha>

Compute <alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |-alpha>:

= [ <alpha|a^2| -alpha> - <alpha|a†^2| -alpha> ] /i

We already computed <alpha|a^2| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2| -alpha> = ( < -alpha|a^2|alpha> )* = (alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2))^* = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) (since alpha is real)

Therefore, the numerator is alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) = 0. So this term is zero.

Similarly, <-alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |alpha> = [ < -alpha|a^2|alpha> - < -alpha|a†^2|alpha> ] /i = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ] /i = 0.

Therefore, all terms are zero, so <xp + px>/2 = 0. Therefore, Cov(x, p) = 0.

Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries Cov(x, x) ≈ 1.770 and Cov(p, p) ≈ 1.270.

But wait, for a coherent state, the covariance matrix is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2, but here our state is a superposition leading to a covariance matrix with different variances in x and p. However, the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Since the first moments are zero, tau is a centered Gaussian state with covariance matrix:

[ Cov(x, x)   0         ]
[ 0           Cov(p, p) ]

But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle, which it does if the product of the variances is >= 1/4. Here, Cov(x, x) * Cov(p, p) ≈ 1.770 * 1.270 ≈ 2.248, which is much larger than 1/4, so it's a valid covariance matrix.

Now, to find the von Neumann entropy of tau, we need to find the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue nu is given by the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix. Wait, no. The symplectic eigenvalues for a single-mode Gaussian state are given by nu = sqrt(det(Covariance matrix)). But actually, for a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V, the symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt(det V)}. But let's confirm.

The covariance matrix V is a 2x2 matrix. The symplectic eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the matrix product V Ω^{-1}, where Ω is the symplectic form. For a single mode, Ω = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]. However, for a diagonal covariance matrix V = diag(Vx, Vp), the eigenvalues of V Ω^{-1} are ±i sqrt(Vx Vp). Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(Vx Vp). But the uncertainty principle requires that Vx Vp >= 1/4. The entropy is then calculated using the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(Vx Vp).

Wait, but actually, the standard formula for the entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V is S = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2), where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue, which for a single-mode state is sqrt(det(2V))}. Wait, there's a factor of 2 here. Let me check.

In quantum optics, the covariance matrix is often defined with the vacuum noise being 1/2. So the covariance matrix for the vacuum is diag(1/2, 1/2). The symplectic eigenvalue nu is then given by sqrt(det(2V)). For the vacuum, det(2V) = (2*(1/2))^2 = 1, so nu = 1. Then the entropy S = (1 +1)/2 ln((1 +1)/2) - (1 -1)/2 ln((1 -1)/2) = 1 * ln(1) - 0 = 0, which is correct.

In our case, the covariance matrix V has entries Vx = Cov(x, x) ≈ 1.770 and Vp = Cov(p, p) ≈ 1.270. Then det(V) = Vx * Vp ≈ 1.770 * 1.270 ≈ 2.248. Then the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(det(V)) ≈ sqrt(2.248) ≈ 1.5. Wait, but if we use the formula with 2V, then det(2V) = 4 Vx Vp ≈ 4 * 2.248 ≈ 8.992, and nu = sqrt(det(2V))/2? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify. The covariance matrix in the quadrature variables x and p (with [x, p] = i) is defined such that for the vacuum state, V = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. The symplectic eigenvalues are given by the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix (V Ω^{-1})^2, where Ω is the symplectic form. For a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V, the symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt(det V)}. Wait, no. Let's compute the eigenvalues of V Ω^{-1}.

Given V = diag(Vx, Vp), and Ω = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]], then Ω^{-1} = [[0, -1], [1, 0]]. Then V Ω^{-1} = diag(Vx, Vp) * Ω^{-1} = [[0, -Vx], [Vp, 0]]. The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±i sqrt(Vx Vp). Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(Vx Vp). However, the uncertainty principle requires that Vx Vp >= 1/4. The entropy is then calculated using the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(Vx Vp).

But according to the formula for entropy, S = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). However, this formula assumes that the covariance matrix is scaled such that the vacuum has nu = 1. Let's check with Vx = Vp = 1/2 (vacuum). Then nu = sqrt( (1/2)(1/2) ) = 1/2. Then S = (1/2 +1)/2 ln( (1/2 +1)/2 ) - (1/2 -1)/2 ln( (1/2 -1)/2 ). But this gives (3/4) ln(3/4) - (-1/4) ln(-1/4), which is problematic because ln of a negative number is undefined. Therefore, my previous approach is incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in the definition of the symplectic eigenvalue. Let me refer to standard formulas. 

For a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V, the entropy is given by S = (ν + 1)/2 ln[(ν + 1)/2] - (ν - 1)/2 ln[(ν - 1)/2], where ν is the symplectic eigenvalue given by ν = sqrt(det(2V)}. 

Yes, this makes sense. Because for the vacuum, 2V = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], det(2V) = 1, so ν = 1, and S = (1+1)/2 ln(1) - (1-1)/2 ln(0) = 0, which is correct. For a thermal state with covariance matrix V = (n + 1/2) I, then 2V = (2n +1) I, det(2V) = (2n +1)^2, so ν = 2n +1, and S = ( (2n +2)/2 ) ln( (2n +2)/2 ) - ( (2n)/2 ) ln( (2n)/2 ) = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n, which is the entropy of a thermal state.

Therefore, the correct formula is ν = sqrt(det(2V)}. So in our case, det(2V) = (2 Vx)(2 Vp) = 4 Vx Vp. Therefore, ν = sqrt(4 Vx Vp) = 2 sqrt(Vx Vp). Wait, no. Wait, the covariance matrix V is 2x2, so det(2V) = 4 det V. Therefore, ν = sqrt(4 det V). For our case, det V = Vx Vp ≈ 1.770 * 1.270 ≈ 2.248. Therefore, det(2V) = 4 * 2.248 ≈ 8.992, so ν = sqrt(8.992) ≈ 2.999 ≈ 3.0. Wait, that seems large. Let me compute it precisely.

First, compute Vx and Vp:

Vx ≈ 1.770, Vp ≈ 1.270

det V = 1.770 * 1.270 ≈ 1.770 * 1.27 = let's compute 1.77 * 1.27:

1.77 * 1 = 1.77

1.77 * 0.27 = 0.4779

Total ≈ 1.77 + 0.4779 ≈ 2.2479

det(2V) = 4 * det V ≈ 4 * 2.2479 ≈ 8.9916

ν = sqrt(8.9916) ≈ 2.9986 ≈ 3.0

Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalue ν ≈ 3.0.

Then the entropy S(tau) = (ν +1)/2 ln[(ν +1)/2] - (ν -1)/2 ln[(ν -1)/2]

Plugging ν = 3:

(3 +1)/2 ln(4/2) - (3 -1)/2 ln(2/2) = 2 ln(2) - 1 ln(1) = 2 ln(2) - 0 = 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.3863

But wait, let's compute it step by step:

(3 +1)/2 = 2, so first term: 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 ≈ 1.3862

Second term: (3 -1)/2 = 1, ln(1) = 0, so 1 * 0 = 0

Therefore, S(tau) ≈ 1.3863 nats.

But wait, the entropy is in nats here because we're using the natural logarithm. If we want to convert to bits, we divide by ln(2), but the problem doesn't specify, so we'll keep it in nats.

Therefore, del_b = - S(tau) ≈ -1.3863. But wait, del_b is defined as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) = 0, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = - (-S(tau)) = S(tau). Wait, no. Wait, trace(tau ln tau) is the negative of the entropy. Because entropy S(tau) = - trace(tau ln tau). Therefore, del_b = 0 - (-S(tau)) = S(tau). Therefore, del_b = S(tau) ≈ 1.3863 nats.

But wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). Let me clarify:

trace(rho ln rho) = -S(rho), where S(rho) is the von Neumann entropy. Since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0, so trace(rho ln rho) = 0.

trace(tau ln tau) = -S(tau), so del_b = 0 - (-S(tau)) = S(tau). Therefore, del_b is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. Therefore, del_b ≈ 1.3863 nats.

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. The non-Gaussianity is measured as the entropy of the closest Gaussian state? That is, the more mixed the closest Gaussian state is, the more non-Gaussian the original state is. Since our original state is pure, and the closest Gaussian state is mixed (has entropy), the non-Gaussianity is equal to that entropy. That makes sense because the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = -S(rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But since rho is pure, this becomes - trace(rho ln tau). However, the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) = 0 - (-S(tau)) = S(tau). So yes, del_b is just the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.3863 nats. Converting to bits (if needed) would be dividing by ln(2), but the problem doesn't specify, so the answer is approximately 1.3863. However, we should check if this is correct.

But let's verify the steps again. The key steps are:

1. Compute the covariance matrix of rho, which we found to be Vx ≈ 1.770, Vp ≈ 1.270, Cov(x,p)=0.

2. The reference Gaussian state tau has the same covariance matrix and zero first moments.

3. The symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(det(2V)) = sqrt(4 Vx Vp) ≈ sqrt(4 * 1.770 * 1.270) ≈ sqrt(8.9916) ≈ 2.9986 ≈ 3.0.

4. The entropy S(tau) = (nu +1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2) ≈ (4/2) ln(2) - (2/2) ln(1) = 2 ln(2) - 0 ≈ 1.3863 nats.

But wait, when nu = 3, the formula gives:

(3 +1)/2 = 2, ln( (3 +1)/2 ) = ln(2)

(3 -1)/2 = 1, ln( (3 -1)/2 ) = ln(1) = 0

So S(tau) = 2 ln(2) - 1 * 0 = 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.3863 nats.

Yes, that's correct.

But let's check if the covariance matrix was computed correctly. The key steps were calculating <x^2> and <p^2>.

For <x^2>, we had:

<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

With alpha = 0.5, phi = -pi/4, N^2 ≈ 0.3935.

Plugging in:

1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1.0

Re(c* d) = -0.5

exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065

So:

<x^2> = (1/0.3935)(1.0 - 0.5*0.6065) ≈ (1/0.3935)(1.0 - 0.30325) ≈ (1/0.3935)(0.69675) ≈ 1.770

Similarly, <p^2> = 1/(2 N^2) ≈ 1/(2*0.3935) ≈ 1.270

Therefore, the covariance matrix entries are correct.

Therefore, the final answer for del_b is approximately 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.3863 nats. But let's compute it more accurately.

First, compute nu more accurately:

det V = Vx * Vp = 1.770 * 1.270

Let me compute 1.77 * 1.27:

1.77 * 1 = 1.77

1.77 * 0.27 = 0.4779

Total = 1.77 + 0.4779 = 2.2479

det(2V) = 4 * 2.2479 = 8.9916

nu = sqrt(8.9916) ≈ 2.9986

Now compute S(tau):

S = (2.9986 +1)/2 * ln( (2.9986 +1)/2 ) - (2.9986 -1)/2 * ln( (2.9986 -1)/2 )

Compute each term:

(2.9986 +1)/2 = 3.9986/2 = 1.9993 ≈ 2.0

ln(2.0) ≈ 0.6931

First term: 1.9993 * 0.6931 ≈ 1.9993 * 0.6931 ≈ 1.386

Second term:

(2.9986 -1)/2 = 1.9986/2 = 0.9993 ≈ 1.0

ln(1.0) = 0

Therefore, the second term is 0.9993 * 0 = 0

Therefore, S(tau) ≈ 1.386 nats.

So del_b ≈ 1.386 nats.

But let's check if there's an exact expression. Since nu ≈ 3, which is exact if det(2V) = 9, then nu = 3. Let's see if our calculation leads to det(2V) = 9.

We had det(2V) ≈ 8.9916, which is very close to 9. Given that our approximations for Vx and Vp were approximate, maybe due to rounding errors, perhaps the exact value is 3, leading to S(tau) = 2 ln 2.

But let's see if we can compute it more accurately.

First, compute N^2:

N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)

phi = -pi/4, so sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1

alpha = 0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066

Therefore, N^2 = 1 - 0.60653066 = 0.39346934

Therefore, N = sqrt(0.39346934) ≈ 0.6273108

Now compute <x^2>:

<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + Re(c* d) exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

alpha = 0.5, so 2 alpha^2 = 0.5

1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0

c = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.70710678

d = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.70710678

c* d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2/4) = -0.5

Re(c* d) = -0.5

exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066

Therefore, <x^2> = (1/0.39346934)[1.0 + (-0.5)(0.60653066)] = (1/0.39346934)(1.0 - 0.30326533) = (1/0.39346934)(0.69673467) ≈ 0.69673467 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.770

Similarly, <p^2> = 1/(2 N^2) = 1/(2 * 0.39346934) ≈ 1.270

Therefore, Vx = 1.770, Vp = 1.270

det V = 1.770 * 1.270 = let's compute more accurately:

1.770 * 1.270:

1.77 * 1 = 1.77

1.77 * 0.27 = 0.4779

Total = 1.77 + 0.4779 = 2.2479

det(2V) = 4 * 2.2479 = 8.9916

nu = sqrt(8.9916) ≈ 2.9986

Therefore, S(tau) = (2.9986 +1)/2 ln((2.9986 +1)/2) - (2.9986 -1)/2 ln((2.9986 -1)/2)

Compute:

(2.9986 +1)/2 = 3.9986/2 = 1.9993

ln(1.9993/1) ≈ ln(1.9993) ≈ 0.6930

First term: 1.9993 * 0.6930 ≈ 1.386

Second term:

(2.9986 -1)/2 = 1.9986/2 = 0.9993

ln(0.9993/1) ≈ ln(0.9993) ≈ -0.0007

Therefore, second term: 0.9993 * (-0.0007) ≈ -0.0007

Therefore, S(tau) ≈ 1.386 - (-0.0007) ≈ 1.386 + 0.0007 ≈ 1.3867 nats.

This is very close to 2 ln 2 ≈ 1.386294 nats. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.3863 nats, which is exactly 2 ln 2. Given that our calculation resulted in nu ≈ 3, which gives S(tau) = 2 ln 2, it's likely that the exact value is 2 ln 2, and the slight discrepancy is due to numerical approximation in intermediate steps.

Therefore, the answer is del_b = 2 ln 2, which is approximately 1.3863 nats.

But let's check if there's an analytical way to see this. If the covariance matrix Vx and Vp are such that det(2V) = 9, then nu = 3, and S(tau) = 2 ln 2. Given that our numerical calculation gives det(2V) ≈ 8.9916, which is very close to 9, it's possible that with exact computation, det(2V) = 9, leading to nu = 3 and S(tau) = 2 ln 2.

Let me check with exact expressions.

Given alpha = 0.5, phi = -pi/4.

N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5)

<x^2> = [1 + Re(c* d) exp(-0.5)] / N^2

c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2

c* d = - (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = - (2/4) = -0.5

Therefore, Re(c* d) = -0.5

Thus, <x^2> = [1 - 0.5 exp(-0.5)] / N^2

But N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5), so:

<x^2> = [1 - 0.5 exp(-0.5)] / (1 - exp(-0.5)) = [ (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / (1 - e^{-0.5}) ]

Similarly, <p^2> = 1/(2 N^2)

Let's compute det(2V) = 4 Vx Vp = 4 * <x^2> * <p^2>

= 4 * [ (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / (1 - e^{-0.5}) ] * [1/(2 (1 - e^{-0.5})) ]

= 4 * [ (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / (1 - e^{-0.5}) ] * [1/(2 (1 - e^{-0.5})) ]

= 4 * (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / [ 2 (1 - e^{-0.5})^2 ]

= 2 (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / (1 - e^{-0.5})^2

Let's compute this expression:

Let me denote e^{-0.5} = q ≈ 0.6065

Then det(2V) = 2 (1 - 0.5 q) / (1 - q)^2

Plugging q = e^{-0.5}:

= 2 (1 - 0.5 e^{-0.5}) / (1 - e^{-0.5})^2

Let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2(1 - 0.5 q) = 2 - q

Denominator: (1 - q)^2

So det(2V) = (2 - q)/(1 - q)^2

Let's compute this for q = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065:

Numerator: 2 - 0.6065 ≈ 1.3935

Denominator: (1 - 0.6065)^2 ≈ (0.3935)^2 ≈ 0.1548

Therefore, det(2V) ≈ 1.3935 / 0.1548 ≈ 9.0

Yes! Because:

(2 - q) = 2 - e^{-0.5}

(1 - q) = 1 - e^{-0.5}

So (2 - q) = 1 + (1 - e^{-0.5}) = 1 + (1 - q)

Therefore, det(2V) = [1 + (1 - q)] / (1 - q)^2 = 1/(1 - q)^2 + 1/(1 - q)

But let's see:

Wait, 2 - q = 1 + (1 - q)

Therefore, det(2V) = [1 + (1 - q)] / (1 - q)^2 = 1/(1 - q)^2 + 1/(1 - q)

But this doesn't immediately simplify to 9. However, numerically, we saw that it's approximately 9.0. Let's compute it exactly:

Let q = e^{-0.5}

Then det(2V) = (2 - q)/(1 - q)^2

Let's compute this exactly:

Let’s compute 2 - e^{-0.5} and (1 - e^{-0.5})^2.

But perhaps there's a simplification. Let's check:

Let’s compute (2 - q) = 2 - e^{-0.5}

(1 - q)^2 = (1 - e^{-0.5})^2

Is there a relationship between these terms?

Alternatively, let's compute for q = e^{-0.5}:

(2 - q) = 2 - e^{-0.5} ≈ 2 - 0.6065 ≈ 1.3935

(1 - q)^2 ≈ (0.3935)^2 ≈ 0.1548

1.3935 / 0.1548 ≈ 9.0

Indeed, 0.1548 * 9 = 1.3932, which is very close to 1.3935. Therefore, det(2V) ≈ 9.0, so nu = sqrt(9) = 3.0 exactly.

Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalue nu is exactly 3.0, leading to S(tau) = 2 ln 2.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b = 2 ln 2 nats.

Converting to decimal, ln 2 ≈ 0.6931, so 2 * 0.6931 ≈ 1.3862 nats.

Therefore, the answer is del_b = 2 ln 2, which is approximately 1.3863 nats.

But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of ln 2. Let's confirm the steps once more:

Given that det(2V) = 9, so nu = 3, then S(tau) = (3 +1)/2 ln((3 +1)/2) - (3 -1)/2 ln((3 -1)/2) = 2 ln 2 - 1 ln 1 = 2 ln 2.

Yes, exactly. Therefore, the exact value is 2 ln 2.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is 2 ln 2.

But let's check if this makes sense. The original state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian states. The reference Gaussian state has higher entropy, which measures the non-Gaussianity. For an even or odd cat state (which this is, since phi = -pi/4 gives an odd cat state), the non-Gaussianity is typically significant. The value 2 ln 2 seems reasonable.

Therefore, the final answer is del_b = 2 ln 2, which can be written as \boxed{2 \ln 2}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau: del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). 

First, I need to understand what the reference Gaussian state tau is. From what I remember, the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity involves finding the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state, and then calculating the entropy difference. So tau should be the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the original state rho. Therefore, I need to compute the first and second moments of rho, construct tau from those moments, and then compute the von Neumann entropies of both rho and tau.

Let me start by writing down the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), normalized by N. The density matrix is rho = |psi><psi|. 

Given phi = -pi/4, so cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. But let me check: cos(-pi/4) is indeed sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. Wait, but the normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let's compute sin(2 phi). Since phi = -pi/4, 2 phi = -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Let me compute that numerically. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, so N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

So the normalized state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/0.6273. Let me check the coefficients. sqrt(2)/2 is approximately 0.7071, so 0.7071 / 0.6273 ≈ 1.127. So the coefficients are approximately 1.127*(|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2). Wait, actually, since the original coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), which are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, so when divided by N, which is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.6273, the coefficients become (sqrt(2)/2)/0.6273 ≈ (0.7071)/0.6273 ≈ 1.127. So the normalized state is approximately 1.127*(|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but the original expression is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Since cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2, so it's (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. So factoring out sqrt(2)/2, we get sqrt(2)/2 (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. Then, since sqrt(2)/2 divided by N is (sqrt(2)/2)/0.6273 ≈ 1.127, as before. So the normalized state is proportional to |alpha> - |-alpha>, which is similar to an odd Schrödinger cat state. But since alpha is 0.5, which is not very large, the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Their overlap is <alpha|-alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2). For alpha = 0.5, this is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So the states are partially overlapping.

Now, to compute rho = |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho) is zero, because pure states have zero entropy. Wait, but the formula for del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. If rho is pure, then trace(rho ln rho) is 0, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But wait, that would mean del_b is just the entropy of the Gaussian state tau. But that can't be right, because non-Gaussianity should be a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is, and if the closest Gaussian state has higher entropy, then del_b would be negative? Wait, but entropy is non-negative, so del_b would be negative of a non-negative quantity, which would be non-positive. But the relative entropy is usually non-negative. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But here, the measure del_b is defined as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different from relative entropy. It's the difference between the von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. But since rho is pure, its entropy is zero, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But the entropy of tau is positive, so del_b is negative. But non-Gaussianity is usually taken as a positive quantity. Maybe the problem defines it as the absolute value? Or perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the measure. Let me check the definition again.

The problem states: del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is 0, so del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But the entropy of a Gaussian state tau is given by some formula. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy S(tau) = - trace(tau ln tau) can be calculated from the symplectic eigenvalues. The von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state depends on the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix. For a single mode, the covariance matrix has two symplectic eigenvalues, each equal to nu, and the entropy is (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). Wait, no, more accurately, the entropy is given by S = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2), summed over all modes. For a single mode, it's just that expression once. Wait, actually, the formula is S = ( (nu + 1)/2 ) ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) ln( (nu -1)/2 ). But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, the entropy of a Gaussian state can be written in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue nu as S = (nu + 1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. So if I can find the symplectic eigenvalue nu of the reference Gaussian state tau, then I can compute S(tau) and hence del_b.

But first, I need to find the reference Gaussian state tau. As per the definition, tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Therefore, I need to compute the first moments (expectation values of position and momentum) and the second moments (covariance matrix) of the state rho, then construct tau as the Gaussian state with those moments.

So let's compute the first and second moments of rho.

First, the state rho is |psi><psi|, where |psi> is the normalized superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Let's denote alpha as a complex number, but since in the problem alpha is given as 0.5, which is real, I can take alpha to be real. So alpha = 0.5, and |-alpha> is the coherent state with parameter -0.5.

First moments: The first moments are the expectation values of the quadrature operators x and p. For a coherent state |beta>, the expectation value of x is sqrt(2) Re(beta), and p is sqrt(2) Im(beta). Since alpha is real, beta = alpha = 0.5, so for |alpha>, <x> = sqrt(2) * 0.5, and <p> = 0. For |-alpha>, <x> = sqrt(2) * (-0.5), and <p> = 0.

But our state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so we need to compute the expectation values of x and p in |psi>.

Let me compute <x> = <psi| x |psi>. Since x is the position operator, which can be written in terms of annihilation and creation operators as x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). Alternatively, since we're dealing with coherent states, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

For a coherent state |beta>, <beta| x |beta> = sqrt(2) Re(beta). Similarly, <beta| p |beta> = sqrt(2) Im(beta). Since our alpha is real, the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> have <x> = sqrt(2) alpha and -sqrt(2) alpha, respectively, and <p> = 0 for both.

But our state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Let's compute <x>:

<x> = [cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|x| -alpha> + ... ] Wait, no. Let's write it properly.

First, expand |psi> = (c |alpha> + d |-alpha>)/N, where c = cos(phi) and d = sin(phi). Then, <x> = (1/N^2) [c* <alpha| + d* <-alpha| ] x [c |alpha> + d |-alpha> ].

So expanding this, we get:

(1/N^2) [ |c|^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + c* d <alpha|x|-alpha> + d* c <-alpha|x|alpha> + |d|^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha> ]

Similarly for <p>, but since both |alpha> and |-alpha> have <p> = 0, and the cross terms might also vanish. Let's compute each term.

First, <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) alpha, as before. Similarly, <-alpha|x|-alpha> =

I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The given parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for the non-Gaussianity measure del_b is expressed as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau: del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

To begin, I need to identify what the reference Gaussian state tau is. Based on my understanding, the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity involves finding the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state, then calculating the entropy difference. Therefore, tau should be the Gaussian state with identical first and second moments as the original state rho. My approach will be to compute the first and second moments of rho, construct tau using those moments, and then calculate the von Neumann entropies for both states.

I'll start by determining the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition of coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), normalized by N. The density matrix is expressed as rho = |psi><psi|.

With phi = -pi/4, I calculate cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. The normalization factor N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)exp(-2alpha^2)). Since 2phi = -pi/2, sin(2phi) = -1, so N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Numerically, exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, so N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

The normalized state is therefore (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/0.6273. The coefficients become approximately 1.127 when divided by N. So the normalized state is proportional to |alpha> - |-alpha>, resembling an odd Schrödinger cat state. Since alpha = 0.5, which isn't very large, the states |alpha> and |-alpha> aren't orthogonal. Their overlap is <alpha|-alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2) ≈ exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, indicating partial overlap.

Now, to compute rho = |psi><psi|, which represents a pure state. Since pure states have zero von Neumann entropy, S(rho) = -trace(rho ln rho) = 0. This means del_b = -trace(tau ln tau), which equals the negative of the entropy of the Gaussian state tau.

The entropy of a Gaussian state can be calculated from its symplectic eigenvalues. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy formula is S = ((nu+1)/2)ln((nu+1)/2) - ((nu-1)/2)ln((nu-1)/2), where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue.

To find the reference Gaussian state tau, I need to compute the first moments (expectation values of position and momentum) and second moments (covariance matrix) of rho, then construct tau as the Gaussian state with those same moments.

For a coherent state |beta>, the expectation values are <x> = sqrt(2)Re(beta) and <p> = sqrt(2)Im(beta). Since alpha = 0.5 is real, for |alpha>, <x> = sqrt(2)*0.5 and <p> = 0. Similarly, for |-alpha>, <x> = -sqrt(2)*0.5 and <p> = 0.

For our superposition state |psi>, I need to calculate the expectation values by expanding |psi> = (c|alpha> + d|-alpha>)/N, where c = cos(phi) and d = sin(phi). The calculation will involve terms like <alpha|x|alpha>, <alpha|x|-alpha>, <-alpha|x|alpha>, and <-alpha|x|-alpha>.

I need to determine the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. The state is represented as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, with N as the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b involves the difference in von Neumann entropy between state rho and a Gaussian reference state tau: del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

The first step is identifying the Gaussian reference state tau. Typically, in the context of relative entropy for non-Gaussianity, tau is the Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho. I need to calculate these moments for rho, construct tau using them, and then determine the von Neumann entropies for both rho and tau.

Let's start by expressing the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a combination of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), normalized by N, i.e., rho = |psi><psi|.

For phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Thus, |psi> becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is calculated as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). With phi = -pi/4, 2 phi becomes -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. This implies N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Numerically, exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, hence N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

Thus, the normalized state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/0.6273. The coefficient sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071 implies 0.7071 / 0.6273 ≈ 1.127. Consequently, the normalized state is approximately 1.127*(|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2). The initial coefficients, divided by N which is approximately 0.6273, yield (sqrt(2)/2)/0.6273 ≈ 1.127. So ultimately, the normalized state resembles |alpha> - |-alpha>. Given alpha = 0.5, the overlap of |alpha> and |-alpha> is <alpha|-alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2) ≈ 0.6065, indicating partial overlap.

Now calculating rho = |psi><psi|, it's a pure state, yielding zero von Neumann entropy S(rho) due to pure states having zero entropy. For del_b, defined as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], and knowing rho's entropy is zero, del_b equals - trace(tau ln tau), which is positive since tau has non-zero entropy. The relative entropy typically being non-negative suggests I might reconsider how del_b should be interpreted.

The reference Gaussian state's entropy S(tau), formulated via the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix, is crucial. For single-mode systems, S(tau) = ( (nu + 1)/2 ) ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) ln( (nu -1)/2 ). Identifying the symplectic eigenvalue nu of tau will allow calculation of its entropy and thus del_b.

For tau, as a Gaussian state mirroring rho’s first and second moments, I must obtain the expectation values of position and momentum as well as the covariance matrix for rho. rho is |psi><psi|, with |psi> being the normalized superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. With alpha = 0.5, a real number, |-alpha> is its coherent counterpart at -0.5.

First moments involve quadrature operators x and p. For a coherent state |beta> with real alpha, <x> = sqrt(2) alpha and <p> = 0. Rho’s expectation values require averaging these operators over |psi>.

For x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), where a and a† are annihilation and creation operators, the calculation involves averaging over |alpha> and |-alpha>. This involves detailed computation of moments:

For state |psi> = (c|alpha> + d|-alpha>)/N where c = cos(phi), d = sin(phi), computing <x> involves (1/N^2)[|c|^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + c*d <alpha|x|-alpha> + conj(c)*conj(d) <-alpha|x|alpha> + |d|^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha>].

The same framework applies to <p>, though coherent state properties may simplify calculations.

Let's check.\n\nSince alpha is real, |alpha> and |-alpha> are position eigenstates displaced along the x-axis. The state |psi> is symmetric in position but with a relative phase. However, since phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, so the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. Let's compute <x>:\n\nEach term:\n\n<alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = sqrt(2)*0.5\n\nSimilarly, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = -sqrt(2)*0.5\n\nThe cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha>:\n\nThe position operator x can be written in terms of annihilation and creation operators: x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [<alpha|a| -alpha> + <alpha|a†| -alpha>]\n\nBut <alpha|a| -alpha> = -alpha <alpha| -alpha> = -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) (since <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2))\n\nSimilarly, <alpha|a†| -alpha> = < -alpha |a | alpha >* = (alpha < -alpha | alpha >)* = alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)\n\nTherefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) + alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = 0\n\nSimilarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> = 0.\n\nTherefore, the cross terms in <x> vanish. Therefore, <x> = (1/N^2)[c^2 (sqrt(2)*0.5) + d^2 (-sqrt(2)*0.5)]\n\nGiven c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, so c^2 = 0.5, d^2 = 0.5. Therefore:\n\n<x> = (1/N^2)[0.5*sqrt(2)*0.5 + 0.5*(-sqrt(2)*0.5)] = (1/N^2)[ (sqrt(2)/4 - sqrt(2)/4 ) ] = 0\n\nSimilarly, <p> can be calculated. The momentum operator p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)). For real alpha, <alpha|p|alpha> = 0. Similarly, the cross terms would involve <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha>. Let's compute <alpha|p|-alpha>:\n\n<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ <alpha|a| -alpha> - <alpha|a†| -alpha> ]\n\nFrom before, <alpha|a| -alpha> = -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2), and <alpha|a†| -alpha> = alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2). Therefore:\n\n<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) - alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ -2 alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = ( -2 alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ) / (i sqrt(2)) = 2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) / sqrt(2)\n\nBut this is imaginary, so when combined with the other terms in <p>, which would be similar, but since the coefficients c and d are real, the cross terms would contribute to the imaginary part. However, since the expectation value <p> must be real, perhaps these terms cancel out. Let me check.\n\nThe full expression for <p> is:\n\n<p> = (1/N^2)[c^2 <alpha|p|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p|alpha> ]\n\nBut <alpha|p|alpha> = 0, similarly <-alpha|p|-alpha> = 0. The cross terms are <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha>. Let's compute these:\n\nFrom above, <alpha|p|-alpha> = 2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2). Similarly, <-alpha|p|alpha> = [ <alpha|p| -alpha> ]* = [2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)]* = -2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the cross terms in <p> are:\n\nc d [ <alpha|p|-alpha> + <-alpha|p|alpha> ] = c d [ (2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)) + (-2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)) ] = 0\n\nTherefore, <p> = 0.\n\nSo the first moments of the state rho are both zero. Therefore, the reference Gaussian state tau will have zero displacement, i.e., it's centered at the origin in phase space.\n\nNext, we need to compute the covariance matrix of rho. The covariance matrix elements are given by:\n\nGamma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} > - <x_i><x_j>\n\nSince the first moments are zero, Gamma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} >, where x_1 = x, x_2 = p.\n\nFor a single mode, the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix with elements:\n\nGamma = [ [ <x^2>, <(x p + p x)/2> ], [ <(x p + p x)/2>, <p^2> ] ]\n\nBut for a state with zero first moments, the covariance matrix is determined by the variances of x and p, and the covariance between x and p.\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the problem, perhaps the covariance matrix is diagonal. Let's check.\n\nFirst, compute <x^2> for the state rho. The position quadrature variance is <x^2> - <x>^2, but since <x> = 0, it's just <x^2>.\n\nSimilarly, <p^2> is the momentum variance.\n\nFor coherent states, the variances of x and p are both 1/2 (since they are minimum uncertainty states). However, in the superposition state, the variances may be different.\n\nLet's compute <x^2> for rho:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|x^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ]\n\nSimilarly, <x^2> for a coherent state |beta> is (1/2 + (Re(beta))^2). Since x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), x^2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2a†a + 1)/2. Therefore, <beta|x^2|beta> = ( <beta|a^2|beta> + <beta|a†^2|beta> + 2 <beta|a†a|beta> + 1 ) / 2.\n\nBut <beta|a^2|beta> = beta^2, <beta|a†^2|beta> = (beta*)^2, and <beta|a†a|beta> = |beta|^2. Therefore, <x^2> = (beta^2 + (beta*)^2 + 2|beta|^2 + 1)/2. For real beta, this becomes (2 beta^2 + 2 beta^2 + 1)/2 = (4 beta^2 + 1)/2 = 2 beta^2 + 0.5.\n\nTherefore, for |alpha> with real alpha, <x^2> = 2 alpha^2 + 0.5. Similarly, for |-alpha>, it's the same. So <alpha|x^2|alpha> = 2*(0.5)^2 + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0. Similarly for |-alpha>.\n\nNow, the cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|x^2|alpha>:\n\nx^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2a†a + 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a†a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = < -alpha |a^2 | alpha >* = (alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2))*\n\nBut since alpha is real, this is alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†a|-alpha> = <alpha|a†a| -alpha> = -alpha <alpha|a†| -alpha> = -alpha ( < -alpha |a | alpha > )* = -alpha ( alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) )* = -alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2 )\n\n<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n<alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(-alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumerator: 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nTherefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2\n\nSimilarly, <-alpha|x^2|alpha> = <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2\n\nTherefore, the cross terms in <x^2> are:\n\nc d [ <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ] = c d [ exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 + exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 ] = c d exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nPutting all terms together for <x^2>:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 *1 + d^2 *1 + c d exp(-2 alpha^2) + c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\n= (1/N^2)[ (c^2 + d^2) + 2 c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nGiven c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, so c^2 + d^2 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, and c d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = -0.5\n\nTherefore:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N^2)[1 + 2*(-0.5)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)] = (1/N^2)[1 - exp(-0.5)]\n\nBut N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, so <x^2> = (1 - exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5)) = 1.0\n\nWait, that's interesting. So <x^2> = 1.0. But for a coherent state, <x^2> was 1.0 as well (since alpha=0.5, 2*(0.5)^2 +0.5=1.0). So the variance in x is the same as a coherent state. But let's check the calculation again.\n\nWait, when we calculated <x^2> for the superposition state, we found that it's equal to 1.0. But the cross terms contributed a term that canceled out the (1 - exp(-0.5)) in the denominator. So the variance in x is 1.0, same as a coherent state. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's compute <p^2>. For a coherent state |beta>, <p^2> = 0.5 + 2 (Im(beta))^2. Since beta is real here, Im(beta) = 0, so <p^2> = 0.5. But for the superposition state, we need to compute <p^2> similarly.\n\nThe momentum operator p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)), so p^2 = -(a - a†)^2 / 2 = -(a^2 + a†^2 - 2a†a -1)/2. Therefore, <beta|p^2|beta> = ( - <beta|a^2|beta> - <beta|a†^2|beta> + 2 <beta|a†a|beta> + 1 ) / 2\n\nFor real beta, this becomes ( - beta^2 - beta^2 + 2 beta^2 +1 ) / 2 = ( -2 beta^2 + 2 beta^2 +1 ) / 2 = 1/2. So for any real coherent state, <p^2> = 0.5.\n\nBut for the superposition state, let's compute <p^2>:\n\n<p^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|p^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|p^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p^2|alpha> ]\n\nFrom above, <alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0.5, similarly for <-alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.5. The cross terms <alpha|p^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|p^2|alpha> need to be calculated.\n\nLet's compute <alpha|p^2|-alpha>:\n\nUsing p^2 = -(a^2 + a†^2 - 2a†a -1)/2\n\n<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> - 2 <alpha|a†a|-alpha> - <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2\n\nFrom previous calculations:\n\n<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†a|-alpha> = -alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2*(-alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2) = (4 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2))\n\nFactor out exp(-2 alpha^2):\n\nexp(-2 alpha^2)(4 alpha^2 -1)\n\nTherefore:\n\n<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ exp(-2 alpha^2)(4 alpha^2 -1) ] / 2\n\nFor alpha = 0.5, this becomes:\n\n- [ exp(-0.5)(4*(0.25) -1) ] / 2 = - [ exp(-0.5)(1 -1) ] / 2 = 0\n\nWait, 4*(0.25) = 1, so 4 alpha^2 -1 = 0. Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <-alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0.\n\nTherefore, the cross terms in <p^2> are zero. Therefore:\n\n<p^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 *0.5 + d^2 *0.5 + 0 + 0 ] = (1/N^2)(0.5(c^2 + d^2)) = (1/N^2)(0.5*1) = 0.5 / N^2\n\nBut N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, so <p^2> ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270\n\nTherefore, the variance in p is 1.270, which is larger than the coherent state's 0.5. However, the covariance matrix for the reference Gaussian state requires the cross terms. Let's check the cross term <xp + px>/2.\n\nCompute <xp + px>/2. For a coherent state, this is zero. For our state, let's compute it.\n\nThe operator (xp + px)/2 is equal to (a a + a† a† - a a† - a† a)/2i. However, calculating this expectation value for the superposition state might be involved. Alternatively, since the state is symmetric in position (even though it's an odd superposition), perhaps the cross terms are zero. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, since the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are both real (alpha is real), the Wigner function might be symmetric in x and p. However, given that the state is an odd superposition, the Wigner function might have odd symmetry in x, but even in p. However, the covariance matrix cross term <xp + px>/2 is related to the correlation between x and p. For a squeezed state, this term is non-zero, but for our state, which is a superposition of coherent states, perhaps this term is zero.\n\nAlternatively, since the first moments are zero and the state is symmetric under x -> -x (since it's an odd superposition), the expectation value of xp + px might be zero. Let's verify.\n\nConsider that x is an odd function and p is an odd function under parity (x -> -x, p -> -p). The product xp is even under parity. However, the state |psi> is an eigenstate of the parity operator with eigenvalue -1 (since it's an odd superposition). Therefore, the expectation value of any even operator (like xp) should be real. However, whether it's zero or not requires calculation.\n\nBut perhaps for our state, the cross term <xp + px>/2 is zero. Let's assume that for now. If that's the case, the covariance matrix is diagonal with elements <x^2> and <p^2>. However, in our case, <x^2> = 1.0 and <p^2> ≈ 1.270. But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle, which for a single mode is det(Gamma) >= (1/2)^2. Here, det(Gamma) = <x^2><p^2> - (<xp + px>/2)^2. If the cross term is zero, det(Gamma) = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, which is greater than 0.25, so it's a valid covariance matrix.\n\nHowever, the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix and first moments (which are zero). Therefore, tau is a thermal squeezed state? Wait, no. For a Gaussian state with diagonal covariance matrix and variances V_x and V_p, if V_x != V_p, it's a squeezed thermal state. But if the cross terms are zero and V_x and V_p are different, then yes.\n\nBut to compute the entropy of tau, we need the symplectic eigenvalue nu. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue is given by nu = sqrt(det(Gamma))}. However, wait, the covariance matrix Gamma is related to the symplectic form. The standard form for a single-mode covariance matrix is:\n\nGamma = [ [ V_x, 0 ], [ 0, V_p ] ]\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue nu is given by sqrt(V_x V_p). Therefore, nu = sqrt(<x^2><p^2>). For our case, nu = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127.\n\nHowever, the entropy formula for a Gaussian state is S = (nu + 1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. Plugging in nu ≈ 1.127:\n\nFirst, compute (nu +1)/2 ≈ (2.127)/2 ≈ 1.0635\n\n(nu -1)/2 ≈ 0.127/2 ≈ 0.0635\n\nThen,\n\nS = 1.0635 * ln(1.0635) - 0.0635 * ln(0.0635)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nln(1.0635) ≈ 0.0615\n\n1.0635 * 0.0615 ≈ 0.0654\n\nln(0.0635) ≈ -2.756\n\n0.0635 * (-2.756) ≈ -0.175\n\nTherefore, S ≈ 0.0654 - (-0.175) ≈ 0.2404\n\nBut wait, entropy is positive, so 0.0654 - (-0.175) = 0.2404 nats. Converting to bits would require dividing by ln(2), but since the question uses natural logarithms (ln in the formula), the entropy is approximately 0.2404 nats.\n\nBut wait, the formula for entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is S = (nu +1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. Let me confirm this. Yes, for a thermal state with average photon number n, the entropy is S = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n. But for a general Gaussian state, the entropy is expressed in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue nu. For a single mode, nu = 2n +1, so substituting, S = ( (2n +1 +1)/2 ) ln( (2n +2)/2 ) - ( (2n +1 -1)/2 ) ln( (2n)/2 ) = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n, which matches the thermal state entropy. Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\nBut in our case, nu = sqrt(V_x V_p) = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ 1.127. However, the uncertainty principle requires that nu >= 1/2. Wait, no. The uncertainty principle for the covariance matrix is that the symplectic eigenvalues must be >= 1/2. Wait, actually, the uncertainty principle is that the covariance matrix must satisfy Gamma + i Omega/2 >= 0, where Omega is the symplectic form. For a single mode, this reduces to the condition that the symplectic eigenvalues are >= 1/2. However, the symplectic eigenvalue nu is calculated as sqrt(det Gamma)}. Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the covariance matrix can be transformed via symplectic transformations to a diagonal matrix with entries nu and nu, where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue. Therefore, det Gamma = nu^2. Therefore, nu = sqrt(det Gamma). But in our case, det Gamma = V_x V_p = 1.0 * 1.270 = 1.270, so nu = sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127. However, the uncertainty principle requires that nu >= 0.5. Since 1.127 > 0.5, it's satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the usual uncertainty principle for variances is V_x V_p >= 1/4. In our case, V_x V_p = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, which is much larger than 1/4, so it's satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the entropy S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.\n\nBut wait, let's compute this more accurately. Let's use exact expressions.\n\nGiven alpha = 0.5, phi = -pi/4.\n\nFirst, compute N^2 = 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 + sin(-pi/2) exp(-0.5) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935.\n\nThen, <x^2> = 1.0 (exactly, as per previous calculation).\n\n<p^2> = 0.5 / N^2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270.\n\nTherefore, det Gamma = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, so nu = sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127.\n\nNow compute S(tau):\n\nS = ( (1.127 +1)/2 ) ln( (1.127 +1)/2 ) - ( (1.127 -1)/2 ) ln( (1.127 -1)/2 )\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(1.127 +1)/2 = 2.127/2 = 1.0635\n\nln(1.0635) ≈ 0.0615\n\n(1.127 -1)/2 = 0.127/2 = 0.0635\n\nln(0.0635) ≈ -2.756\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = 1.0635 * 0.0615 - 0.0635 * (-2.756) ≈ 0.0654 + 0.175 ≈ 0.2404 nats.\n\nSince the von Neumann entropy of rho is zero (it's a pure state), the non-Gaussianity del_b = S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.\n\nBut let's check if the cross term <xp + px>/2 is indeed zero. If not, it would affect the covariance matrix and thus the symplectic eigenvalue.\n\nTo compute <xp + px>/2, we need to evaluate <psi| (xp + px)/2 |psi>.\n\nExpressed in terms of a and a†, xp + px = (a + a†)(a - a†)/i + (a - a†)(a + a†)/i = [ (a^2 - a†^2 + a a† - a† a ) + (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a† ) ] / i\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ 2(a^2 - a†^2) + (a a† - a† a + a† a - a a† ) ] / i\n\nThe terms (a a† - a† a) and (a† a - a a†) cancel out, leaving:\n\n= 2(a^2 - a†^2)/i\n\nTherefore, (xp + px)/2 = (a^2 - a†^2)/i\n\nTherefore, <xp + px>/2 = < (a^2 - a†^2)/i > = [ <a^2> - <a†^2> ] / i\n\nFor our state |psi>, compute <a^2> and <a†^2>:\n\n<a^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|a^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|a^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|a^2|alpha> ]\n\nSimilarly, <a^2> for |alpha> is alpha^2, and for |-alpha> is (-alpha)^2 = alpha^2. The cross terms <alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2), and similarly <-alpha|a^2|alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).\n\nTherefore:\n\n<a^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 alpha^2 + d^2 alpha^2 + c d alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + c d alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\n= (alpha^2 / N^2)[ c^2 + d^2 + 2 c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nSimilarly, c^2 + d^2 = 1, and 2 c d = 2*(-0.5) = -1. Therefore:\n\n<a^2> = (alpha^2 / N^2)[1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nFor alpha = 0.5:\n\n<a^2> = (0.25 / 0.3935)[1 - exp(-0.5)] = (0.25 / 0.3935)(0.3935) = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, <a†^2> = <a^2>* = 0.25 (since all terms are real)\n\nTherefore, <xp + px>/2 = (0.25 - 0.25)/i = 0. Therefore, the cross term is zero. Hence, the covariance matrix is indeed diagonal with <x^2> = 1.0 and <p^2> ≈ 1.270.\n\nTherefore, the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ 1.127, and the entropy S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.\n\nThus, the non-Gaussianity del_b = S(tau) ≈ 0.2404.\n\nBut let's check if there's a mistake in the calculation of <p^2>. Earlier, we found <p^2> = 0.5 / N^2 ≈ 1.270. Let's verify this.\n\nThe calculation steps for <p^2>:\n\nFor the cross terms in <p^2>, we found they were zero. Therefore, <p^2> = (c^2 + d^2) * 0.5 / N^2 = 0.5 / N^2. Since N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, <p^2> ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. This seems correct.\n\nBut wait, for a coherent state, <p^2> = 0.5. Here, <p^2> is larger, which makes sense because the superposition state might have increased uncertainty in p. However, the reference Gaussian state has higher entropy due to this increased variance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 0.2404 nats. To express it more precisely, we can compute it using exact expressions.\n\nLet's compute nu exactly:\n\nnu = sqrt(<x^2><p^2>) = sqrt(1.0 * (0.5 / N^2)) = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5)))\n\nGiven N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5), so:\n\nnu = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5)))\n\nCompute 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935\n\n0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270\n\nsqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127\n\nNow, compute S(tau) using exact expressions:\n\nS = ( (nu +1)/2 ) * ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) * ln( (nu -1)/2 )\n\nLet's compute this with more precision.\n\nFirst, compute nu:\n\nnu = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5))) = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - e^{-0.5}))\n\nCalculate 1 - e^{-0.5}:\n\ne^{-0.5} ≈ 0.60653066\n\n1 - 0.60653066 ≈ 0.39346934\n\n0.5 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.270\n\nsqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.12701665\n\nNow, compute (nu +1)/2:\n\n(1.12701665 +1)/2 ≈ 2.12701665/2 ≈ 1.063508325\n\nln(1.063508325) ≈ 0.0615518\n\n(nu -1)/2 ≈ 0.12701665/2 ≈ 0.063508325\n\nln(0.063508325) ≈ -2.756815\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = 1.063508325 * 0.0615518 - 0.063508325 * (-2.756815)\n\n= 0.06544 + 0.1753\n\n≈ 0.2407 nats\n\nSo approximately 0.2407 nats of non-Gaussianity.\n\nTo check if this is correct, let's consider that for a coherent state (which is Gaussian), del_b would be zero. For a cat state with small alpha, the non-Gaussianity is significant. For alpha approaching zero, the state becomes a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, a Gaussian state. But with alpha=0.5, it's a small cat state, so the non-Gaussianity should be moderate.\n\nAnother way to check is to recall that for an even cat state (phi=0), the non-Gaussianity can be calculated similarly, and for alpha=0.5, the value might be similar. However, our calculation here is for an odd cat state (phi=-pi/4), but the procedure should be the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 0.2407 nats. Rounding to three significant figures, it's approximately 0.241 nats.\n\nBut let's check if there's a mistake in the reference state. The reference Gaussian state is supposed to have the same first and second moments as rho. We calculated the first moments as zero and the covariance matrix as diagonal with Vx=1.0 and Vp≈1.270. Therefore, the Gaussian state tau is a thermal squeezed state with these variances. However, in reality, a Gaussian state with diagonal covariance matrix and Vx != Vp is a squeezed thermal state. The entropy depends only on the symplectic eigenvalue, which is sqrt(Vx Vp). Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAnother point to consider: since the original state is pure, the non-Gaussianity is entirely captured by the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. This makes sense because the relative entropy between a pure non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state is just the entropy of the Gaussian state, as the pure state has zero entropy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is del_b ≈ 0.241 nats.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447917, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8472, prompt_tokens=1100, total_tokens=9572, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we follow these steps:

1. **State Normalization**:  
   Given the state \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N} \) with \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.6273
   \]
   The normalized state becomes an odd cat state: \( |\psi\rangle \propto |\alpha\rangle - |-\alpha\rangle \).

2. **First Moments**:  
   The first moments (expectation values of position \(x\) and momentum \(p\)) are zero due to symmetry.

3. **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix)**:  
   - Position variance: \( \langle x^2 \rangle = 1.0 \) (same as a coherent state).
   - Momentum variance: \( \langle p^2 \rangle = \frac{0.5}{N^2} \approx 1.270 \).
   - Cross term \( \langle xp + px \rangle / 2 = 0 \), leading to a diagonal covariance matrix:
     \[
     \Gamma = \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.270 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

4. **Symplectic Eigenvalue**:  
   The symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\) of the covariance matrix is:
   \[
   \nu = \sqrt{\langle x^2 \rangle \langle p^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{1.0 \times 1.270} \approx 1.127
   \]

5. **Entropy of the Gaussian State**:  
   The von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is:
   \[
   S(\tau) = \frac{\nu + 1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right) - \frac{\nu - 1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu - 1}{2}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(\nu \approx 1.127\):
   \[
   S(\tau) \approx 0.2407 \text{ nats}
   \]

6. **Non-Gaussianity**:  
   Since the original state \(|\psi\rangle\) is pure, its entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\). The non-Gaussianity is:
   \[
   \delta_b = S(\tau) \approx 0.241 \text{ nats}
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state is \(\boxed{0.241}\) nats.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, since the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are not orthogonal, the expectation values will depend on the cross terms.

First, compute the first moments:

<x> = <psi|x|psi> = (1/N^2)[c^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x|alpha>]

Similarly for <p>, but since alpha is real, the momentum expectation value might be zero due to symmetry. Let's check.

Since alpha is real, |alpha> and |-alpha> are position eigenstates displaced along the x-axis. The state |psi> is symmetric in position but with a relative phase. However, since phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, so the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N. Let's compute <x>:

Each term:

<alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = sqrt(2)*0.5

Similarly, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = -sqrt(2)*0.5

The cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha>:

The position operator x can be written in terms of annihilation and creation operators: x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [<alpha|a| -alpha> + <alpha|a†| -alpha>]

But <alpha|a| -alpha> = -alpha <alpha| -alpha> = -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) (since <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2))

Similarly, <alpha|a†| -alpha> = < -alpha |a | alpha >* = (alpha < -alpha | alpha >)* = alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)

Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) + alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = 0

Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> = 0.

Therefore, the cross terms in <x> vanish. Therefore, <x> = (1/N^2)[c^2 (sqrt(2)*0.5) + d^2 (-sqrt(2)*0.5)]

Given c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, so c^2 = 0.5, d^2 = 0.5. Therefore:

<x> = (1/N^2)[0.5*sqrt(2)*0.5 + 0.5*(-sqrt(2)*0.5)] = (1/N^2)[ (sqrt(2)/4 - sqrt(2)/4 ) ] = 0

Similarly, <p> can be calculated. The momentum operator p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)). For real alpha, <alpha|p|alpha> = 0. Similarly, the cross terms would involve <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha>. Let's compute <alpha|p|-alpha>:

<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ <alpha|a| -alpha> - <alpha|a†| -alpha> ]

From before, <alpha|a| -alpha> = -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2), and <alpha|a†| -alpha> = alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2). Therefore:

<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ -alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) - alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = (1/(i sqrt(2))) [ -2 alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ] = ( -2 alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) ) / (i sqrt(2)) = 2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2) / sqrt(2)

But this is imaginary, so when combined with the other terms in <p>, which would be similar, but since the coefficients c and d are real, the cross terms would contribute to the imaginary part. However, since the expectation value <p> must be real, perhaps these terms cancel out. Let me check.

The full expression for <p> is:

<p> = (1/N^2)[c^2 <alpha|p|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p|alpha> ]

But <alpha|p|alpha> = 0, similarly <-alpha|p|-alpha> = 0. The cross terms are <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha>. Let's compute these:

From above, <alpha|p|-alpha> = 2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2). Similarly, <-alpha|p|alpha> = [ <alpha|p| -alpha> ]* = [2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)]* = -2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, the cross terms in <p> are:

c d [ <alpha|p|-alpha> + <-alpha|p|alpha> ] = c d [ (2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)) + (-2i alpha exp(-2|alpha|^2)/sqrt(2)) ] = 0

Therefore, <p> = 0.

So the first moments of the state rho are both zero. Therefore, the reference Gaussian state tau will have zero displacement, i.e., it's centered at the origin in phase space.

Next, we need to compute the covariance matrix of rho. The covariance matrix elements are given by:

Gamma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} > - <x_i><x_j>

Since the first moments are zero, Gamma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} >, where x_1 = x, x_2 = p.

For a single mode, the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix with elements:

Gamma = [ [ <x^2>, <(x p + p x)/2> ], [ <(x p + p x)/2>, <p^2> ] ]

But for a state with zero first moments, the covariance matrix is determined by the variances of x and p, and the covariance between x and p.

However, due to the symmetry of the problem, perhaps the covariance matrix is diagonal. Let's check.

First, compute <x^2> for the state rho. The position quadrature variance is <x^2> - <x>^2, but since <x> = 0, it's just <x^2>.

Similarly, <p^2> is the momentum variance.

For coherent states, the variances of x and p are both 1/2 (since they are minimum uncertainty states). However, in the superposition state, the variances may be different.

Let's compute <x^2> for rho:

<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|x^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ]

Similarly, <x^2> for a coherent state |beta> is (1/2 + (Re(beta))^2). Since x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), x^2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2a†a + 1)/2. Therefore, <beta|x^2|beta> = ( <beta|a^2|beta> + <beta|a†^2|beta> + 2 <beta|a†a|beta> + 1 ) / 2.

But <beta|a^2|beta> = beta^2, <beta|a†^2|beta> = (beta*)^2, and <beta|a†a|beta> = |beta|^2. Therefore, <x^2> = (beta^2 + (beta*)^2 + 2|beta|^2 + 1)/2. For real beta, this becomes (2 beta^2 + 2 beta^2 + 1)/2 = (4 beta^2 + 1)/2 = 2 beta^2 + 0.5.

Therefore, for |alpha> with real alpha, <x^2> = 2 alpha^2 + 0.5. Similarly, for |-alpha>, it's the same. So <alpha|x^2|alpha> = 2*(0.5)^2 + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0. Similarly for |-alpha>.

Now, the cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|x^2|alpha>:

x^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2a†a + 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a†a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2

Compute each term:

<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = < -alpha |a^2 | alpha >* = (alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2))*

But since alpha is real, this is alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†a|-alpha> = <alpha|a†a| -alpha> = -alpha <alpha|a†| -alpha> = -alpha ( < -alpha |a | alpha > )* = -alpha ( alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) )* = -alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2 )

<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)

Putting it all together:

<alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(-alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

Simplify:

Numerator: 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-2 alpha^2)

Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2

Similarly, <-alpha|x^2|alpha> = <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2

Therefore, the cross terms in <x^2> are:

c d [ <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ] = c d [ exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 + exp(-2 alpha^2)/2 ] = c d exp(-2 alpha^2)

Putting all terms together for <x^2>:

<x^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 *1 + d^2 *1 + c d exp(-2 alpha^2) + c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

= (1/N^2)[ (c^2 + d^2) + 2 c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

Given c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, so c^2 + d^2 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, and c d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = -0.5

Therefore:

<x^2> = (1/N^2)[1 + 2*(-0.5)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)] = (1/N^2)[1 - exp(-0.5)]

But N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, so <x^2> = (1 - exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5)) = 1.0

Wait, that's interesting. So <x^2> = 1.0. But for a coherent state, <x^2> was 1.0 as well (since alpha=0.5, 2*(0.5)^2 +0.5=1.0). So the variance in x is the same as a coherent state. But let's check the calculation again.

Wait, when we calculated <x^2> for the superposition state, we found that it's equal to 1.0. But the cross terms contributed a term that canceled out the (1 - exp(-0.5)) in the denominator. So the variance in x is 1.0, same as a coherent state. Hmm.

Now, let's compute <p^2>. For a coherent state |beta>, <p^2> = 0.5 + 2 (Im(beta))^2. Since beta is real here, Im(beta) = 0, so <p^2> = 0.5. But for the superposition state, we need to compute <p^2> similarly.

The momentum operator p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)), so p^2 = -(a - a†)^2 / 2 = -(a^2 + a†^2 - 2a†a -1)/2. Therefore, <beta|p^2|beta> = ( - <beta|a^2|beta> - <beta|a†^2|beta> + 2 <beta|a†a|beta> + 1 ) / 2

For real beta, this becomes ( - beta^2 - beta^2 + 2 beta^2 +1 ) / 2 = ( -2 beta^2 + 2 beta^2 +1 ) / 2 = 1/2. So for any real coherent state, <p^2> = 0.5.

But for the superposition state, let's compute <p^2>:

<p^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|p^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|p^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p^2|alpha> ]

From above, <alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0.5, similarly for <-alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.5. The cross terms <alpha|p^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|p^2|alpha> need to be calculated.

Let's compute <alpha|p^2|-alpha>:

Using p^2 = -(a^2 + a†^2 - 2a†a -1)/2

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> - 2 <alpha|a†a|-alpha> - <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2

From previous calculations:

<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†a|-alpha> = -alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)

Substituting:

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2*(-alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

Simplify numerator:

2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2) = (4 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - exp(-2 alpha^2))

Factor out exp(-2 alpha^2):

exp(-2 alpha^2)(4 alpha^2 -1)

Therefore:

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = - [ exp(-2 alpha^2)(4 alpha^2 -1) ] / 2

For alpha = 0.5, this becomes:

- [ exp(-0.5)(4*(0.25) -1) ] / 2 = - [ exp(-0.5)(1 -1) ] / 2 = 0

Wait, 4*(0.25) = 1, so 4 alpha^2 -1 = 0. Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.

Similarly, <-alpha|p^2|alpha> = 0.

Therefore, the cross terms in <p^2> are zero. Therefore:

<p^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 *0.5 + d^2 *0.5 + 0 + 0 ] = (1/N^2)(0.5(c^2 + d^2)) = (1/N^2)(0.5*1) = 0.5 / N^2

But N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, so <p^2> ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270

Therefore, the variance in p is 1.270, which is larger than the coherent state's 0.5. However, the covariance matrix for the reference Gaussian state requires the cross terms. Let's check the cross term <xp + px>/2.

Compute <xp + px>/2. For a coherent state, this is zero. For our state, let's compute it.

The operator (xp + px)/2 is equal to (a a + a† a† - a a† - a† a)/2i. However, calculating this expectation value for the superposition state might be involved. Alternatively, since the state is symmetric in position (even though it's an odd superposition), perhaps the cross terms are zero. Let's check.

Alternatively, since the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are both real (alpha is real), the Wigner function might be symmetric in x and p. However, given that the state is an odd superposition, the Wigner function might have odd symmetry in x, but even in p. However, the covariance matrix cross term <xp + px>/2 is related to the correlation between x and p. For a squeezed state, this term is non-zero, but for our state, which is a superposition of coherent states, perhaps this term is zero.

Alternatively, since the first moments are zero and the state is symmetric under x -> -x (since it's an odd superposition), the expectation value of xp + px might be zero. Let's verify.

Consider that x is an odd function and p is an odd function under parity (x -> -x, p -> -p). The product xp is even under parity. However, the state |psi> is an eigenstate of the parity operator with eigenvalue -1 (since it's an odd superposition). Therefore, the expectation value of any even operator (like xp) should be real. However, whether it's zero or not requires calculation.

But perhaps for our state, the cross term <xp + px>/2 is zero. Let's assume that for now. If that's the case, the covariance matrix is diagonal with elements <x^2> and <p^2>. However, in our case, <x^2> = 1.0 and <p^2> ≈ 1.270. But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle, which for a single mode is det(Gamma) >= (1/2)^2. Here, det(Gamma) = <x^2><p^2> - (<xp + px>/2)^2. If the cross term is zero, det(Gamma) = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, which is greater than 0.25, so it's a valid covariance matrix.

However, the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix and first moments (which are zero). Therefore, tau is a thermal squeezed state? Wait, no. For a Gaussian state with diagonal covariance matrix and variances V_x and V_p, if V_x != V_p, it's a squeezed thermal state. But if the cross terms are zero and V_x and V_p are different, then yes.

But to compute the entropy of tau, we need the symplectic eigenvalue nu. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue is given by nu = sqrt(det(Gamma))}. However, wait, the covariance matrix Gamma is related to the symplectic form. The standard form for a single-mode covariance matrix is:

Gamma = [ [ V_x, 0 ], [ 0, V_p ] ]

The symplectic eigenvalue nu is given by sqrt(V_x V_p). Therefore, nu = sqrt(<x^2><p^2>). For our case, nu = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127.

However, the entropy formula for a Gaussian state is S = (nu + 1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. Plugging in nu ≈ 1.127:

First, compute (nu +1)/2 ≈ (2.127)/2 ≈ 1.0635

(nu -1)/2 ≈ 0.127/2 ≈ 0.0635

Then,

S = 1.0635 * ln(1.0635) - 0.0635 * ln(0.0635)

Calculate each term:

ln(1.0635) ≈ 0.0615

1.0635 * 0.0615 ≈ 0.0654

ln(0.0635) ≈ -2.756

0.0635 * (-2.756) ≈ -0.175

Therefore, S ≈ 0.0654 - (-0.175) ≈ 0.2404

But wait, entropy is positive, so 0.0654 - (-0.175) = 0.2404 nats. Converting to bits would require dividing by ln(2), but since the question uses natural logarithms (ln in the formula), the entropy is approximately 0.2404 nats.

But wait, the formula for entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is S = (nu +1)/2 ln[(nu +1)/2] - (nu -1)/2 ln[(nu -1)/2]. Let me confirm this. Yes, for a thermal state with average photon number n, the entropy is S = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n. But for a general Gaussian state, the entropy is expressed in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue nu. For a single mode, nu = 2n +1, so substituting, S = ( (2n +1 +1)/2 ) ln( (2n +2)/2 ) - ( (2n +1 -1)/2 ) ln( (2n)/2 ) = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n, which matches the thermal state entropy. Therefore, the formula is correct.

But in our case, nu = sqrt(V_x V_p) = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ 1.127. However, the uncertainty principle requires that nu >= 1/2. Wait, no. The uncertainty principle for the covariance matrix is that the symplectic eigenvalues must be >= 1/2. Wait, actually, the uncertainty principle is that the covariance matrix must satisfy Gamma + i Omega/2 >= 0, where Omega is the symplectic form. For a single mode, this reduces to the condition that the symplectic eigenvalues are >= 1/2. However, the symplectic eigenvalue nu is calculated as sqrt(det Gamma)}. Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the covariance matrix can be transformed via symplectic transformations to a diagonal matrix with entries nu and nu, where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue. Therefore, det Gamma = nu^2. Therefore, nu = sqrt(det Gamma). But in our case, det Gamma = V_x V_p = 1.0 * 1.270 = 1.270, so nu = sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127. However, the uncertainty principle requires that nu >= 0.5. Since 1.127 > 0.5, it's satisfied.

But wait, the usual uncertainty principle for variances is V_x V_p >= 1/4. In our case, V_x V_p = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, which is much larger than 1/4, so it's satisfied.

Therefore, the entropy S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.

But wait, let's compute this more accurately. Let's use exact expressions.

Given alpha = 0.5, phi = -pi/4.

First, compute N^2 = 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 + sin(-pi/2) exp(-0.5) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935.

Then, <x^2> = 1.0 (exactly, as per previous calculation).

<p^2> = 0.5 / N^2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270.

Therefore, det Gamma = 1.0 * 1.270 ≈ 1.270, so nu = sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127.

Now compute S(tau):

S = ( (1.127 +1)/2 ) ln( (1.127 +1)/2 ) - ( (1.127 -1)/2 ) ln( (1.127 -1)/2 )

Calculate each term:

(1.127 +1)/2 = 2.127/2 = 1.0635

ln(1.0635) ≈ 0.0615

(1.127 -1)/2 = 0.127/2 = 0.0635

ln(0.0635) ≈ -2.756

Therefore,

S = 1.0635 * 0.0615 - 0.0635 * (-2.756) ≈ 0.0654 + 0.175 ≈ 0.2404 nats.

Since the von Neumann entropy of rho is zero (it's a pure state), the non-Gaussianity del_b = S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.

But let's check if the cross term <xp + px>/2 is indeed zero. If not, it would affect the covariance matrix and thus the symplectic eigenvalue.

To compute <xp + px>/2, we need to evaluate <psi| (xp + px)/2 |psi>.

Expressed in terms of a and a†, xp + px = (a + a†)(a - a†)/i + (a - a†)(a + a†)/i = [ (a^2 - a†^2 + a a† - a† a ) + (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a† ) ] / i

Simplify:

= [ 2(a^2 - a†^2) + (a a† - a† a + a† a - a a† ) ] / i

The terms (a a† - a† a) and (a† a - a a†) cancel out, leaving:

= 2(a^2 - a†^2)/i

Therefore, (xp + px)/2 = (a^2 - a†^2)/i

Therefore, <xp + px>/2 = < (a^2 - a†^2)/i > = [ <a^2> - <a†^2> ] / i

For our state |psi>, compute <a^2> and <a†^2>:

<a^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|a^2|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|a^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|a^2|alpha> ]

Similarly, <a^2> for |alpha> is alpha^2, and for |-alpha> is (-alpha)^2 = alpha^2. The cross terms <alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2), and similarly <-alpha|a^2|alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Therefore:

<a^2> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 alpha^2 + d^2 alpha^2 + c d alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + c d alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

= (alpha^2 / N^2)[ c^2 + d^2 + 2 c d exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

Similarly, c^2 + d^2 = 1, and 2 c d = 2*(-0.5) = -1. Therefore:

<a^2> = (alpha^2 / N^2)[1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

For alpha = 0.5:

<a^2> = (0.25 / 0.3935)[1 - exp(-0.5)] = (0.25 / 0.3935)(0.3935) = 0.25

Similarly, <a†^2> = <a^2>* = 0.25 (since all terms are real)

Therefore, <xp + px>/2 = (0.25 - 0.25)/i = 0. Therefore, the cross term is zero. Hence, the covariance matrix is indeed diagonal with <x^2> = 1.0 and <p^2> ≈ 1.270.

Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalue nu = sqrt(1.0 * 1.270) ≈ 1.127, and the entropy S(tau) ≈ 0.2404 nats.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity del_b = S(tau) ≈ 0.2404.

But let's check if there's a mistake in the calculation of <p^2>. Earlier, we found <p^2> = 0.5 / N^2 ≈ 1.270. Let's verify this.

The calculation steps for <p^2>:

For the cross terms in <p^2>, we found they were zero. Therefore, <p^2> = (c^2 + d^2) * 0.5 / N^2 = 0.5 / N^2. Since N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935, <p^2> ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. This seems correct.

But wait, for a coherent state, <p^2> = 0.5. Here, <p^2> is larger, which makes sense because the superposition state might have increased uncertainty in p. However, the reference Gaussian state has higher entropy due to this increased variance.

Therefore, the final answer for the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 0.2404 nats. To express it more precisely, we can compute it using exact expressions.

Let's compute nu exactly:

nu = sqrt(<x^2><p^2>) = sqrt(1.0 * (0.5 / N^2)) = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5)))

Given N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5), so:

nu = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5)))

Compute 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935

0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270

sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.127

Now, compute S(tau) using exact expressions:

S = ( (nu +1)/2 ) * ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) * ln( (nu -1)/2 )

Let's compute this with more precision.

First, compute nu:

nu = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - exp(-0.5))) = sqrt(0.5 / (1 - e^{-0.5}))

Calculate 1 - e^{-0.5}:

e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.60653066

1 - 0.60653066 ≈ 0.39346934

0.5 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.270

sqrt(1.270) ≈ 1.12701665

Now, compute (nu +1)/2:

(1.12701665 +1)/2 ≈ 2.12701665/2 ≈ 1.063508325

ln(1.063508325) ≈ 0.0615518

(nu -1)/2 ≈ 0.12701665/2 ≈ 0.063508325

ln(0.063508325) ≈ -2.756815

Therefore,

S = 1.063508325 * 0.0615518 - 0.063508325 * (-2.756815)

= 0.06544 + 0.1753

≈ 0.2407 nats

So approximately 0.2407 nats of non-Gaussianity.

To check if this is correct, let's consider that for a coherent state (which is Gaussian), del_b would be zero. For a cat state with small alpha, the non-Gaussianity is significant. For alpha approaching zero, the state becomes a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, a Gaussian state. But with alpha=0.5, it's a small cat state, so the non-Gaussianity should be moderate.

Another way to check is to recall that for an even cat state (phi=0), the non-Gaussianity can be calculated similarly, and for alpha=0.5, the value might be similar. However, our calculation here is for an odd cat state (phi=-pi/4), but the procedure should be the same.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 0.2407 nats. Rounding to three significant figures, it's approximately 0.241 nats.

But let's check if there's a mistake in the reference state. The reference Gaussian state is supposed to have the same first and second moments as rho. We calculated the first moments as zero and the covariance matrix as diagonal with Vx=1.0 and Vp≈1.270. Therefore, the Gaussian state tau is a thermal squeezed state with these variances. However, in reality, a Gaussian state with diagonal covariance matrix and Vx != Vp is a squeezed thermal state. The entropy depends only on the symplectic eigenvalue, which is sqrt(Vx Vp). Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Another point to consider: since the original state is pure, the non-Gaussianity is entirely captured by the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. This makes sense because the relative entropy between a pure non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state is just the entropy of the Gaussian state, as the pure state has zero entropy.

Therefore, the final answer is del_b ≈ 0.241 nats.

Similarly, the cross terms for x would be <alpha|x|-alpha> = sqrt(2) * Re( <alpha| (a + a†)/sqrt(2) |-alpha> ) = (1/2) [ <alpha|a|-alpha> + <alpha|a†|-alpha> ].\n\nBut <alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha <alpha|-alpha> = -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <alpha|a†|-alpha> = <alpha|a†|-alpha> = (-alpha)* exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> would be the conjugate, but since everything is real here, it's the same as <alpha|x|-alpha> which is -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2).\n\nPutting this together, <x> for rho is (1/N^2)[ |c|^2 sqrt(2) alpha + |d|^2 (-sqrt(2) alpha) + c d (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + c d (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ].\n\nGiven phi = -pi/4, c = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, |c|^2 = |d|^2 = 1/2. Then:\n\n<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2) sqrt(2) alpha + (1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the cross terms. Let me re-express the terms:\n\nThe cross terms are c*d* <alpha|x|-alpha> + c*d* <-alpha|x|alpha> ?\n\nWait, no. The density matrix is |psi><psi|, so when calculating expectation values, it's <psi|x|psi> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + c d <alpha|x|-alpha> + d c <-alpha|x|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha> ].\n\nBut since c and d are real here (phi is real, so coefficients are real), so c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, c*d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1/2. Similarly, d*c is also -1/2.\n\nSo:\n\n<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2) sqrt(2) alpha + (1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha) + (-1/2) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (-1/2) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]\n\nBut <alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) as calculated earlier, and similarly <-alpha|x|alpha> is the same. Therefore:\n\n<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2 sqrt(2) alpha - 1/2 sqrt(2) alpha ) + (-1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (-1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ]\n\nThe first two terms cancel each other (1/2 -1/2 = 0). The cross terms become (1/2)(sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (1/2)(sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) = sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:\n\n<x> = (1/N^2) * sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nSimilarly, for alpha = 0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then:\n\nsqrt(2)*0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.7071 * 0.5 * 0.6065 ≈ 0.214.\n\nN^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. Therefore, <x> ≈ 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544.\n\nBut wait, this seems odd. The state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, so the average position should be zero if symmetric. But with phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/N. If N is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)), then the normalized state is (|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-0.5))). This is an antisymmetric combination. However, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, so the state is a superposition with opposite phases.\n\nBut when calculating <x>, which is (a + a†)/sqrt(2), the expectation value for |alpha> is sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = sqrt(2) * 0.5. For |-alpha>, it's sqrt(2) * (-0.5). However, due to the cross terms, the average might not be zero. Wait, but in the case of an equal superposition (like a cat state (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2)), the average <x> would be zero due to symmetry. But here, the coefficients are (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2), which is equivalent to (1, -1)/sqrt(2), so the same as the antisymmetric cat state. However, due to the normalization factor N, which is different from sqrt(2), the expectation value might not be zero. Wait, but in our calculation, we found <x> ≈ 0.544. That seems contradictory. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me re-express the expectation value:\n\n< x > = (1/N²) [ c² <alpha|x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x|alpha> ]\n\nGiven c = sqrt(2)/2, d = -sqrt(2)/2, so c² = d² = 0.5. Then:\n\n< x > = (1/N²) [ 0.5 * sqrt(2) * 0.5 + 0.5 * (-sqrt(2) * 0.5) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]\n\nThe first two terms: 0.5 * sqrt(2)*0.5 = sqrt(2)/4 ≈ 0.3535, and 0.5*(-sqrt(2)*0.5) = -sqrt(2)/4 ≈ -0.3535. These cancel each other. The cross terms:\n\n(sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2)/4 = -0.5. So:\n\n< x > = (1/N²) [ 0 + 0 + (-0.5) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (-0.5) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]\n\nBut <alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) * 0.5 * exp(-0.5) ≈ -sqrt(2)*0.5*0.6065 ≈ -0.429. Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> is the same as <alpha|x|-alpha> because x is Hermitian. Therefore:\n\n< x > = (1/N²) [ (-0.5)(-0.429) + (-0.5)(-0.429) ] = (1/N²)(0.2145 + 0.2145) = (0.429)/0.3935 ≈ 1.09.\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the cross terms. Let me re-express:\n\n<alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) = -sqrt(2)*0.5*exp(-0.5) ≈ -0.7071*0.5*0.6065 ≈ -0.7071*0.30325 ≈ -0.214. Then, each cross term is (-0.5)*(-0.214) = 0.107. Two such terms sum to 0.214. Then, <x> = 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544. So that's the same as before. But why is the average position not zero? Because the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-0.5))), which is antisymmetric. However, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, so the state isn't exactly symmetric. Wait, but in the case of alpha being real, the state (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))) is an odd superposition, so perhaps the expectation value of x should be zero. But according to the calculation, it's not. Hmm, this suggests a possible error in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's think again. For a coherent state |alpha>, the expectation value of x is sqrt(2) Re(alpha). For |-alpha>, it's sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = -sqrt(2) Re(alpha). So, if the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))), then the expectation value of x would be [ <alpha|x|alpha> - <alpha|x|-alpha> - <-alpha|x|alpha> + <-alpha|x|-alpha> ] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))].\n\nBut <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) alpha, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha. The cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha> are equal to -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:\n\n<x> = [ sqrt(2) alpha - (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) - (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (-sqrt(2) alpha) ] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nsqrt(2) alpha - sqrt(2) alpha + 2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) = 2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nThus, <x> = [2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))] = [sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)]\n\nFor alpha = 0.5:\n\nNumerator: sqrt(2)*0.5*exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.7071*0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.214\n\nDenominator: 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935\n\nThus, <x> ≈ 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544. So the expectation value of x is approximately 0.544. This seems non-zero, which is counterintuitive for an antisymmetric state. However, because the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha> is non-zero, the state isn't perfectly antisymmetric in the position basis. Therefore, the average position isn't zero. This is a valid result.\n\nSimilarly, the expectation value of p would be zero, as coherent states have <p> = sqrt(2) Im(alpha), and here alpha is real, so <p> for |alpha> and |-alpha> is zero. The cross terms would also cancel out. Let's verify:\n\n< p > = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|p|alpha> + d² <-alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p|alpha> ]\n\nSince <alpha|p|alpha> = 0 and <-alpha|p|-alpha> = 0, the first two terms are zero. The cross terms <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha> need to be calculated. For real alpha, p is proportional to (a - a†)/i sqrt(2), so <alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) <alpha|a - a†|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ <alpha|a|-alpha> - <alpha|a†|-alpha> ].\n\n<alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha <alpha|-alpha> = -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <alpha|a†|-alpha> = <alpha|a†|-alpha> = (-alpha)* exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:\n\n<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) - (-alpha) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <-alpha|p|alpha> would also be zero. Therefore, <p> = 0. So the first moments are (0.544, 0). However, for a Gaussian state, the first moments can be displaced, but the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first moments. However, typically, non-Gaussianity measures sometimes consider the covariance matrix (second moments) and ignore first moments, but in the relative entropy measure, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as rho. Therefore, we need to compute both first and second moments for rho.\n\nBut since the state is pure and non-Gaussian, the reference Gaussian state tau will have the same first and second moments as rho. The von Neumann entropy of tau depends on the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is determined by the determinant of the covariance matrix. For a single mode, the entropy is given by S(tau) = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2), where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue, which for a pure Gaussian state would be 1, but tau is a mixed Gaussian state with nu >=1.\n\nTo compute the covariance matrix of rho, we need the variances of x and p, and the covariance term. For a coherent state, the covariance matrix is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2 (since coherent states are minimum uncertainty states). However, for the superposition state rho, the variances may be larger due to the superposition.\n\nThe covariance matrix elements are:\n\nsigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2\n\nsigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2\n\nsigma_xp = (1/2)(<x p + p x>) - <x><p>\n\nSince <p> = 0, sigma_xp = (1/2)(<x p + p x>). For our state, due to the real nature of alpha and the coefficients, the state may have no correlation between x and p, leading to sigma_xp = 0. Let's verify.\n\nFirst, compute <x^2> and <p^2> for rho.\n\nFor a coherent state |alpha>, <x^2> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2. Similarly, <p^2> = (1/2). For |-alpha>, <x^2> is the same as |alpha>, since x^2 is even in alpha. Therefore, the diagonal terms for x^2 and p^2 in rho would involve the same calculation as before, but for x^2.\n\nLet's compute <x^2> for rho:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x^2|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ]\n\nSince <alpha|x^2|alpha> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2 = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2. Similarly for <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2. The cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|x^2|alpha> need to be calculated.\n\nx^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = ( <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a† a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ) / 2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = <alpha|(a†)^2|-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a† a|-alpha> = <alpha|a† a |-alpha> = alpha* (-alpha) exp(-2 alpha^2) = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n<alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\n= [ 0 + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2 = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2\n\nTherefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2. Similarly, <-alpha|x^2|alpha> is the same.\n\nTherefore, <x^2> for rho is:\n\n(1/N²)[ (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/N²)[ (0.5 + 0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\n= (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nFor alpha = 0.5:\n\n1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0\n\n0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.30325\n\nThus, <x^2> ≈ (1.0 - 0.30325)/0.3935 ≈ 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770.\n\nThen, sigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2 ≈ 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474.\n\nSimilarly, compute <p^2>. For coherent states, <p^2> = 1/2. For the cross terms:\n\n<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = ?\n\np^2 = (a - a†)^2 / (-2) = (a^2 + a†^2 - 2 a† a -1)/(-2) = (-a^2 - a†^2 + 2 a† a +1)/2.\n\nTherefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ - <alpha|a^2|-alpha> - <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a† a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|a† a|-alpha> = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\n<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nThus:\n\n<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\n= [ -2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\n= [ -4 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2\n\n= exp(-2 alpha^2) (1 - 4 alpha^2) / 2\n\nFor alpha = 0.5:\n\nexp(-0.5) * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0. Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.\n\nTherefore, <p^2> for rho is:\n\n(1/N²)[ 0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(1/2) + (-0.5)*0 + (-0.5)*0 ] = (1/N²)(0.5) = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270.\n\nThus, sigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2 ≈ 1.270 - 0 = 1.270.\n\nThe covariance term sigma_xp is (1/2)(<x p + p x>). For our state, since it's a real combination of coherent states, and given the symmetry, this term might be zero. Let's verify:\n\n<x p + p x> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x p + p x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> ]\n\nFor coherent states |alpha>, <x p + p x> = 0 because x and p are uncorrelated. Similarly for |-alpha>. The cross terms <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> need to be calculated. However, due to the complexity of these terms, and given the state's symmetry, it's plausible that sigma_xp = 0. Assuming this, the covariance matrix is diagonal with sigma_xx ≈ 1.474, sigma_pp ≈ 1.270, and sigma_xp = 0.\n\nHowever, for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle: sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= 1/4. Here, 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872, which is much larger than 1/4, so it's valid.\n\nThe reference Gaussian state tau has covariance matrix with elements sigma_xx, sigma_pp, and sigma_xp. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is sqrt(sigma_xx sigma_pp) because the covariance matrix is diagonal. Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue is given by nu = sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) / (1/2). Wait, the uncertainty relation is sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= (1/2)^2. The symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) * 2. Wait, let me recall the correct formula.\n\nThe covariance matrix for a single mode is:\n\nsigma = [ [ sigma_xx, sigma_xp ],\n          [ sigma_xp, sigma_pp ] ]\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalues nu is given by sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) * 2. Because the uncertainty principle requires sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= 1/4. Therefore, nu = 2 * sqrt( sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 ). For a pure Gaussian state, nu = 1. For mixed states, nu >1.\n\nIn our case, sigma_xp = 0, so nu = 2 * sqrt( sigma_xx sigma_pp ). Plugging in the values:\n\nsigma_xx ≈ 1.474, sigma_pp ≈ 1.270. Then, sigma_xx sigma_pp ≈ 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. Therefore, nu ≈ 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736.\n\nThen, the entropy S(tau) is:\n\nS = ( (nu +1)/2 ) ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) ln( (nu -1)/2 )\n\nPlugging in nu ≈ 2.736:\n\n(nu +1)/2 ≈ (3.736)/2 ≈ 1.868\n\n(nu -1)/2 ≈ (1.736)/2 ≈ 0.868\n\nThen,\n\nS ≈ 1.868 ln(1.868) - 0.868 ln(0.868)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nln(1.868) ≈ 0.625\n\n1.868 * 0.625 ≈ 1.1675\n\nln(0.868) ≈ -0.146\n\n0.868 * (-0.146) ≈ -0.127\n\nThus, S ≈ 1.1675 - (-0.127) ≈ 1.2945 nats.\n\nSince del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) and S(rho) = 0 (pure state), del_b ≈ 1.2945 nats.\n\nConverting to bits (if needed), divide by ln(2) ≈ 0.693, so ≈ 1.2945 / 0.693 ≈ 1.87 bits. But the question asks for the answer in nats, as the formula uses natural logarithm.\n\nHowever, there might be errors in the calculation of the covariance matrix. Let me verify:\n\nWait, the covariance matrix for a coherent state |alpha> is indeed [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], but for our state rho, which is a superposition, the variances are larger. However, when calculating <x^2> and <p^2>, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, for a coherent state |alpha>, <x^2> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2. For alpha = 0.5, this is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0. Similarly, <x^2> for |-alpha> is also 1.0. The cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> were calculated as exp(-0.5)/2 ≈ 0.30325. Then, <x^2> for rho is [ (0.5*1.0 + 0.5*1.0) - 0.5*0.30325 ] / 0.3935 ≈ (1.0 - 0.1516)/0.3935 ≈ 0.8484 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.156. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the expression was:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nWait, for alpha = 0.5, 2 alpha^2 = 0.5, so 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0. Then, 0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325. Therefore, numerator is 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675. Divided by N² ≈ 0.3935, gives 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770. Then, sigma_xx = 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, <p^2> was calculated as 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Therefore, sigma_pp = 1.270.\n\nThus, the product sigma_xx sigma_pp ≈ 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. The symplectic eigenvalue nu = 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2.736. Then, the entropy S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats. Therefore, del_b ≈ 1.2945.\n\nBut let's cross-validate this with another approach. The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix sigma is S = (nu +1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). For nu ≈ 2.736, this gives approximately 1.2945 nats.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the cross term sigma_xp is not zero. Let's check <x p + p x> for the state rho.\n\n<x p + p x> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x p + p x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> ]\n\nFor coherent states, <x p + p x> = 0 because x and p are uncorrelated. For cross terms:\n\n<alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> = ?\n\nUsing x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), p = (a - a†)/i sqrt(2). Then,\n\nx p + p x = (a + a†)(a - a†)/i 2 + (a - a†)(a + a†)/i 2\n\n= [ (a^2 - a†^2 + a a† - a† a) + (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a†) ] / i 2\n\n= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + (a a† - a† a) + (a† a - a a†) ] / i 2\n\nBut a a† = a† a + 1, so:\n\n= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + (a† a +1 - a† a) + (a† a - (a† a +1)) ] / i 2\n\n= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + 1 -1 ] / i 2\n\n= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 ] / i 2\n\n= (a^2 - a†^2)/i\n\nTherefore, <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> = <alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |-alpha>\n\n= ( <alpha|a^2|-alpha> - <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> ) / i\n\n= ( alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - (-alpha)^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ) / i\n\n= ( alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ) / i = 0.\n\nTherefore, <x p + p x> for the cross terms is zero. Hence, sigma_xp = 0. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal, and the previous calculation holds.\n\nThus, the symplectic eigenvalue nu ≈ 2.736, leading to S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats. Therefore, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = 1.2945 - 0 = 1.2945 nats.\n\nBut wait, the formula given in the problem is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) = 0. Therefore, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = S(tau). Hence, del_b = S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats.\n\nBut let me confirm with exact calculation. Let's compute nu more precisely.\n\nGiven sigma_xx = 1.474, sigma_pp = 1.270. Then, sigma_xx * sigma_pp = 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. Therefore, nu = 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736.\n\nCompute S(tau):\n\nS = ( (2.736 +1)/2 ) * ln( (2.736 +1)/2 ) - ( (2.736 -1)/2 ) * ln( (2.736 -1)/2 )\n\n= (3.736/2) * ln(1.868) - (1.736/2) * ln(0.868)\n\n= 1.868 * ln(1.868) - 0.868 * ln(0.868)\n\nCalculate ln(1.868):\n\nln(1.868) ≈ 0.625\n\n1.868 * 0.625 ≈ 1.1675\n\nln(0.868) ≈ -0.141\n\n0.868 * (-0.141) ≈ -0.122\n\nThus, S ≈ 1.1675 - (-0.122) ≈ 1.2895 nats.\n\nMore precisely, using calculator:\n\nln(1.868) ≈ 0.6255\n\n1.868 * 0.6255 ≈ 1.167\n\nln(0.868) ≈ -0.1413\n\n0.868 * (-0.1413) ≈ -0.1226\n\nThus, S ≈ 1.167 - (-0.1226) = 1.2896 nats.\n\nTherefore, del_b ≈ 1.2896 nats.\n\nBut let's check if the covariance matrix was correctly calculated. The variance sigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.544^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Similarly, sigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2 ≈ 1.270 - 0 ≈ 1.270. These values seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of <x^2> for rho. Let's re-express:\n\n<x^2> = (1/N²)[ (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) ]\n\n= (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]\n\nFor alpha = 0.5:\n\n1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0\n\n0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325\n\nThus, numerator = 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675\n\nN² = 0.3935\n\n<x^2> = 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770\n\nThen, sigma_xx = 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, <p^2> = (1/N²)[0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(1/2) + 0 + 0] = (0.5)/0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix is correct, leading to nu ≈ 2.736 and S(tau) ≈ 1.2896 nats.\n\nThus, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.29 nats.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation with more precise values.\n\nFirst, compute N²:\n\nN² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)\n\nphi = -pi/4, so 2 phi = -pi/2, sin(-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, N² = 1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.60653066 ≈ 0.39346934.\n\nThus, N ≈ 0.6273.\n\nCompute <x>:\n\n<x> = [sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / N²\n\nalpha = 0.5:\n\nsqrt(2)*0.5 ≈ 0.7071*0.5 ≈ 0.35355\n\nexp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066\n\nThus, numerator = 0.35355 * 0.60653066 ≈ 0.2145\n\nDenominator = 0.39346934\n\n<x> ≈ 0.2145 / 0.39346934 ≈ 0.545\n\n<x>^2 ≈ 0.545^2 ≈ 0.297\n\n<x^2> = [1.0 - 0.5*exp(-0.5)] / N² ≈ [1.0 - 0.5*0.60653066] / 0.39346934 ≈ [1.0 - 0.303265] / 0.39346934 ≈ 0.696735 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.770\n\nsigma_xx = 1.770 - 0.297 ≈ 1.473\n\nSimilarly, <p^2> = 0.5 / N² ≈ 0.5 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.270\n\nsigma_pp = 1.270\n\nnu = 2 * sqrt(1.473 * 1.270) ≈ 2 * sqrt(1.871) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736\n\nCompute S(tau):\n\n(nu +1)/2 = (2.736 +1)/2 = 1.868\n\n(nu -1)/2 = (2.736 -1)/2 = 0.868\n\nln(1.868) ≈ 0.6255\n\nln(0.868) ≈ -0.1413\n\nS = 1.868 * 0.6255 - 0.868 * (-0.1413) ≈ 1.868*0.6255 + 0.868*0.1413 ≈ 1.170 + 0.1226 ≈ 1.2926 nats.\n\nTherefore, del_b ≈ 1.2926 nats.\n\nRounding to three significant figures, del_b ≈ 1.29 nats.\n\nHowever, given the problem's parameters, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Alternatively, there might be an analytical approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho is a displaced squeezed state. However, since the first moments are non-zero, but the covariance matrix is diagonal with sigma_xx and sigma_pp, the state is a thermal squeezed state displaced in x. However, the entropy depends only on the symplectic eigenvalue nu, which we've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the reference Gaussian state has the same first and second moments. However, according to the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is indeed the one with the same first and second moments as the state in question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for del_b is approximately 1.29 nats. Given the problem's parameters, this seems reasonable. However, to ensure precision, let's compute using exact expressions.\n\nLet me compute nu exactly:\n\nsigma_xx = 1.473, sigma_pp = 1.270\n\nsigma_xx * sigma_pp = 1.473 * 1.270 ≈ 1.473*1.27 ≈ 1.473*1 + 1.473*0.27 ≈ 1.473 + 0.3977 ≈ 1.8707\n\nnu = 2 * sqrt(1.8707) ≈ 2 * 1.3678 ≈ 2.7356\n\nThen,\n\n(nu +1)/2 ≈ (2.7356 +1)/2 ≈ 1.8678\n\n(nu -1)/2 ≈ (2.7356 -1)/2 ≈ 0.8678\n\nln(1.8678) ≈ 0.6255\n\nln(0.8678) ≈ -0.1416\n\nThus,\n\nS = 1.8678 * 0.6255 - 0.8678 * (-0.1416) ≈ 1.8678*0.6255 + 0.8678*0.1416 ≈ 1.170 + 0.123 ≈ 1.293 nats.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.293 nats.\n\nGiven the problem's request to calculate it for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, and following through the detailed steps, the answer should be approximately 1.29 nats. However, to check for possible miscalculations, let's consider an alternative approach.\n\nAnother way to compute the entropy of the Gaussian state is using the formula for the entropy of a thermal state. The symplectic eigenvalue nu corresponds to the purity of the Gaussian state: mu = 1/nu. The entropy S = (nu +1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). Alternatively, for a thermal state with average photon number n, the entropy is S = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n. However, this applies when the state is a thermal state with covariance matrix diag(n + 1/2, n + 1/2). In our case, the covariance matrix is diag(sigma_xx, sigma_pp), which is not symmetric, so it's a squeezed thermal state. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is related to the squeezing and thermal parameters. However, the entropy formula in terms of nu remains the same.\n\nGiven that we've calculated nu ≈ 2.7356, the entropy S ≈ 1.293 nats. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.29 nats.\n\nHowever, to ensure that there's no error in the calculation of the covariance matrix, let's recheck the cross terms in <x^2> and <p^2>.\n\nFor <x^2>, the cross terms were calculated as -0.5 * exp(-2 alpha^2)/2. For alpha=0.5, this is -0.5 * exp(-0.5)/2 ≈ -0.5 * 0.6065/2 ≈ -0.1516. Then, <x^2> = (1.0 - 0.1516)/0.3935 ≈ 0.8484/0.3935 ≈ 2.156. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the expression was:\n\n<x^2> = [ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N²\n\nFor alpha=0.5:\n\n1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1.0\n\n0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325\n\nThus, numerator = 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675\n\nN² = 0.3935\n\n<x^2> = 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770\n\nYes, correct. Then, sigma_xx = 1.770 - 0.544^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent.\n\nIn conclusion, the non-Gaussianity del_b for the given Schrödinger cat state with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 is approximately 1.29 nats.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe non-Gaussianity for the given Schrödinger cat state is \\boxed{1.29}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745448289, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=10662, prompt_tokens=1264, total_tokens=11926, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we follow these steps:

1. **State Definition and Normalization**:
   The given state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N} \) with \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The normalization constant \(N\) is calculated as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)} = \sqrt{1 - \exp(-0.5)} \approx 0.6273
   \]

2. **Density Matrix**:
   The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).

3. **Reference Gaussian State**:
   The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) has the same first and second moments as \(\rho\). 

4. **First Moments**:
   - The expectation value of position \(x\) is calculated to be approximately 0.544.
   - The expectation value of momentum \(p\) is zero.

5. **Second Moments**:
   - The variance of position \(\sigma_{xx} \approx 1.474\)
   - The variance of momentum \(\sigma_{pp} \approx 1.270\)
   - The covariance term \(\sigma_{xp} = 0\)

6. **Symplectic Eigenvalue**:
   The symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\) of the covariance matrix is calculated as:
   \[
   \nu = 2 \sqrt{\sigma_{xx} \sigma_{pp}} \approx 2.736
   \]

7. **Von Neumann Entropy of Gaussian State**:
   The entropy \(S(\tau)\) is calculated using the symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\):
   \[
   S(\tau) = \frac{(\nu + 1)}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right) - \frac{(\nu - 1)}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu - 1}{2}\right) \approx 1.29 \text{ nats}
   \]

8. **Non-Gaussianity**:
   The non-Gaussianity \(\delta_b\) is the difference in entropy between \(\rho\) and \(\tau\):
   \[
   \delta_b = S(\tau) - S(\rho) = 1.29 - 0 = 1.29 \text{ nats}
   \]

### Final Answer
The non-Gaussianity for the given Schrödinger cat state is \boxed{1.29}.

For real alpha, <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) alpha, and <alpha|p|alpha> = 0. Similarly, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha, and <p> remains zero. The cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha> would involve overlaps between |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is exp(-2 alpha^2). For alpha = 0.5, this is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Similarly, the cross terms for x would be <alpha|x|-alpha> = sqrt(2) * Re( <alpha| (a + a†)/sqrt(2) |-alpha> ) = (1/2) [ <alpha|a|-alpha> + <alpha|a†|-alpha> ].

But <alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha <alpha|-alpha> = -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <alpha|a†|-alpha> = <alpha|a†|-alpha> = (-alpha)* exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore, <alpha|x|-alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> would be the conjugate, but since everything is real here, it's the same as <alpha|x|-alpha> which is -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2).

Putting this together, <x> for rho is (1/N^2)[ |c|^2 sqrt(2) alpha + |d|^2 (-sqrt(2) alpha) + c d (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + c d (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ].

Given phi = -pi/4, c = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, |c|^2 = |d|^2 = 1/2. Then:

<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2) sqrt(2) alpha + (1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the cross terms. Let me re-express the terms:

The cross terms are c*d* <alpha|x|-alpha> + c*d* <-alpha|x|alpha> ?

Wait, no. The density matrix is |psi><psi|, so when calculating expectation values, it's <psi|x|psi> = (1/N^2)[ c^2 <alpha|x|alpha> + c d <alpha|x|-alpha> + d c <-alpha|x|alpha> + d^2 <-alpha|x|-alpha> ].

But since c and d are real here (phi is real, so coefficients are real), so c = cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, d = sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, c*d = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1/2. Similarly, d*c is also -1/2.

So:

<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2) sqrt(2) alpha + (1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha) + (-1/2) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (-1/2) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]

But <alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) as calculated earlier, and similarly <-alpha|x|alpha> is the same. Therefore:

<x> = (1/N^2)[ (1/2 sqrt(2) alpha - 1/2 sqrt(2) alpha ) + (-1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (-1/2)(-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) ]

The first two terms cancel each other (1/2 -1/2 = 0). The cross terms become (1/2)(sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (1/2)(sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) = sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:

<x> = (1/N^2) * sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)

Similarly, for alpha = 0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then:

sqrt(2)*0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.7071 * 0.5 * 0.6065 ≈ 0.214.

N^2 = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. Therefore, <x> ≈ 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544.

But wait, this seems odd. The state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, so the average position should be zero if symmetric. But with phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>)/N. If N is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)), then the normalized state is (|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-0.5))). This is an antisymmetric combination. However, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, so the state is a superposition with opposite phases.

But when calculating <x>, which is (a + a†)/sqrt(2), the expectation value for |alpha> is sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = sqrt(2) * 0.5. For |-alpha>, it's sqrt(2) * (-0.5). However, due to the cross terms, the average might not be zero. Wait, but in the case of an equal superposition (like a cat state (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2)), the average <x> would be zero due to symmetry. But here, the coefficients are (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2), which is equivalent to (1, -1)/sqrt(2), so the same as the antisymmetric cat state. However, due to the normalization factor N, which is different from sqrt(2), the expectation value might not be zero. Wait, but in our calculation, we found <x> ≈ 0.544. That seems contradictory. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me re-express the expectation value:

< x > = (1/N²) [ c² <alpha|x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x|alpha> ]

Given c = sqrt(2)/2, d = -sqrt(2)/2, so c² = d² = 0.5. Then:

< x > = (1/N²) [ 0.5 * sqrt(2) * 0.5 + 0.5 * (-sqrt(2) * 0.5) + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]

The first two terms: 0.5 * sqrt(2)*0.5 = sqrt(2)/4 ≈ 0.3535, and 0.5*(-sqrt(2)*0.5) = -sqrt(2)/4 ≈ -0.3535. These cancel each other. The cross terms:

(sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2)/4 = -0.5. So:

< x > = (1/N²) [ 0 + 0 + (-0.5) <alpha|x|-alpha> + (-0.5) <-alpha|x|alpha> ]

But <alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) * 0.5 * exp(-0.5) ≈ -sqrt(2)*0.5*0.6065 ≈ -0.429. Similarly, <-alpha|x|alpha> is the same as <alpha|x|-alpha> because x is Hermitian. Therefore:

< x > = (1/N²) [ (-0.5)(-0.429) + (-0.5)(-0.429) ] = (1/N²)(0.2145 + 0.2145) = (0.429)/0.3935 ≈ 1.09.

Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the cross terms. Let me re-express:

<alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) = -sqrt(2)*0.5*exp(-0.5) ≈ -0.7071*0.5*0.6065 ≈ -0.7071*0.30325 ≈ -0.214. Then, each cross term is (-0.5)*(-0.214) = 0.107. Two such terms sum to 0.214. Then, <x> = 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544. So that's the same as before. But why is the average position not zero? Because the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-0.5))), which is antisymmetric. However, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, so the state isn't exactly symmetric. Wait, but in the case of alpha being real, the state (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))) is an odd superposition, so perhaps the expectation value of x should be zero. But according to the calculation, it's not. Hmm, this suggests a possible error in the calculation.

Wait, let's think again. For a coherent state |alpha>, the expectation value of x is sqrt(2) Re(alpha). For |-alpha>, it's sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = -sqrt(2) Re(alpha). So, if the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))), then the expectation value of x would be [ <alpha|x|alpha> - <alpha|x|-alpha> - <-alpha|x|alpha> + <-alpha|x|-alpha> ] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))].

But <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) alpha, <-alpha|x|-alpha> = -sqrt(2) alpha. The cross terms <alpha|x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x|alpha> are equal to -sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:

<x> = [ sqrt(2) alpha - (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) - (-sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)) + (-sqrt(2) alpha) ] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))]

Simplify numerator:

sqrt(2) alpha - sqrt(2) alpha + 2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) = 2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)

Thus, <x> = [2 sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / [2(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2))] = [sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)]

For alpha = 0.5:

Numerator: sqrt(2)*0.5*exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.7071*0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.214

Denominator: 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935

Thus, <x> ≈ 0.214 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.544. So the expectation value of x is approximately 0.544. This seems non-zero, which is counterintuitive for an antisymmetric state. However, because the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha> is non-zero, the state isn't perfectly antisymmetric in the position basis. Therefore, the average position isn't zero. This is a valid result.

Similarly, the expectation value of p would be zero, as coherent states have <p> = sqrt(2) Im(alpha), and here alpha is real, so <p> for |alpha> and |-alpha> is zero. The cross terms would also cancel out. Let's verify:

< p > = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|p|alpha> + d² <-alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <alpha|p|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|p|alpha> ]

Since <alpha|p|alpha> = 0 and <-alpha|p|-alpha> = 0, the first two terms are zero. The cross terms <alpha|p|-alpha> and <-alpha|p|alpha> need to be calculated. For real alpha, p is proportional to (a - a†)/i sqrt(2), so <alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) <alpha|a - a†|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ <alpha|a|-alpha> - <alpha|a†|-alpha> ].

<alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha <alpha|-alpha> = -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2). Similarly, <alpha|a†|-alpha> = <alpha|a†|-alpha> = (-alpha)* exp(-2 alpha^2). Therefore:

<alpha|p|-alpha> = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) - (-alpha) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = (1/i sqrt(2)) [ -alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = 0.

Similarly, <-alpha|p|alpha> would also be zero. Therefore, <p> = 0. So the first moments are (0.544, 0). However, for a Gaussian state, the first moments can be displaced, but the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first moments. However, typically, non-Gaussianity measures sometimes consider the covariance matrix (second moments) and ignore first moments, but in the relative entropy measure, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as rho. Therefore, we need to compute both first and second moments for rho.

But since the state is pure and non-Gaussian, the reference Gaussian state tau will have the same first and second moments as rho. The von Neumann entropy of tau depends on the symplectic eigenvalues of its covariance matrix. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is determined by the determinant of the covariance matrix. For a single mode, the entropy is given by S(tau) = (nu + 1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2), where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue, which for a pure Gaussian state would be 1, but tau is a mixed Gaussian state with nu >=1.

To compute the covariance matrix of rho, we need the variances of x and p, and the covariance term. For a coherent state, the covariance matrix is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2 (since coherent states are minimum uncertainty states). However, for the superposition state rho, the variances may be larger due to the superposition.

The covariance matrix elements are:

sigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2

sigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2

sigma_xp = (1/2)(<x p + p x>) - <x><p>

Since <p> = 0, sigma_xp = (1/2)(<x p + p x>). For our state, due to the real nature of alpha and the coefficients, the state may have no correlation between x and p, leading to sigma_xp = 0. Let's verify.

First, compute <x^2> and <p^2> for rho.

For a coherent state |alpha>, <x^2> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2. Similarly, <p^2> = (1/2). For |-alpha>, <x^2> is the same as |alpha>, since x^2 is even in alpha. Therefore, the diagonal terms for x^2 and p^2 in rho would involve the same calculation as before, but for x^2.

Let's compute <x^2> for rho:

<x^2> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x^2|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x^2|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x^2|alpha> ]

Since <alpha|x^2|alpha> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2 = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2. Similarly for <-alpha|x^2|-alpha> = 1/2 + 2 alpha^2. The cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> and <-alpha|x^2|alpha> need to be calculated.

x^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = ( <alpha|a^2|-alpha> + <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a† a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ) / 2.

Calculating each term:

<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = <alpha|(a†)^2|-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a† a|-alpha> = <alpha|a† a |-alpha> = alpha* (-alpha) exp(-2 alpha^2) = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)

Putting it all together:

<alpha|x^2|-alpha> = [ alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= [ 0 + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2 = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2

Therefore, <alpha|x^2|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)/2. Similarly, <-alpha|x^2|alpha> is the same.

Therefore, <x^2> for rho is:

(1/N²)[ (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) ]

Simplify:

= (1/N²)[ (0.5 + 0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

= (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

For alpha = 0.5:

1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0

0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.5*0.6065 ≈ 0.30325

Thus, <x^2> ≈ (1.0 - 0.30325)/0.3935 ≈ 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770.

Then, sigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2 ≈ 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474.

Similarly, compute <p^2>. For coherent states, <p^2> = 1/2. For the cross terms:

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = ?

p^2 = (a - a†)^2 / (-2) = (a^2 + a†^2 - 2 a† a -1)/(-2) = (-a^2 - a†^2 + 2 a† a +1)/2.

Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ - <alpha|a^2|-alpha> - <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> + 2 <alpha|a† a|-alpha> + <alpha|1|-alpha> ] / 2

Calculating each term:

<alpha|a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a†^2|-alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|a† a|-alpha> = - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)

<alpha|1|-alpha> = exp(-2 alpha^2)

Thus:

<alpha|p^2|-alpha> = [ - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + 2*(- alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2)) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= [ -2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - 2 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= [ -4 alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / 2

= exp(-2 alpha^2) (1 - 4 alpha^2) / 2

For alpha = 0.5:

exp(-0.5) * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0. Therefore, <alpha|p^2|-alpha> = 0.

Therefore, <p^2> for rho is:

(1/N²)[ 0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(1/2) + (-0.5)*0 + (-0.5)*0 ] = (1/N²)(0.5) = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270.

Thus, sigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2 ≈ 1.270 - 0 = 1.270.

The covariance term sigma_xp is (1/2)(<x p + p x>). For our state, since it's a real combination of coherent states, and given the symmetry, this term might be zero. Let's verify:

<x p + p x> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x p + p x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> ]

For coherent states |alpha>, <x p + p x> = 0 because x and p are uncorrelated. Similarly for |-alpha>. The cross terms <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> and <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> need to be calculated. However, due to the complexity of these terms, and given the state's symmetry, it's plausible that sigma_xp = 0. Assuming this, the covariance matrix is diagonal with sigma_xx ≈ 1.474, sigma_pp ≈ 1.270, and sigma_xp = 0.

However, for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle: sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= 1/4. Here, 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872, which is much larger than 1/4, so it's valid.

The reference Gaussian state tau has covariance matrix with elements sigma_xx, sigma_pp, and sigma_xp. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is sqrt(sigma_xx sigma_pp) because the covariance matrix is diagonal. Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue is given by nu = sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) / (1/2). Wait, the uncertainty relation is sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= (1/2)^2. The symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) * 2. Wait, let me recall the correct formula.

The covariance matrix for a single mode is:

sigma = [ [ sigma_xx, sigma_xp ],
          [ sigma_xp, sigma_pp ] ]

The symplectic eigenvalues nu is given by sqrt( (sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2) ) * 2. Because the uncertainty principle requires sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 >= 1/4. Therefore, nu = 2 * sqrt( sigma_xx sigma_pp - sigma_xp^2 ). For a pure Gaussian state, nu = 1. For mixed states, nu >1.

In our case, sigma_xp = 0, so nu = 2 * sqrt( sigma_xx sigma_pp ). Plugging in the values:

sigma_xx ≈ 1.474, sigma_pp ≈ 1.270. Then, sigma_xx sigma_pp ≈ 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. Therefore, nu ≈ 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736.

Then, the entropy S(tau) is:

S = ( (nu +1)/2 ) ln( (nu +1)/2 ) - ( (nu -1)/2 ) ln( (nu -1)/2 )

Plugging in nu ≈ 2.736:

(nu +1)/2 ≈ (3.736)/2 ≈ 1.868

(nu -1)/2 ≈ (1.736)/2 ≈ 0.868

Then,

S ≈ 1.868 ln(1.868) - 0.868 ln(0.868)

Calculate each term:

ln(1.868) ≈ 0.625

1.868 * 0.625 ≈ 1.1675

ln(0.868) ≈ -0.146

0.868 * (-0.146) ≈ -0.127

Thus, S ≈ 1.1675 - (-0.127) ≈ 1.2945 nats.

Since del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) and S(rho) = 0 (pure state), del_b ≈ 1.2945 nats.

Converting to bits (if needed), divide by ln(2) ≈ 0.693, so ≈ 1.2945 / 0.693 ≈ 1.87 bits. But the question asks for the answer in nats, as the formula uses natural logarithm.

However, there might be errors in the calculation of the covariance matrix. Let me verify:

Wait, the covariance matrix for a coherent state |alpha> is indeed [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], but for our state rho, which is a superposition, the variances are larger. However, when calculating <x^2> and <p^2>, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, for a coherent state |alpha>, <x^2> = (1/2) + (sqrt(2) alpha)^2. For alpha = 0.5, this is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0. Similarly, <x^2> for |-alpha> is also 1.0. The cross terms <alpha|x^2|-alpha> were calculated as exp(-0.5)/2 ≈ 0.30325. Then, <x^2> for rho is [ (0.5*1.0 + 0.5*1.0) - 0.5*0.30325 ] / 0.3935 ≈ (1.0 - 0.1516)/0.3935 ≈ 0.8484 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.156. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no:

Wait, the expression was:

<x^2> = (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

Wait, for alpha = 0.5, 2 alpha^2 = 0.5, so 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0. Then, 0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325. Therefore, numerator is 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675. Divided by N² ≈ 0.3935, gives 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770. Then, sigma_xx = 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. That's correct.

Similarly, <p^2> was calculated as 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Therefore, sigma_pp = 1.270.

Thus, the product sigma_xx sigma_pp ≈ 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. The symplectic eigenvalue nu = 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2.736. Then, the entropy S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats. Therefore, del_b ≈ 1.2945.

But let's cross-validate this with another approach. The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix sigma is S = (nu +1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). For nu ≈ 2.736, this gives approximately 1.2945 nats.

However, there's a possibility that the cross term sigma_xp is not zero. Let's check <x p + p x> for the state rho.

<x p + p x> = (1/N²)[ c² <alpha|x p + p x|alpha> + d² <-alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> + c d <-alpha|x p + p x|alpha> ]

For coherent states, <x p + p x> = 0 because x and p are uncorrelated. For cross terms:

<alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> = ?

Using x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), p = (a - a†)/i sqrt(2). Then,

x p + p x = (a + a†)(a - a†)/i 2 + (a - a†)(a + a†)/i 2

= [ (a^2 - a†^2 + a a† - a† a) + (a^2 - a†^2 + a† a - a a†) ] / i 2

= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + (a a† - a† a) + (a† a - a a†) ] / i 2

But a a† = a† a + 1, so:

= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + (a† a +1 - a† a) + (a† a - (a† a +1)) ] / i 2

= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 + 1 -1 ] / i 2

= [ 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2 ] / i 2

= (a^2 - a†^2)/i

Therefore, <alpha|x p + p x|-alpha> = <alpha| (a^2 - a†^2)/i |-alpha>

= ( <alpha|a^2|-alpha> - <alpha|a†^2|-alpha> ) / i

= ( alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - (-alpha)^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ) / i

= ( alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) - alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ) / i = 0.

Therefore, <x p + p x> for the cross terms is zero. Hence, sigma_xp = 0. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal, and the previous calculation holds.

Thus, the symplectic eigenvalue nu ≈ 2.736, leading to S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats. Therefore, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = 1.2945 - 0 = 1.2945 nats.

But wait, the formula given in the problem is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) = 0. Therefore, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = S(tau). Hence, del_b = S(tau) ≈ 1.2945 nats.

But let me confirm with exact calculation. Let's compute nu more precisely.

Given sigma_xx = 1.474, sigma_pp = 1.270. Then, sigma_xx * sigma_pp = 1.474 * 1.270 ≈ 1.872. Therefore, nu = 2 * sqrt(1.872) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736.

Compute S(tau):

S = ( (2.736 +1)/2 ) * ln( (2.736 +1)/2 ) - ( (2.736 -1)/2 ) * ln( (2.736 -1)/2 )

= (3.736/2) * ln(1.868) - (1.736/2) * ln(0.868)

= 1.868 * ln(1.868) - 0.868 * ln(0.868)

Calculate ln(1.868):

ln(1.868) ≈ 0.625

1.868 * 0.625 ≈ 1.1675

ln(0.868) ≈ -0.141

0.868 * (-0.141) ≈ -0.122

Thus, S ≈ 1.1675 - (-0.122) ≈ 1.2895 nats.

More precisely, using calculator:

ln(1.868) ≈ 0.6255

1.868 * 0.6255 ≈ 1.167

ln(0.868) ≈ -0.1413

0.868 * (-0.1413) ≈ -0.1226

Thus, S ≈ 1.167 - (-0.1226) = 1.2896 nats.

Therefore, del_b ≈ 1.2896 nats.

But let's check if the covariance matrix was correctly calculated. The variance sigma_xx = <x^2> - <x>^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.544^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Similarly, sigma_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2 ≈ 1.270 - 0 ≈ 1.270. These values seem correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of <x^2> for rho. Let's re-express:

<x^2> = (1/N²)[ (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (0.5)(1/2 + 2 alpha^2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) + (-0.5)(exp(-2 alpha^2)/2) ]

= (1/N²)[ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

For alpha = 0.5:

1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1/2 + 0.5 = 1.0

0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325

Thus, numerator = 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675

N² = 0.3935

<x^2> = 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770

Then, sigma_xx = 1.770 - (0.544)^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Correct.

Similarly, <p^2> = (1/N²)[0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(1/2) + 0 + 0] = (0.5)/0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Correct.

Therefore, the covariance matrix is correct, leading to nu ≈ 2.736 and S(tau) ≈ 1.2896 nats.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.29 nats.

However, to ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation with more precise values.

First, compute N²:

N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)

phi = -pi/4, so 2 phi = -pi/2, sin(-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, N² = 1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.60653066 ≈ 0.39346934.

Thus, N ≈ 0.6273.

Compute <x>:

<x> = [sqrt(2) alpha exp(-2 alpha^2)] / N²

alpha = 0.5:

sqrt(2)*0.5 ≈ 0.7071*0.5 ≈ 0.35355

exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066

Thus, numerator = 0.35355 * 0.60653066 ≈ 0.2145

Denominator = 0.39346934

<x> ≈ 0.2145 / 0.39346934 ≈ 0.545

<x>^2 ≈ 0.545^2 ≈ 0.297

<x^2> = [1.0 - 0.5*exp(-0.5)] / N² ≈ [1.0 - 0.5*0.60653066] / 0.39346934 ≈ [1.0 - 0.303265] / 0.39346934 ≈ 0.696735 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.770

sigma_xx = 1.770 - 0.297 ≈ 1.473

Similarly, <p^2> = 0.5 / N² ≈ 0.5 / 0.39346934 ≈ 1.270

sigma_pp = 1.270

nu = 2 * sqrt(1.473 * 1.270) ≈ 2 * sqrt(1.871) ≈ 2 * 1.368 ≈ 2.736

Compute S(tau):

(nu +1)/2 = (2.736 +1)/2 = 1.868

(nu -1)/2 = (2.736 -1)/2 = 0.868

ln(1.868) ≈ 0.6255

ln(0.868) ≈ -0.1413

S = 1.868 * 0.6255 - 0.868 * (-0.1413) ≈ 1.868*0.6255 + 0.868*0.1413 ≈ 1.170 + 0.1226 ≈ 1.2926 nats.

Therefore, del_b ≈ 1.2926 nats.

Rounding to three significant figures, del_b ≈ 1.29 nats.

However, given the problem's parameters, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Alternatively, there might be an analytical approach.

Alternatively, consider that the reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho is a displaced squeezed state. However, since the first moments are non-zero, but the covariance matrix is diagonal with sigma_xx and sigma_pp, the state is a thermal squeezed state displaced in x. However, the entropy depends only on the symplectic eigenvalue nu, which we've calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the reference Gaussian state has the same first and second moments. However, according to the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is indeed the one with the same first and second moments as the state in question.

Therefore, the final answer for del_b is approximately 1.29 nats. Given the problem's parameters, this seems reasonable. However, to ensure precision, let's compute using exact expressions.

Let me compute nu exactly:

sigma_xx = 1.473, sigma_pp = 1.270

sigma_xx * sigma_pp = 1.473 * 1.270 ≈ 1.473*1.27 ≈ 1.473*1 + 1.473*0.27 ≈ 1.473 + 0.3977 ≈ 1.8707

nu = 2 * sqrt(1.8707) ≈ 2 * 1.3678 ≈ 2.7356

Then,

(nu +1)/2 ≈ (2.7356 +1)/2 ≈ 1.8678

(nu -1)/2 ≈ (2.7356 -1)/2 ≈ 0.8678

ln(1.8678) ≈ 0.6255

ln(0.8678) ≈ -0.1416

Thus,

S = 1.8678 * 0.6255 - 0.8678 * (-0.1416) ≈ 1.8678*0.6255 + 0.8678*0.1416 ≈ 1.170 + 0.123 ≈ 1.293 nats.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.293 nats.

Given the problem's request to calculate it for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, and following through the detailed steps, the answer should be approximately 1.29 nats. However, to check for possible miscalculations, let's consider an alternative approach.

Another way to compute the entropy of the Gaussian state is using the formula for the entropy of a thermal state. The symplectic eigenvalue nu corresponds to the purity of the Gaussian state: mu = 1/nu. The entropy S = (nu +1)/2 ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 ln((nu -1)/2). Alternatively, for a thermal state with average photon number n, the entropy is S = (n +1) ln(n +1) - n ln n. However, this applies when the state is a thermal state with covariance matrix diag(n + 1/2, n + 1/2). In our case, the covariance matrix is diag(sigma_xx, sigma_pp), which is not symmetric, so it's a squeezed thermal state. The symplectic eigenvalue nu is related to the squeezing and thermal parameters. However, the entropy formula in terms of nu remains the same.

Given that we've calculated nu ≈ 2.7356, the entropy S ≈ 1.293 nats. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity del_b is approximately 1.29 nats.

However, to ensure that there's no error in the calculation of the covariance matrix, let's recheck the cross terms in <x^2> and <p^2>.

For <x^2>, the cross terms were calculated as -0.5 * exp(-2 alpha^2)/2. For alpha=0.5, this is -0.5 * exp(-0.5)/2 ≈ -0.5 * 0.6065/2 ≈ -0.1516. Then, <x^2> = (1.0 - 0.1516)/0.3935 ≈ 0.8484/0.3935 ≈ 2.156. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, no:

Wait, the expression was:

<x^2> = [ (1/2 + 2 alpha^2) - 0.5 exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N²

For alpha=0.5:

1/2 + 2*(0.25) = 1.0

0.5 exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.30325

Thus, numerator = 1.0 - 0.30325 = 0.69675

N² = 0.3935

<x^2> = 0.69675 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.770

Yes, correct. Then, sigma_xx = 1.770 - 0.544^2 ≈ 1.770 - 0.296 ≈ 1.474. Correct.

Therefore, the calculations are consistent.

In conclusion, the non-Gaussianity del_b for the given Schrödinger cat state with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 is approximately 1.29 nats.

**Final Answer**
The non-Gaussianity for the given Schrödinger cat state is \boxed{1.29}.
