# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

The mutation in **Mutant 2** is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - **Changes**:  
     - TTT (Phe) → TTC (Phe) at positions 4–6 (silent mutation).  
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at positions 7–9 (missense mutation).  
   - **Effect**: A single amino acid substitution (Leu→Tyr). This may alter protein function but is unlikely to completely disrupt it.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - **Change**:  
     - CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon) at positions 7–9.  
   - **Effect**: A **nonsense mutation** introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein after the second amino acid (Met-Phe-Stop). This severely disrupts the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional and halting synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - **Changes**:  
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at positions 7–9 (missense mutation).  
     - ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val) at positions 16–18 (missense mutation).  
   - **Effect**: Two amino acid substitutions. While these may impair protein activity, they are unlikely to completely abolish it.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - **Change**:  
     - Deletion of GGT (Gly) at positions 13–15 (in-frame deletion).  
   - **Effect**: Loss of one amino acid (Gly). This could disrupt protein structure but does not cause a frameshift or premature termination, so partial function may remain.

**Conclusion**: Mutant 2’s nonsense mutation (TAA stop codon) is the most disruptive, leading to a severely truncated, nonfunctional protein. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound entirely. 

**Answer**: **Mutant 2**

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which mutation in the barley gene will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The original gene has a sequence starting with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. There are four mutants provided, each with different changes in the first exon area. 

First, I should compare each mutant's sequence to the original to identify the mutations. Then, determine which mutation is most likely to disrupt the gene's function, leading to the compound not being produced. Since the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by this gene, a loss-of-function mutation would probably stop its production. Such mutations could be nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon), frameshift mutations (altering the reading frame), or critical missense mutations that disrupt protein function.

Let me go through each mutant one by one.

Mutant 1: The original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Comparing the two, let's look at the differences. The original has TTTCTC, and Mutant 1 has TTCTAC. Wait, let me check the exact positions. Let's break it down:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Looking at the third codon: Original is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Wait, but the first few nucleotides: Original is TTT (positions 4-6), which is Phe (F). Mutant1 has TTC (also Phe) at positions 4-6. Then the next triplet in original is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant1, it's TAC. Wait, maybe the mutation is a substitution. Let me check the actual nucleotide changes. Let's write the original and mutant sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So, the first codon is ATG (Met) same. Then original TTT (positions 4-6) is F, Mutant1 has TTC (still F). Then original CTC (positions 7-9) becomes TAC. Wait, how? Let's look at the nucleotide sequence. Original: TTT CTC GCT. So nucleotides 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC. Mutant1: TTC TAC GCT. So positions 4-6: TTC (same amino acid, F), then positions 7-9: TAC. So the original was CTC (Leu), which is CT-C. Mutant1 has TAC (Tyr), which is T-A-C. So the change is at position 7: C→T (since original is TTT CTC, so the 7th nucleotide is C, which in mutant is T. So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So that's a missense mutation. Then later, at the end, the original has CGT (Arg), mutant1 has CGC (also Arg). So that's a silent mutation. So Mutant1 has two changes: a missense (Leu→Tyr) and a silent mutation. The key one is the missense in the third codon. Depending on where that Leu is in the protein, this might affect function, but missense can sometimes be tolerated. Not sure if this would knock out the gene.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Let's compare to original. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So breaking down:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So positions 4-6: TTT→TTC (F→F, silent). Then positions 7-9: original CTC→TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in the original, the third codon was CTC (Leu), but in Mutant2, it's TAA, which is a stop codon. So that's a nonsense mutation. This would cause the protein to be truncated early, right after the second amino acid. Because the original starts with Met (ATG), then Phe (TTT), then Leu (CTC), etc. If the third codon is TAA (stop), then the protein would be Met-Phe-Stop. That's a very short protein, likely nonfunctional. So this would knock out the gene product, which is the enzyme producing the anti-nutritional compound. So Mutant2 might be the one that eliminates the compound.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG... Let's see. Original sequence: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: ACT (Thr), 19-21: TCT (Ser)... 

Mutant3: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: TAC (Tyr), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: GTC (Val), 19-21: ACT (Thr)... Wait, so comparing the original and Mutant3:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, maybe there's an insertion or a frameshift? Let me check the actual nucleotide changes. Original nucleotides: positions 7-9: CTC (C at position 7, T at 8, C at 9). Mutant3 has TAC here (T at 7, A at 8, C at 9). So that's a substitution at position 8: T→A. Then, looking further, original GGT (positions 13-15: GGT) becomes GGT (same), but then ACT (positions 16-18) becomes GTC. Wait, maybe there's a duplication or a shift. Let me check the exact sequence.

Original sequence from position 7 onwards: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So after the TAC (positions 7-9), the next part is GCT GGT (same as original), but then instead of ACT, it's GTC ACT. Wait, maybe there's an insertion? Let me count the nucleotides. Original: positions 7-18: CTC GCT GGT ACT (7-18: 12 nucleotides). Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT (positions 7-18: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT, which is 12 nucleotides as well). Wait, so maybe it's a substitution. Let's see: original at positions 16-18: ACT (Thr), in Mutant3, positions 16-18: GTC (Val). So the change is from ACT to GTC. How does that happen? Let's look at the DNA sequence. Original: ...GGT ACT TCT... (GGT is 13-15, ACT is 16-18). Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT... So between GGT and ACT in original, there's a substitution of the A in ACT to G, making GTC. Wait, the original ACT is at 16-18 (nucleotides 16:A, 17:C, 18:T). Mutant3's GTC would be at 16-18: G, T, C. So that's a substitution of A→G at position 16, C→T at 17, T→C at 18? That seems like multiple substitutions. Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift. Wait, let's check the entire sequence.

Original: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
Mutant3:5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’

Comparing the two:

Original: positions 7-9: CTC → Mutant3: TAC (so C→T at position 7, T→A at 8, C remains at 9? Wait, no. Let's index the original:

Original nucleotides (first part):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

Mutant3:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC (so position 7: T instead of C, position 8: A instead of T, position 9: C instead of C? Wait, original position 7 is C, 8 is T, 9 is C. Mutant3 has T at 7, A at 8, C at 9. So that's two substitutions: C→T at 7, T→A at 8. Then, original 10-12: GCT (same in mutant3). Then 13-15: GGT (same). Then original 16-18: ACT becomes GTC. So position 16: A→G, 17: C→T, 18: T→C. So three substitutions here. This would change the amino acids from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So this is a missense mutation. Then the rest is the same. So Mutant3 has two missense mutations: Leu→Tyr at positions 7-9, and Thr→Val at 16-18. Depending on the protein's structure, these could affect function, but it's not a frameshift or a stop codon. So maybe the protein is still functional, just altered. Not sure if this would eliminate the compound.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... Let's compare. Original sequence from position 7: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT... So there's a deletion here. Let's see:

Original: positions 7-18: CTC GCT GGT ACT (nucleotides 7-18)
Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (positions 7-18?)

Wait, let's count. Original has CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18). Mutant4 has TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TCT (16-18). So the GGT (13-15) in original is missing, and instead, ACT is moved up. So there's a deletion of GGT (positions 13-15), causing a frameshift? Or is it a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which would be in-frame? If three nucleotides are deleted, it's an in-frame deletion, resulting in the loss of one amino acid (Gly at position 13-15). But looking at the sequence:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So between GCT and ACT in mutant4, the GGT is missing. So that's a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which is an in-frame deletion. So the protein would lack the glycine at that position but the reading frame remains the same. This might disrupt the protein's structure if that glycine is important, but it's not a frameshift. So it's a possible functional mutation but not necessarily a knockout.

Now, evaluating all mutants:

Mutant1: Missense (Leu→Tyr) and silent mutation. Possible partial effect.

Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (Leu→Stop) at third codon. Results in a truncated protein, likely nonfunctional. This would knock out the gene, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant3: Two missense mutations. Might reduce activity but not eliminate.

Mutant4: In-frame deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), leading to loss of one amino acid. Possible partial effect.

Therefore, the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound is Mutant2, as it introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Let's look at the nucleotide sequence. Original: TTT CTC GCT. So nucleotides 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC. Mutant1: TTC TAC GCT. So positions 4-6: TTC (same amino acid, F), then positions 7-9: TAC. So the original was CTC (Leu), which is CT-C. Mutant1 has TAC (Tyr), which is

Alright, I need to identify which mutation in the barley gene will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The original gene sequence begins with 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'. I've been given four mutants with various changes in the first exon region.

My approach should be to compare each mutant sequence with the original to pinpoint the mutations. Then, I need to determine which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function and prevent the compound from being produced. Since this gene synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound, a loss-of-function mutation would likely halt its production. Such mutations could include nonsense mutations (creating premature stop codons), frameshift mutations (changing the reading frame), or critical missense mutations that impair protein functionality.

I'll analyze each mutant individually.

For Mutant 1, I need to compare its sequence with the original. The original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA, while Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Let me examine the differences by breaking down the sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Looking at the third codon, the original has CTC (Leucine), while Mutant 1 has TAC (Tyrosine). Checking the nucleotides more carefully: the original has TTT at positions 4-6 coding for Phenylalanine (F), and Mutant 1 has TTC (also Phenylalanine) at the same positions. Then the original has CTC (Leucine) at positions 7-9, but Mutant 1 has TAC. This appears to be a substitution mutation. Let me verify by writing out the sequences again:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So the original codons are: TTT (positions 4-6, Phe) and CTC (positions 7-9, Leu), while Mutant 1 has TTC (positions 4-6, still Phe) and TAC (positions 7-9, Tyr). The original CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr) in Mutant 1.

Alright, let's take a look. I need to identify which mutation in the barley gene will prevent the production of an anti-nutritional compound. The sequence of the original gene begins with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Four mutants have been provided, each with alterations in the first exon region.

Firstly, I should compare the sequences of each mutant with the original to spot the mutations. Next, I need to ascertain which mutation could likely lead to a loss of gene function, thereby stopping the compound's production. Since this compound is synthesized by the gene, a loss-of-function mutation should probably halt its synthesis. This could be caused by nonsense mutations (creating an early stop codon), frameshift mutations (modifying the reading frame), or essential missense mutations that impair protein function.

I'll examine each mutant individually.

Mutant 1: The original sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant 1 begins with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Comparing both sequences, let's identify the differences. The original has TTTCTC, while Mutant 1 has TTCTAC. Let me verify the exact positions. I'll break it down:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA  
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Observing the third codon: The original sequence reads CTC (Leu), while Mutant 1 shows TAC (Tyr). However, considering the initial nucleotides: The original sequence at positions 4-6, TTT, translates to Phe (F). Mutant 1 features TTC (also Phe) at the same positions. Moving to the next triplet in the original sequence, CTC (Leu) changes to TAC in Mutant 1. Hold on, could the mutation be a substitution? I'll reassess the nucleotide variations:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA  
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

The first identical codon is ATG (Met). The original TTT at positions 4-6 translates to F, and Mutant 1 maintains TTC (also F). Following that, the original CTC (positions 7-9) becomes TAC. Let's clarify this by examining the nucleotide sequence. In the original: TTT CTC GCT means nucleotides 4-6 are TTT, while 7-9 are CTC. In Mutant 1: TTC TAC GCT represents positions 4-6 as TTC (same amino acid, F), and positions 7-9 as TAC. Originally, it was CTC (Leu), but in Mutant 1, it shifts to TAC (Tyr), indicating the nature of the substitution.

That's possible with EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes). Wait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let's look at the actual DNA sequences.\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’\n\nWait, maybe the original sequence is written as a continuous string.

So position 6: T→C. That's a single nucleotide change. So codon 2: TTT (F) to TTC (F) – synonymous mutation, no effect.\n\nThen positions 7-9: Original is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Let's see: position 7 in original is C, in Mutant1 it's T. Position 8: original T becomes A. Wait, that's two nucleotide changes? But EMS usually causes single point mutations.

In Mutant1, it's TTC (positions 4-6), still F. Then the next codon in original is CTC (positions 7-9), which is Leu. In Mutant1, it's TAC (positions 7-9), which is Tyr. So how does that happen? The original codon CTC is C T C. To get TAC, the first C becomes T, and the second T becomes A. That's two mutations. But EMS typically induces single nucleotide changes. So maybe this is a typo or I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion, but the sequences seem the same length. Wait, let's count the nucleotides.\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA\n\nThat's 3 (ATG) + 3 (TTT) + 3 (CTC) + ... etc. Mutant1: same structure. So no frameshift. The change from CTC to TAC would require two nucleotide substitutions (C→T at first position, T→A at second). But EMS usually causes single changes. So maybe this is a typo in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a single nucleotide change that results in a different codon. Wait, let's check the actual DNA sequences again.\n\nOriginal: positions 7-9: C T C (CTC)\n\nMutant1: T A C (TAC). So position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A. Two mutations. That's possible but less likely from a single EMS treatment. However, maybe the problem allows it. If this is the case, then this is a missense mutation (Leu→Tyr). Whether this disrupts the protein's function depends on where it is. If it's in a critical part of the enzyme, maybe it inactivates it. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say. However, the question is which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. So maybe a more disruptive mutation would be better.\n\nMoving on to Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA\n\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

In Mutant3, after TTT (positions4-6), it's TAC (positions7-9). So that's a change from CTC to TAC, similar to Mutant1 but in a different position? Wait, no. Wait, original sequence:\n\nOriginal: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S)...\n\nMutant3: positions4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: TAC (Y), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: GTC (V), 19-21: ACT (T), 22-24: TCT (S)...\n\nSo the difference is that in Mutant3, after GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (positions16-18), but Mutant3 has GTC (V) at 16-18 and then ACT at 19-21.

That would be an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC), which is an in-frame insertion, adding one amino acid (Val) between GGT (Gly) and ACT (Thr). So this would be a missense mutation with an insertion, but not a frameshift. However, inserting a codon might disrupt the protein's structure if it's in a critical region. But it's not a frameshift, so the rest of the protein would be normal. This might not completely abolish the protein's function, depending on where the insertion is. So this might not be the best candidate.\n\nMutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nComparing the sequences:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo, original has CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nOriginal positions 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\nMutant4 positions 7-9: TAC (Tyr), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\nSo, in Mutant4, the GGT (Gly) at positions13-15 is missing, and instead, ACT (Thr) is there. So there's a deletion of the GGT codon. Let's check the DNA sequence:\n\nOriginal fragment: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4 fragment: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nSo, the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions7-21: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT)\n\nMutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (positions7-18: TAC GCT ACT TCT).

Depending on the protein's structure, this could disrupt function, but it's a smaller change compared to a frameshift or nonsense mutation. However, if the deletion is in a critical region, it might inactivate the enzyme. But again, without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's protein product:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - **Mutation**: TTT (Phe) → TTC (Phe) (synonymous) and CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) (missense).  
   - **Effect**: A single amino acid substitution (Leu→Tyr). While this could alter protein structure, it is unlikely to completely abolish function unless the residue is critical.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon).  
   - **Effect**: A nonsense mutation introduces a premature termination codon. This truncates the protein early, likely rendering it nonfunctional. This is a strong candidate for eliminating the compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - **Mutation**: Insertion of GTC (Val) between GGT (Gly) and ACT (Thr).  
   - **Effect**: An in-frame insertion adds one amino acid. While this might disrupt local structure, the rest of the protein remains intact, making full inactivation less likely.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - **Mutation**: Deletion of GGT (Gly).  
   - **Effect**: An in-frame deletion removes one amino acid. This could impair function but is less disruptive than a premature stop codon.  

**Conclusion**: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated, nonfunctional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.  

**Answer**: Mutant 2

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

T-A-C. So the change is at position 7: C→T? Wait, let me check the actual DNA sequences.

Original DNA sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1 DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’

So comparing nucleotide by nucleotide:

Original: positions 4-6: T T T (codon TTT)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: T T C (codon TTC) – same amino acid (F).

Then positions 7-9: Original C T C (codon CTC, Leu)
Mutant1: T A C (codon TAC, Tyr). So the mutation here is a change from C to T at position 7, and T to A at position 8? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the original sequence in the first exon is given as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's break it down into triplets:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant1 is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So comparing:

Original: TTT (positions 4-6) vs. TTC (positions 4-6 in Mutant1) – same amino acid (F).

Then original CTC (positions 7-9) becomes TAC (positions 7-9 in Mutant1). So the nucleotides at positions 7 and 8 have changed. Original: C T C (positions 7,8,9). Mutant1: T A C (positions 7,8,9). So position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A. That's two nucleotide changes? That's possible with EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes). Wait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let's look at the actual DNA sequences.

Original: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’

Wait, maybe the original sequence is written as a continuous string. Let me write the original and mutant1 sequences as strings:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Comparing these:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C…TGA

So, starting from the beginning:

Original: positions 1-3: ATG (same in both)

positions 4-6: TTT (original) vs. TTC (Mutant1). So position 6: T→C. That's a single nucleotide change. So codon 2: TTT (F) to TTC (F) – synonymous mutation, no effect.

Then positions 7-9: Original is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Let's see: position 7 in original is C, in Mutant1 it's T. Position 8: original T becomes A. Wait, that's two nucleotide changes? But EMS usually causes single point mutations. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Original sequence from position 4 onwards: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, perhaps the original is TTT CTC GCT..., and Mutant1 is TTC TAC GCT...

So, the first codon after ATG is TTT (positions 4-6) in original, which is F. In Mutant1, it's TTC (positions 4-6), still F. Then the next codon in original is CTC (positions 7-9), which is Leu. In Mutant1, it's TAC (positions 7-9), which is Tyr. So how does that happen? The original codon CTC is C T C. To get TAC, the first C becomes T, and the second T becomes A. That's two mutations. But EMS typically induces single nucleotide changes. So maybe this is a typo or I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion, but the sequences seem the same length. Wait, let's count the nucleotides.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

That's 3 (ATG) + 3 (TTT) + 3 (CTC) + ... etc. Mutant1: same structure. So no frameshift. The change from CTC to TAC would require two nucleotide substitutions (C→T at first position, T→A at second). But EMS usually causes single changes. So maybe this is a typo in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a single nucleotide change that results in a different codon. Wait, let's check the actual DNA sequences again.

Original: positions 7-9: C T C (CTC)

Mutant1: T A C (TAC). So position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A. Two mutations. That's possible but less likely from a single EMS treatment. However, maybe the problem allows it. If this is the case, then this is a missense mutation (Leu→Tyr). Whether this disrupts the protein's function depends on where it is. If it's in a critical part of the enzyme, maybe it inactivates it. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say. However, the question is which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. So maybe a more disruptive mutation would be better.

Moving on to Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Breaking into codons:

Original: TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant2: TTC TAA GCT...

So codon 2: TTT→TTC (F→F, no change). Codon 3: CTC→TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So this is a nonsense mutation. The third codon becomes a stop, so the protein would be truncated early. This would likely result in a nonfunctional protein, which would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. That's a strong candidate.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ...

Wait, let's parse the original and mutant3 sequences.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the original sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So comparing:

Original codons 2-5: TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), ...

Mutant3 codons 2-5: TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T), ...

Wait, there's an insertion? Let me check the actual DNA strings.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, original has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So, the original sequence from position 4: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant3: T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T...

Wait, inserting a T? Let me count the nucleotides. Original: positions 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT...

Mutant3: positions 4-6: TTT, 7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: GTC, 19-21: ACT, 22-24: TCT...

Wait, so in the original, after TTT (positions4-6), the next is CTC (positions7-9). In Mutant3, after TTT (positions4-6), it's TAC (positions7-9). So that's a change from CTC to TAC, similar to Mutant1 but in a different position? Wait, no. Wait, original sequence:

Original: positions 4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S)...

Mutant3: positions4-6: TTT (F), 7-9: TAC (Y), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: GTC (V), 19-21: ACT (T), 22-24: TCT (S)...

So the difference is that in Mutant3, after GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (positions16-18), but Mutant3 has GTC (V) at 16-18 and then ACT at 19-21. Wait, this seems like a frameshift. Let me check the actual DNA sequence alignment.

Original: ...GGT ACT TCT... (GGT is positions13-15, ACT is 16-18, TCT is 19-21)

Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT... So between GGT and ACT, there's an insertion of GTC? Wait, no. Let me look at the actual DNA strings.

Original fragment: GGTACTTCT (nucleotides 13-21: GGT ACT TCT)

Mutant3 fragment: GGTGTCACTTCT (GGT GTC ACT TCT). Wait, that's inserting three nucleotides (GTC) after GGT? But that would be an insertion of a codon, leading to an extra amino acid but not a frameshift. Alternatively, maybe there's a duplication or a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different mutation. Let me check the exact mutation.

Original sequence fragment: GCTGGTACTTCT (GCT GGT ACT TCT)

Mutant3: GCTGGTGTCACTTCT (GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT)

So between GGT and ACT in original, Mutant3 has GTC inserted? That would be an insertion of three nucleotides (GTC), which is an in-frame insertion, adding one amino acid (Val) between GGT (Gly) and ACT (Thr). So this would be a missense mutation with an insertion, but not a frameshift. However, inserting a codon might disrupt the protein's structure if it's in a critical region. But it's not a frameshift, so the rest of the protein would be normal. This might not completely abolish the protein's function, depending on where the insertion is. So this might not be the best candidate.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing the sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, original has CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, let's break it down:

Original positions 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: ACT (Thr)

Mutant4 positions 7-9: TAC (Tyr), 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: ACT (Thr)

So, in Mutant4, the GGT (Gly) at positions13-15 is missing, and instead, ACT (Thr) is there. So there's a deletion of the GGT codon. Let's check the DNA sequence:

Original fragment: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4 fragment: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions7-21: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT)

Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (positions7-18: TAC GCT ACT TCT). So the GGT (GGT) codon is missing. That's a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), which is an in-frame deletion. This would result in the loss of one amino acid (Gly) at that position. Depending on the protein's structure, this could disrupt function, but it's a smaller change compared to a frameshift or nonsense mutation. However, if the deletion is in a critical region, it might inactivate the enzyme. But again, without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say. However, compared to a nonsense mutation (which truncates the protein early), a deletion of a single amino acid might be less disruptive.

Now, evaluating all mutants:

Mutant1: Missense mutation (Leu→Tyr) in the third codon. Possible partial disruption.

Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (Leu→Stop) in the third codon. This would cause a truncated protein, likely nonfunctional. Strong candidate.

Mutant3: In-frame insertion of a codon (Val) between Gly and Thr. Might disrupt but not as severely as a premature stop.

Mutant4: In-frame deletion of a Gly codon. Possible disruption but again, not as severe as a nonsense mutation.

Therefore, the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound is Mutant2, as a premature stop codon would lead to a nonfunctional protein, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Then, after GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (16-18) and then ACT (19-21). So, inserting three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT? That would be an insertion of three nucleotides, which doesn't cause a frameshift but adds an extra codon (GTC, Val) before ACT. So this is an in-frame insertion. The original codons after GGT would be ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... In mutant3, after GGT, it's GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... So the protein would have an extra Valine inserted here. This is a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr at position7-9) and an insertion of Valine. This might disrupt the protein structure, but since it's an in-frame insertion, the rest of the protein remains the same. Depending on where these changes occur, it might affect function, but it's not as drastic as a frameshift or a premature stop codon. So maybe not the best candidate for knocking out the gene.\n\nMutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant4 from position7 to 15 is also 9 nucleotides (TAC GCT ACT). So no deletion in terms of length. But the nucleotides at positions7-9 and 13-15 are changed. So, this is two separate substitutions. The first substitution is CTC to TAC (Leu to Tyr) at positions7-9, and the second substitution is GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr) at positions13-15. Both are missense mutations. So two amino acid changes.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's coding potential:

### **Mutant 1**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at positions 7–9; CGT (Arg) → CGC (Arg) (silent mutation).  
- **Effect**: A single missense mutation (Leu → Tyr). This may alter protein structure but is unlikely to fully disrupt function.  

### **Mutant 2**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon) at positions 7–9.  
- **Effect**: A **nonsense mutation** introducing a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein early in the first exon, likely rendering it non-functional. This is a strong candidate for eliminating the compound.  

### **Mutant 3**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at positions 7–9; insertion of GTC (Val) between codons 16–18.  
- **Effect**: A missense mutation (Leu → Tyr) and an **in-frame insertion** of Val. The reading frame remains intact, so the protein retains most of its sequence. Likely insufficient to fully abolish function.  

### **Mutant 4**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at positions 7–9; GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr) at positions 13–15.  
- **Effect**: Two missense mutations. While these may impair protein function, they do not guarantee complete loss of activity.  

### **Conclusion**  
**Mutant 2** introduces a **premature stop codon** in the first exon, leading to a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.  

**Answer: Mutant 2**

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

That's a missense mutation. Also, towards the end, the original has CGT (Arg), and Mutant1 has CGC (also Arg), so that's a silent mutation. So the main change is CTC to TAC (Leu to Tyr). This is a missense mutation. Depending on where this occurs in the protein, it might affect function, but it's not a frameshift or a stop codon. So maybe not the best candidate for knocking out the gene.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Breaking it down: The original sequence after ATG is TTT (positions 4-6, Phe), CTC (positions7-9, Leu), GCT (positions10-12, Ala), etc. Mutant2 has TTC (positions4-6, Phe), then TAA (positions7-9). TAA is a stop codon. So this is a nonsense mutation. The original had Leu (CTC) at positions7-9, but Mutant2 has TAA, which is a stop codon. This would result in a truncated protein, likely non-functional. If the gene product is truncated early (in the first exon), it might completely disrupt the protein's function, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Comparing the sequences. Let's break them down:

Original: TTT (4-6, Phe), CTC (7-9, Leu), GCT (10-12, Ala), GGT (13-15, Gly), ACT (16-18, Thr), TCT (19-21, Ser), etc.

Mutant3: TTT (4-6, Phe), TAC (7-9, Tyr), GCT (10-12, Ala), GGT (13-15, Gly), GTC (16-18, Val), ACT (19-21, Thr), TCT (22-24, Ser)... Wait, but the original sequence after GGT is ACT TCT, while Mutant3 has GGT GTC ACT TCT. Let me check the exact positions.

Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so in the original, after GCT (positions10-12) comes GGT (13-15), then ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21). In Mutant3, after GCT (10-12) is GGT (13-15), then GTC (16-18), ACT (19-21), TCT (22-24). So there's an insertion here. Wait, but how? Let me check the actual nucleotide sequences.

Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... (nucleotides: GCT GGT ACT TCT)
Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG... (nucleotides: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT)

Wait, the original has GCTGGTACTTCT, which is GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21). Mutant3 has GCTGGTGTCACTTCT. So inserting GTC between GGT and ACT? Wait, no. Let me check the exact letters.

Original sequence from positions 10-21: GCT GGT ACT TCT (nucleotides: G C T G G T A C T T C T)
Mutant3 sequence: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT (nucleotides: G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T). Wait, that's inserting three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT? But that would make the sequence longer. Wait, but looking at the given Mutant3 sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Comparing the original and mutant3:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So, the original has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT, while Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT. So, the CTC (positions7-9) in original is changed to TAC (positions7-9 in mutant3). Then, after GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC ACT. Wait, the original's ACT (positions16-18) is replaced with GTC ACT? Let me check the nucleotides:

Original: positions 16-18: ACT (A C T)
Mutant3: positions 16-18: GTC (G T C), then ACT (positions19-21). So, inserting GTC here? Wait, but that would shift the reading frame. Wait, no. Let's count the nucleotides. Let's take the original sequence from the start up to the mutation:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, the original sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3 after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So, the first change is CTC (original) to TAC (mutant3) at positions7-9. Then, after GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (16-18) and then ACT (19-21). So, inserting three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT? That would be an insertion of three nucleotides, which doesn't cause a frameshift but adds an extra codon (GTC, Val) before ACT. So this is an in-frame insertion. The original codons after GGT would be ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... In mutant3, after GGT, it's GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... So the protein would have an extra Valine inserted here. This is a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr at position7-9) and an insertion of Valine. This might disrupt the protein structure, but since it's an in-frame insertion, the rest of the protein remains the same. Depending on where these changes occur, it might affect function, but it's not as drastic as a frameshift or a premature stop codon. So maybe not the best candidate for knocking out the gene.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Comparing the sequences. Original: after TTT (positions4-6) is CTC (7-9, Leu), GCT (10-12, Ala), GGT (13-15, Gly), ACT (16-18, Thr), TCT (19-21, Ser)...

Mutant4: after TTT (positions4-6) is TAC (7-9, Tyr), GCT (10-12, Ala), then ACT (13-15, Thr), TCT (16-18, Ser)... So, the GGT (positions13-15 in original) is missing. Let me check the nucleotides:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (nucleotides: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT)
Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT (nucleotides: TAC GCT ACT TCT). So, the GGT (GGT) is missing. How many nucleotides are deleted? Let's see: original sequence from position7-15 is CTC GCT GGT (nucleotides: CTC GCT GGT). Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT. Wait, perhaps there's a deletion here. Let me check the exact positions.

Original: positions7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT
Mutant4: positions7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: ACT

So, in the original, positions13-15 are GGT, but in Mutant4, positions13-15 are ACT. So, the original GGT (positions13-15) is replaced by ACT. How does that happen? Let me check the actual nucleotide sequence.

Original: positions7-15: CTC GCT GGT (nucleotides: C T C G C T G G T)
Mutant4: positions7-15: TAC GCT ACT (nucleotides: T A C G C T A C T)

Wait, so the original has CTC (C T C) at positions7-9, GCT (G C T) at 10-12, GGT (G G T) at 13-15.

Mutant4 has TAC (T A C) at 7-9, GCT (G C T) at 10-12, ACT (A C T) at 13-15.

So, the original nucleotides from position7 to 15 are:

7-9: C T C

10-12: G C T

13-15: G G T

Mutant4:

7-9: T A C

10-12: G C T

13-15: A C T

So, comparing the original and mutant4 sequences from position7 onwards:

Original: C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4: T A C G C T A C T T C T...

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion here. Let me check the exact letters. The original sequence after ATGTTT is CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4 after ATGTTT is TACGCTACTTCT...

So, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the GGT (GGT) in original is replaced by ACT. How many nucleotides are changed? Let's see:

Original: positions7-15: CTC GCT GGT (nucleotides 7-15: C T C G C T G G T)

Mutant4: positions7-15: TAC GCT ACT (nucleotides 7-15: T A C G C T A C T)

Wait, that's a substitution from position7-9 (CTC to TAC) and positions13-15 (GGT to ACT). But looking at the actual sequence, perhaps there's a deletion. Let me count the nucleotides. Original from position7 to 15 is 9 nucleotides (CTC GCT GGT). Mutant4 from position7 to 15 is also 9 nucleotides (TAC GCT ACT). So no deletion in terms of length. But the nucleotides at positions7-9 and 13-15 are changed. So, this is two separate substitutions. The first substitution is CTC to TAC (Leu to Tyr) at positions7-9, and the second substitution is GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr) at positions13-15. Both are missense mutations. So two amino acid changes. Depending on their location in the protein, this might affect function, but again, it's not a frameshift or a stop codon. So maybe not as disruptive as a nonsense mutation.

Now, evaluating all mutants:

Mutant1: Missense mutation (Leu to Tyr) and a silent mutation. Probably not enough to eliminate the protein function.

Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (Leu to Stop) at codon 7-9. This would result in a truncated protein. If the stop codon occurs early in the gene, the protein would be non-functional. Since this is in the first exon, the truncated protein is unlikely to perform its normal function, thus preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is a strong candidate.

Mutant3: Missense mutation (Leu to Tyr) and an in-frame insertion of Valine. The insertion doesn't disrupt the reading frame, so the rest of the protein is intact. This might affect function but may not eliminate it entirely.

Mutant4: Two missense mutations (Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr). Again, possible partial disruption but not a complete knockout.

Therefore, the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound is Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein.

Let me parse the original sequence correctly. Let's split into triplets starting from ATG:\n\nOriginal:  \nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA  \nSo, each triplet is:\n\n1. ATG (Met)\n2. TTT (Phe)\n3. CTC (Leu)\n4. GCT (Ala)\n5. GGT (Gly)\n6. ACT (Thr)\n7. TCT (Ser)\n8. GTG (Val)\n9. GAT (Asp)\n10. GAA (Glu)\n11. CAT (His)\n12.

Let me compare step by step. Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant3 starts with ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT... So, after the first TTT (positions 4-6), original has CTC (positions 7-9), but Mutant3 has TAC (positions 7-9). Then, original GCT (positions 10-12) is same as Mutant3. Then original GGT (positions 13-15) is same as Mutant3. Then original ACT (positions 16-18) becomes GTC in Mutant3. Wait, how? Let me check the actual sequence:\n\nOriginal: ...GGT ACT TCT... (GGT is positions 13-15, ACT is 16-18)  \nMutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT... (GGT same, then GTC at 16-18, then ACT at 19-21?)\n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion of a nucleotide causing a frameshift. Let me check the exact letters. Original first exon sequence (from the start):\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’  \nMutant3: 5’-ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’\n\nComparing the two, after the initial ATG, original has T T T C T C G C T..., while Mutant3 has T T T T A C G C T... So, starting at position 4 (the first T after ATG is position 4?), let's count:\n\nOriginal positions 4-6: T T T (codon TTT)  \nMutant3 positions 4-6: T T T (same)  \nOriginal positions 7-9: C T C (codon CTC)  \nMutant3 positions 7-9: T A C (codon TAC)  \nOriginal positions 10-12: G C T (GCT)  \nMutant3 positions 10-12: G C T (same)  \nOriginal positions 13-15: G G T (GGT)  \nMutant3 positions 13-15: G G T (same)  \nOriginal positions 16-18: A C T (ACT)  \nMutant3 positions 16-18: G T C (GTC)  \nOriginal positions 19-21: T C T (TCT)  \nMutant3 positions 19-21: A C T (ACT)  \nWait, this seems like a substitution at position 16 from A to G, 17 from C to T, 18 from T to C. But that would be three substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps there's an insertion causing a frameshift. Let me check the actual sequence length. Original: after ATG, the next nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant3: after ATG, it's TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Comparing:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...  \nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo, after the first TTT (positions 4-6), original has CTC (positions 7-9), while Mutant3 has TAC (positions 7-9). Then, original GCT (positions 10-12) is same. Then GGT (positions 13-15) same. Then original ACT (positions 16-18) becomes GTC (positions 16-18). Then original TCT (positions 19-21) becomes ACT (positions 19-21). So, this is a substitution of ACT to GTC in positions 16-18 and TCT to ACT in 19-21. But how does that happen? It's possible that there's a three-nucleotide substitution. Alternatively, maybe a single nucleotide change causing a frameshift. Wait, let's check the actual nucleotides:\n\nOriginal positions 7-9: C T C (CTC)  \nMutant3 positions 7-9: T A C (TAC). So, position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A, position 9: C→C. Wait, that's two substitutions (positions 7 and 8). Then, original position 16-18: A C T (ACT) becomes G T C (GTC). So, position 16: A→G, position 17: C→T, position 18: T→C. That's three substitutions. Then original 19-21: T C T (TCT) becomes A C T (ACT). So, position 19: T→A. This seems like multiple point mutations. Alternatively, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. Let me check the length. Original sequence from positions 4 onwards: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Let's count the letters. Original from position 4 (after ATG) up to, say, the first TGA (stop codon). But perhaps the key is that in Mutant3, after the initial TTT, there's a TAC, then GCT, GGT, GTC, ACT, TCT, etc. So, the changes are in codons 3 (CTC→TAC), and then codon 6 (ACT→GTC), codon 7 (TCT→ACT). This seems like multiple substitutions. However, the main thing is whether this causes a frameshift or a missense. Since the number of nucleotides isn't changed (no insertions or deletions), it's a series of substitutions. So, the reading frame remains the same. The third codon changes from Leu to Tyr, sixth codon from Thr to Val, seventh from Ser to Thr. These are missense mutations. Depending on where they occur, they might disrupt the protein's function. However, multiple missense mutations could be more disruptive. But compared to a nonsense mutation (like in Mutant2), which would truncate the protein early, this might not be as effective in knocking out the gene's function. So, Mutant3 might have a partially functional protein, but maybe not. It's possible, but not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\nMutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  \nMutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA\n\nBreaking into triplets:\n\nOriginal:  \nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  \nMutant4:  \nATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA\n\nComparing, after the first two codons (ATG TTT), original has CTC GCT GGT ACT..., while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT... Let's check the nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: positions 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT  \nMutant4: positions 7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: ACT, 16-18: TCT\n\nSo, in Mutant4, after the first two codons (ATG TTT), the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same as original. Then, the fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). Then, original sixth codon ACT (Thr) becomes TCT (Ser) in Mutant4. Wait, but how does this happen? Let me check the actual nucleotide sequence. Original sequence from position 7 onwards: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT... So, there's a deletion here. Let me count the nucleotides. Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions 7-21: 15 nucleotides). Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (positions 7-18: 12 nucleotides). Wait, that's three fewer nucleotides. So, perhaps there's a deletion of three nucleotides (codon GGT) in Mutant4. Let me check:\n\nOriginal:  \npositions 7-9: CTC  \n10-12: GCT  \n13-15: GGT  \n16-18: ACT  \n19-21: TCT\n\nMutant4:  \npositions 7-9: TAC  \n10-12: GCT  \n13-15: ACT  \n16-18: TCT\n\nSo, the original GGT (positions 13-15) is missing in Mutant4. Therefore, there's a deletion of the GGT codon. This is an in-frame deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the loss of the amino acid Gly at position 5. Since it's an in-frame deletion, the reading frame remains intact, but one amino acid is missing. This could disrupt the protein's structure if that Gly is important, but in-frame deletions can sometimes be tolerated, depending on the location. If the deleted amino acid is in a critical region (like an active site), it might disable the protein. However, compared to a premature stop codon (Mutant2), this might not be as effective in completely knocking out the gene's function.\n\nSo, summarizing the mutations:\n\n- Mutant1: Missense mutation (Leu→Tyr) in third codon, silent in second. Possible partial effect.\n- Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (Leu→Stop) in third codon. Truncated protein. Likely non-functional.\n- Mutant3: Multiple missense mutations (Leu→Tyr, Thr→Val, Ser→Thr). Possible disruption, but not certain.\n- Mutant4: In-frame deletion of a codon (GGT, Gly). Possible disruption if Gly is critical.\n\nThe question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the compound is synthesized by the gene product, a non-functional protein (due to truncation) would prevent its synthesis. Therefore, Mutant2, with the premature stop codon, is the most likely candidate. This is a classic example of a nonsense mutation leading to a loss-of-function allele.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444408, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4311, prompt_tokens=1021, total_tokens=5332, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene product:

### **Mutant 1**  
- **Mutation**: TTT (Phe) → TTC (Phe) (silent) and CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) (missense).  
- **Effect**: A single amino acid substitution (Leu → Tyr). This missense mutation may alter protein function but does not guarantee loss of activity.  

### **Mutant 2**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon) in the third codon.  
- **Effect**: A **nonsense mutation** introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein early. This almost certainly abolishes the enzyme’s function, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  

### **Mutant 3**  
- **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr), ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val), and TCT (Ser) → ACT (Thr).  
- **Effect**: Multiple missense mutations. While disruptive, the protein may retain partial function, making this less likely to fully eliminate the compound.  

### **Mutant 4**  
- **Mutation**: In-frame deletion of the GGT (Gly) codon.  
- **Effect**: Loss of one amino acid (Gly). This could impair the protein if Gly is critical, but in-frame deletions are often tolerated, making this less definitive.  

### **Conclusion**  
**Mutant 2** is the most likely candidate. The premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) truncates the protein, rendering it non-functional and halting the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  

**Answer**: Mutant 2

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, the third codon (CTC to TAC) is a point mutation from C to A at position 7? Wait, let's check the actual DNA sequence.

Original: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’  
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the nucleotides:

Original: positions 4-6: T T T  
Mutant1: T T C  
So, position 6 changes from T to C. Then positions 7-9: original is C T C, mutant1 is T A C. Wait, that's a bigger change. Wait, perhaps the original sequence is TTT CTC GCT, and the mutant is TTC TAC GCT. So, the first codon after ATG is TTT (positions 1-3: ATG, then 4-6: TTT). Wait, no, the original sequence is written as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let me parse the original sequence correctly. Let's split into triplets starting from ATG:

Original:  
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA  
So, each triplet is:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTC (Leu)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
11. CAT (His)
12. ATT (Ile)
13. TAT (Tyr)
14. TGT (Cys)
15. CGT (Arg)
... and so on until TGA (stop).

Now, Mutant1:  
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Breaking into triplets:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTC (Phe) – same as original TTT (both code for Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr) – original was CTC (Leu)
4. GCT (Ala) – same
5. GGT (Gly) – same
6. ACT (Thr) – same
7. TCT (Ser) – same
8. GTG (Val) – same
9. GAT (Asp) – same
10. GAA (Glu) – same
11. CAT (His) – same
12. ATT (Ile) – same
13. TAT (Tyr) – same
14. TGT (Cys) – same
15. CGC (Arg) – original was CGT (Arg), so same amino acid (Arg) but different codon (CGT to CGC is a silent mutation)
... and TGA.

So, the main changes in Mutant1 are in the second and third codons. The second codon changes from TTT (Phe) to TTC (still Phe), which is a silent mutation. The third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. So, a Leu to Tyr substitution. Whether this affects the protein's function depends on the context. If this amino acid is critical for the enzyme's activity, it might disrupt it. However, missense mutations can sometimes be tolerated. So, this might not necessarily eliminate the compound. It's possible, but not guaranteed.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA

Breaking into triplets:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTC (Phe) – original was TTT (Phe)
3. TAA (Stop codon)
4. GCT (Ala) – original was GCT (Ala)
... etc.

Wait, the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon. So, the original third codon was CTC (Leu), but in Mutant2, it's TAA. This is a nonsense mutation, leading to a premature termination codon. This would result in a truncated protein, likely non-functional. If the gene product is required for the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, then a premature stop codon early in the gene (third codon after Met) would prevent the production of a functional enzyme, thereby eliminating the compound. This seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Comparing the sequences. Let's split into triplets:

Original:  
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  
Mutant3:  
ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Looking at the third codon: original CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr) in Mutant3. Then, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same as original. Then fifth codon: original GGT (Gly) remains GGT. Wait, no. Let me check the actual nucleotide changes. The original sequence after the first ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant3 is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, perhaps there's an insertion or a frameshift? Let me check the exact nucleotides.

Original:  
ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA

Mutant3:  
ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA

Wait, perhaps there's an insertion. Let me compare step by step. Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant3 starts with ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT... So, after the first TTT (positions 4-6), original has CTC (positions 7-9), but Mutant3 has TAC (positions 7-9). Then, original GCT (positions 10-12) is same as Mutant3. Then original GGT (positions 13-15) is same as Mutant3. Then original ACT (positions 16-18) becomes GTC in Mutant3. Wait, how? Let me check the actual sequence:

Original: ...GGT ACT TCT... (GGT is positions 13-15, ACT is 16-18)  
Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT... (GGT same, then GTC at 16-18, then ACT at 19-21?)

Wait, perhaps there's an insertion of a nucleotide causing a frameshift. Let me check the exact letters. Original first exon sequence (from the start):

Original: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’  
Mutant3: 5’-ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’

Comparing the two, after the initial ATG, original has T T T C T C G C T..., while Mutant3 has T T T T A C G C T... So, starting at position 4 (the first T after ATG is position 4?), let's count:

Original positions 4-6: T T T (codon TTT)  
Mutant3 positions 4-6: T T T (same)  
Original positions 7-9: C T C (codon CTC)  
Mutant3 positions 7-9: T A C (codon TAC)  
Original positions 10-12: G C T (GCT)  
Mutant3 positions 10-12: G C T (same)  
Original positions 13-15: G G T (GGT)  
Mutant3 positions 13-15: G G T (same)  
Original positions 16-18: A C T (ACT)  
Mutant3 positions 16-18: G T C (GTC)  
Original positions 19-21: T C T (TCT)  
Mutant3 positions 19-21: A C T (ACT)  
Wait, this seems like a substitution at position 16 from A to G, 17 from C to T, 18 from T to C. But that would be three substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps there's an insertion causing a frameshift. Let me check the actual sequence length. Original: after ATG, the next nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant3: after ATG, it's TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Comparing:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...  
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, after the first TTT (positions 4-6), original has CTC (positions 7-9), while Mutant3 has TAC (positions 7-9). Then, original GCT (positions 10-12) is same. Then GGT (positions 13-15) same. Then original ACT (positions 16-18) becomes GTC (positions 16-18). Then original TCT (positions 19-21) becomes ACT (positions 19-21). So, this is a substitution of ACT to GTC in positions 16-18 and TCT to ACT in 19-21. But how does that happen? It's possible that there's a three-nucleotide substitution. Alternatively, maybe a single nucleotide change causing a frameshift. Wait, let's check the actual nucleotides:

Original positions 7-9: C T C (CTC)  
Mutant3 positions 7-9: T A C (TAC). So, position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A, position 9: C→C. Wait, that's two substitutions (positions 7 and 8). Then, original position 16-18: A C T (ACT) becomes G T C (GTC). So, position 16: A→G, position 17: C→T, position 18: T→C. That's three substitutions. Then original 19-21: T C T (TCT) becomes A C T (ACT). So, position 19: T→A. This seems like multiple point mutations. Alternatively, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. Let me check the length. Original sequence from positions 4 onwards: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Mutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Let's count the letters. Original from position 4 (after ATG) up to, say, the first TGA (stop codon). But perhaps the key is that in Mutant3, after the initial TTT, there's a TAC, then GCT, GGT, GTC, ACT, TCT, etc. So, the changes are in codons 3 (CTC→TAC), and then codon 6 (ACT→GTC), codon 7 (TCT→ACT). This seems like multiple substitutions. However, the main thing is whether this causes a frameshift or a missense. Since the number of nucleotides isn't changed (no insertions or deletions), it's a series of substitutions. So, the reading frame remains the same. The third codon changes from Leu to Tyr, sixth codon from Thr to Val, seventh from Ser to Thr. These are missense mutations. Depending on where they occur, they might disrupt the protein's function. However, multiple missense mutations could be more disruptive. But compared to a nonsense mutation (like in Mutant2), which would truncate the protein early, this might not be as effective in knocking out the gene's function. So, Mutant3 might have a partially functional protein, but maybe not. It's possible, but not as definitive as a premature stop codon.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Breaking into triplets:

Original:  
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA  
Mutant4:  
ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Comparing, after the first two codons (ATG TTT), original has CTC GCT GGT ACT..., while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT TCT... Let's check the nucleotides:

Original: positions 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT  
Mutant4: positions 7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: ACT, 16-18: TCT

So, in Mutant4, after the first two codons (ATG TTT), the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same as original. Then, the fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). Then, original sixth codon ACT (Thr) becomes TCT (Ser) in Mutant4. Wait, but how does this happen? Let me check the actual nucleotide sequence. Original sequence from position 7 onwards: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT... So, there's a deletion here. Let me count the nucleotides. Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT (positions 7-21: 15 nucleotides). Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT (positions 7-18: 12 nucleotides). Wait, that's three fewer nucleotides. So, perhaps there's a deletion of three nucleotides (codon GGT) in Mutant4. Let me check:

Original:  
positions 7-9: CTC  
10-12: GCT  
13-15: GGT  
16-18: ACT  
19-21: TCT

Mutant4:  
positions 7-9: TAC  
10-12: GCT  
13-15: ACT  
16-18: TCT

So, the original GGT (positions 13-15) is missing in Mutant4. Therefore, there's a deletion of the GGT codon. This is an in-frame deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the loss of the amino acid Gly at position 5. Since it's an in-frame deletion, the reading frame remains intact, but one amino acid is missing. This could disrupt the protein's structure if that Gly is important, but in-frame deletions can sometimes be tolerated, depending on the location. If the deleted amino acid is in a critical region (like an active site), it might disable the protein. However, compared to a premature stop codon (Mutant2), this might not be as effective in completely knocking out the gene's function.

So, summarizing the mutations:

- Mutant1: Missense mutation (Leu→Tyr) in third codon, silent in second. Possible partial effect.
- Mutant2: Nonsense mutation (Leu→Stop) in third codon. Truncated protein. Likely non-functional.
- Mutant3: Multiple missense mutations (Leu→Tyr, Thr→Val, Ser→Thr). Possible disruption, but not certain.
- Mutant4: In-frame deletion of a codon (GGT, Gly). Possible disruption if Gly is critical.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the compound is synthesized by the gene product, a non-functional protein (due to truncation) would prevent its synthesis. Therefore, Mutant2, with the premature stop codon, is the most likely candidate. This is a classic example of a nonsense mutation leading to a loss-of-function allele.
