# Original Question

Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:

Given the problem, we need to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**:
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which causes a Doppler shift in its emitted wavelength.
   - The observed peak wavelengths for both stars are the same, implying that the emitted wavelengths must be adjusted for the Doppler effect.

2. **Wien's Law**:
   - The peak wavelength of a black body is given by \( \lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{b}{T} \).
   - For Star_1 (radial velocity 0), the observed wavelength is the emitted wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \).
   - For Star_2 (radial velocity 700 km/s), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{observed,2}} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \).

3. **Equating Observed Wavelengths**:
   - Since the observed wavelengths are the same: \( \frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \).
   - Solving for \( T_2 \): \( T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \).

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), the luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}\right)^4
     \]

5. **Calculations**:
   - \( \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300000} = 0.002333 \)
   - \( 1 + \frac{v}{c} = 1.002333 \)
   - \( \left(1.002333\right)^4 \approx 1.00937 \)
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times \frac{1}{1.00937} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.23
     \]

However, considering the problem might expect a simplified or rounded answer, the closest approximate value is:

\boxed{2.2}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is asking about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. The given information includes their radii, masses, the fact that their peak wavelengths are the same, and their radial velocities. Hmm, radial velocities? Wait, radial velocity usually refers to the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Maybe it's related to Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving away, its emitted wavelengths get redshifted, or blueshifted if moving towards. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Wait, but the actual peak wavelength emitted by the star would depend on its temperature, right? So if the observed peak wavelength is the same, but one star is moving, then the actual emitted peak wavelength would be different due to the Doppler effect. Let me think.

So, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if the star is moving with a radial velocity, the observed wavelength is shifted. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) when the velocity is along the line of sight. But for non-relativistic speeds, which 700 km/s is, since 700 km/s is 0.7% the speed of light (since c is about 300,000 km/s), so v/c is 0.007, which is small. So we can approximate the Doppler shift as λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). Wait, but actually, the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) ≈ (1 + v/c) when v is much less than c. Wait, no, actually, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) if the source is moving away. So if the star is moving away (positive radial velocity), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, it's blueshifted.

But in the problem, they say that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So even though Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelengths for both stars are the same. That must mean that the actual emitted peak wavelengths are different, adjusted by their velocities. So for Star_1, which has 0 radial velocity, the observed λ_peak is equal to its emitted λ_peak. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed λ_peak is equal to λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c). But since the observed λ_peak for both stars is the same, we can set up an equation:

λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_peak_observed_Star2

But λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star1 (since v=0)

λ_peak_observed_Star2 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore:

λ_emitted_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

But from Wien's Law, λ_emitted is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Therefore:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1. Because when Star_2's emitted wavelength is blueshifted (if moving towards) or redshifted (if moving away). Wait, no, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But is that velocity towards us or away? The problem says "radial velocity", which is the component along the line of sight. The sign convention is usually that positive is receding (away), negative is approaching. But the problem just states 700 km/s. Since it's given as a positive number, perhaps we can assume it's moving away. But the problem doesn't specify direction, but since it's given as 700 km/s, maybe we just take the magnitude. But in any case, the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2 * (1 + v/c). Since the observed λ_peak is the same for both stars, then:

λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, using Wien's Law:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then its emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed, so T2 would be higher. Because if the emitted wavelength is shorter, the temperature is higher (since λ_peak ~ 1/T). So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by that factor.

But then, we need to compute the luminosities. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴

L2 = 4πR2²σT2⁴

We need to find the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2 (since Star_1 has radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2). Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So mass might not directly factor into the luminosity calculation here, unless it affects radius or temperature. But since radius is already given, and temperature is determined via the Doppler shift and Wien's law, maybe mass is irrelevant? The problem states the mass is larger by the same factor (1.5 times), but perhaps that's a red herring, or maybe it's to check if we consider other factors. But in the context of black body radiation, luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not mass. So maybe the mass information is not needed here. Let me check the question again: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So yes, the mass is given but perhaps not needed. Unless there's a relation between mass, radius, and temperature, but since both radius and temperature are determined via other means (radius given, temperature via Doppler and Wien), maybe mass is extra.

So proceeding, L1/L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4

We know R1/R2 = 1.5, and T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)

Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v/c))^4

But we need to compute this. Let's plug in the numbers. v = 700 km/s. c is the speed of light, approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. Therefore, v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333...

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333...

Therefore, (1 / (1 + v/c))^4 ≈ (1 / 1.002333)^4 ≈ (approx) using binomial approximation: (1 - v/c)^4 ≈ 1 - 4v/c. Since v/c is small, higher order terms are negligible. So approximately, 1 - 4*(0.002333) ≈ 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990667. But let's check with a calculator for better precision.

Alternatively, compute 1.002333^4:

First, ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233 (using ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...)

So ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233 - (0.00233)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.00233 - 0.0000027 ≈ 0.0023273

Then multiply by 4: 0.009309

Exponentiate: e^0.009309 ≈ 1.00936

Wait, wait, that's the other way. Wait, if T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), then T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4. So 1/(1.002333)^4. Let's compute 1.002333^4.

Compute step by step:

1.002333 squared: 1.002333 * 1.002333 ≈ 1.00467

Then squared again: 1.00467 * 1.00467 ≈ 1.00938

So 1.002333^4 ≈ 1.00938, so 1/(1.00938) ≈ 0.9907

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

But wait, that would mean L1 is about 2.23 times L2. But the options might require a more precise calculation. Alternatively, maybe the approximation is sufficient, but let's check.

Alternatively, use the exact value:

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333333...

So 1 + v/c = 1.002333333...

Compute (1.0023333333)^4:

First, (1.0023333333)^2 = (1 + 0.0023333333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444 ≈ 1.004672111

Then, square that result: (1.004672111)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.004672111 + (0.004672111)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009344222 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.009365042

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009365, so 1/(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.009365 ≈ 0.9907

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

So approximately 2.23 times. But the problem says "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of". So the factor is approximately 2.23. But let's see if the answer is expected to be an exact value or approximate. The given velocities are 700 km/s, which is exact, but c is 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 is exact as 7/300. So maybe we can do it more accurately.

Wait, 700 km/s divided by c (which is 299,792.458 km/s approximately). So more accurately, v/c = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 700 / 299,792.458 ≈ 0.002335.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002335

Then, (1.002335)^4:

First, compute ln(1.002335) ≈ 0.002333 (using Taylor series ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ...)

So ln(1.002335) ≈ 0.002335 - (0.002335)^2 / 2 + (0.002335)^3 / 3 - ...

First term: 0.002335

Second term: (0.002335)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.000005452 / 2 ≈ 0.000002726

Third term: (0.002335)^3 / 3 ≈ 0.0000000127 / 3 ≈ 0.00000000423

So ln(1.002335) ≈ 0.002335 - 0.000002726 + 0.00000000423 ≈ 0.00233228

Multiply by 4: 0.0093291

Exponentiate: e^0.0093291 ≈ 1 + 0.0093291 + (0.0093291)^2 / 2 + (0.0093291)^3 / 6

First term: 1

Second term: 0.0093291

Third term: (0.00008703) / 2 ≈ 0.000043515

Fourth term: (0.000000811) / 6 ≈ 0.000000135

Total ≈ 1 + 0.0093291 + 0.000043515 + 0.000000135 ≈ 1.00937275

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937275, so 1/(1.00937275) ≈ 0.9907

So again, same approximation. So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

But the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of the given factors. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift effect? But the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which must be due to the Doppler shift, so we can't ignore it. The problem states that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found the peak wavelengths to be the same. So the Doppler effect must be considered. Therefore, the calculation we did is necessary.

But let's check if there's another approach. The problem gives the masses as 1.5 times. But in the context of stars, mass and radius are related, but unless they are main-sequence stars. For main-sequence stars, more massive stars are larger and hotter. But the problem already gives the radius and mass as both 1.5 times. But if we were to consider the mass-luminosity relation, which says L ∝ M^3 or something, but that's for main-sequence stars. However, the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, which would mean using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So the mass might not be directly relevant here. The given mass might be a distractor, or perhaps it's to confirm that the radius scaling is consistent with the mass scaling? But since the problem states both radius and mass are 1.5 times, maybe it's just extra info. So perhaps the answer is (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4, and T1/T2 is 1/(1 + v/c), so the factor is (2.25) / (1 + v/c)^4. But since v is 700 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, so v/c is 7/300, so (1 + 7/300)^4. So the exact factor would be (1.5)^2 / (1 + 7/300)^4. Let's compute that.

First, 1 + 7/300 = 307/300 ≈ 1.023333... Wait, no, 1 + 7/300 is 307/300? Wait, 7/300 is approximately 0.02333, so 1 + 0.02333 is 1.02333. Wait, but earlier we had v/c as 700 / 3e5 = 7/300 = 0.02333? Wait, 700 divided by 300,000 is 7/3000, which is 0.002333. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 700 km/s divided by 300,000 km/s is 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 = 0.002333..., not 7/300. So 7/3000 is approximately 0.002333. Therefore, 1 + v/c = 1 + 7/3000 = 3007/3000 ≈ 1.002333. So (1 + v/c) = 1.002333, so (1 + v/c)^4 = (3007/3000)^4. Therefore, the exact expression is (1.5)^2 / (3007/3000)^4. But 1.5 is 3/2, so (3/2)^2 / (3007/3000)^4. But this seems complicated. Maybe the problem expects an approximate answer, like 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23. But maybe the answer is 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4. But this is getting too precise. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? But that seems unlikely because they mention radial velocities and observed peak wavelengths being the same, which must be connected via Doppler.

Wait, but let's check: if we ignore the Doppler shift, then the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2. Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the answer is not 2.25 because the temperatures are actually different due to Doppler shift. So the correct calculation must consider the Doppler effect, leading to a slightly lower factor, around 2.23. But the options might have 2.25 as a choice and another close number. But since the problem is from astronomy, perhaps they expect us to use the approximation that (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4v/c, so 1/(1 + 4v/c) ≈ 1 - 4v/c. But even then, 4v/c = 4*700/3e5 = 2800/3e5 ≈ 0.009333. So 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990666. Then, 2.25 * 0.990666 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23. But maybe the answer is 2.25 * (1 - 4v/c) ≈ 2.25 - 2.25*0.009333 ≈ 2.25 - 0.021 ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23.

But the problem might want an exact expression. Let's see:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + 700/c)^4]

But c is 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 7/3000. So:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4

= 2.25 / ( (3007/3000)^4 )

= 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4

But calculating (3000/3007)^4 exactly would require computation. However, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of 1.5^2 divided by (1 + 700/c)^4, but since 700/c is small, the answer is approximately 2.25. But the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which requires that the actual temperatures are different, so the answer must be less than 2.25. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.25 * (1 - 4*(700/c)) as a first-order approximation, which is about 2.25 * (1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229, so approximately 2.23.

But given that in multiple-choice questions, sometimes the options are given in fractions or whole numbers. But since the problem says "computing the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of", and the options are likely numerical, but since this is a thought process, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, let's check if there's another way.

Wait, another approach: The peak wavelength is the same for both stars as observed. For Star_1, since it's not moving, the observed peak wavelength is λ1 = b / T1. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s away, the observed peak wavelength is λ2 = λ2_emitted * (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c). Since λ1 = λ2, we have:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/c)

Then, the luminosity ratio is:

L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + 700/c))^4

Given c = 3e5 km/s,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700/3e5)^4 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23

So the factor is approximately 2.23. But since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps expressed as (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4, but since 700/c is 7/3000, then:

(1.5)^2 / (1 + 7/3000)^4 = (9/4) / ( (3007/3000)^4 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23

But since the problem is from astronomers, they might use the approximation formula for small velocities:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x.

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4v/c

Therefore, 1 / (1 + 4v/c) ≈ 1 - 4v/c

But this is only valid for small x. So:

L1/L2 ≈ (1.5)^2 * (1 - 4v/c) = 2.25 * (1 - 4*700/3e5) = 2.25 * (1 - 2800/3e5) = 2.25 * (1 - 0.009333) = 2.25 * 0.990666 ≈ 2.229

So approximately 2.23. But since the options might not have decimals, maybe it's a fraction. Let's compute 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is 223/100, but that's not a nice fraction. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, but that contradicts the given radial velocity. Therefore, the correct answer must consider the Doppler shift, leading to approximately 2.23. However, given that this is a calculation, perhaps the answer is 2.25 divided by (1.002333)^4, which is approximately 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So the factor is approximately 2.23. But since the problem might want an exact answer, maybe they expect us to write it as (3/2)^2 / (1 + 7/3000)^4, but that's not a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 81/16 divided by something, but I think in the absence of specific options, the best answer is approximately 2.23. However, given that in the problem statement, the radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is quite significant, but using non-relativistic Doppler shift, the factor is about 1.00233, so the temperature difference is small, leading to a small adjustment in the luminosity ratio. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23 times. So the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. But since the problem might expect an exact value, perhaps using the exact calculation:

Compute (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/300000)^4

First, 700/300000 = 0.002333...

1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333...

(1.002333...)^4 ≈ 1.00937

So 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23

Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. So the factor is about 2.23. But since the problem is multiple-choice, maybe the closest option is 2.25, but considering the Doppler effect reduces the luminosity ratio slightly, so the answer is less than 2.25. Therefore, the correct factor is approximately 2.23. However, without the options, we can't be sure, but based on calculations, the answer is approximately 2.23. But let's check once more.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the relation between T1 and T2. Let's double-check:

Since Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. But the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_emit1 = b / T1

For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Setting equal:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Therefore, when calculating L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v/c))^4

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation is right. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. So the factor is approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.23} or in fractional terms, but since 2.23 is approximately 223/100, but it's better to write as a decimal. However, if the problem expects an exact answer, maybe in terms of (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4, but since c is exact, but given as 3e5 km/s, perhaps they want an approximate decimal. So the answer is approximately 2.23. Hence, the final answer is \boxed{2.25} if they ignore Doppler shift, but considering Doppler shift, it's \boxed{2.23}. But since the problem mentions radial velocity, the correct answer must include the Doppler effect, so 2.23. However, in many textbooks, such problems might round the value, so maybe 2.25 is considered the answer if Doppler shift is neglected. But the problem explicitly mentions radial velocity and observed peak wavelengths being the same, so we must consider it. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the user hasn't provided options, and the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", I think the expected answer is 2.25, but that's only if they ignore Doppler shift. However, according to the correct calculation considering Doppler shift, it's approximately 2.23. But maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocity is small. But 700 km/s is not that small; it's 0.23% the speed of light. Wait, 700 / 300,000 is 0.00233, which is 0.233%. So maybe the change is small enough that the problem expects us to approximate it as 2.25. But the fact that the observed peak wavelengths are the same must be due to the Doppler shift, so we can't ignore it. Therefore, the answer must be approximately 2.23. But since in the calculation, we get approximately 2.23, which is 2.23 times. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.23}. However, in some contexts, they might keep it as (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/c)^4, but since c is 3e5 km/s, that's 700/3e5 = 7/3000, so the exact expression is (9/4) / ( (3007/3000)^4 ). But this is not a numerical answer. Therefore, the best approximate answer is 2.23. Hence, I will box 2.23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is asking about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. The given information includes their radii, masses, the fact that their peak wavelengths are the same, and their radial velocities. Hmm, radial velocities? Wait, radial velocity usually refers to the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Maybe it's related to Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving away, its emitted wavelengths get redshifted, or blueshifted if moving towards. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Wait, but the actual peak wavelength emitted by the star would depend on its temperature, right? So if the observed peak wavelength is the same, but one star is moving, then the actual emitted peak wavelength would be different due to the Doppler effect. Let me think.

So, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if the star is moving with a radial velocity, the observed wavelength is shifted. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) when the velocity is along the line of sight. But for non-relativistic speeds, which 700 km/s is, since 700 km/s is 0.7% the speed of light (since c is about 300,000 km/s), so v/c is 0.007, which is small. So we can approximate the Doppler shift as λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). Wait, but actually, the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) ≈ (1 + v/c) when v is much less than c. Wait, no, actually, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) if the source is moving away. So if the star is moving away (positive radial velocity), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, it's blueshifted.

But in the problem, they say that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So even though Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelengths for both stars are the same. That must mean that the actual emitted peak wavelengths are different, adjusted by their velocities. So for Star_1, which has 0 radial velocity, the observed λ_peak is equal to its emitted λ_peak. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed λ_peak is equal to λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c). But since the observed λ_peak for both stars is the same, we can set up an equation:

λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_peak_observed_Star2

But λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star1 (since v=0)

λ_peak_observed_Star2 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore:

λ_emitted_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

But from Wien's Law, λ_emitted is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Therefore:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1. Because when Star_2's emitted wavelength is blueshifted (if moving towards) or redshifted (if moving away). Wait, no, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But is that velocity towards us or away? The problem says "radial velocity", which is the component along the line of sight. The sign convention is usually that positive is receding (away), negative is approaching. But the problem just states 700 km/s. Since it's given as a positive number, perhaps we can assume it's moving away. But the problem doesn't specify direction, but since it's given as 700 km/s, maybe we just take the magnitude. But in any case, the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2 * (1 + v/c). Since the observed λ_peak is the same for both stars, then:

λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, using Wien's Law:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then its emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed, so T2 would be higher. Because if the emitted wavelength is shorter, the temperature is higher (since λ_peak ~ 1/T). So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by that factor.

But then, we need to compute the luminosities. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴

L2 = 4πR2²σT2⁴

We need to find the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2 (since Star_1 has radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2). Also, the mass of St

# Anthropic completion

Alright, so we're examining a problem involving two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, and need to determine the factor by which Star_1's luminosity exceeds Star_2's. We have information about their radii, masses, peak wavelengths, and radial velocities.

The problem states that both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, despite Star_2 having a radial velocity of 700 km/s while Star_1 has zero radial velocity. This implies the Doppler effect is influencing our observations.

Since radial velocity affects the observed wavelength through the formula λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c) for non-relativistic speeds (where 700 km/s is approximately 0.007c), the actual emitted wavelengths must differ between the stars to result in identical observed wavelengths.

For Star_1: λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star1 (since v=0)
For Star_2: λ_peak_observed_Star2 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal:
λ_emitted_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Using Wien's Law (λ_peak = b/T), we can determine:
b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplifying: T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

This means Star_2's temperature is higher than Star_1's by a factor of (1 + v/c).

Now for luminosity calculations using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (L = 4πR²σT⁴):
L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴
L2 = 4πR2²σT2⁴

Given that R1 = 1.5R2 and considering our temperature relationship, we can determine the luminosity ratio L1/L2.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's see. The problem concerns two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, and asks by how much the luminosity of Star_1 surpasses that of Star_2. We know their radii, masses, that their peak wavelengths are identical, and their radial velocities. Radial velocity indicates how the star moves relative to us. But does it impact luminosity? It might relate to the Doppler shift, because a star's movement causes its emitted wavelengths to shift: redshift if it's moving away, blueshift if it's approaching. Despite this, the problem states that their observed peak wavelengths are identical. Yet, the actual emitted peak wavelength depends on temperature. Thus, if the observed peak wavelengths are the same and one star is moving, their emitted peak wavelengths must differ due to the Doppler effect. Let me consider this.

A black body's peak wavelength follows Wien's Law: λ_peak = b / T, with b as Wien's displacement constant. If a star moves with a radial velocity, its observed wavelength shifts. The Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) for velocities along the line of sight. With non-relativistic speeds, such as 700 km/s, v/c is about 0.007, so it's small enough to allow the approximation: λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). Although the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) ≈ (1 + v/c) with v much less than c, no, in fact, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) when the source recedes. Therefore, if the star moves away (positive radial velocity), its observed wavelength elongates as redshift, and shortens as blueshift when it moves toward us.

Now, the problem states that both stars’ observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hence, even though Star_2 moves at 700 km/s, their observed peak wavelengths are identical. This means their actual emitted peak wavelengths differ, considering velocity adjustments. For Star_1, with 0 radial velocity, the observed and emitted λ_peak match. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed λ_peak equals λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c). Since observed λ_peak is the same, we set:

λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_peak_observed_Star2

Given λ_peak_observed_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star1 (because v=0)

And λ_peak_observed_Star2 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

Therefore:

λ_emitted_Star1 = λ_emitted_Star2 * (1 + v/c)

According to Wien's Law, λ_emitted inversely relates to temperature:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

This simplifies to:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Thus:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So, Star_2's temperature surpasses Star_1's by a factor of (1 + v/c). Nonetheless, remember that Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter than observed if it moves away, making T2 larger due to the relation λ_peak ~ 1/T, confirming that T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Now, for luminosities, the Stefan-Boltzmann law states: L = 4πR²σT⁴, with R for radius, T for temperature, and σ for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

For Star_1: L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴

For Star_2: L2 = 4πR2²σT2⁴

We're finding the ratio L1 / L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2 (Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's), the mass information of Star_2 needs consideration but hasn't directly entered our luminosity comparison yet.

So mass might not directly factor into the luminosity calculation unless it affects radius or temperature. But since the radius is already given, and the temperature is determined through the Doppler shift and Wien\'s law, maybe the mass is a red herring? Wait, but in stars, mass and radius are related through the stellar structure, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so perhaps we can ignore the mass? Wait, but the problem mentions that the mass is 1.5 times larger for Star_1. But since we are given the radii and the temperatures (from the previous calculation), maybe the mass doesn\'t directly affect the luminosity here. Unless the luminosity also depends on mass, but according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, it\'s only R and T. So maybe the mass is extra information, perhaps to confuse? Or maybe not. Wait, but the problem says "the mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times)". So radius is 1.5 times, mass is 1.5 times. But in main sequence stars, mass and radius are related, but not linearly. For example, more massive stars are larger, but the relationship isn\'t linear. But in this problem, maybe we are supposed to ignore that and just take the given radius and mass? Since the problem states to assume black body radiation, so perhaps mass is not needed. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"\n\nSo, given that, the luminosity ratio is (L1 / L2) = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)^4\n\nWe have R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1 / R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\nFrom earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nBut we need to compute this factor. Let\'s plug in the numbers.\n\nv = 700 km/s. c = 300,000 km/s. Therefore, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333...\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.023333)^4. Let\'s compute that.\n\nFirst, compute ln(1.023333) ≈ 0.0230 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x). So ln(1.023333) ≈ 0.0230. Then multiply by 4: 0.092. Then exponentiate: e^0.092 ≈ 1.096. Alternatively, use binomial approximation: (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4. For x = 0.023333.\n\nCompute 4x = 0.093333\n\n6x² = 6*(0.023333)^2 ≈ 6*0.000544 = 0.003264\n\n4x³ ≈ 4*(0.023333)^3 ≈ 4*0.0000127 ≈ 0.0000508\n\nx^4 ≈ (0.023333)^4 ≈ 0.0000003\n\nSo total ≈ 1 + 0.093333 + 0.003264 + 0.0000508 + 0.0000003 ≈ 1.096648. So approximately 1.0966. So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052. So approximately 2.05.\n\nBut let me check with a calculator for more precision.\n\nFirst, compute 1.023333^4:\n\n1.023333^2 = (1.023333)*(1.023333). Let\'s compute 1.023333*1.023333:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*0.023333 = 0.023333\n\n0.023333*1 = 0.023333\n\n0.023333*0.023333 ≈ 0.000544\n\nAdding up: 1 + 0.023333 + 0.023333 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721\n\nSo 1.023333^2 ≈ 1.04721\n\nThen square that to get the fourth power: 1.04721^2\n\n1.04721*1.04721:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*0.04721 = 0.04721\n\n0.04721*1 = 0.04721\n\n0.04721*0.04721 ≈ 0.002228\n\nAdding up: 1 + 0.04721 + 0.04721 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.09664\n\nSo indeed, (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09664. So 1.09664.\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ 2.052. Let\'s compute 2.25 divided by 1.09664.\n\nFirst, 1.09664 * 2 = 2.19328. That\'s more than 2.25. Wait, no. Wait, 1.09664 * 2 = 2.19328. But 2.25 is larger than 2.19328. So 1.09664 * 2.05 = 1.09664 * 2 + 1.09664 * 0.05 = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112. That\'s very close to 2.25. So 2.05 gives 2.2481, which is 2.25 - 2.2481 = 0.0019 less. So the actual value is approximately 2.05 + (0.0019 / 1.09664) ≈ 2.05 + 0.00173 ≈ 2.0517. So approximately 2.0517. So about 2.05.\n\nBut let\'s check with a more precise division.\n\n2.25 / 1.09664:\n\nLet me write it as 225 / 109.664.\n\nDivide 225 by 109.664.\n\n109.664 * 2 = 219.328\n\n225 - 219.328 = 5.672\n\nBring down a zero: 56.72\n\n109.664 goes into 56.72 about 0.5 times (0.5*109.664 = 54.832)\n\n56.72 - 54.832 = 1.888\n\nBring down another zero: 18.88\n\n109.664 goes into 18.88 about 0.172 times (0.172*109.664 ≈ 18.88)\n\nSo total is 2.05 + 0.005 + 0.000...? Wait, maybe this is getting too detailed. But the approximate value is 2.05.\n\nBut let me use a calculator step:\n\n1.09664 * 2.05 = 1.09664 * 2 + 1.09664 * 0.05 = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112\n\nDifference from 2.25 is 0.001888. So 0.001888 / 1.09664 ≈ 0.001722. So total is 2.05 + 0.001722 ≈ 2.0517. So approximately 2.0517, which is about 2.05. So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.05. So the answer is approximately 2.05, so the factor is about 2.05. But let\'s see if we need to be more precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Wait, but the problem mentions that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which is only possible if the actual emitted wavelengths are different due to their velocities. So the Doppler shift is essential here. So the calculation we did is necessary.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the direction of the Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving away (radial velocity 700 km/s), then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. Therefore, to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1 (which is at rest), Star_2 must have a shorter emitted wavelength. Since λ_emitted = λ_observed / (1 + v/c). Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So that part is correct.\n\nSo the temperature ratio is T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, when we take T1 / T2, it\'s 1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4. So that part is correct.\n\nThen, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05. So that seems right.\n\nBut let me check if the Doppler shift formula is correct. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + v/c). Since λ_obs_Star1 = λ_emit_Star1, and they are equal, then λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + v/c). Therefore, λ_emit_Star2 = λ_emit_Star1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, since λ_peak ~ 1/T, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "the stars radiate as black bodies", so we don\'t have to consider any other effects, like relativistic beaming or anything else? Probably not, since the problem states to assume black body radiation, so standard Doppler shift and Stefan-Boltzmann law apply.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately 2.05. But let\'s see if the answer is expected to be an exact value or a decimal. The given numbers are 1.5, 700 km/s. 1.5 is exact, 700 is exact. So maybe we need to compute it more precisely.\n\nLet me compute (1 + v/c)^4 with v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s.\n\nv/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...\n\nCompute (1 + 0.0233333)^4:\n\nFirst, compute ln(1.0233333) ≈ 0.023049 (using calculator: ln(1.0233333) ≈ 0.023049)\n\nMultiply by 4: 0.092196\n\nExponentiate: e^0.092196 ≈ 1.0966 (since e^0.09 = 1.09417, e^0.092196 ≈ 1.0966)\n\nSo (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966\n\nTherefore, 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052\n\nSo approximately 2.05. But maybe the problem expects an exact fractional value? Let\'s see.\n\nv/c = 700 / 300000 = 7 / 300\n\nSo (1 + 7/300) = 307/300\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4) * (300^4 / 307^4)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let\'s compute 300/307 ≈ 0.977. So (300/307)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91. Then 9/4 * 0.91 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.0475. So approximately 2.05. So the exact value is (9/4)*(300/307)^4. But unless they want it in terms of fractions, which would be messy, the approximate decimal is 2.05. But let\'s check if 307^4 is computable.\n\n307^2 = 94249\n\n307^4 = (307^2)^2 = 94249^2. Let\'s compute 94249*94249. That\'s a huge number, but maybe we can see that 300^4 = 81,000,000. 307^4 is (300 + 7)^4. But expanding that would take time. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation, so 2.05 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Wait, but the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which is only possible if the actual temperatures are different when considering their velocities. If we ignored the Doppler shift, then the peak wavelengths would imply the same temperature, and then the luminosity ratio would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the inclusion of the radial velocities must mean that we have to consider the Doppler effect. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.05. But let\'s check the problem statement again.\n\n"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."\n\nSo the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But if one star is moving, the actual emitted peak wavelength is different. Therefore, the temperatures are different. Therefore, the calculation we did is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity as well? Because if a star is moving away, the observed flux is reduced due to the Doppler shift (relativistic beaming), but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", which might imply that we just consider the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed one. Wait, but the problem says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of". So luminosity here is the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed one. Therefore, the Doppler shift only affects the determination of the temperature, but the luminosity is calculated using the actual radius and actual temperature. Therefore, the steps we did are correct: using the Doppler shift to find the temperature ratio, then applying Stefan-Boltzmann law with the given radius ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 2.05. But let\'s check if 700 km/s is positive (receding) or negative (approaching). The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." If Star_2 is moving away, then the calculation is as above. If it\'s moving towards, then the Doppler shift factor would be (1 - v/c), but since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, which is a positive number, it\'s likely that it\'s moving away. But in any case, the problem doesn\'t specify direction, so we have to assume the given velocity is the radial speed, regardless of direction. But the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c), where v is positive for receding. If the star is moving towards, v is negative, so λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 - v/c). But since the problem states the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, without specifying direction, but in astronomy, radial velocity is usually given with a sign, but here it\'s given as 700 km/s. Maybe it\'s the speed, not the velocity. So perhaps the direction doesn\'t matter, and we take the speed, so the Doppler factor is 1 + v/c. But if the star is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 - v/c). But since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ_emit_Star2 = λ_obs / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = T1*(1 - v/c). But since v is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction, but the problem doesn\'t specify direction. Wait, but the problem says "radial velocities", which in astronomy can be positive (receding) or negative (approaching). But here, both are given as positive numbers: 0 and 700. So maybe they are speeds, not velocities. If that\'s the case, then we can\'t know the direction, but the problem says "astronomers calculated the radial velocities", which usually include direction. So this is a bit ambiguous. But given that the problem is likely constructed with the intention that Star_2 is moving away, so that the Doppler shift is a redshift, requiring Star_2 to have a higher temperature to have the same observed wavelength. Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards, then the Doppler shift is a blueshift, so Star_2 would have a lower temperature. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, which one is it?\n\nWait, let\'s think. If Star_2 is moving towards us (v = -700 km/s), then the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - v/c) = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + 700/300000) because v is negative. Wait, no. If the velocity is towards us, the radial velocity is negative, so v = -700 km/s. Then the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) = λ_emit*(1 - 700/300000). Therefore, λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - 0.002333). Therefore, to have λ_obs_Star2 = λ_obs_Star1 = λ_emit_Star1, we get λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - 0.002333). Therefore, T2 = T1 / (1 - v/c). Wait, but v is negative here. So if v is the radial velocity, with positive being receding, then if Star_2 is approaching, v = -700 km/s. Then the formula becomes λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) = λ_emit*(1 - 700/c). Therefore, λ_emit_Star2 = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c). Then, using Wien\'s Law, T2 = b / λ_emit_Star2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs)*(1 - 700/c). But since λ_obs = λ_emit_Star1 = b / T1, then T2 = T1*(1 - 700/c). Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1*0.997667. Therefore, T2 is lower than T1. Then, the luminosity ratio would be L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2*(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2*(1 / 0.997667)^4 ≈ 2.25*(1.0094) ≈ 2.25*1.038 ≈ 2.34. But this contradicts the previous result. So depending on the direction of the velocity, the answer is different. But the problem states the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. In astronomy, radial velocities are signed, with positive meaning receding. Therefore, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, it\'s moving away. If it\'s -700 km/s, moving towards. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." Since it\'s stated as 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it\'s positive, so moving away. Therefore, the initial calculation holds: T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s check what happens if the velocity is negative. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the calculation gives T2 = T1*(1 - v/c) = T1*(1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1*0.9976667. Then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2*(T1/(T1*0.9976667))^4 = 2.25*(1/0.9976667)^4 ≈ 2.25*(1.0094) ≈ 2.25*1.038 ≈ 2.34. But this is a different answer. However, given that the problem specifies radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, without a sign, but in the context of radial velocities, usually positive is receding. However, sometimes in some contexts, radial velocity is just speed. But given that the problem is from astronomers who determined the radial velocities, they would know the direction. But since it\'s given as 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it\'s moving away. Therefore, the correct calculation is T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.\n\nBut let\'s check with exact calculation using v = 700 km/s:\n\nv/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...\n\n(1 + v/c) = 307/300\n\n(1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4\n\nCompute (307/300)^4:\n\nFirst, 307/300 = 1 + 7/300\n\nCompute (1 + 7/300)^4 using binomial theorem:\n\n= 1 + 4*(7/300) + 6*(7/300)^2 + 4*(7/300)^3 + (7/300)^4\n\n= 1 + 28/300 + 6*(49/90000) + 4*(343/27,000,000) + (2401/810,000,000)\n\nConvert to decimals:\n\n28/300 ≈ 0.093333\n\n6*(49/90000) = 294/90000 ≈ 0.0032667\n\n4*(343/27,000,000) ≈ 1372/27,000,000 ≈ 0.0000508\n\n2401/810,000,000 ≈ 0.00000296\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1 + 0.093333 + 0.0032667 + 0.0000508 + 0.00000296 ≈ 1.096653\n\nSo (307/300)^4 ≈ 1.096653\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.096653 ≈ 2.25 / 1.096653 ≈ 2.052\n\nSo approximately 2.05, which rounds to 2.1. But maybe the problem expects an exact fraction? Let\'s see:\n\nL1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4)*(300^4 / 307^4)\n\nBut 300^4 = (3^4)*(100^4) = 81*100000000 = 8,100,000,000\n\n307^4 = 307*307*307*307. Let\'s compute:\n\n307*307 = 94249\n\n94249*307 = let\'s compute 94249*300 + 94249*7 = 28,274,700 + 659,743 = 28,934,443\n\n28,934,443*307 = 28,934,443*300 + 28,934,443*7 = 8,680,332,900 + 202,541,101 = 8,882,874,001\n\nSo 307^4 = 8,882,874,001\n\nTherefore, 300^4 / 307^4 = 8,100,000,000 / 8,882,874,001 ≈ 0.9118\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = (9/4)*0.9118 ≈ 2.25*0.9118 ≈ 2.05155\n\nSo approximately 2.0516, which is about 2.05. So the answer is approximately 2.05. However, in the options, if given, it might be 2.1 or 2.05. But since the problem is from an exam, maybe the answer is 2.1. But given that 2.05 is more precise. However, let\'s check if there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another way: The problem says the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But in the calculation, we didn\'t use the mass. Is there a reason mass would be involved? In the luminosity calculation for stars, mass can affect luminosity, but the problem says to assume black body radiation. The Stefan-Boltzmann law only depends on radius and temperature. So mass is not needed here. Therefore, the inclusion of mass in the problem might be a distractor. So the answer is approximately 2.05. But since the problem is likely multiple choice, and 2.05 is not a nice number, maybe the intended answer is (1.5)^2/(1 + 700/c)^4. But 700/c is 7/300, so (1 + 7/300)^4 = (307/300)^4. So the exact ratio is (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4. But this is a fraction that\'s approximately 2.05. If the answer requires an exact value, it\'s that fraction, but if approximate, it\'s 2.05. Since the problem says "computed the luminosity... by a factor of:", it\'s likely expecting an approximate decimal, so 2.1. But given that 2.05 is closer, but maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Let\'s check.\n\nIf we ignore the Doppler shift, then the peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem gives information about radial velocities, so we can\'t ignore it. Therefore, the answer must be approximately 2.05, which is closest to 2.1. But in the calculation, it\'s 2.05. However, maybe the problem expects us to use the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x. Let\'s see:\n\n(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(v/c) = 1 + 4*(0.023333) ≈ 1.093333\n\nThen L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.093333 ≈ 2.25 / 1.093333 ≈ 2.058, which is about 2.06. Still approximately 2.1. But given that the exact value is 2.05, which is approximately 2.1. However, in some contexts, 2.05 rounds to 2.1, but in others, it\'s kept as 2.05. But since the options are not given, and the problem asks to put the answer in a box, likely as \\boxed{2.05} or \\boxed{2.1}. But given that in precise calculation it\'s 2.05, but maybe the answer is 2.1. However, given that 700/300000 is 0.002333..., and (1.002333...)^4 is approximately 1.0094 for 0.2333% per year? Wait, no, 0.002333 is 0.2333%, so over 4th power, it\'s roughly 1 + 4*0.002333 = 1.009333, but actual value is higher, 1.0966. Wait, no, 1.023333^4 is 1.0966, which is approximately 9.66% increase. So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05. So 2.05 is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05, which is best represented as \\boxed{2.05}. However, in some textbooks, they might use 2.1 as an approximate answer. But since the calculation gives 2.05, I think 2.05 is better. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the relativistic Doppler effect formula for temperature. The temperature observed is related to the intrinsic temperature by T_obs = T_emit / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. But in this case, the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. For Star_1, T_obs1 = T1 (since no redshift). For Star_2, T_obs2 = T2 / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Since T_obs1 = T_obs2, then T1 = T2 / (1 + z). Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 + z). The redshift z for small velocities is approximately z ≈ v/c. Therefore, T2 ≈ T1*(1 + v/c). So same as before. Therefore, the calculation holds. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 2.05. Since the problem might expect rounding to two significant figures, 2.1. But 2.05 is three significant figures. Given that the given data (1.5 and 700) are two significant figures, except 700 which could be ambiguous (if it\'s 7x10^2, it\'s one significant figure, but usually 700 is considered two if written as 7.0x10^2, but here it\'s written as 700). Hmm. 1.5 is two significant figures, 700 is ambiguous. If 700 is two significant figures (7.0x10^2), then the answer should be two significant figures: 2.1. If 700 is three significant figures, then the answer is 2.05. But in many textbooks, trailing zeros in numbers without a decimal are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 700 km/s would be 7 x 10^2 (1 sig fig) or 7.0 x 10^2 (2 sig fig) or 7.00 x 10^2 (3 sig fig). Since it\'s written as 700, which is ambiguous, but in the context of physics problems, often numbers like 700 are treated as having two significant figures if the trailing zeros are significant. But since the other number is 1.5 (two sig figs), the answer should have two sig figs. Therefore, 2.1. But our calculation is 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.1}.\n\nBut I need to check the exact calculation again. If we take v = 700 km/s (two sig figs), c = 3.00 x 10^5 km/s (three sig figs), then v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.00233 (three sig figs). Then (1 + 0.00233)^4 = 1.00937 (using more precise calculation), wait no, wait:\n\nWait, 0.00233 is approximate. Wait, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.002333 with the 3 repeating. So if we take it as 0.002333, then (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00941 (wait, no, earlier calculation showed it\'s 1.0966). Wait, no, wait, 1.02333^4 is 1.0966, but 0.002333 is 0.2333%, so 1.002333^4 is different. Wait, no, wait, v/c is 700/300,000 = 0.002333..., so 0.2333% of c. So (1 + 0.002333)^4 = ?\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, the Doppler shift formula: if the radial velocity is v, then the Doppler factor is 1 + v/c for recession, 1 - v/c for approach. But in terms of temperature, the observed temperature is T_obs = T_emit / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For small z, z ≈ v/c. So T_obs ≈ T_emit / (1 + v/c). But in our problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so T_obs1 = T_obs2. Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c), so T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, the temperature ratio is T2/T1 = 1 + v/c. Therefore, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2*(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2*(1/(1 + v/c))^4. Given that v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333..., so 1/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.997668. Then (0.997668)^4 ≈ 0.9907. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. Wait, this contradicts previous results. Wait, no, wait, this is wrong. Because if T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), then T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. So 2.25 / (1.002333)^4. Wait, but 1.002333^4 is approximately 1.00941. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.00941 ≈ 2.229. Wait, this is different from before. What\'s the issue here?\n\nWait, no, there\'s confusion between the Doppler shift in wavelength and the Doppler shift in temperature. Let me clarify.\n\nThe observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) for recession. The Wien\'s Law says λ_peak = b / T. Therefore, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit = b / T. Therefore, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = (b / T)*(1 + v/c). Therefore, if two stars have the same observed λ_obs, then:\n\nFor Star_1 (v=0): λ_obs = b / T1\n\nFor Star_2 (v=700 km/s): λ_obs = (b / T2)*(1 + v/c)\n\nSetting equal:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2)*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, 1 / T1 = (1 / T2)*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, when calculating L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v/c))^4\n\nGiven that v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333...\n\nTherefore, (1/(1 + v/c))^4 = 1 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00941 ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229\n\nWait, this is different from the previous result of 2.05. What\'s the mistake here?\n\nWait, no, this can\'t be. Wait, earlier I thought that T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c), so (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4. Then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. But 1.5^2 is 2.25, and (1 + v/c)^4 is (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00941. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.00941 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. But earlier calculation said that (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966, which is incorrect. Wait, no, wait, there\'s confusion between two different uses of v/c. Wait, in the initial calculation, I considered v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333, but then in the first part of the thought process, I mistakenly used v/c = 0.02333 (which is 7/300), but 700/3e5 is 7/300 = 0.02333. Wait, no! Wait, 700 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333..., which is 2.333...% of the speed of light. Therefore, v/c = 0.023333, not 0.002333. That was the mistake! Oh my goodness, I see now. So the initial calculation had v/c = 0.023333, which is 7/300, but later, in the last part, I incorrectly used v/c = 0.002333. That\'s where the error crept in.\n\nSo correcting that:\n\nv = 700 km/s\n\nc = 300,000 km/s\n\nv/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c) = 1.023333...\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.0966\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05\n\nYes, that\'s correct. The earlier mistake was in the latter part where I incorrectly took v/c as 0.002333 instead of 0.023333. Therefore, the correct calculation is L1/L2 ≈ 2.05. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two significant figures. However, since 700 has two significant figures (if it\'s 7.0 x 10^2), and 1.5 has two, the answer should have two significant figures: 2.1. But 2.05 is three significant figures. However, in the calculation, we have:\n\nv/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.00233 (three significant figures if 700 is three sig figs). But 700 is ambiguous. If it\'s two sig figs, then v/c is 0.0023 (two sig figs), then (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0094 (using 0.0023), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23, which is 2.2. But this is inconsistent.\n\nBut given that the problem states 700 km/s, which is two significant figures (assuming it\'s 7.0 x 10^2), and 1.5 is two significant figures, the answer should be two significant figures. However, the exact calculation with v/c = 0.023333 (three sig figs) gives 2.05, which is three sig figs. But since the given data has two sig figs (700 and 1.5), the answer should be two sig figs: 2.1. However, in the initial exact calculation, it\'s 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two sig figs. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.1}.\n\nBut I need to confirm once again. If v/c = 0.023333 (exactly 7/300), then (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4 ≈ 1.0966. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.0517, which is approximately 2.05. If we consider significant figures:\n\n- 1.5 has two sig figs.\n\n- 700 km/s has one or two sig figs. If it\'s one sig fig (7 x 10^2), then v/c ≈ 0.02 (one sig fig), (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.02)^4 ≈ 1.0824, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0824 ≈ 2.08, which rounds to 2.1 (two sig figs). If 700 has two sig figs (7.0 x 10^2), then v/c = 0.0233 (three sig figs), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, which is three sig figs. But since 1.5 has two, the answer should have two, so 2.1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.1}.\n\nBut given that in the calculation it\'s approximately 2.05, but considering significant figures, it\'s 2.1. However, different instructors might treat significant figures differently. But since the problem is likely designed to test the application of Doppler shift in luminosity calculation, and the exact answer is approximately 2.05, but given the options, it\'s probably 2.1. However, to adhere to the significant figures based on the given data (700 as two sig figs, 1.5 as two sig figs), the answer is two sig figs: 2.1. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2.1}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447526, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=9838, prompt_tokens=1553, total_tokens=11391, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and consider the Doppler effect on the observed peak wavelengths.

1. **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**:
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1 + v/c) \).
   - Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, we equate the emitted wavelengths adjusted by their velocities:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} (1 + v/c)
     \]
   - Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto 1/T \)), we find the temperature ratio:
     \[
     \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} (1 + v/c) \implies T_2 = T_1 (1 + v/c)
     \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The Stefan-Boltzmann law states \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \).
   - The luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 (1 + v/c) \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + v/c} \right)^4
     \]

3. **Calculations**:
   - \( v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333 \)
   - \( (1 + v/c)^4 \approx 1.0966 \)
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.0966} \approx 2.05
     \]

4. **Significant Figures**:
   - Given the data (1.5 and 700 km/s), the result is rounded to two significant figures.

The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of \(\boxed{2.1}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ar_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but the problem states to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So mass might not directly factor into the luminosity calculation unless it affects radius or temperature. But since the radius is already given, and the temperature is determined through the Doppler shift and Wien's law, maybe the mass is a red herring? Wait, but in stars, mass and radius are related through the stellar structure, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so perhaps we can ignore the mass? Wait, but the problem mentions that the mass is 1.5 times larger for Star_1. But since we are given the radii and the temperatures (from the previous calculation), maybe the mass doesn't directly affect the luminosity here. Unless the luminosity also depends on mass, but according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, it's only R and T. So maybe the mass is extra information, perhaps to confuse? Or maybe not. Wait, but the problem says "the mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times)". So radius is 1.5 times, mass is 1.5 times. But in main sequence stars, mass and radius are related, but not linearly. For example, more massive stars are larger, but the relationship isn't linear. But in this problem, maybe we are supposed to ignore that and just take the given radius and mass? Since the problem states to assume black body radiation, so perhaps mass is not needed. Let me check.

The problem says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, given that, the luminosity ratio is (L1 / L2) = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)^4

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1 / R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

From earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4

Therefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4

But we need to compute this factor. Let's plug in the numbers.

v = 700 km/s. c = 300,000 km/s. Therefore, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333...

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333...

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.023333)^4. Let's compute that.

First, compute ln(1.023333) ≈ 0.0230 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x). So ln(1.023333) ≈ 0.0230. Then multiply by 4: 0.092. Then exponentiate: e^0.092 ≈ 1.096. Alternatively, use binomial approximation: (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4. For x = 0.023333.

Compute 4x = 0.093333

6x² = 6*(0.023333)^2 ≈ 6*0.000544 = 0.003264

4x³ ≈ 4*(0.023333)^3 ≈ 4*0.0000127 ≈ 0.0000508

x^4 ≈ (0.023333)^4 ≈ 0.0000003

So total ≈ 1 + 0.093333 + 0.003264 + 0.0000508 + 0.0000003 ≈ 1.096648. So approximately 1.0966. So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966

Therefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052. So approximately 2.05.

But let me check with a calculator for more precision.

First, compute 1.023333^4:

1.023333^2 = (1.023333)*(1.023333). Let's compute 1.023333*1.023333:

1*1 = 1

1*0.023333 = 0.023333

0.023333*1 = 0.023333

0.023333*0.023333 ≈ 0.000544

Adding up: 1 + 0.023333 + 0.023333 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721

So 1.023333^2 ≈ 1.04721

Then square that to get the fourth power: 1.04721^2

1.04721*1.04721:

1*1 = 1

1*0.04721 = 0.04721

0.04721*1 = 0.04721

0.04721*0.04721 ≈ 0.002228

Adding up: 1 + 0.04721 + 0.04721 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.09664

So indeed, (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09664. So 1.09664.

Therefore, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ 2.052. Let's compute 2.25 divided by 1.09664.

First, 1.09664 * 2 = 2.19328. That's more than 2.25. Wait, no. Wait, 1.09664 * 2 = 2.19328. But 2.25 is larger than 2.19328. So 1.09664 * 2.05 = 1.09664 * 2 + 1.09664 * 0.05 = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112. That's very close to 2.25. So 2.05 gives 2.2481, which is 2.25 - 2.2481 = 0.0019 less. So the actual value is approximately 2.05 + (0.0019 / 1.09664) ≈ 2.05 + 0.00173 ≈ 2.0517. So approximately 2.0517. So about 2.05.

But let's check with a more precise division.

2.25 / 1.09664:

Let me write it as 225 / 109.664.

Divide 225 by 109.664.

109.664 * 2 = 219.328

225 - 219.328 = 5.672

Bring down a zero: 56.72

109.664 goes into 56.72 about 0.5 times (0.5*109.664 = 54.832)

56.72 - 54.832 = 1.888

Bring down another zero: 18.88

109.664 goes into 18.88 about 0.172 times (0.172*109.664 ≈ 18.88)

So total is 2.05 + 0.005 + 0.000...? Wait, maybe this is getting too detailed. But the approximate value is 2.05.

But let me use a calculator step:

1.09664 * 2.05 = 1.09664 * 2 + 1.09664 * 0.05 = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112

Difference from 2.25 is 0.001888. So 0.001888 / 1.09664 ≈ 0.001722. So total is 2.05 + 0.001722 ≈ 2.0517. So approximately 2.0517, which is about 2.05. So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.05. So the answer is approximately 2.05, so the factor is about 2.05. But let's see if we need to be more precise.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Wait, but the problem mentions that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which is only possible if the actual emitted wavelengths are different due to their velocities. So the Doppler shift is essential here. So the calculation we did is necessary.

But let me check if I messed up the direction of the Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving away (radial velocity 700 km/s), then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. Therefore, to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1 (which is at rest), Star_2 must have a shorter emitted wavelength. Since λ_emitted = λ_observed / (1 + v/c). Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So that part is correct.

So the temperature ratio is T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, when we take T1 / T2, it's 1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4. So that part is correct.

Then, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05. So that seems right.

But let me check if the Doppler shift formula is correct. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + v/c). Since λ_obs_Star1 = λ_emit_Star1, and they are equal, then λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + v/c). Therefore, λ_emit_Star2 = λ_emit_Star1 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, since λ_peak ~ 1/T, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). So that's correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

But wait, the problem says "the stars radiate as black bodies", so we don't have to consider any other effects, like relativistic beaming or anything else? Probably not, since the problem states to assume black body radiation, so standard Doppler shift and Stefan-Boltzmann law apply.

Therefore, the ratio is approximately 2.05. But let's see if the answer is expected to be an exact value or a decimal. The given numbers are 1.5, 700 km/s. 1.5 is exact, 700 is exact. So maybe we need to compute it more precisely.

Let me compute (1 + v/c)^4 with v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...

Compute (1 + 0.0233333)^4:

First, compute ln(1.0233333) ≈ 0.023049 (using calculator: ln(1.0233333) ≈ 0.023049)

Multiply by 4: 0.092196

Exponentiate: e^0.092196 ≈ 1.0966 (since e^0.09 = 1.09417, e^0.092196 ≈ 1.0966)

So (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966

Therefore, 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.052

So approximately 2.05. But maybe the problem expects an exact fractional value? Let's see.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 7 / 300

So (1 + 7/300) = 307/300

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4

Therefore, L1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4) * (300^4 / 307^4)

But this seems complicated. Let's compute 300/307 ≈ 0.977. So (300/307)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91. Then 9/4 * 0.91 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.0475. So approximately 2.05. So the exact value is (9/4)*(300/307)^4. But unless they want it in terms of fractions, which would be messy, the approximate decimal is 2.05. But let's check if 307^4 is computable.

307^2 = 94249

307^4 = (307^2)^2 = 94249^2. Let's compute 94249*94249. That's a huge number, but maybe we can see that 300^4 = 81,000,000. 307^4 is (300 + 7)^4. But expanding that would take time. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation, so 2.05 is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Wait, but the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which is only possible if the actual temperatures are different when considering their velocities. If we ignored the Doppler shift, then the peak wavelengths would imply the same temperature, and then the luminosity ratio would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the inclusion of the radial velocities must mean that we have to consider the Doppler effect. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.05. But let's check the problem statement again.

"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But if one star is moving, the actual emitted peak wavelength is different. Therefore, the temperatures are different. Therefore, the calculation we did is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity as well? Because if a star is moving away, the observed flux is reduced due to the Doppler shift (relativistic beaming), but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", which might imply that we just consider the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed one. Wait, but the problem says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of". So luminosity here is the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed one. Therefore, the Doppler shift only affects the determination of the temperature, but the luminosity is calculated using the actual radius and actual temperature. Therefore, the steps we did are correct: using the Doppler shift to find the temperature ratio, then applying Stefan-Boltzmann law with the given radius ratio.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05. But let's check if 700 km/s is positive (receding) or negative (approaching). The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." If Star_2 is moving away, then the calculation is as above. If it's moving towards, then the Doppler shift factor would be (1 - v/c), but since the velocity is given as 700 km/s, which is a positive number, it's likely that it's moving away. But in any case, the problem doesn't specify direction, so we have to assume the given velocity is the radial speed, regardless of direction. But the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c), where v is positive for receding. If the star is moving towards, v is negative, so λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 - v/c). But since the problem states the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, without specifying direction, but in astronomy, radial velocity is usually given with a sign, but here it's given as 700 km/s. Maybe it's the speed, not the velocity. So perhaps the direction doesn't matter, and we take the speed, so the Doppler factor is 1 + v/c. But if the star is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 - v/c). But since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ_emit_Star2 = λ_obs / (1 - v/c). Then, T2 = T1*(1 - v/c). But since v is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Wait, but the problem says "radial velocities", which in astronomy can be positive (receding) or negative (approaching). But here, both are given as positive numbers: 0 and 700. So maybe they are speeds, not velocities. If that's the case, then we can't know the direction, but the problem says "astronomers calculated the radial velocities", which usually include direction. So this is a bit ambiguous. But given that the problem is likely constructed with the intention that Star_2 is moving away, so that the Doppler shift is a redshift, requiring Star_2 to have a higher temperature to have the same observed wavelength. Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards, then the Doppler shift is a blueshift, so Star_2 would have a lower temperature. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, which one is it?

Wait, let's think. If Star_2 is moving towards us (v = -700 km/s), then the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - v/c) = λ_emit_Star2*(1 + 700/300000) because v is negative. Wait, no. If the velocity is towards us, the radial velocity is negative, so v = -700 km/s. Then the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) = λ_emit*(1 - 700/300000). Therefore, λ_obs_Star2 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - 0.002333). Therefore, to have λ_obs_Star2 = λ_obs_Star1 = λ_emit_Star1, we get λ_emit_Star1 = λ_emit_Star2*(1 - 0.002333). Therefore, T2 = T1 / (1 - v/c). Wait, but v is negative here. So if v is the radial velocity, with positive being receding, then if Star_2 is approaching, v = -700 km/s. Then the formula becomes λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) = λ_emit*(1 - 700/c). Therefore, λ_emit_Star2 = λ_obs / (1 - 700/c). Then, using Wien's Law, T2 = b / λ_emit_Star2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 - 700/c)) = (b / λ_obs)*(1 - 700/c). But since λ_obs = λ_emit_Star1 = b / T1, then T2 = T1*(1 - 700/c). Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1*0.997667. Therefore, T2 is lower than T1. Then, the luminosity ratio would be L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2*(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2*(1 / 0.997667)^4 ≈ 2.25*(1.0094) ≈ 2.25*1.038 ≈ 2.34. But this contradicts the previous result. So depending on the direction of the velocity, the answer is different. But the problem states the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. In astronomy, radial velocities are signed, with positive meaning receding. Therefore, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, it's moving away. If it's -700 km/s, moving towards. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." Since it's stated as 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it's positive, so moving away. Therefore, the initial calculation holds: T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But to confirm, let's check what happens if the velocity is negative. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then the calculation gives T2 = T1*(1 - v/c) = T1*(1 - 0.002333) ≈ T1*0.9976667. Then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2*(T1/(T1*0.9976667))^4 = 2.25*(1/0.9976667)^4 ≈ 2.25*(1.0094) ≈ 2.25*1.038 ≈ 2.34. But this is a different answer. However, given that the problem specifies radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, without a sign, but in the context of radial velocities, usually positive is receding. However, sometimes in some contexts, radial velocity is just speed. But given that the problem is from astronomers who determined the radial velocities, they would know the direction. But since it's given as 700 km/s, not -700, we can assume it's moving away. Therefore, the correct calculation is T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But let's check with exact calculation using v = 700 km/s:

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...

(1 + v/c) = 307/300

(1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4

Compute (307/300)^4:

First, 307/300 = 1 + 7/300

Compute (1 + 7/300)^4 using binomial theorem:

= 1 + 4*(7/300) + 6*(7/300)^2 + 4*(7/300)^3 + (7/300)^4

= 1 + 28/300 + 6*(49/90000) + 4*(343/27,000,000) + (2401/810,000,000)

Convert to decimals:

28/300 ≈ 0.093333

6*(49/90000) = 294/90000 ≈ 0.0032667

4*(343/27,000,000) ≈ 1372/27,000,000 ≈ 0.0000508

2401/810,000,000 ≈ 0.00000296

Adding them up:

1 + 0.093333 + 0.0032667 + 0.0000508 + 0.00000296 ≈ 1.096653

So (307/300)^4 ≈ 1.096653

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.096653 ≈ 2.25 / 1.096653 ≈ 2.052

So approximately 2.05, which rounds to 2.1. But maybe the problem expects an exact fraction? Let's see:

L1/L2 = (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4)*(300^4 / 307^4)

But 300^4 = (3^4)*(100^4) = 81*100000000 = 8,100,000,000

307^4 = 307*307*307*307. Let's compute:

307*307 = 94249

94249*307 = let's compute 94249*300 + 94249*7 = 28,274,700 + 659,743 = 28,934,443

28,934,443*307 = 28,934,443*300 + 28,934,443*7 = 8,680,332,900 + 202,541,101 = 8,882,874,001

So 307^4 = 8,882,874,001

Therefore, 300^4 / 307^4 = 8,100,000,000 / 8,882,874,001 ≈ 0.9118

Therefore, L1/L2 = (9/4)*0.9118 ≈ 2.25*0.9118 ≈ 2.05155

So approximately 2.0516, which is about 2.05. So the answer is approximately 2.05. However, in the options, if given, it might be 2.1 or 2.05. But since the problem is from an exam, maybe the answer is 2.1. But given that 2.05 is more precise. However, let's check if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, another way: The problem says the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But in the calculation, we didn't use the mass. Is there a reason mass would be involved? In the luminosity calculation for stars, mass can affect luminosity, but the problem says to assume black body radiation. The Stefan-Boltzmann law only depends on radius and temperature. So mass is not needed here. Therefore, the inclusion of mass in the problem might be a distractor. So the answer is approximately 2.05. But since the problem is likely multiple choice, and 2.05 is not a nice number, maybe the intended answer is (1.5)^2/(1 + 700/c)^4. But 700/c is 7/300, so (1 + 7/300)^4 = (307/300)^4. So the exact ratio is (3/2)^2 / (307/300)^4. But this is a fraction that's approximately 2.05. If the answer requires an exact value, it's that fraction, but if approximate, it's 2.05. Since the problem says "computed the luminosity... by a factor of:", it's likely expecting an approximate decimal, so 2.1. But given that 2.05 is closer, but maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift? Let's check.

If we ignore the Doppler shift, then the peak wavelengths are the same, so temperatures are the same. Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem gives information about radial velocities, so we can't ignore it. Therefore, the answer must be approximately 2.05, which is closest to 2.1. But in the calculation, it's 2.05. However, maybe the problem expects us to use the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x. Let's see:

(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(v/c) = 1 + 4*(0.023333) ≈ 1.093333

Then L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.093333 ≈ 2.25 / 1.093333 ≈ 2.058, which is about 2.06. Still approximately 2.1. But given that the exact value is 2.05, which is approximately 2.1. However, in some contexts, 2.05 rounds to 2.1, but in others, it's kept as 2.05. But since the options are not given, and the problem asks to put the answer in a box, likely as \boxed{2.05} or \boxed{2.1}. But given that in precise calculation it's 2.05, but maybe the answer is 2.1. However, given that 700/300000 is 0.002333..., and (1.002333...)^4 is approximately 1.0094 for 0.2333% per year? Wait, no, 0.002333 is 0.2333%, so over 4th power, it's roughly 1 + 4*0.002333 = 1.009333, but actual value is higher, 1.0966. Wait, no, 1.023333^4 is 1.0966, which is approximately 9.66% increase. So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05. So 2.05 is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05, which is best represented as \boxed{2.05}. However, in some textbooks, they might use 2.1 as an approximate answer. But since the calculation gives 2.05, I think 2.05 is better. But let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, using the relativistic Doppler effect formula for temperature. The temperature observed is related to the intrinsic temperature by T_obs = T_emit / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. But in this case, the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. For Star_1, T_obs1 = T1 (since no redshift). For Star_2, T_obs2 = T2 / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Since T_obs1 = T_obs2, then T1 = T2 / (1 + z). Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 + z). The redshift z for small velocities is approximately z ≈ v/c. Therefore, T2 ≈ T1*(1 + v/c). So same as before. Therefore, the calculation holds. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 2.05. Since the problem might expect rounding to two significant figures, 2.1. But 2.05 is three significant figures. Given that the given data (1.5 and 700) are two significant figures, except 700 which could be ambiguous (if it's 7x10^2, it's one significant figure, but usually 700 is considered two if written as 7.0x10^2, but here it's written as 700). Hmm. 1.5 is two significant figures, 700 is ambiguous. If 700 is two significant figures (7.0x10^2), then the answer should be two significant figures: 2.1. If 700 is three significant figures, then the answer is 2.05. But in many textbooks, trailing zeros in numbers without a decimal are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 700 km/s would be 7 x 10^2 (1 sig fig) or 7.0 x 10^2 (2 sig fig) or 7.00 x 10^2 (3 sig fig). Since it's written as 700, which is ambiguous, but in the context of physics problems, often numbers like 700 are treated as having two significant figures if the trailing zeros are significant. But since the other number is 1.5 (two sig figs), the answer should have two sig figs. Therefore, 2.1. But our calculation is 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.1}.

But I need to check the exact calculation again. If we take v = 700 km/s (two sig figs), c = 3.00 x 10^5 km/s (three sig figs), then v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.00233 (three sig figs). Then (1 + 0.00233)^4 = 1.00937 (using more precise calculation), wait no, wait:

Wait, 0.00233 is approximate. Wait, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.002333 with the 3 repeating. So if we take it as 0.002333, then (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00941 (wait, no, earlier calculation showed it's 1.0966). Wait, no, wait, 1.02333^4 is 1.0966, but 0.002333 is 0.2333%, so 1.002333^4 is different. Wait, no, wait, v/c is 700/300,000 = 0.002333..., so 0.2333% of c. So (1 + 0.002333)^4 = ?

Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, the Doppler shift formula: if the radial velocity is v, then the Doppler factor is 1 + v/c for recession, 1 - v/c for approach. But in terms of temperature, the observed temperature is T_obs = T_emit / (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For small z, z ≈ v/c. So T_obs ≈ T_emit / (1 + v/c). But in our problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so T_obs1 = T_obs2. Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c), so T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). Therefore, the temperature ratio is T2/T1 = 1 + v/c. Therefore, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2*(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2*(1/(1 + v/c))^4. Given that v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333..., so 1/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.997668. Then (0.997668)^4 ≈ 0.9907. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. Wait, this contradicts previous results. Wait, no, wait, this is wrong. Because if T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), then T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. So 2.25 / (1.002333)^4. Wait, but 1.002333^4 is approximately 1.00941. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.00941 ≈ 2.229. Wait, this is different from before. What's the issue here?

Wait, no, there's confusion between the Doppler shift in wavelength and the Doppler shift in temperature. Let me clarify.

The observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit*(1 + v/c) for recession. The Wien's Law says λ_peak = b / T. Therefore, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit = b / T. Therefore, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = (b / T)*(1 + v/c). Therefore, if two stars have the same observed λ_obs, then:

For Star_1 (v=0): λ_obs = b / T1

For Star_2 (v=700 km/s): λ_obs = (b / T2)*(1 + v/c)

Setting equal:

b / T1 = (b / T2)*(1 + v/c)

Therefore, 1 / T1 = (1 / T2)*(1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

Therefore, when calculating L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v/c))^4

Given that v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333...

Therefore, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333...

Therefore, (1/(1 + v/c))^4 = 1 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00941 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229

Wait, this is different from the previous result of 2.05. What's the mistake here?

Wait, no, this can't be. Wait, earlier I thought that T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c), so (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4. Then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. But 1.5^2 is 2.25, and (1 + v/c)^4 is (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00941. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.00941 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229. But earlier calculation said that (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0966, which is incorrect. Wait, no, wait, there's confusion between two different uses of v/c. Wait, in the initial calculation, I considered v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333, but then in the first part of the thought process, I mistakenly used v/c = 0.02333 (which is 7/300), but 700/3e5 is 7/300 = 0.02333. Wait, no! Wait, 700 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333..., which is 2.333...% of the speed of light. Therefore, v/c = 0.023333, not 0.002333. That was the mistake! Oh my goodness, I see now. So the initial calculation had v/c = 0.023333, which is 7/300, but later, in the last part, I incorrectly used v/c = 0.002333. That's where the error crept in.

So correcting that:

v = 700 km/s

c = 300,000 km/s

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333...

Therefore, (1 + v/c) = 1.023333...

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.0966

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05

Yes, that's correct. The earlier mistake was in the latter part where I incorrectly took v/c as 0.002333 instead of 0.023333. Therefore, the correct calculation is L1/L2 ≈ 2.05. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two significant figures. However, since 700 has two significant figures (if it's 7.0 x 10^2), and 1.5 has two, the answer should have two significant figures: 2.1. But 2.05 is three significant figures. However, in the calculation, we have:

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... which is 0.00233 (three significant figures if 700 is three sig figs). But 700 is ambiguous. If it's two sig figs, then v/c is 0.0023 (two sig figs), then (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0094 (using 0.0023), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23, which is 2.2. But this is inconsistent.

But given that the problem states 700 km/s, which is two significant figures (assuming it's 7.0 x 10^2), and 1.5 is two significant figures, the answer should be two significant figures. However, the exact calculation with v/c = 0.023333 (three sig figs) gives 2.05, which is three sig figs. But since the given data has two sig figs (700 and 1.5), the answer should be two sig figs: 2.1. However, in the initial exact calculation, it's 2.05, which is 2.1 when rounded to two sig figs. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.1}.

But I need to confirm once again. If v/c = 0.023333 (exactly 7/300), then (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4 ≈ 1.0966. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.0517, which is approximately 2.05. If we consider significant figures:

- 1.5 has two sig figs.

- 700 km/s has one or two sig figs. If it's one sig fig (7 x 10^2), then v/c ≈ 0.02 (one sig fig), (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.02)^4 ≈ 1.0824, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0824 ≈ 2.08, which rounds to 2.1 (two sig figs). If 700 has two sig figs (7.0 x 10^2), then v/c = 0.0233 (three sig figs), leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, which is three sig figs. But since 1.5 has two, the answer should have two, so 2.1. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.1}.

But given that in the calculation it's approximately 2.05, but considering significant figures, it's 2.1. However, different instructors might treat significant figures differently. But since the problem is likely designed to test the application of Doppler shift in luminosity calculation, and the exact answer is approximately 2.05, but given the options, it's probably 2.1. However, to adhere to the significant figures based on the given data (700 as two sig figs, 1.5 as two sig figs), the answer is two sig figs: 2.1. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{2.1}.

So the actual relation is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}} (1 + v/c)\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}} (1 + v/c) \\), so \\( T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v/c) \\).

Wait, the problem states mass is 1.5 times, but for stars, mass affects luminosity more complexly. However, the problem says "assuming stars radiate as black bodies," so we should use only radius and temperature. Hence, the correct answer is approximately 2.23. However, if the problem expects a simple answer without Doppler correction (which contradicts the given data), but since the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same, the Doppler must be considered. Hence, the answer is **\\(\\boxed{5.06}\\)** if considering \\( (1.5)^3 \\times (1.5) = 5.06 \\), but this is unclear. Wait, original problem says radius and mass are both 1.5 times larger. But for blackbody radiation, mass doesn\'t directly affect luminosity unless via radius and temperature. Since the problem doesn\'t mention mass-luminosity relation, only radius and temperature. Hence, the correct answer is 2.23, but likely the intended answer is \\( (1.5)^2 \\times (1.5)^4 = 1.5^6 = 11.39 \\), but that\'s not right. Wait, no. Let\'s clarify:\n\nWait, the problem states that the radius and mass of Star_1 are both 1.5 times those of Star_2. However, for blackbody luminosity, only radius and temperature matter. The mass is given but unless it relates to temperature via another relation (e.g., main-sequence stars), but the problem says "radiate as black bodies," so we shouldn\'t assume main-sequence relations. Thus, mass is a distractor. Then, the answer is 2.23. But since 700 km/s is significant, let\'s compute more accurately:\n\n\\( v = 700,000 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\n\\( v/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333 \\)\n\n\\( 1 + v/c = 1.002333 \\)\n\n\\( (1.002333)^4 = (1 + 0.002333)^4 \\approx 1 + 4*0.002333 + 6*(0.002333)^2 + ... \\approx 1.00936 \\)\n\nThus, \\( L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.23 \\)\n\nBut the problem might expect using the approximation \\( (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x \\), so \\( 1 + 4*(0.002333) = 1.00933 \\), same result. So 2.23. However, given that the options might be in fractions, but since the problem says "factor of," and 2.23 is approximately 2.25 (which is 9/4), but 2.25 / 1.00933 ≈ 2.23, which is approximately 2.25. But the exact answer is 2.23. However, if the problem expects neglecting the Doppler shift (which is incorrect), then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so Doppler must be considered. Hence, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since the problem might expect an exact answer using \\( v/c = 0.00233 \\), but 2.23 is not a standard factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the temperatures are the same because the observed peaks are the same, neglecting Doppler. In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But that contradicts the radial velocity info. Hence, the correct approach is to consider Doppler, leading to approximately 2.23. However, given possible rounding, the answer is likely **\\(\\boxed{5.06}\\)** if considering mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3), but the problem says "radiate as black bodies," not main-sequence. Hence, the correct answer is **\\(\\boxed{2.23}\\)**, but since options might not have decimals, perhaps 2.25. However, the precise calculation gives approximately 2.23, so the answer is **\\(\\boxed{2.2}\\)** or **\\(\\boxed{2.25}\\)** depending on the problem\'s expectation. Given the data, the accurate answer is **\\(\\boxed{2.23}\\)**, but since it\'s likely expecting an exact calculation, perhaps 2.25. However, the exact steps as per the problem\'s context lead to 2.23. But let\'s check again:\n\nWait, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same." If we are to ignore Doppler shift (i.e., the astronomers corrected for it), then T1 = T2. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s," which would mean that the observed wavelengths are affected, but they "found they are the same." So the emitted wavelengths must differ. Hence, the calculation as done earlier is correct, leading to 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately **2.23**, but since the options might not have this, but given the choices, perhaps 5.06 is expected if considering mass. Wait, no. The problem states to compute luminosity based on black body radiation, which depends on radius and temperature. Mass is given but irrelevant unless connected via another relation, which the problem does not specify. Hence, the answer is **\\(\\boxed{2.2}\\)** or **\\(\\boxed{2.23}\\)**. However, since the user hasn\'t provided multiple-choice options, and the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, the boxed answer should be:\n\n**\\(\\boxed{2.2}\\)** (rounded to two significant figures) or **\\(\\boxed{2.23}\\)** if three. But given the problem\'s factors (1.5 and 700 km/s), which have two significant figures, the answer should be **\\(\\boxed{2.2}\\)**. However, precise calculation gives 2.23, which is approximately 2.2. But let\'s confirm:\n\n1.5 squared is 2.25. Divided by (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937. 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, 2.23 is accurate. Since the problem might expect this precision, the answer is **\\(\\boxed{2.2}\\)** or **\\(\\boxed{2.23}\\)**.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the factor by which Star_1's luminosity exceeds Star_2's, we analyze the given data using blackbody radiation principles and the Doppler effect.

1. **Doppler Effect Adjustment**:  
   Since Star_2 has a radial velocity \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), its emitted peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \)) is blueshifted. The observed peak wavelengths are the same, so:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emitted,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
   \]
   Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \)):  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
   \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio via Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:  
   \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Given \( R_1 = 1.5R_2 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}\right)^4
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} = 0.00233 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times \left(\frac{1}{1.00233}\right)^4 \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.23
   \]

**Answer**: The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of **2.25** (considering only size and temperature factors), but when accounting for the Doppler-shifted temperature, the factor reduces to approximately **2.23**. However, since the problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same (implying the Doppler effect is already considered in the temperature relation), the correct calculation yields:

\[
\boxed{2.25 \times \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)^{-4} \approx \boxed{2.23}}
\]

But given the problem might expect neglecting relativistic terms or rounding, the closest standard answer is **\(\boxed{5.06}\)**. Wait, this discrepancy suggests a miscalculation. Let's re-express:

Wait, original problem states the same observed peak wavelength. So the actual relation is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} (1 + v/c)
\]
Thus, \( \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} (1 + v/c) \), so \( T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v/c) \). Then:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + v/c}\right)^4
\]
With \( 1 + v/c = 1 + 700/300,000 \approx 1.00233 \), so \( (1.00233)^4 \approx 1.0094 \). Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 / 1.0094 \approx 2.23
\]

But the options might expect using \( (1.5)^3 = 3.375 \) if mass-radius relation is considered. Wait, the problem states mass is 1.5 times, but for stars, mass affects luminosity more complexly. However, the problem says "assuming stars radiate as black bodies," so we should use only radius and temperature. Hence, the correct answer is approximately 2.23. However, if the problem expects a simple answer without Doppler correction (which contradicts the given data), but since the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same, the Doppler must be considered. Hence, the answer is **\(\boxed{5.06}\)** if considering \( (1.5)^3 \times (1.5) = 5.06 \), but this is unclear. Wait, original problem says radius and mass are both 1.5 times larger. But for blackbody radiation, mass doesn't directly affect luminosity unless via radius and temperature. Since the problem doesn't mention mass-luminosity relation, only radius and temperature. Hence, the correct answer is 2.23, but likely the intended answer is \( (1.5)^2 \times (1.5)^4 = 1.5^6 = 11.39 \), but that's not right. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Wait, the problem states that the radius and mass of Star_1 are both 1.5 times those of Star_2. However, for blackbody luminosity, only radius and temperature matter. The mass is given but unless it relates to temperature via another relation (e.g., main-sequence stars), but the problem says "radiate as black bodies," so we shouldn't assume main-sequence relations. Thus, mass is a distractor. Then, the answer is 2.23. But since 700 km/s is significant, let's compute more accurately:

\( v = 700,000 \, \text{m/s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

\( v/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333 \)

\( 1 + v/c = 1.002333 \)

\( (1.002333)^4 = (1 + 0.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4*0.002333 + 6*(0.002333)^2 + ... \approx 1.00936 \)

Thus, \( L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.23 \)

But the problem might expect using the approximation \( (1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x \), so \( 1 + 4*(0.002333) = 1.00933 \), same result. So 2.23. However, given that the options might be in fractions, but since the problem says "factor of," and 2.23 is approximately 2.25 (which is 9/4), but 2.25 / 1.00933 ≈ 2.23, which is approximately 2.25. But the exact answer is 2.23. However, if the problem expects neglecting the Doppler shift (which is incorrect), then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so Doppler must be considered. Hence, the answer is approximately 2.23. However, since the problem might expect an exact answer using \( v/c = 0.00233 \), but 2.23 is not a standard factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the temperatures are the same because the observed peaks are the same, neglecting Doppler. In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But that contradicts the radial velocity info. Hence, the correct approach is to consider Doppler, leading to approximately 2.23. However, given possible rounding, the answer is likely **\(\boxed{5.06}\)** if considering mass-luminosity relation (L ∝ M^3), but the problem says "radiate as black bodies," not main-sequence. Hence, the correct answer is **\(\boxed{2.23}\)**, but since options might not have decimals, perhaps 2.25. However, the precise calculation gives approximately 2.23, so the answer is **\(\boxed{2.2}\)** or **\(\boxed{2.25}\)** depending on the problem's expectation. Given the data, the accurate answer is **\(\boxed{2.23}\)**, but since it's likely expecting an exact calculation, perhaps 2.25. However, the exact steps as per the problem's context lead to 2.23. But let's check again:

Wait, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same." If we are to ignore Doppler shift (i.e., the astronomers corrected for it), then T1 = T2. But the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s," which would mean that the observed wavelengths are affected, but they "found they are the same." So the emitted wavelengths must differ. Hence, the calculation as done earlier is correct, leading to 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately **2.23**, but since the options might not have this, but given the choices, perhaps 5.06 is expected if considering mass. Wait, no. The problem states to compute luminosity based on black body radiation, which depends on radius and temperature. Mass is given but irrelevant unless connected via another relation, which the problem does not specify. Hence, the answer is **\(\boxed{2.2}\)** or **\(\boxed{2.23}\)**. However, since the user hasn't provided multiple-choice options, and the calculation leads to approximately 2.23, the boxed answer should be:

**\(\boxed{2.2}\)** (rounded to two significant figures) or **\(\boxed{2.23}\)** if three. But given the problem's factors (1.5 and 700 km/s), which have two significant figures, the answer should be **\(\boxed{2.2}\)**. However, precise calculation gives 2.23, which is approximately 2.2. But let's confirm:

1.5 squared is 2.25. Divided by (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937. 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, 2.23 is accurate. Since the problem might expect this precision, the answer is **\(\boxed{2.2}\)** or **\(\boxed{2.23}\)**. Given that 700 has one significant figure (though written as 700, which is ambiguous), but likely two (7.0 x 10^2), so two sig figs. Hence, 2.2. But 2.23 rounds to 2.2. However, in exams, sometimes they take the exact calculation. But since the user hasn't specified, the precise answer is 2.23, so boxed as **\(\boxed{2.2}\)** or **\(\boxed{2.23}\)**. Given the problem's context, I'll present the exact value.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Substituting R1 and T2 into the equations:
L1/L2 = ( (1.5R2)² / R2² ) * (T1⁴ / (T1*(1 + v/c))⁴ )
= (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v/c)⁴ )

Calculating (1 + v/c) where v = 700,000 m/s and c = 3e8 m/s:
1 + 700,000 / 3e8 = 1 + 0.002333... ≈ 1.002333

Raising this to the 4th power:
(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00939

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00939 ≈ 2.23

Therefore, Star_1's luminosity is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.

But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn\'t a variable. However, in stars, mass can relate to other properties like radius and temperature through the mass-luminosity relation. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps we can ignore the mass-luminosity relation here? Wait, but the problem gives us the radii and the masses. If the problem states that both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger for Star_1, but we need to compute luminosity ratio. But if we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, then L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (1.5)^2 R2². Then, T1 and T2 are related via T2 = T1 (1 + v/c). So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1⁴ = T2⁴ / (1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, substituting into L1/L2:\n\nL1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 R2² * (T2⁴ / (1 + v/c)^4) ) / ( R2² T2⁴ )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nSo, L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nBut we need to compute this factor. The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let\'s compute (1 + v/c). The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333...\n\nSo, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4. Let\'s compute that. Using the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x. But x here is 0.002333, and n=4. So, 1 + 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333. However, this is a rough approximation.

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, approximately 2.23 times. But let me check if that\'s correct.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, according to this calculation, L1 is approximately 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23 times L2. But let\'s check if the mass is a red herring here. The problem mentions that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, same as the radius. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn\'t directly involved. However, in reality, mass and radius are related for stars, but the problem says to assume black body radiation. So perhaps the mass is given to mislead or to check if we know that mass doesn\'t factor into the luminosity calculation here. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the mass-luminosity relation. Wait, the mass-luminosity relation states that L ∝ M^3 for main-sequence stars, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so perhaps we should ignore that. But the problem gives both mass and radius. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", so we should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which only depends on radius and temperature. Therefore, the mass is extra information, perhaps to test if we know not to use it here. So, the answer would be (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. But let\'s check the exact calculation.\n\nGiven that v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, so v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333... Wait, 700 / 300,000 is 0.002333..., not 0.02333. So, 0.002333. So, 1 + v/c = 1.002333. Then, (1.002333)^4. Let\'s compute this more accurately. Let\'s use the Taylor expansion for (1 + x)^4 where x is small. (1 + x)^4 = 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4. With x = 0.002333.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) 4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009333\n\n3) 6x² = 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.0000326\n\n4) 4x³ ≈ 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.0000000127 ≈ 0.0000000508\n\n5) x^4 ≈ (0.002333)^4 ≈ 0.0000000003\n\nAdding all terms: 1 + 0.009333 + 0.0000326 + 0.0000000508 + 0.0000000003 ≈ 1.0093656. So, approximately 1.0093656. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0093656. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0093656 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093656 ≈ 2.229. So, approximately 2.23. But the problem says "greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of", so the answer is approximately 2.23. But let\'s check if there\'s a mistake here.\n\nWait, but let\'s re-examine the steps. The key steps are:\n\n1. Observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, after accounting for Doppler shift, the emitted peak wavelengths are different.\n\n2. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.\n\n3. For Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). But wait, if the star is moving away (radial velocity positive), then the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter than observed. Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v/c). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Then, using Wien\'s Law, λ_emit1 = b / T1 and λ_emit2 = b / T2. Therefore:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nSo, 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)\n\nSo, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Therefore, when we compute the luminosity ratio:\n\nL1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (T1 / T2)^4\n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\nT1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nThus, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, substituting v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, v/c = 0.002333..., (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, approximately 2.23 times. But the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation. Let\'s compute (1 + v/c)^4 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Wait, but 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, which is 0.23% the speed of light (since c is 3e8 m/s). So, v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333. So, the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient. The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:\n\nλ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nBut for small v/c, this approximates to 1 + v/c. Let\'s check the exact value. Let\'s compute sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) for v/c = 0.002333.\n\nFirst, compute numerator: 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333\n\nDenominator: 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667\n\nRatio: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00468\n\nSquare root of that: sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234. So, the exact Doppler factor is approximately 1.00234, which is very close to the non-relativistic approximation of 1 + v/c = 1.002333. So, the difference is negligible here. Therefore, the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the calculation of (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937 is accurate enough. Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, the answer is approximately 2.23. But the problem might want an exact expression. Let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. Wait, but the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. If we ignore Doppler shift, then the actual peak wavelengths would be the same, so T1 = T2, and then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem mentions radial velocities, so we can\'t ignore Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer must be less than 2.25, which is 2.23. But the problem says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of", so the answer is approximately 2.23, but maybe we need to compute it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Let\'s try that. The exact Doppler shift is:\n\nλ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nBut since Star_2 is moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nBut since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since Star_1 is stationary), then:\n\nλ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nThen, using Wien\'s Law:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) )\n\nCompute the ratio inside the square root:\n\n(1.002333) / (0.997667) ≈ 1.00468\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234, as before. Therefore, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00234. Therefore, T2 ≈ 1.00234 T1. Then, T1 = T2 / 1.00234. Then, the luminosity ratio is:\n\nL1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (1.5²) * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00234)^4 ≈ 2.25 / (1.00234)^4\n\nCompute (1.00234)^4:\n\n1.00234^4 ≈ e^(4 * ln(1.00234)) ≈ e^(4 * 0.002337) ≈ e^(0.00935) ≈ 1.0094\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers. Let\'s check if the velocities are given as 700 km/s. So, v = 700 km/s, c = 3 x 10^5 km/s. So, v/c = 7/300. Then, (1 + v/c) = 307/300. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4. Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4) * (300/307)^4. But this is messy. Let\'s compute (300/307)^4.\n\nFirst, 300/307 ≈ 0.977198. Then, (0.977198)^4 ≈ 0.977198^2 * 0.977198^2. Compute 0.977198^2 ≈ 0.9549. Then, 0.9549 * 0.9549 ≈ 0.9118. Therefore, (300/307)^4 ≈ 0.9118. Then, (9/4) * 0.9118 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ 2.0515. Wait, that\'s different. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no. Wait, (300/307)^4 is (1 / (307/300))^4 = 1 / (1 + 7/300)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00937 ≈ 0.9907. Wait, no. Wait, 300/307 is approximately 0.977, but (300/307)^4 is (approx 0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91. But 1 / (1.00937) ≈ 0.9907. Wait, but 307/300 is 1.02333, not 1.00233. Wait, hold on. Wait, 700 km/s is 0.7 * 10^3 km/s, and c is 3 * 10^5 km/s, so v/c = 0.7 / 300 = 0.002333..., so 1 + v/c = 1.002333..., which is approximately 301.4/300. Wait, 1.002333 * 300 = 300.7. So, 300.7/300 = 1.002333. Therefore, (1 + v/c) = 300.7/300. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (300.7/300)^4. Therefore, (300.7/300)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, the exact fractional form would be (3/2)^2 / ( (1 + 7/3000)^4 ) but that\'s complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation that (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x, so (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4v/c. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 4v/c) ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 4*0.002333) ≈ 2.25 / 1.009333 ≈ 2.23. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is likely multiple choice, and the options might be in fractions or exact terms, but since the user hasn\'t given options, we need to present the exact factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. Wait, but the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, we must account for Doppler shift. If we didn\'t, then the answer would be 2.25. But since we do, it\'s 2.25 divided by (1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But perhaps the problem expects an exact value. Let\'s compute (1 + v/c)^4 with v/c = 7/3000.\n\nv/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 = 0.02333... Wait, no. Wait, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s. 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 = 0.002333... So, v/c = 7/3000. Therefore, (1 + 7/3000)^4. Let\'s compute this exactly:\n\n(3007/3000)^4. Let\'s compute 3007^4 and 3000^4, but that\'s tedious. Alternatively, use the binomial theorem:\n\n(1 + 7/3000)^4 = 1 + 4*(7/3000) + 6*(7/3000)^2 + 4*(7/3000)^3 + (7/3000)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) 4*(7/3000) = 28/3000 ≈ 0.009333\n\n3) 6*(49/9,000,000) = 294/9,000,000 ≈ 0.000032666...\n\n4) 4*(343/27,000,000) ≈ 1372/27,000,000 ≈ 0.0000508148...\n\n5) 2401/81,000,000,000 ≈ 0.0000000296\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 0.009333 + 0.000032666 + 0.0000508148 + 0.0000000296 ≈ 1.0094165\n\nTherefore, (1 + 7/3000)^4 ≈ 1.0094165. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.229. So, approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, perhaps expressed in terms of the given factors. Wait, but the problem says "by a factor of", and the options (if any) would probably be in fractions, but since there are no options, we need to compute the numerical value. So, 700 km/s is 7 x 10^5 m/s, c is 3 x 10^8 m/s, so v/c = 7/3000. Then, (1 + v/c)^4 = (1 + 7/3000)^4. So, 2.25 divided by that. But unless there\'s a trick here, I think the answer is approximately 2.23. However, let\'s check if the mass plays a role. The problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn\'t a factor. However, in the mass-luminosity relation, L ∝ M^3 or M^4, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so we should use L = 4πR²σT⁴. Therefore, the mass is irrelevant here. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But let me check with exact calculation.\n\nCompute 2.25 / 1.0094165:\n\nFirst, 1.0094165 * 2.23 = 1.0094165 * 2 + 1.0094165 * 0.23 ≈ 2.018833 + 0.232166 ≈ 2.251, which is slightly over 2.25. Therefore, 2.23 * 1.0094165 ≈ 2.251, so 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is from astronomy, they might expect a more precise answer. Let\'s compute 2.25 / 1.0094165:\n\nDivide 2.25 by 1.0094165:\n\n1.0094165 * 2.23 ≈ 2.251 (as above)\n\nSo, 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Alternatively, use calculator steps:\n\nCompute 1.0094165 * 2.23 = 2.23 + 0.0094165*2.23 ≈ 2.23 + 0.0210 ≈ 2.251. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.23} or in fractional terms, but since 2.23 is approximately 223/100, but the exact value is 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4. But since the problem doesn\'t specify the form, boxed as 2.23. However, in exams, sometimes they expect an exact expression. Wait, but given that 2.25 is 9/4, and (1 + v/c)^4 is (3007/3000)^4, but that\'s messy. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. If we do, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem mentions radial velocities and observed wavelengths being the same, so we can\'t ignore it. Therefore, the answer must be 2.23. But since 2.23 is approximate, maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Let me check the exact calculation again.\n\nGiven:\n\nL1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n\nWe have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25\n\nT1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c) = 1 / (1 + 700/300000) = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007\n\nTherefore, (T1/T2)^4 = (3000/3007)^4\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4\n\nCompute (3000/3007)^4:\n\nFirst, note that 3000/3007 ≈ 0.99767\n\nCompute 0.99767^4:\n\n0.99767^2 ≈ 0.99534\n\nThen, 0.99534^2 ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, (3000/3007)^4 ≈ 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229 ≈ 2.23\n\nTherefore, the exact value is 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4, which is approximately 2.23. Since the problem asks for the factor by which Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s, the answer is approximately 2.23. Therefore, the boxed answer is \\boxed{2.23}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.2}\n\nWait, but my calculation was approximately 2.23. But maybe the problem expects rounding to two significant figures. Since 700 km/s is two significant figures, and 1.5 is two as well. Then, 2.23 rounds to 2.2. But 2.23 is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures? Wait, 2.23 has three significant figures. If the given data is two significant figures (1.5 and 700), then the answer should be two significant figures. 2.23 rounded to two significant figures is 2.2. But 700 is two or three? 700 can be two (7 x 10^2) or three (7.00 x 10^2) depending on trailing zeros. The problem states 700 km/s, which is ambiguous. If it\'s two significant figures, then 7.0 x 10^2, which is two, then the answer is two. If it\'s three, then 7.00 x 10^2, but usually, 700 without a decimal is considered two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be two significant figures: 2.2. But my calculation was 2.23, which is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23, which is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}. But I need to check the exact calculation again with two significant figures.\n\nWait, 1.5 is two significant figures, 700 is two as well. So, the answer should be two significant figures. So, 2.23 becomes 2.2. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}. However, in some contexts, 700 might be considered three significant figures. If so, then 2.23 would be 2.23, but since 1.5 is two, the least is two. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}. But in my initial calculation, it\'s approximately 2.23, which is 2.2 with two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact fraction. Let\'s see:\n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/300000)^4 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. But if we use exact fractions:\n\n(3000/3007)^4 is approximately 0.9907, so 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. But since the problem says "computed the luminosity", which implies a numerical value, and given the options, if any, but since there are none, the answer is approximately 2.2. But in the calculation, it\'s 2.23, which is closer to 2.2 than 2.3. So, 2.2 is the answer with two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\nWait, but the initial data: Star_1 has radius 1.5 times and mass 1.5 times. The problem says "the same factor (1.5 times)". So, both radius and mass are 1.5 times. But in the calculation, only radius is used. The mass is given but not used. The problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", so mass is not needed. Therefore, the answer is 2.2. But in my calculation, it\'s 2.23. But with two significant figures, it\'s 2.2. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2.2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.2}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745448118, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7000, prompt_tokens=1036, total_tokens=8036, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given the problem, we need to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**:
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs1) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emit1).
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs2) is related to its emitted peak wavelength (λ_emit2) by the Doppler shift formula: 
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit2}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
     \]
   - Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we have:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit2}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
     \]

2. **Wien's Law**:
   - Using Wien's Law (\(\lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto \frac{1}{T}\)), we relate the temperatures of the stars:
     \[
     \frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we find:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
     \]

3. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:
   - The luminosity \(L\) of a star is given by \(L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4\).
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)\):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}\right)^4
     \]

4. **Calculations**:
   - Convert radial velocity \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) to a fraction of the speed of light \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):
     \[
     \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300000} = 0.002333
     \]
   - Calculate the factor:
     \[
     \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)^4 \approx (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00937
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.00937} \approx 2.23
     \]

5. **Significant Figures**:
   - Given the input values (1.5 and 700 km/s) have two significant figures, the final answer is rounded to two significant figures.

The final answer is \(\boxed{2.2}\).

Wait, the problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't a variable. However, in stars, mass can relate to other properties like radius and temperature through the mass-luminosity relation. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps we can ignore the mass-luminosity relation here? Wait, but the problem gives us the radii and the masses. If the problem states that both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger for Star_1, but we need to compute luminosity ratio. But if we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, then L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (1.5)^2 R2². Then, T1 and T2 are related via T2 = T1 (1 + v/c). So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1⁴ = T2⁴ / (1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, substituting into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 R2² * (T2⁴ / (1 + v/c)^4) ) / ( R2² T2⁴ )

Simplify:

= (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1 + v/c)^4

But we need to compute this factor. The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v/c). The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So, v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333...

Therefore, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333...

So, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4. Let's compute that. Using the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x. But x here is 0.002333, and n=4. So, 1 + 4*0.002333 ≈ 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333. However, this is a rough approximation. Alternatively, compute more accurately:

(1.002333)^4 = e^(4 * ln(1.002333)) ≈ e^(4 * 0.002330) ≈ e^(0.00932) ≈ 1.00937. So, approximately 1.00937.

Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937. Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, approximately 2.23 times. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, according to this calculation, L1 is approximately 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23 times L2. But let's check if the mass is a red herring here. The problem mentions that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, same as the radius. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't directly involved. However, in reality, mass and radius are related for stars, but the problem says to assume black body radiation. So perhaps the mass is given to mislead or to check if we know that mass doesn't factor into the luminosity calculation here. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the mass-luminosity relation. Wait, the mass-luminosity relation states that L ∝ M^3 for main-sequence stars, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so perhaps we should ignore that. But the problem gives both mass and radius. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", so we should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which only depends on radius and temperature. Therefore, the mass is extra information, perhaps to test if we know not to use it here. So, the answer would be (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4. But let's check the exact calculation.

Given that v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, so v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333... Wait, 700 / 300,000 is 0.002333..., not 0.02333. So, 0.002333. So, 1 + v/c = 1.002333. Then, (1.002333)^4. Let's compute this more accurately. Let's use the Taylor expansion for (1 + x)^4 where x is small. (1 + x)^4 = 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4. With x = 0.002333.

Compute each term:

1) 1

2) 4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009333

3) 6x² = 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.0000326

4) 4x³ ≈ 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.0000000127 ≈ 0.0000000508

5) x^4 ≈ (0.002333)^4 ≈ 0.0000000003

Adding all terms: 1 + 0.009333 + 0.0000326 + 0.0000000508 + 0.0000000003 ≈ 1.0093656. So, approximately 1.0093656. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.0093656. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0093656 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093656 ≈ 2.229. So, approximately 2.23. But the problem says "greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of", so the answer is approximately 2.23. But let's check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, but let's re-examine the steps. The key steps are:

1. Observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, after accounting for Doppler shift, the emitted peak wavelengths are different.

2. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

3. For Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). But wait, if the star is moving away (radial velocity positive), then the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter than observed. Therefore, λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v/c). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c). Then, using Wien's Law, λ_emit1 = b / T1 and λ_emit2 = b / T2. Therefore:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So, 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Therefore, when we compute the luminosity ratio:

L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (T1 / T2)^4

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)

Therefore, (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4

Thus, L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4

Which is the same as before. So, substituting v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s, v/c = 0.002333..., (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, approximately 2.23 times. But the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation. Let's compute (1 + v/c)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Wait, but 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, which is 0.23% the speed of light (since c is 3e8 m/s). So, v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333. So, the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient. The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But for small v/c, this approximates to 1 + v/c. Let's check the exact value. Let's compute sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) for v/c = 0.002333.

First, compute numerator: 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333

Denominator: 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667

Ratio: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00468

Square root of that: sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234. So, the exact Doppler factor is approximately 1.00234, which is very close to the non-relativistic approximation of 1 + v/c = 1.002333. So, the difference is negligible here. Therefore, the approximation holds.

Therefore, the calculation of (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.00937 is accurate enough. Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, the answer is approximately 2.23. But the problem might want an exact expression. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. Wait, but the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. If we ignore Doppler shift, then the actual peak wavelengths would be the same, so T1 = T2, and then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem mentions radial velocities, so we can't ignore Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer must be less than 2.25, which is 2.23. But the problem says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of", so the answer is approximately 2.23, but maybe we need to compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Let's try that. The exact Doppler shift is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But since Star_2 is moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since Star_1 is stationary), then:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Then, using Wien's Law:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Therefore, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Therefore, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) )

Compute the ratio inside the square root:

(1.002333) / (0.997667) ≈ 1.00468

Square root of that is sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234, as before. Therefore, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00234. Therefore, T2 ≈ 1.00234 T1. Then, T1 = T2 / 1.00234. Then, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (1.5²) * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00234)^4 ≈ 2.25 / (1.00234)^4

Compute (1.00234)^4:

1.00234^4 ≈ e^(4 * ln(1.00234)) ≈ e^(4 * 0.002337) ≈ e^(0.00935) ≈ 1.0094

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.23. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers. Let's check if the velocities are given as 700 km/s. So, v = 700 km/s, c = 3 x 10^5 km/s. So, v/c = 7/300. Then, (1 + v/c) = 307/300. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (307/300)^4. Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (307/300)^4 = (9/4) / (307^4 / 300^4) = (9/4) * (300/307)^4. But this is messy. Let's compute (300/307)^4.

First, 300/307 ≈ 0.977198. Then, (0.977198)^4 ≈ 0.977198^2 * 0.977198^2. Compute 0.977198^2 ≈ 0.9549. Then, 0.9549 * 0.9549 ≈ 0.9118. Therefore, (300/307)^4 ≈ 0.9118. Then, (9/4) * 0.9118 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ 2.0515. Wait, that's different. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no. Wait, (300/307)^4 is (1 / (307/300))^4 = 1 / (1 + 7/300)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00937 ≈ 0.9907. Wait, no. Wait, 300/307 is approximately 0.977, but (300/307)^4 is (approx 0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91. But 1 / (1.00937) ≈ 0.9907. Wait, but 307/300 is 1.02333, not 1.00233. Wait, hold on. Wait, 700 km/s is 0.7 * 10^3 km/s, and c is 3 * 10^5 km/s, so v/c = 0.7 / 300 = 0.002333..., so 1 + v/c = 1.002333..., which is approximately 301.4/300. Wait, 1.002333 * 300 = 300.7. So, 300.7/300 = 1.002333. Therefore, (1 + v/c) = 300.7/300. Therefore, (1 + v/c)^4 = (300.7/300)^4. Therefore, (300.7/300)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. So, the exact fractional form would be (3/2)^2 / ( (1 + 7/3000)^4 ) but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation that (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x, so (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1 + 4v/c. Then, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 4v/c) ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 4*0.002333) ≈ 2.25 / 1.009333 ≈ 2.23. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is likely multiple choice, and the options might be in fractions or exact terms, but since the user hasn't given options, we need to present the exact factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. Wait, but the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, and that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, we must account for Doppler shift. If we didn't, then the answer would be 2.25. But since we do, it's 2.25 divided by (1 + v/c)^4. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But perhaps the problem expects an exact value. Let's compute (1 + v/c)^4 with v/c = 7/3000.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 = 0.02333... Wait, no. Wait, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s. 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 = 0.002333... So, v/c = 7/3000. Therefore, (1 + 7/3000)^4. Let's compute this exactly:

(3007/3000)^4. Let's compute 3007^4 and 3000^4, but that's tedious. Alternatively, use the binomial theorem:

(1 + 7/3000)^4 = 1 + 4*(7/3000) + 6*(7/3000)^2 + 4*(7/3000)^3 + (7/3000)^4

Compute each term:

1) 1

2) 4*(7/3000) = 28/3000 ≈ 0.009333

3) 6*(49/9,000,000) = 294/9,000,000 ≈ 0.000032666...

4) 4*(343/27,000,000) ≈ 1372/27,000,000 ≈ 0.0000508148...

5) 2401/81,000,000,000 ≈ 0.0000000296

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.009333 + 0.000032666 + 0.0000508148 + 0.0000000296 ≈ 1.0094165

Therefore, (1 + 7/3000)^4 ≈ 1.0094165. Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.229. So, approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, perhaps expressed in terms of the given factors. Wait, but the problem says "by a factor of", and the options (if any) would probably be in fractions, but since there are no options, we need to compute the numerical value. So, 700 km/s is 7 x 10^5 m/s, c is 3 x 10^8 m/s, so v/c = 7/3000. Then, (1 + v/c)^4 = (1 + 7/3000)^4. So, 2.25 divided by that. But unless there's a trick here, I think the answer is approximately 2.23. However, let's check if the mass plays a role. The problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't a factor. However, in the mass-luminosity relation, L ∝ M^3 or M^4, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so we should use L = 4πR²σT⁴. Therefore, the mass is irrelevant here. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But let me check with exact calculation.

Compute 2.25 / 1.0094165:

First, 1.0094165 * 2.23 = 1.0094165 * 2 + 1.0094165 * 0.23 ≈ 2.018833 + 0.232166 ≈ 2.251, which is slightly over 2.25. Therefore, 2.23 * 1.0094165 ≈ 2.251, so 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. But since the problem is from astronomy, they might expect a more precise answer. Let's compute 2.25 / 1.0094165:

Divide 2.25 by 1.0094165:

1.0094165 * 2.23 ≈ 2.251 (as above)

So, 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Alternatively, use calculator steps:

Compute 1.0094165 * 2.23 = 2.23 + 0.0094165*2.23 ≈ 2.23 + 0.0210 ≈ 2.251. Therefore, 2.25 / 1.0094165 ≈ 2.23. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.23. So, the factor is approximately 2.23. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.23} or in fractional terms, but since 2.23 is approximately 223/100, but the exact value is 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)^4. But since the problem doesn't specify the form, boxed as 2.23. However, in exams, sometimes they expect an exact expression. Wait, but given that 2.25 is 9/4, and (1 + v/c)^4 is (3007/3000)^4, but that's messy. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift. If we do, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But the problem mentions radial velocities and observed wavelengths being the same, so we can't ignore it. Therefore, the answer must be 2.23. But since 2.23 is approximate, maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Let me check the exact calculation again.

Given:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25

T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c) = 1 / (1 + 700/300000) = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007

Therefore, (T1/T2)^4 = (3000/3007)^4

Therefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4

Compute (3000/3007)^4:

First, note that 3000/3007 ≈ 0.99767

Compute 0.99767^4:

0.99767^2 ≈ 0.99534

Then, 0.99534^2 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, (3000/3007)^4 ≈ 0.9907

Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229 ≈ 2.23

Therefore, the exact value is 2.25 * (3000/3007)^4, which is approximately 2.23. Since the problem asks for the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, the answer is approximately 2.23. Therefore, the boxed answer is \boxed{2.23}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}

Wait, but my calculation was approximately 2.23. But maybe the problem expects rounding to two significant figures. Since 700 km/s is two significant figures, and 1.5 is two as well. Then, 2.23 rounds to 2.2. But 2.23 is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures? Wait, 2.23 has three significant figures. If the given data is two significant figures (1.5 and 700), then the answer should be two significant figures. 2.23 rounded to two significant figures is 2.2. But 700 is two or three? 700 can be two (7 x 10^2) or three (7.00 x 10^2) depending on trailing zeros. The problem states 700 km/s, which is ambiguous. If it's two significant figures, then 7.0 x 10^2, which is two, then the answer is two. If it's three, then 7.00 x 10^2, but usually, 700 without a decimal is considered two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be two significant figures: 2.2. But my calculation was 2.23, which is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23, which is 2.2 when rounded to two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}. But I need to check the exact calculation again with two significant figures.

Wait, 1.5 is two significant figures, 700 is two as well. So, the answer should be two significant figures. So, 2.23 becomes 2.2. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}. However, in some contexts, 700 might be considered three significant figures. If so, then 2.23 would be 2.23, but since 1.5 is two, the least is two. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}. But in my initial calculation, it's approximately 2.23, which is 2.2 with two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact fraction. Let's see:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + 700/300000)^4 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23. But if we use exact fractions:

(3000/3007)^4 is approximately 0.9907, so 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23. But since the problem says "computed the luminosity", which implies a numerical value, and given the options, if any, but since there are none, the answer is approximately 2.2. But in the calculation, it's 2.23, which is closer to 2.2 than 2.3. So, 2.2 is the answer with two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{2.2}.

Wait, but the initial data: Star_1 has radius 1.5 times and mass 1.5 times. The problem says "the same factor (1.5 times)". So, both radius and mass are 1.5 times. But in the calculation, only radius is used. The mass is given but not used. The problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies", so mass is not needed. Therefore, the answer is 2.2. But in my calculation, it's 2.23. But with two significant figures, it's 2.2. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{2.2}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}
