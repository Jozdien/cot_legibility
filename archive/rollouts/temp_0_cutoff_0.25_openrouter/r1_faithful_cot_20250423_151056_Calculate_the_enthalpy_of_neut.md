To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \rightarrow 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **H₂SO₄:** \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \rightarrow 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}\) (since each H₂SO₄ provides 2 H⁺)
   - **Total H⁺:** \(0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol}\)

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** \(0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\) (since each Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻)

3. **Determine limiting reagent and moles of H₂O formed:**
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is 1:1. Here, OH⁻ is the limiting reagent with 0.2 mol.
   - **Moles of H₂O formed:** \(0.2 \, \text{mol}\)

4. **Calculate enthalpy of neutralization:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is \(-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}\) of H₂O formed.
   - **Total enthalpy change:** \(0.2 \, \text{mol} \times -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}\)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{-11.4\ \text{kJ}}

Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid and a base react to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ per mole of water formed, but I think that's for strong acids and bases. Since HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are all strong, maybe that applies here. But first, I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture to see if they neutralize each other completely or if there's a limiting reagent.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each acid and base. For HCl: it's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl has one H+ per molecule, that's 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and since it's strong, both protons are released. The concentration is 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28 mol and OH- is 0.2 mol. Hmm, so the H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol. But wait, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1, right? So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted. But the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated based on the moles of water formed, which would be equal to the moles of OH- (since it's the limiting reagent here). So the moles of water formed are 0.2 mol.

But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. If the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, then each mole of this reaction gives ΔH of -57 kJ. So if 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, then the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the problem says "enthalpy of neutralization"—is that the total enthalpy change, or per mole? The question is a bit ambiguous. But usually, when asked for the enthalpy of neutralization, it's the total heat released, unless specified otherwise. But maybe they want it in kJ per mole? Let me check the question again.

The question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when..." followed by the volumes and concentrations. So maybe they want the total enthalpy change for the reaction that occurs when these solutions are mixed. Since only 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, the total enthalpy would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ (0.28) vs OH- (0.2). The OH- is limiting, so 0.2 mol H2O formed. Therefore, the enthalpy of neutralization is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But wait, sometimes enthalpy of neutralization is expressed per mole of acid or base. Wait, no, the standard enthalpy is per mole of water formed. So if 0.2 moles of water are formed, then total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's the total heat released. But the question says "enthalpy of neutralization"—if they are asking for the molar value, it's -57 kJ/mol, but given the context of mixing specific amounts, they probably want the total. But maybe the question is phrased as "enthalpy of neutralization" in general, but when solutions are mixed, so the total heat released. Let me check units. If the answer is in kJ, then -11.4 kJ. If per mole, then -57 kJ/mol. But given that the question provides specific quantities, they probably want the total. So the answer is -11.4 kJ. But let me check if there's any other reaction happening. For example, Ba(OH)2 reacting with H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is H+ and SO4^2-, and Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ and OH-. When mixed, the H+ and OH- react to form water, and also Ba^2+ and SO4^2- might form BaSO4 precipitate. Wait, but BaSO4 is a precipitate. So maybe there's another reaction here. Oh, right! If H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they can form BaSO4, which is a solid. So the neutralization might involve not just H+ + OH- → H2O, but also the precipitation of BaSO4. So the total enthalpy change would include both the heat from neutralization and the heat from precipitation. But the problem says "enthalpy of neutralization", which typically refers to the acid-base reaction forming water. However, in the case of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O

So this reaction produces both water and a precipitate. The enthalpy change for this reaction would include the neutralization of two H+ and two OH- to make two H2O, and the formation of BaSO4. But the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually just for H+ + OH- → H2O, which is -57 kJ/mol. However, if a precipitate forms, the enthalpy change would be different because forming BaSO4 is also exothermic. But the problem doesn't give any specific enthalpies of formation, so maybe we are supposed to assume that only the neutralization of H+ and OH- contributes, and ignore the precipitation. But that might not be correct. Wait, but the question is from a general chemistry perspective. Typically, in such problems, unless stated otherwise, you consider only the neutralization of H+ and OH- to form water, and any precipitation reactions are considered separately. But in this case, since Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 are reacting, the reaction is actually:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l)

So this reaction has both neutralization and precipitation. The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the sum of the enthalpy of neutralization for two moles of H2O and the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4. But without data on the enthalpy of formation for BaSO4, we can't calculate it. However, the problem might be assuming that all the H+ and OH- react to form water, and the Ba^2+ and SO4^2- just stay in solution or form a precipitate, but the enthalpy change is only considered for the neutralization part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the only reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the spectator ions are ignored. But in reality, when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, they will form BaSO4 precipitate, which is a separate process. But since the problem mentions enthalpy of neutralization, which is about acid-base reaction, maybe we are to consider only the H+ and OH- reaction. However, the formation of BaSO4 is a metathesis reaction, which is a different process. But without data, perhaps we can't include that. So maybe the question expects us to just consider the H+ and OH- neutralization. Let me check standard problems. Usually, when mixing strong acids and strong bases, even if they form a precipitate, the enthalpy is considered as per mole of H2O formed, using the standard -57 kJ/mol. For example, if you mix H2SO4 and NaOH, the enthalpy would be based on moles of H2O formed. Similarly, if you have a diprotic acid and a dihydroxide base, the total moles of H+ and OH- would determine the moles of H2O, hence the enthalpy. So in this case, even though BaSO4 precipitates, the enthalpy of neutralization is still based on the H+ and OH- reacting. Therefore, the answer would be 0.2 mol * -57 kJ/mol = -11.4 kJ. But wait, let me confirm. Suppose we have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-. They react in 1:1 to form 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ (with a negative sign). So the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Therefore, the answer is -11.4 kJ. But let me check if the actual reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 contributes more. The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. The enthalpy for this reaction would be ΔH = [ΔHf(BaSO4) + 2ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(H2SO4) + ΔHf(Ba(OH)2)]. But without those values, we can't compute it. So if the problem expects us to use the standard -57 kJ/mol per H2O, then we proceed as before. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the actual neutralization is different. Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. The sulfate from H2SO4 and barium from Ba(OH)2 will form BaSO4 precipitate. But the enthalpy of precipitation of BaSO4 is separate. However, the problem says "enthalpy of neutralization", which is specifically the heat from H+ + OH- → H2O. The precipitation of BaSO4 would contribute to the overall enthalpy change of the reaction, but if the question is only about neutralization (acid-base), then we can ignore the precipitation. But I need to be sure. In standard terminology, the enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when an acid and a base react to form one mole of water. For strong acid-strong base reactions, it's typically around -57 kJ per mole of water. So even if other reactions occur (like precipitation), the neutralization part is just the H+ + OH- → H2O. Therefore, in this problem, the total moles of H+ and OH- that react are 0.2 mol, leading to 0.2 mol H2O, so enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Therefore, the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But let me check once more. If the actual reaction forming BaSO4 releases additional heat, but since we don't have data, we can't calculate it, so the problem must intend for us to use the standard -57 kJ/mol for neutralization only. Therefore, the answer is -11.4 kJ. But wait, another thought: when H2SO4 is neutralized by a base, since it's diprotic, the neutralization would typically release twice the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4. But in the case of strong acids and bases, each H+ neutralized gives -57 kJ/mol. So whether it's HCl (monoprotic) or H2SO4 (diprotic), each H+ contributes -57 kJ/mol when neutralized. So in this case, the 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- would lead to 0.2 mol H2O, so 0.2 * -57 = -11.4 kJ. Therefore, the answer is -11.4 kJ. I think that's it. So the final answer is \boxed{-11.4\ \text{kJ}}.

Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid and a base react to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ per mole of water formed, but I think that's for strong acids and bases. Since HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are all strong, maybe that applies here. But first, I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture to see if they neutralize each other completely or if there's a limiting reagent.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each acid and base. For HCl: it's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl has one H+ per molecule, that's 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and since it's strong, both protons are released. The concentration is 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The concentration is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28 mol and OH- is 0.2 mol. Hmm, so the H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol. But wait, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1, right? So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted. But the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated based on the moles of water formed, which would be equal to the moles of OH- (since it's the limiting reagent here). So the moles of water formed are 0.2 mol.

I need to determine the enthalpy of neutralization when combining these three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Enthalpy of neutralization typically refers to the heat released during the reaction between an acid and a base to form water. For strong acids and bases, the standard value is approximately -57 kJ per mole of water formed. Since HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are all strong electrolytes, this value should apply here. First, I'll need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions to determine if there's complete neutralization or a limiting reagent.

Starting with the acids: For HCl, which dissociates completely, the moles equal 0.2 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. As HCl provides one H+ per molecule, that's 0.1 mol of H+.

For H2SO4, a diprotic acid that fully dissociates, the moles equal 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each H2SO4 molecule contributes 2 H+ ions, so that's 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol of H+.

The total H+ from both acids is therefore 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

For the base Ba(OH)2, which also fully dissociates, the moles equal 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions, so that's 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol of OH-.

Comparing the totals, we have 0.28 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-. The H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol. Since the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- occurs in a 1:1 ratio, the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+, leaving 0.08 mol of H+ unreacted. The enthalpy calculation is based on the moles of water formed, which equals the moles of OH- (the limiting reagent), so 0.2 mol of water forms.

For the standard enthalpy of neutralization of -57 kJ per mole of water formed, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. There's some ambiguity about whether the question asks for the total enthalpy change or the molar enthalpy. Typically, "enthalpy of neutralization" refers to the total heat released unless specified otherwise, but it could also be asking for the value in kJ per mole.

I need to determine the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing these three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Typically, the enthalpy of neutralization involves the release of heat when an acid reacts with a base to produce water. The typical value is about -57 kJ per mole of water formed, usually for strong acids and bases. Since HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are strong, this might apply here. First, I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions to see if they fully neutralize each other or if there's a limiting reagent.

Starting with the moles of each acid and base: HCl is a strong acid that fully dissociates. With a concentration of 0.2 M in 500 mL, moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol, meaning 0.1 mol of H+ ions.

Next, for H2SO4, a diprotic strong acid where both protons are released: concentration is 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole releases 2 moles of H+, thus 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

As for Ba(OH)2, it's a strong base that dissociates fully. At a concentration of 0.5 M in 200 mL, moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol, with each mole providing 2 moles of OH-, resulting in 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Overall, there are 0.28 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-. The H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol, but the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. Thus, OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+, leaving 0.08 mol of H+ unreacted. The enthalpy of neutralization depends on the moles of water formed, which are 0.2 mol since OH- is the limiting reagent.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. The reaction H+ + OH- → H2O gives a ΔH of -57 kJ per mole. With 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- reacting, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. The question asks for "enthalpy of neutralization," which typically means the total heat released unless specified otherwise, although it could mean kJ per mole. I should double-check the question for clarity.

The question mentions "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when..." along with the given volumes and concentrations, so perhaps it asks for the total enthalpy change for the reaction.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \rightarrow 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **H₂SO₄:** \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \rightarrow 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **Total H⁺:** \(0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol}\)

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** \(0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\)

3. **Determine limiting reagent:**
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ react in a 1:1 ratio. The limiting reagent is OH⁻ (0.2 mol), which neutralizes 0.2 mol of H⁺, leaving 0.08 mol H⁺ in excess.

4. **Calculate moles of water formed:**
   - Moles of H₂O formed = moles of OH⁻ = 0.2 mol

However, given the problem statement, it's likely the total enthalpy. Also, since the reaction is exothermic, the value should be negative. Therefore, the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But I need to check if there's any mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me verify:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

H+ and OH- react 1:1, so 0.2 mol OH- neutralizes 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ in excess. Therefore, moles of water formed = 0.2 mol. Enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer is -11.4 kJ. But wait, sometimes enthalpy of neutralization is reported per mole of acid/base, but in this case, since it's a mix of different acids and a base, the total moles of H+ and OH- reacting would be the basis. Since the standard value is per mole of H2O formed, which is 0.2 mol here, so yes, -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, if the question expects the answer in kJ per mole, but the problem says "enthalpy of neutralization" which is usually per mole. Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of water formed. So if they are asking for the total enthalpy change, it's -11.4 kJ. If they are asking for the molar enthalpy, it's -57 kJ/mol. But the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization", which is typically the molar value. But in this case, since the reaction is not 1 mole of acid and 1 mole of base, but a mixture, perhaps the total enthalpy released is required. The problem might be expecting the total enthalpy. Let me check the problem statement again: "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when...". The term "enthalpy of neutralization" can sometimes refer to the total heat released. However, in standard terms, the enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change per mole of water formed, which is -57 kJ/mol. But in this case, since the user is mixing specific amounts, they might want the total enthalpy change. But the problem is phrased as "enthalpy of neutralization", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in many textbooks, the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of water formed. But if the question is asking for the total enthalpy change for this specific reaction, then it's 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So I think that's the answer they are looking for. Therefore, the final answer is -11.4 kJ. But let me check once more. If the problem is from an exam, and they mix different acids and a base, the key is to find the moles of H+ and OH- and see which is limiting. Then, the moles of water formed is the lesser of the two, which is 0.2 mol. Then, using the standard enthalpy per mole, multiply. So yes, -11.4 kJ. So the answer is \boxed{-11.4\ \text{kJ}}.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \rightarrow 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **H₂SO₄:** \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \rightarrow 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **Total H⁺:** \(0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol}\)

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** \(0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\)

3. **Determine limiting reagent and moles of H₂O formed:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \) occurs in a 1:1 ratio.
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent with \(0.2 \, \text{mol}\), neutralizing \(0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺}\).
   - **Moles of H₂O formed:** \(0.2 \, \text{mol}\)

4. **Calculate total enthalpy change:**
   - Standard enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H₂O: \(-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
   - **Total enthalpy:** \(0.2 \, \text{mol} \times -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}\)

**Answer:** The total enthalpy of neutralization is \(\boxed{-11.4\ \text{kJ}}\).

Since 0.2 mol of H2O is formed, and each mole gives -57 kJ, the total is -11.4 kJ.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol, each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So moles of H2O formed is 0.2 mol. Each mole gives -57 kJ, so total is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is -11.4 kJ. But maybe the problem expects the answer in kJ per mole?
