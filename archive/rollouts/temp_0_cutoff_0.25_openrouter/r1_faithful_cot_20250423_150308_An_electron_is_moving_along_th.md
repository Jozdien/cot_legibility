# Original Question

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.

The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.

What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

The electron and positron are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors 4 and 2, respectively. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2
\]

Each photon will have an energy of \(3m_e c^2\) since the total energy is equally shared. The momentum of each photon is:

\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3m_e c
\]

The initial momenta of the electron and positron are calculated using their respective Lorentz factors and velocities. For the electron (gamma = 4, beta = \(\sqrt{15}/4\)):

\[
p_e = \sqrt{15} m_e c
\]

For the positron (gamma = 2, beta = \(\sqrt{3}/2\)):

\[
p_p = -\sqrt{3} m_e c
\]

The total initial momentum is:

\[
p_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{15} m_e c - \sqrt{3} m_e c = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

After annihilation, the photons' momenta must conserve this total momentum. The horizontal components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum. Let \(\theta\) be the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is \(3m_e c \cos(\theta)\), and the total horizontal momentum is:

\[
2 \cdot 3m_e c \cos(\theta) = 6m_e c \cos(\theta)
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum:

\[
6m_e c \cos(\theta) = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

Solving for \(\cos(\theta)\):

\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3568
\]

The angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69.1^\circ
\]

The angle between the two photons is twice this angle:

\[
2\theta \approx 2 \times 69.1^\circ \approx 138.2^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

Okay, so I have this problem where an electron and a positron are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons with equal energies. The photons are measured to move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and I need to find the angle between their directions. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into photons. But since both the electron and positron are moving, their total energy isn't just their rest mass energy; it's their relativistic energy. The Lorentz factor (gamma) tells us how much their energy is increased due to their speed. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 0.511 MeV, right? So the total energy of each particle would be gamma times that. For the electron, gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron has gamma 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. 

But wait, energy isn't the only thing to consider here. Momentum also plays a role. Since they're moving along the horizontal axis towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by gamma * m * v, but since v is close to c, maybe it's better to use the formula for momentum in terms of gamma: p = gamma * m * beta * c, where beta is v/c. Alternatively, since we know gamma and beta can be found from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Let me calculate beta for both particles.

For the electron with gamma = 4:
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

So the electron's velocity is 0.9682c to the right (since it's moving from the left to the right). The positron has gamma = 2:
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the positron's velocity is 0.8660c to the left (but since it's moving from the right to the left, its velocity is -0.8660c in the coordinate system where right is positive).

Now, the total energy before collision is the sum of both particles' energies. So E_total = 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the electron is 4*0.511 and the positron is 2*0.511, so total energy is (4 + 2)*0.511 = 6*0.511 ≈ 3.066 MeV. But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, so each photon would have energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 ≈ 1.533 MeV. But wait, the rest mass energy of the electron-positron system is 2*0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But since they are moving, their total energy is higher. So the photons must carry away both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But the problem says the photons have equal energy. So each photon has energy 1.533 MeV. 

But we also need to consider momentum conservation. Before the collision, the electron and positron have momenta in opposite directions. Let's calculate their momenta. The momentum p = gamma * m * beta * c. For the electron: p_e = 4 * m_e * 0.9682c. For the positron: p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e - p_p = 4*0.9682*m_e*c - 2*0.8660*m_e*c. Let's compute that:

First, compute 4*0.9682 = 3.8728, and 2*0.8660 = 1.732. So p_total = (3.8728 - 1.732)*m_e*c ≈ 2.1408*m_e*c. So the total momentum is to the right, since it's positive. 

After the collision, the two photons must carry away this momentum. Since photons have momentum p = E/c, and their directions are important. The problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is at some angle above the axis and the other at the same angle below. Therefore, their vertical components of momentum will cancel each other, and their horizontal components will add up to the total momentum. 

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same: p_photon = E_photon / c. Let's denote each photon's momentum as p. Then, the horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the horizontal axis. Since there are two photons, one above and one below, their vertical components are p * sin(theta) and -p * sin(theta), which cancel. So the total horizontal momentum is 2p * cos(theta). 

But from conservation of momentum, this must equal the initial total momentum p_total = 2.1408*m_e*c. So:

2p * cos(theta) = 2.1408*m_e*c.

But we also know that the total energy of the photons is 2p*c = E_total = 3.066 MeV. So 2p*c = 3.066 MeV. Therefore, p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. But let's express m_e*c^2 as 0.511 MeV. So m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, m_e*c = 0.511 / c * MeV. Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of m_e*c^2.

Wait, let's see. Let me write the equations again.

Total energy: E_total = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c^2 + 2*m_e*c^2 = 6*m_e*c^2. Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass energy of each is m_e*c^2, but their total energy is gamma*m_e*c^2. So the electron's energy is 4*m_e*c^2, positron's is 2*m_e*c^2. So total energy is 6*m_e*c^2. Then, the photons' total energy is 6*m_e*c^2, so each photon has energy 3*m_e*c^2. Therefore, each photon's momentum is E/c = 3*m_e*c^2 / c = 3*m_e*c. 

Wait, but m_e*c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so 3*m_e*c^2 is 1.533 MeV, which matches the earlier calculation. So each photon's momentum is 3*m_e*c. 

But the total momentum of the photons is 2*p_photon*cos(theta) in the horizontal direction. So 2*3*m_e*c*cos(theta) = p_total_initial = 2.1408*m_e*c. 

Therefore, 6*m_e*c*cos(theta) = 2.1408*m_e*c. Divide both sides by m_e*c:

6*cos(theta) = 2.1408

So cos(theta) = 2.1408 / 6 ≈ 0.3568

Then theta = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees. 

But wait, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta, since one is at theta above and the other theta below. So the angle between them is 2*69 ≈ 138 degrees. 

But let me check the calculations again to make sure.

First, Lorentz factors: electron gamma=4, positron gamma=2. Their energies are 4*mc² and 2*mc², total 6*mc². Photons each have 3*mc² energy. Their momenta are each 3*mc² / c = 3*mc. 

Total initial momentum: electron's momentum is gamma*m*v. Wait, but maybe I should compute the actual momentum using gamma*m*v. Alternatively, since p = gamma*m*v, and v = beta*c, so p = gamma*beta*m*c. 

For the electron: gamma=4, beta=sqrt(1 - 1/16)=sqrt(15)/4≈0.9682. So p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m*c = sqrt(15)*m*c ≈ 3.87298*m*c.

For the positron: gamma=2, beta=sqrt(1 - 1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. Since it's moving to the left, p_p = -2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m*c = -sqrt(3)*m*c ≈ -1.73205*m*c.

Total initial momentum: p_total = p_e + p_p = sqrt(15)*m*c - sqrt(3)*m*c ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)*m*c ≈ 2.14093*m*c.

So that's correct. Then, the photons' total momentum must be 2.14093*m*c in the x-direction. Each photon has momentum 3*m*c. The x-component of each photon's momentum is 3*m*c*cos(theta). There are two photons, so total x-momentum is 6*m*c*cos(theta). Setting equal to initial momentum:

6*m*c*cos(theta) = 2.14093*m*c => cos(theta) ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.3568. 

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. 

But wait, the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So the angle between them is twice theta, which is approximately 138 degrees. Let me check if this makes sense. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the momentum conservation. Let me verify. 

Total energy of the system is 6*mc². Each photon has energy 3*mc², so their momenta are 3*mc. The x-components of their momenta are 3*mc*cos(theta) each, so total x-momentum is 6*mc*cos(theta). This must equal the initial momentum of 2.14093*mc. So 6*cos(theta) = 2.14093, so cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568. That's correct. 

Therefore, theta ≈ 69 degrees, angle between photons is 138 degrees. 

But let me check with exact values. Let's compute sqrt(15) and sqrt(3) more precisely. sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732050808. So p_total = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈ 2.140932538. So cos(theta) = 2.140932538 / 6 ≈ 0.35682209. Then theta = arccos(0.35682209). Let's compute that. 

Using a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69.1 degrees. So 2*theta ≈ 138.2 degrees. 

But the problem might expect an exact answer. Wait, maybe there's a way to express this angle more precisely or in terms of inverse trigonometric functions. Let me see. 

Alternatively, perhaps using exact expressions. Let's write cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. So theta = arccos[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6]. Then the angle between the photons is 2*arccos[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6]. But maybe this can be simplified. 

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities. Let me compute cos(2*theta) using double angle formula: cos(2*theta) = 2*cos²(theta) - 1. 

Given cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ 0.3568, then cos²(theta) = [(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))²]/36 = (15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(45))/36 = (18 - 6*sqrt(5))/36 = (3 - sqrt(5))/6. 

Therefore, cos(2*theta) = 2*(3 - sqrt(5))/6 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5))/3 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5) - 3)/3 = (-sqrt(5))/3 ≈ -0.7454. 

Therefore, 2*theta = arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). Let's compute this angle. arccos(-sqrt(5)/3) is in the second quadrant. The angle whose cosine is -sqrt(5)/3. Let's compute this in degrees. sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745. So arccos(-0.745) is approximately 138 degrees, which matches our previous result. 

But is there a way to express this angle in terms of inverse trigonometric functions? The problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps in terms of sqrt(5) or something. Wait, but maybe the angle is 180 - arccos(sqrt(5)/3). Since cos(180 - x) = -cos(x). So 2*theta = 180 - arccos(sqrt(5)/3). But I don't know if that's helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 120 degrees? Wait, sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is 30 degrees. But here, cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568, which is 69 degrees. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. But in the center of momentum frame, the photons would have to go in opposite directions. But here, the initial frame is not the center of momentum frame because the total momentum is not zero. So in the lab frame, the photons have to conserve both energy and momentum. 

Wait, but in this case, the total initial momentum is to the right, so the photons must have a net momentum to the right. Since they are moving at angles, their horizontal components add up, and vertical components cancel. 

But given that each photon has energy 3*m_e*c², their momenta are 3*m_e*c. So the horizontal component is 3*m_e*c*cos(theta), and vertical component is 3*m_e*c*sin(theta). For two photons, the total horizontal momentum is 6*m_e*c*cos(theta), and vertical components cancel. 

Setting 6*m_e*c*cos(theta) equal to the initial momentum (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))*m_e*c, we get cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. 

So theta = arccos[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6], and the angle between the photons is 2*theta. 

But maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can relate this to a known angle. Let's compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 numerically: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205. So 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093. Divided by 6: ≈0.3568. 

So arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees, so 2*theta ≈ 138.2 degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of inverse cosine, but I think 138 degrees is approximate. However, perhaps there's a way to get an exact value. Let me think. 

Wait, if we consider that (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 can be written as [sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) - 1)]/6. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe using some substitution. 

Alternatively, let's square both sides. Let’s suppose that angle between the photons is φ = 2*theta. Then, cos(phi/2) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. Then, cos(phi/2) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)]/6. Let's square both sides:

cos²(phi/2) = [15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(45)]/36 = [18 - 6*sqrt(5)]/36 = [3 - sqrt(5)]/6.

But using the double angle formula, cos(phi) = 2*cos²(phi/2) - 1 = 2*(3 - sqrt(5))/6 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5))/3 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5) - 3)/3 = -sqrt(5)/3. 

Therefore, cos(phi) = -sqrt(5)/3. Therefore, phi = arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). 

So the angle between the photons is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). If we want to express this in degrees, it's approximately 138 degrees, but the exact value is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). However, the problem might want the answer in terms of an inverse cosine, but maybe they expect a numerical value. Let me check with a calculator: sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745. So arccos(-0.745) is approximately 138 degrees. 

But let me check with more precise calculation. Let's compute arccos(-sqrt(5)/3):

cos(138.19068°) ≈ cos(138.19°) ≈ -0.745. So yes, approximately 138.19 degrees. 

Since the problem says "the angle between the directions of the photons", and given that the answer is likely expected to be in degrees, probably rounded to the nearest degree or a fraction. But maybe they want an exact expression. However, given that the problem mentions Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, which are integers, perhaps there's a way to get an exact angle. 

Wait, let's check if sqrt(5)/3 is related to some known angle. For example, cos(138.19°) ≈ -sqrt(5)/3. But I don't recall a standard angle with that cosine. So perhaps the answer is 2*arccos[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6], or arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). But since the problem is in English and likely expects a numerical answer, I think 138 degrees is acceptable. However, let me check once more the calculations. 

Wait, let's verify the initial momentum again. The electron's momentum is gamma*beta*m*c. For gamma=4, beta=sqrt(1 - 1/16)=sqrt(15)/4. So p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m*c = sqrt(15)*m*c. The positron's momentum is gamma=2, beta=sqrt(3)/2, but moving left, so p_p = -2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m*c = -sqrt(3)*m*c. Total initial momentum: sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093. 

Then, photons' total momentum in x-direction: 2*p_photon*cos(theta) = 2*(3*m*c)*cos(theta) = 6*m*c*cos(theta). Setting equal to 2.14093*m*c, so cos(theta)=2.14093/6≈0.3568. 

Yes, that's correct. So theta≈69.1°, angle between photons≈138.2°. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of pi radians? 138 degrees is approximately 2.41 radians, but I don't think so. The problem says "angle between the directions", so degrees with a boxed number. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the energy and momentum once again. 

Total energy: electron has gamma=4, so energy 4*mc². Positron gamma=2, energy 2*mc². Total energy 6*mc². Photons each have 3*mc². 

Momentum of each photon: E/c = 3*mc²/c = 3*mc. 

Total momentum of photons: in x-direction, 2*3*mc*cos(theta) = 6*mc*cos(theta). 

Initial momentum: sqrt(15)*mc - sqrt(3)*mc = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))mc ≈2.14093*mc. 

Thus, 6*cos(theta)=sqrt(15)-sqrt(3). Therefore, cos(theta)=(sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6≈0.3568. 

Yes, that's correct. So angle between photons is 2*theta≈138.2 degrees. 

I think that's the answer. So the angle is approximately 138 degrees. Since the problem might want an exact value, but given the numbers, it's likely they expect the approximate value. Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here. 

Wait, another approach: in the center of momentum frame. But since the problem is in the lab frame where the electron and positron are moving towards each other, maybe transforming to the center of momentum frame would complicate things. But let's see. 

In the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But in this problem, the initial momentum is not zero, so the center of momentum frame is moving relative to the lab frame. However, after annihilation, the photons must have zero total momentum in the center of momentum frame, meaning they move in opposite directions. But when transformed back to the lab frame, their directions would be altered. However, the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, which suggests that in the lab frame, they have a net momentum to the right, which matches our previous calculation. 

But perhaps using the center of momentum frame could simplify the problem. Let's try. 

First, find the velocity of the center of momentum frame relative to the lab frame. 

In the lab frame, total energy is E_total = 4*mc² + 2*mc² = 6*mc². Total momentum is p_total = sqrt(15)*mc - sqrt(3)*mc ≈2.14093*mc. 

The velocity of the center of momentum frame (u) can be found by u = (p_total*c²)/E_total. 

So u = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc * c² ] / (6*mc²) ) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * c ] / 6 ≈ (2.14093*c)/6 ≈0.3568c. 

So the center of momentum frame is moving to the right at speed 0.3568c relative to the lab frame. 

In the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the two photons must be emitted in opposite directions. Since the problem states that in the lab frame, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right, this suggests that in the center of momentum frame, they are emitted symmetrically at some angle, and when boosted back to the lab frame, their directions become upper and lower right. 

But this might complicate things. However, since the problem states that the photons have equal energy in the lab frame, which is not necessarily the case in the center of momentum frame. Wait, in the center of momentum frame, the photons would have equal energy if emitted opposite, but when transformed back to the lab frame, their energies would differ due to Doppler shift. However, the problem states that in the lab frame, the photons have equal energy. Therefore, this suggests that the emission in the center of momentum frame must be such that after the boost, their energies are equal. 

This seems more complicated, but maybe we can use this approach. 

In the center of momentum frame, the two photons are emitted in opposite directions with energy E1 and E2. But since in the lab frame, their energies are equal, we need to relate E1 and E2 through the Lorentz transformation. 

Alternatively, maybe this approach is not necessary, and our initial approach is sufficient. 

Given that the initial approach gives an angle of approximately 138 degrees, and the steps seem correct, I think that's the answer. 

**Final Answer**
The angle between the directions of the photons is \boxed{138^\circ}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem where an electron and a positron are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons with equal energies. The photons are measured to move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and I need to find the angle between their directions. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into photons. But since both the electron and positron are moving, their total energy isn't just their rest mass energy; it's their relativistic energy. The Lorentz factor (gamma) tells us how much their energy is increased due to their speed. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 0.511 MeV, right? So the total energy of each particle would be gamma times that. For the electron, gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron has gamma 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. 

But wait, energy isn't the only thing to consider here. Momentum also plays a role. Since they're moving along the horizontal axis towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by gamma * m * v, but since v is close to c, maybe it's better to use the formula for momentum in terms of gamma: p = gamma * m * beta * c, where beta is v/c. Alternatively, since we know gamma and beta can be found from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Let me calculate beta for both particles.

For the electron with gamma = 4:
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

So the electron's velocity is 0.9682c to the right (since it's moving from the left to the right). The positron has gamma = 2:
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the positron's velocity is 0.8660c to the left (but since it's moving from the right to the left, its velocity is -0.8660c in the coordinate system where right is positive).

Now, the total energy before collision is the sum of both particles' energies. So E_total = 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the electron is 4*0.511 and the positron is 2*0.511, so total energy is (4 + 2)*0.511 = 6*0.511 ≈ 3.066 MeV. But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, so each photon would have energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 ≈ 1.533 MeV. But wait, the rest mass energy of the electron-positron system is 2*0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But since they are moving, their total energy is higher. So the photons must carry away both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But the problem says the photons have equal energy. So each photon has energy 1.533 MeV. 

But we also need to consider momentum conservation. Before the collision, the electron and positron have momenta in opposite directions. Let's calculate their momenta. The momentum p = gamma * m * beta * c. For the electron: p_e = 4 * m_e * 0.9682c. For the positron: p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e - p_p = 4*0.9682*m_e*c - 2*0.8660*m_e*c. Let's compute that:

First, compute 4*0.9682 = 3.8728, and 2*0.8660 = 1.732. So p_total = (3.8728 - 1.732)*m_e*c ≈ 2.1408*m_e*c. So the total momentum is to the right, since it's positive. 

After the collision, the two photons must carry away this momentum. Since photons have momentum p = E/c, and their directions are important. The problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is at some angle above the axis and the other at the same angle below. Therefore, their vertical components of momentum will cancel each other, and their horizontal components will add up to the total momentum. 

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same: p_photon = E_photon / c. Let's denote each photon's momentum as p. Then, the horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the horizontal axis. Since there are two photons, one above and one below, their vertical components are p * sin(theta) and -p * sin(theta), which cancel. So the total horizontal momentum is 2p * cos(theta). 

But from conservation of momentum, this must equal the initial total momentum p_total = 2.1408*m_e*c. So:

2p * cos(the

I'm faced with a physics problem involving an electron and positron collision. The scenario involves an electron moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and a positron moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Upon collision, they annihilate and produce two photons of equal energy, traveling in the upper-right and lower-right directions. I need to determine the angle between these photons' paths.

To solve this, I need to consider both energy and momentum conservation. First, I'll calculate the total energy of the system. The rest mass energy of both electron and positron is 0.511 MeV each. For the electron with γ=4, its energy is 4×0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron with γ=2 has energy 2×0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So the total energy is 3.066 MeV, meaning each photon gets 1.533 MeV.

For momentum, I need to calculate β (velocity relative to speed of light) for each particle. For the electron with γ=4: β = √(1-1/16) = √(15/16) = √15/4 ≈ 0.9682, moving rightward. For the positron with γ=2: β = √(1-1/4) = √(3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, moving leftward.

The momentum is p = γmβc. For the electron: p_e = 4×m_e×0.9682c = 3.8728m_e c. For the positron: p_p = 2×m_e×0.8660c = 1.732m_e c (negative since it moves left). The total momentum is therefore (3.8728-1.732)m_e c ≈ 2.1408m_e c, directed rightward.

After collision, the two photons must carry this momentum. Since their vertical components cancel out (one goes up-right, one goes down-right), their horizontal components must sum to the total momentum. Each photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon/c, and the horizontal component is p_photon×cos(θ) where θ is the angle from the horizontal. Conservation of momentum requires that 2p_photon×cos(θ) equals the initial momentum 2.1408m_e c.

Alright, I have a problem involving an electron and a positron moving toward each other along the horizontal axis. The electron comes from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, while the positron approaches from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, creating two photons with equal energies. These photons are observed to move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and I need to determine the angle between their paths. Let's break this down one step at a time.

First, I recall that during annihilation, the rest mass energy of the particles converts into photons. However, since the electron and positron are moving, their total energy includes both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. The Lorentz factor (gamma) indicates the increase in energy due to speed. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the total energy for each particle is calculated as gamma times their rest mass energy. For the electron, with gamma equal to 4, the energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. For the positron, with gamma 2, the energy amounts to 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

Energy isn't the only factor here; momentum is crucial as well. Since they're moving on a horizontal path heading toward each other, their momenta are opposite. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * beta * c, where beta represents v/c. Since the velocity is near the speed of light, I use beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). I will now compute beta for each particle.

For the electron (gamma = 4):
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Thus, the electron's velocity is 0.9682c to the right. For the positron (gamma = 2):
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

This means the positron's velocity is -0.8660c to the left (right is positive in this system).

Now, the pre-collision total energy is the sum of both particles' energies. Thus, E_total = 4*0.511 MeV + 2*0.511 MeV = 6*0.511 MeV = 3.066 MeV. When they annihilate, two photons are produced, each carrying an equal amount of energy. Consequently, each photon has an energy of E_photon = 3.066 MeV / 2 ≈ 1.533 MeV.

In addition, momentum conservation is necessary. The electron and positron possess opposite momenta before collision. Calculating their momenta, we have p = gamma * m * beta * c. For the electron, p_e = 4 * m_e * 0.9682c. For the positron, p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660c, but being left-directed, its momentum is negative. Therefore, p_total = p_e - p_p = 4*0.9682*m_e*c - 2*0.8660*m_e*c, leading to:

4*0.9682 = 3.8728 and 2*0.8660 = 1.732. Thus, p_total = (3.8728 - 1.732)*m_e*c ≈ 2.1408 m_e*c, indicating the momentum is right-directed.

Post-collision, both photons must account for this momentum. Since photon momentum is p = E/c, their trajectories are significant. The problem specifies that one photon travels upper-right, and the other lower-right, so their vertical momentum components cancel, while their horizontal components total the initial momentum. With equal photon energies, each photon has a momentum magnitude of p_photon = E_photon / c. Let's denote each photon's momentum as p. The horizontal component for each is p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the horizontal axis. Hence, the total horizontal momentum is 2p * cos(theta).

Using momentum conservation, this equals the initial momentum, p_total = 2.1408 * m_e * c. Therefore:

2p * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * m_e * c.

So 2p*c = 3.066 MeV. Therefore, p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Wait, but energy E_photon = p*c, so each photon has energy p*c. Therefore, 2p*c = 3.066 MeV, so p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Hmm, but m_e*c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. So, m_e*c = 0.511 / c * MeV. Wait, maybe I need to express p in terms of m_e*c.\n\nWait, let\'s see. Let me write the momentum conservation equation again:\n\n2p * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * m_e * c.\n\nBut p = E_photon / c, and each photon\'s energy is 1.533 MeV. So p = 1.533 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * m_e * c.\n\nBut m_e * c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e * c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting m_e * c:\n\n2 * 1.533 MeV / c * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c).\n\nMultiply both sides by c to eliminate the 1/c:\n\n2 * 1.533 MeV * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV.\n\nDivide both sides by MeV:\n\n2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511.\n\nCompute the right-hand side: 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.093.\n\nLeft-hand side: 2 * 1.533 = 3.066. So:\n\n3.066 * cos(theta) ≈ 1.093.\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.093 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356.\n\nThen theta ≈ arccos(0.356) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees. Hmm, but let me check the calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, let\'s verify the steps:\n\n1. Calculated energies: E_e = 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV, E_p = 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. Total energy: 3.066 MeV. So each photon has 1.533 MeV. Correct.\n\n2. Calculated beta for electron: sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. For positron: sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Correct.\n\n3. Calculated momenta: p_e = gamma * m_e * beta_e * c = 4 * m_e * 0.9682 * c. Similarly, p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660 * c. Since positron is moving left, total momentum is p_e - p_p = (4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660)*m_e*c. Calculated as 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408*m_e*c. Correct.\n\n4. Then, for the photons: each photon has energy 1.533 MeV, so momentum p = E/c = 1.533 MeV/c. Total horizontal momentum from both photons is 2*p*cos(theta). Set equal to 2.1408*m_e*c. Then, substituting m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. So 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c. Then, equation becomes 2*(1.533 MeV/c)*cos(theta) = 2.1408*(0.511 MeV / c). Multiply both sides by c: 2*1.533*cos(theta) = 2.1408*0.511. Then, 3.066*cos(theta) ≈ 1.093. So cos(theta) ≈ 0.356. Theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 2*69 ≈ 138 degrees. \n\nBut wait, 69 degrees from the horizontal for each photon, so the angle between them is 2*69 = 138 degrees. That seems correct. But let me check if there\'s another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, using conservation of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before collision is the sum of the electron\'s and positron\'s four-momenta. Then, after collision, the four-momentum is the sum of the two photons\'. Since the photons have equal energy and symmetric directions, their momenta can be represented as (E/c, E/c * cos(theta), E/c * sin(theta), 0) and (E/c, E/c * cos(theta), -E/c * sin(theta), 0). So the total four-momentum would be (2E/c, 2E/c * cos(theta), 0, 0). \n\nThe initial four-momentum is (E_e + E_p)/c, (p_e - p_p), 0, 0). So equating the time component: 2E/c = (E_e + E_p)/c. Which gives 2E = E_e + E_p, which is consistent with energy conservation. The space component: 2E/c * cos(theta) = p_e - p_p. Which is the same as before. So this approach leads to the same equation. Therefore, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nBut let me check the numerical values again. Let\'s compute p_e and p_p in terms of MeV/c. Since p = gamma * m_e * beta * c. But m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, p_e = gamma * beta * m_e * c = gamma * beta * (0.511 MeV / c). So for the electron: gamma=4, beta≈0.9682. So p_e = 4 * 0.9682 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 4 * 0.9682 * 0.511 ≈ 1.980 MeV/c. Similarly, p_p = 2 * 0.8660 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 0.8660 * 1.022 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is -0.885 MeV/c. Therefore, total momentum p_total = 1.980 - (-0.885)? Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving to the right, positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. If right is positive, then electron\'s momentum is +1.980 MeV/c, positron\'s is -0.885 MeV/c. Therefore, total momentum is 1.980 - 0.885 = 1.095 MeV/c. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation where I had 2.1408 * m_e*c. Wait, m_e*c is 0.511 MeV / c, so 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. So that\'s consistent. So p_total ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. \n\nThen, the momentum from the photons is 2p * cos(theta) = 1.094 MeV/c. But each photon has energy E_photon = 1.533 MeV, so p_photon = 1.533 MeV/c. Therefore, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. So cos(theta) = 1.094 / (2 * 1.533) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356. So theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. \n\nWait, but when I first calculated p_total as 2.1408 * m_e*c, and m_e*c is 0.511 MeV/c, so 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094, which matches. So that\'s correct. So the angle is indeed 2*arccos(0.356) ≈ 2*69 ≈ 138 degrees. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. Let\'s compute cos(theta) = (p_total) / (2p). p_total is 1.094 MeV/c, and 2p is 2*1.533 MeV/c = 3.066 MeV/c. So cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356. Arccos(0.356) is approximately 69.1 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is approximately 138.2 degrees. \n\nBut the problem says "the angle between the directions of the photons". Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, the angle between them is 2*theta. So 2*69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. So approximately 138 degrees. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s a possible mistake in the reference frame. Wait, all these calculations are done in the lab frame where the electron is moving to the right and the positron to the left. But is there a better frame to analyze this? For example, the center-of-momentum frame. In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons would have to be emitted in opposite directions. But the problem states that in the lab frame, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right. However, the problem says that the energies of both photons are the same. In the COM frame, if they are emitted opposite, their energies would be the same. But in the lab frame, their energies being the same might be a clue. \n\nWait, but in our calculation, we assumed that the photons have equal energy and symmetric angles, which gives the result. But maybe there\'s a different approach. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, since the photons have equal energy, their momenta have equal magnitude. The total momentum of the system is along the horizontal axis. So the vector sum of the two photon momenta must equal the initial total momentum. Let me represent the photon momenta as vectors. Let’s denote each photon\'s momentum as p, with one at angle theta above the horizontal and the other at theta below. Then, the horizontal components are p*cos(theta) each, summing to 2p*cos(theta). The vertical components are p*sin(theta) and -p*sin(theta), canceling each other. Therefore, the total momentum is 2p*cos(theta) along the horizontal. This must equal the initial total momentum, which we found to be approximately 1.094 MeV/c. \n\nSince the total energy is 3.066 MeV, which is 2p*c. Therefore, 2p*c = 3.066 MeV => p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Then, substituting into the momentum equation:\n\n2*(3.066 / (2c)) * cos(theta) = 1.094 MeV/c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3.066 / c) * cos(theta) = 1.094 / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094.\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356, as before. So theta ≈ 69.1 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. \n\nSo, after verifying through multiple approaches, it seems the angle is approximately 138 degrees. But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me check if the numbers can be computed more precisely.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute the exact value of p_total. The electron\'s momentum: p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e * c. Similarly for the positron. \n\nGiven gamma_e = 4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4. Therefore, p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m_e*c = sqrt(15)*m_e*c. \n\nSimilarly, gamma_p = 2, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So p_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m_e*c = sqrt(3)*m_e*c. \n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is -sqrt(3)*m_e*c. Therefore, total momentum p_total = sqrt(15)*m_e*c - sqrt(3)*m_e*c = m_e*c*(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 MeV / c. \n\nThe total energy is E_total = gamma_e*m_e*c^2 + gamma_p*m_e*c^2 = (4 + 2)*0.511 MeV = 6*0.511 MeV = 3.066 MeV. \n\nEach photon has energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Therefore, the momentum of each photon is p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. \n\nSetting up the momentum conservation equation:\n\n2*p_photon*cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n2*(1.533 MeV/c)*cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))*0.511 MeV / c.\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2*1.533*cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))*0.511.\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.\n\nMultiply by 0.511: 2.14093 * 0.511 ≈ 1.0939.\n\nLeft-hand side: 2*1.533 ≈ 3.066.\n\nSo, 3.066*cos(theta) ≈ 1.0939.\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.0939 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568.\n\nThen theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.0 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.0 ≈ 138.0 degrees. \n\nBut let\'s compute this more precisely. Let\'s calculate cos(theta) exactly:\n\ncos(theta) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 ] / (2 * 1.533 )\n\nBut 0.511 / 1.533 = 1/3, since 1.533 = 3*0.511. Let\'s verify:\n\n0.511 * 3 = 1.533. Yes. Therefore, 0.511 / 1.533 = 1/3. Therefore,\n\ncos(theta) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (1/3) ] / 2\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0.511 / (2*1.533) = 0.511 / (3.066) = 1/6. Because 0.511*6=3.066. Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 / (2*1.533) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (0.511 / 3.066) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (1/6). Because 0.511 / 3.066 = 1/6. \n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nCompute that:\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682, which gives theta ≈ arccos(0.35682). Let\'s compute arccos(0.35682):\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69.0 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.0 = 138.0 degrees. \n\nBut let\'s check if there\'s an exact expression. Since cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6, maybe this can be expressed in terms of known angles? Probably not a standard angle, so the answer is approximately 138 degrees. \n\nBut the problem might want an exact value in terms of inverse cosine, but since they ask for the angle, likely a numerical value. Given that in competitions, sometimes exact symbolic expressions are accepted, but here it\'s probably expected to compute it numerically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in assuming that the photons are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. The problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which suggests symmetry, so the calculation should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rest frame of the system gives a different perspective. In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons would be emitted in opposite directions. But since in this frame, their energies would be equal, which matches the problem\'s condition. Then, transforming back to the lab frame, the angles would be adjusted. However, this might complicate things, but let\'s try.\n\nIn the COM frame, the two photons are emitted in opposite directions, say along the y-axis and -y-axis, but since the problem states they are moving upper-right and lower-right, which is in the lab frame. To find the relation between COM frame and lab frame, we need to boost. But this might be more complex. However, since we already solved it in the lab frame and got 138 degrees, which seems reasonable, and the problem gives all conditions in the lab frame, I think the answer is 138 degrees. \n\nBut let me check with another method. Let\'s use the invariant mass squared. The invariant mass squared of the system is (E_total/c^2)^2 - (p_total)^2. This should equal the square of the total rest mass, but since electron and positron annihilate into photons, which are massless, the invariant mass squared should be (sum of four-momenta)^2 = (2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2 - (0)^2 = (2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2. But wait, the invariant mass squared is also equal to (E_e + E_p)^2/c^4 - (p_e - p_p)^2/c^2. \n\nLet me compute both sides. \n\nLeft side (from photons):\n\n(2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2.\n\nBut E_photon = p_photon*c, so this becomes (2p_photon/c)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2 = 4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).\n\nRight side (from initial particles):\n\n(E_e + E_p)^2/c^4 - (p_e - p_p)^2/c^2.\n\nCompute E_e = gamma_e*m_e*c^2 = 4*0.511 MeV, E_p = 2*0.511 MeV. So E_total = 6*0.511 MeV. p_e = gamma_e*beta_e*m_e*c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m_e*c = sqrt(15)*m_e*c. Similarly, p_p = sqrt(3)*m_e*c. So p_total = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) times m_e*c. \n\nTherefore, right side:\n\n(6*0.511 MeV)^2 / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c )^2 / c^2.\n\nBut m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting:\n\n(6*0.511)^2 / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 / c )^2 / c^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(6^2 * 0.511^2) / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 * 0.511^2 ) / c^4.\n\nFactor out 0.511^2 / c^4:\n\n[36 - (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2] * 0.511^2 / c^4.\n\nCompute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 = 15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 6*sqrt(5). Therefore:\n\n[36 - 18 + 6*sqrt(5)] = 18 + 6*sqrt(5).\n\nSo right side is (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.\n\nLeft side from photons:\n\n4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).\n\nBut p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. So p_photon^2 = (1.533)^2 (MeV/c)^2. Therefore:\n\n4*(1.533)^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = 4*(1.533)^2 ( (1 - c^2 cos^2(theta)) / c^2 ). Wait, no. Wait, 1/c^2 - cos^2(theta) is in units of 1/c^2. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let\'s instead set the two expressions equal:\n\nLeft side: 4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.\n\nBut p_photon = 1.533 MeV/c = 3*0.511 MeV/c. Because 1.533 / 0.511 = 3. So p_photon = 3*0.511 MeV/c. Therefore, p_photon^2 = 9*0.511^2 (MeV/c)^2. \n\nSubstitute into left side:\n\n4*9*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = 36*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n36*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.511^2:\n\n36*(1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) / c^4.\n\nMultiply both sides by c^4:\n\n36*(c^2 - c^4 cos^2(theta)) = 18 + 6*sqrt(5).\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n6*(c^2 - c^4 cos^2(theta)) = 3 + sqrt(5).\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe this approach isn\'t helpful. Let\'s abandon it and stick to the previous result.\n\nGiven all the cross-verification, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees. Since the problem might expect an exact answer, but given the numbers, it\'s likely 138 degrees.

tha) = 2.1408*m_e*c.

But we also know that the total energy of the photons is 2p*c = E_total = 3.066 MeV. So 2p*c = 3.066 MeV. Therefore, p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Wait, but energy E_photon = p*c, so each photon has energy p*c. Therefore, 2p*c = 3.066 MeV, so p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Hmm, but m_e*c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. So, m_e*c = 0.511 / c * MeV. Wait, maybe I need to express p in terms of m_e*c.

Wait, let's see. Let me write the momentum conservation equation again:

2p * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * m_e * c.

But p = E_photon / c, and each photon's energy is 1.533 MeV. So p = 1.533 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting into the momentum equation:

2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * m_e * c.

But m_e * c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e * c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting m_e * c:

2 * 1.533 MeV / c * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c).

Multiply both sides by c to eliminate the 1/c:

2 * 1.533 MeV * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV.

Divide both sides by MeV:

2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511.

Compute the right-hand side: 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.093.

Left-hand side: 2 * 1.533 = 3.066. So:

3.066 * cos(theta) ≈ 1.093.

Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.093 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356.

Then theta ≈ arccos(0.356) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees. Hmm, but let me check the calculations again to make sure.

Wait, let's verify the steps:

1. Calculated energies: E_e = 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV, E_p = 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. Total energy: 3.066 MeV. So each photon has 1.533 MeV. Correct.

2. Calculated beta for electron: sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. For positron: sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Correct.

3. Calculated momenta: p_e = gamma * m_e * beta_e * c = 4 * m_e * 0.9682 * c. Similarly, p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660 * c. Since positron is moving left, total momentum is p_e - p_p = (4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660)*m_e*c. Calculated as 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408*m_e*c. Correct.

4. Then, for the photons: each photon has energy 1.533 MeV, so momentum p = E/c = 1.533 MeV/c. Total horizontal momentum from both photons is 2*p*cos(theta). Set equal to 2.1408*m_e*c. Then, substituting m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. So 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c. Then, equation becomes 2*(1.533 MeV/c)*cos(theta) = 2.1408*(0.511 MeV / c). Multiply both sides by c: 2*1.533*cos(theta) = 2.1408*0.511. Then, 3.066*cos(theta) ≈ 1.093. So cos(theta) ≈ 0.356. Theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 2*69 ≈ 138 degrees. 

But wait, 69 degrees from the horizontal for each photon, so the angle between them is 2*69 = 138 degrees. That seems correct. But let me check if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, using conservation of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's four-momenta. Then, after collision, the four-momentum is the sum of the two photons'. Since the photons have equal energy and symmetric directions, their momenta can be represented as (E/c, E/c * cos(theta), E/c * sin(theta), 0) and (E/c, E/c * cos(theta), -E/c * sin(theta), 0). So the total four-momentum would be (2E/c, 2E/c * cos(theta), 0, 0). 

The initial four-momentum is (E_e + E_p)/c, (p_e - p_p), 0, 0). So equating the time component: 2E/c = (E_e + E_p)/c. Which gives 2E = E_e + E_p, which is consistent with energy conservation. The space component: 2E/c * cos(theta) = p_e - p_p. Which is the same as before. So this approach leads to the same equation. Therefore, the calculation seems consistent.

But let me check the numerical values again. Let's compute p_e and p_p in terms of MeV/c. Since p = gamma * m_e * beta * c. But m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, p_e = gamma * beta * m_e * c = gamma * beta * (0.511 MeV / c). So for the electron: gamma=4, beta≈0.9682. So p_e = 4 * 0.9682 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 4 * 0.9682 * 0.511 ≈ 1.980 MeV/c. Similarly, p_p = 2 * 0.8660 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 0.8660 * 1.022 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is -0.885 MeV/c. Therefore, total momentum p_total = 1.980 - (-0.885)? Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving to the right, positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. If right is positive, then electron's momentum is +1.980 MeV/c, positron's is -0.885 MeV/c. Therefore, total momentum is 1.980 - 0.885 = 1.095 MeV/c. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation where I had 2.1408 * m_e*c. Wait, m_e*c is 0.511 MeV / c, so 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. So that's consistent. So p_total ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. 

Then, the momentum from the photons is 2p * cos(theta) = 1.094 MeV/c. But each photon has energy E_photon = 1.533 MeV, so p_photon = 1.533 MeV/c. Therefore, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. So cos(theta) = 1.094 / (2 * 1.533) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356. So theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. 

Wait, but when I first calculated p_total as 2.1408 * m_e*c, and m_e*c is 0.511 MeV/c, so 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094, which matches. So that's correct. So the angle is indeed 2*arccos(0.356) ≈ 2*69 ≈ 138 degrees. 

But let me check with exact numbers. Let's compute cos(theta) = (p_total) / (2p). p_total is 1.094 MeV/c, and 2p is 2*1.533 MeV/c = 3.066 MeV/c. So cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356. Arccos(0.356) is approximately 69.1 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is approximately 138.2 degrees. 

But the problem says "the angle between the directions of the photons". Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, the angle between them is 2*theta. So 2*69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. So approximately 138 degrees. 

But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the reference frame. Wait, all these calculations are done in the lab frame where the electron is moving to the right and the positron to the left. But is there a better frame to analyze this? For example, the center-of-momentum frame. In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons would have to be emitted in opposite directions. But the problem states that in the lab frame, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right. However, the problem says that the energies of both photons are the same. In the COM frame, if they are emitted opposite, their energies would be the same. But in the lab frame, their energies being the same might be a clue. 

Wait, but in our calculation, we assumed that the photons have equal energy and symmetric angles, which gives the result. But maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since the photons have equal energy, their momenta have equal magnitude. The total momentum of the system is along the horizontal axis. So the vector sum of the two photon momenta must equal the initial total momentum. Let me represent the photon momenta as vectors. Let’s denote each photon's momentum as p, with one at angle theta above the horizontal and the other at theta below. Then, the horizontal components are p*cos(theta) each, summing to 2p*cos(theta). The vertical components are p*sin(theta) and -p*sin(theta), canceling each other. Therefore, the total momentum is 2p*cos(theta) along the horizontal. This must equal the initial total momentum, which we found to be approximately 1.094 MeV/c. 

Since the total energy is 3.066 MeV, which is 2p*c. Therefore, 2p*c = 3.066 MeV => p = 3.066 / (2c) MeV/c. Then, substituting into the momentum equation:

2*(3.066 / (2c)) * cos(theta) = 1.094 MeV/c.

Simplify:

(3.066 / c) * cos(theta) = 1.094 / c.

Multiply both sides by c:

3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094.

Therefore, cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356, as before. So theta ≈ 69.1 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. 

So, after verifying through multiple approaches, it seems the angle is approximately 138 degrees. But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me check if the numbers can be computed more precisely.

First, let's compute the exact value of p_total. The electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e * c. Similarly for the positron. 

Given gamma_e = 4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4. Therefore, p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m_e*c = sqrt(15)*m_e*c. 

Similarly, gamma_p = 2, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So p_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m_e*c = sqrt(3)*m_e*c. 

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is -sqrt(3)*m_e*c. Therefore, total momentum p_total = sqrt(15)*m_e*c - sqrt(3)*m_e*c = m_e*c*(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Now, m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, p_total = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 MeV / c. 

The total energy is E_total = gamma_e*m_e*c^2 + gamma_p*m_e*c^2 = (4 + 2)*0.511 MeV = 6*0.511 MeV = 3.066 MeV. 

Each photon has energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Therefore, the momentum of each photon is p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. 

Setting up the momentum conservation equation:

2*p_photon*cos(theta) = p_total.

Substituting the values:

2*(1.533 MeV/c)*cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))*0.511 MeV / c.

Multiply both sides by c:

2*1.533*cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))*0.511.

Compute the right-hand side:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Multiply by 0.511: 2.14093 * 0.511 ≈ 1.0939.

Left-hand side: 2*1.533 ≈ 3.066.

So, 3.066*cos(theta) ≈ 1.0939.

Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.0939 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568.

Then theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.0 degrees. 

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.0 ≈ 138.0 degrees. 

But let's compute this more precisely. Let's calculate cos(theta) exactly:

cos(theta) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 ] / (2 * 1.533 )

But 0.511 / 1.533 = 1/3, since 1.533 = 3*0.511. Let's verify:

0.511 * 3 = 1.533. Yes. Therefore, 0.511 / 1.533 = 1/3. Therefore,

cos(theta) = [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (1/3) ] / 2

Wait, no. Wait, 0.511 / (2*1.533) = 0.511 / (3.066) = 1/6. Because 0.511*6=3.066. Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 / (2*1.533) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (0.511 / 3.066) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * (1/6). Because 0.511 / 3.066 = 1/6. 

Therefore, cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Compute that:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682, which gives theta ≈ arccos(0.35682). Let's compute arccos(0.35682):

Using a calculator, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69.0 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69.0 = 138.0 degrees. 

But let's check if there's an exact expression. Since cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6, maybe this can be expressed in terms of known angles? Probably not a standard angle, so the answer is approximately 138 degrees. 

But the problem might want an exact value in terms of inverse cosine, but since they ask for the angle, likely a numerical value. Given that in competitions, sometimes exact symbolic expressions are accepted, but here it's probably expected to compute it numerically. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the photons are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. The problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which suggests symmetry, so the calculation should be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the rest frame of the system gives a different perspective. In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons would be emitted in opposite directions. But since in this frame, their energies would be equal, which matches the problem's condition. Then, transforming back to the lab frame, the angles would be adjusted. However, this might complicate things, but let's try.

In the COM frame, the two photons are emitted in opposite directions, say along the y-axis and -y-axis, but since the problem states they are moving upper-right and lower-right, which is in the lab frame. To find the relation between COM frame and lab frame, we need to boost. But this might be more complex. However, since we already solved it in the lab frame and got 138 degrees, which seems reasonable, and the problem gives all conditions in the lab frame, I think the answer is 138 degrees. 

But let me check with another method. Let's use the invariant mass squared. The invariant mass squared of the system is (E_total/c^2)^2 - (p_total)^2. This should equal the square of the total rest mass, but since electron and positron annihilate into photons, which are massless, the invariant mass squared should be (sum of four-momenta)^2 = (2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2 - (0)^2 = (2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2. But wait, the invariant mass squared is also equal to (E_e + E_p)^2/c^4 - (p_e - p_p)^2/c^2. 

Let me compute both sides. 

Left side (from photons):

(2E_photon/c^2)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2.

But E_photon = p_photon*c, so this becomes (2p_photon/c)^2 - (2p_photon*cos(theta))^2 = 4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).

Right side (from initial particles):

(E_e + E_p)^2/c^4 - (p_e - p_p)^2/c^2.

Compute E_e = gamma_e*m_e*c^2 = 4*0.511 MeV, E_p = 2*0.511 MeV. So E_total = 6*0.511 MeV. p_e = gamma_e*beta_e*m_e*c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m_e*c = sqrt(15)*m_e*c. Similarly, p_p = sqrt(3)*m_e*c. So p_total = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) times m_e*c. 

Therefore, right side:

(6*0.511 MeV)^2 / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c )^2 / c^2.

But m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e*c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, substituting:

(6*0.511)^2 / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 / c )^2 / c^2.

Simplify:

(6^2 * 0.511^2) / c^4 - ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 * 0.511^2 ) / c^4.

Factor out 0.511^2 / c^4:

[36 - (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2] * 0.511^2 / c^4.

Compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 = 15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 6*sqrt(5). Therefore:

[36 - 18 + 6*sqrt(5)] = 18 + 6*sqrt(5).

So right side is (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.

Left side from photons:

4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).

But p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. So p_photon^2 = (1.533)^2 (MeV/c)^2. Therefore:

4*(1.533)^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = 4*(1.533)^2 ( (1 - c^2 cos^2(theta)) / c^2 ). Wait, no. Wait, 1/c^2 - cos^2(theta) is in units of 1/c^2. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let's instead set the two expressions equal:

Left side: 4p_photon^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.

But p_photon = 1.533 MeV/c = 3*0.511 MeV/c. Because 1.533 / 0.511 = 3. So p_photon = 3*0.511 MeV/c. Therefore, p_photon^2 = 9*0.511^2 (MeV/c)^2. 

Substitute into left side:

4*9*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = 36*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)).

Set equal to right side:

36*0.511^2 (1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) * 0.511^2 / c^4.

Divide both sides by 0.511^2:

36*(1/c^2 - cos^2(theta)) = (18 + 6*sqrt(5)) / c^4.

Multiply both sides by c^4:

36*(c^2 - c^4 cos^2(theta)) = 18 + 6*sqrt(5).

Divide both sides by 6:

6*(c^2 - c^4 cos^2(theta)) = 3 + sqrt(5).

This seems messy. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let's abandon it and stick to the previous result.

Given all the cross-verification, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees. Since the problem might expect an exact answer, but given the numbers, it's likely 138 degrees. However, let me check if using exact values for cos(theta):

We had cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6. Let's compute this exactly:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732050808.

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: ≈ 0.35682209.

Then theta ≈ arccos(0.35682209). Let me compute this using a calculator:

arccos(0.35682209) ≈ 69.0 degrees. So 2*69 = 138 degrees. 

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. 

**Final Answer**
The angle between the directions of the photons is \boxed{138^\circ}.

Right side: 2.1408×0.511 ≈ 1.094. So cosθ ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568. Then θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, each photon is at 69 degrees from the horizontal, one above and one below, so the angle between them is 2×69 = 138 degrees. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.

So total energy is 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. Then each photon has 3.066/2 = 1.533 MeV. That's correct.\n\nMomentum of the electron: p_e = γmv. But m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV/c. So p_e = γβ m_e c. For the electron, γ=4, β=√(1-1/16)=√(15)/4≈0.9682. So p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*0.511 MeV/c ≈ sqrt(15)*0.511 ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. Wait, but earlier I thought p_e was 3.8728 m_e c. Wait, perhaps I confused units. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c. So p_e = γβ m_e c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4) * 0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(15)*0.511 MeV/c ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = γβ m_e c = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(3)*0.511 ≈ 1.732*0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

But m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c, so 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. So that's consistent. So the total initial momentum is approximately 1.094 MeV/c to the right.\n\nNow, the photons each have energy 1.533 MeV, so their momentum is E/c = 1.533 MeV/c. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2. Since they are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their vertical components are opposite. Let's say each makes an angle θ with the horizontal. Then the horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p_photon * cosθ, and the vertical component is p_photon * sinθ. Since the vertical components are equal and opposite, they cancel. The total horizontal momentum is 2 * p_photon * cosθ. This must equal the initial momentum of 1.094 MeV/c. So:\n\n2 * (1.533 MeV/c) * cosθ = 1.094 MeV/c\n\nSolving for cosθ:\n\ncosθ = 1.094 / (2 * 1.533) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568\n\nθ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.\n\nTherefore, each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the horizontal axis. The angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. But let me check if this is correct. If each is 69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is indeed 2*69 = 138 degrees. Alternatively, if they are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, then the angle between them is 2θ. So 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the initial momentum, I converted m_e c to MeV/c correctly. Let me confirm. The rest mass energy m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV/c. Therefore, when I calculated p_e = γβ m_e c, that's in units of MeV/c. So for the electron, p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(15)*0.511 ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. For the positron, p_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*0.511 ≈ sqrt(3)*0.511 ≈ 1.732*0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. So total initial momentum is 1.978 - 0.885 ≈ 1.093 MeV/c. Then, the photons' total horizontal momentum is 2*(1.533)*cosθ = 3.066*cosθ. Setting equal to 1.093, so cosθ ≈ 1.093/3.066 ≈ 0.3565, leading to θ ≈ 69 degrees. So angle between them is 138 degrees. That seems correct. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the assumption that the photons have equal energy. The problem states that the energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. So that's given, so energy conservation gives each photon 1.533 MeV. Then, the momentum conservation in the horizontal direction gives the angle. The vertical components must cancel, so their vertical momenta are equal and opposite, which requires that the angles are symmetric above and below the horizontal. Therefore, the angle between them is 2θ. So 138 degrees. But wait, 69 degrees each from the horizontal, so the angle between them is 2*69=138 degrees. So the answer should be 138 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69 = 138 degrees. So the answer is 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the direction of the positron's momentum. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - |p_p|. Which is correct. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees. But wait, I should check if the angle is measured as the angle between their directions.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The angle between the directions of the two photons is **138 degrees**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Energy Conservation:**
   - The electron and positron each have rest mass energy \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Electron's total energy: \( \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 \times 0.511 = 2.044 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Positron's total energy: \( \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 \times 0.511 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total energy: \( 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Each photon receives half: \( 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 \, \text{MeV} \).

2. **Momentum Calculation:**
   - Electron's velocity factor \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_e^2} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682 \).
   - Electron's momentum: \( p_e = \gamma_e \beta_e m_e c = 4 \times \sqrt{15}/4 \times 0.511/c \approx 1.978 \, \text{MeV}/c \).
   - Positron's velocity factor \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_p^2} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660 \).
   - Positron's momentum (leftward): \( p_p = \gamma_p \beta_p m_e c = 2 \times \sqrt{3}/2 \times 0.511/c \approx 0.885 \, \text{MeV}/c \).
   - Total initial momentum: \( p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p \approx 1.093 \, \text{MeV}/c \) (rightward).

3. **Photon Momentum Components:**
   - Each photon's momentum: \( p_{\gamma} = E_{\gamma}/c = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}/c \).
   - Horizontal components: \( 2 p_{\gamma} \cos\theta = p_{\text{total}} \).
   - Solving for \( \cos\theta \): \( \cos\theta = \frac{1.093}{2 \times 1.533} \approx 0.3568 \).
   - Angle \( \theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ \).

4. **Angle Between Photons:**
   - One photon at \( +69^\circ \), the other at \( -69^\circ \) relative to the horizontal.
   - Total angle between them: \( 69^\circ + 69^\circ = 138^\circ \).

**Answer:** The angle between the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

But since each photon's energy is 1.533 MeV, and E_photon = p_photon c, so p_photon = 1.533 MeV/c. Therefore, 2×1.533 MeV/c × cosθ = 2.1408m_e c. But m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV/c. Thus, substituting, 2×1.533 × cosθ = 2.1408×0.511. Let me compute that.

Left side: 3.066 cosθ. Right side: 2.1408×0.511 ≈ 1.094. So cosθ ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568. Then θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, each photon is at 69 degrees from the horizontal, one above and one below, so the angle between them is 2×69 = 138 degrees. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. If each is 69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify the steps again.

First, the total energy: 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511? Wait, no. Wait, the electron has γ=4, so energy is 4*0.511, and the positron has γ=2, so energy is 2*0.511. So total energy is 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. Then each photon has 3.066/2 = 1.533 MeV. That's correct.

Momentum of the electron: p_e = γmv. But m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV/c. So p_e = γβ m_e c. For the electron, γ=4, β=√(1-1/16)=√(15)/4≈0.9682. So p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*0.511 MeV/c ≈ sqrt(15)*0.511 ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. Wait, but earlier I thought p_e was 3.8728 m_e c. Wait, perhaps I confused units. Let me clarify.

Wait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c. So p_e = γβ m_e c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4) * 0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(15)*0.511 MeV/c ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = γβ m_e c = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(3)*0.511 ≈ 1.732*0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p = 1.978 - 0.885 ≈ 1.093 MeV/c. Wait, but earlier I thought the total momentum was 2.1408 m_e c. But m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c, so 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV/c ≈ 1.094 MeV/c. So that's consistent. So the total initial momentum is approximately 1.094 MeV/c to the right.

Now, the photons each have energy 1.533 MeV, so their momentum is E/c = 1.533 MeV/c. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2. Since they are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their vertical components are opposite. Let's say each makes an angle θ with the horizontal. Then the horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p_photon * cosθ, and the vertical component is p_photon * sinθ. Since the vertical components are equal and opposite, they cancel. The total horizontal momentum is 2 * p_photon * cosθ. This must equal the initial momentum of 1.094 MeV/c. So:

2 * (1.533 MeV/c) * cosθ = 1.094 MeV/c

Solving for cosθ:

cosθ = 1.094 / (2 * 1.533) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568

θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

Therefore, each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the horizontal axis. The angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. But let me check if this is correct. If each is 69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is indeed 2*69 = 138 degrees. Alternatively, if they are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, then the angle between them is 2θ. So 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but when I calculated the initial momentum, I converted m_e c to MeV/c correctly. Let me confirm. The rest mass energy m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV/c. Therefore, when I calculated p_e = γβ m_e c, that's in units of MeV/c. So for the electron, p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(15)*0.511 ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c. For the positron, p_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*0.511 ≈ sqrt(3)*0.511 ≈ 1.732*0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. So total initial momentum is 1.978 - 0.885 ≈ 1.093 MeV/c. Then, the photons' total horizontal momentum is 2*(1.533)*cosθ = 3.066*cosθ. Setting equal to 1.093, so cosθ ≈ 1.093/3.066 ≈ 0.3565, leading to θ ≈ 69 degrees. So angle between them is 138 degrees. That seems correct. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the assumption that the photons have equal energy. The problem states that the energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. So that's given, so energy conservation gives each photon 1.533 MeV. Then, the momentum conservation in the horizontal direction gives the angle. The vertical components must cancel, so their vertical momenta are equal and opposite, which requires that the angles are symmetric above and below the horizontal. Therefore, the angle between them is 2θ. So 138 degrees. But wait, 69 degrees each from the horizontal, so the angle between them is 2*69=138 degrees. So the answer should be 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in units or calculation. Let me redo the calculation step by step.

Total energy: 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. Each photon has 1.533 MeV.

Electron's momentum: γβm_e c. γ=4, β=sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. So p_e = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*0.511 MeV/c = sqrt(15)*0.511 ≈ 3.872*0.511 ≈ 1.978 MeV/c.

Positron's momentum: γ=2, β=sqrt(1 - 1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So p_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*0.511 = sqrt(3)*0.511 ≈ 1.732*0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV/c. Since positron is moving left, total initial momentum is 1.978 - 0.885 ≈ 1.093 MeV/c.

Each photon's momentum is E/c = 1.533 MeV/c. The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is 1.533*cosθ. Two photons contribute 2*1.533*cosθ. This must equal 1.093 MeV/c. So cosθ = 1.093/(2*1.533) ≈ 1.093/3.066 ≈ 0.3565. θ ≈ arccos(0.3565) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*69 = 138 degrees. So the answer is 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the direction of the positron's momentum. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So total initial momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - |p_p|. Which is correct. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees. But wait, I should check if the angle is measured as the angle between their directions. If one is at +69 degrees and the other at -69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the problem statement. The problem says the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So both are moving to the right, but one is above and one is below the horizontal axis. So the angle between them is indeed the sum of their angles from the horizontal. So 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees. So I think that's the correct answer.

However, m_e * c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is 0.511 MeV. Therefore, m_e * c = 0.511 MeV / c. Substituting into the equation:\n\n2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511\n\nCalculate the right-hand side: 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094.\n\nLeft-hand side: 3.066 * cos(theta) ≈ 1.094\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568\n\nThus, theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So, each photon is at an angle theta above and below the horizontal axis. Therefore, the angle between them is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees. However, 69 degrees seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, let\'s redo the momentum calculation. The electron\'s momentum is gamma * m_e * beta_e * c. Gamma for the electron is 4, beta_e is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. So, p_e = 4 * m_e * c * 0.9682 ≈ 3.8728 m_e c.\n\nThe positron\'s momentum is gamma * m_e * beta_p * c. Gamma is 2, beta_p is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. But since it\'s moving to the left, p_p = -2 * m_e * c * 0.8660 ≈ -1.732 m_e c.\n\nTotal momentum before collision: p_total = p_e + p_p = 3.8728 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c ≈ 2.1408 m_e c. Correct.\n\nAfter collision, two photons with equal energy. Each photon\'s energy is 3.066 MeV / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Therefore, each photon\'s momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nBut m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, m_e c = 0.511 / c * c^2 = 0.511 c (MeV units). Wait, perhaps I need to express m_e c in terms of MeV. Let me think.\n\nActually, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c. Therefore, m_e c has units of MeV / c. So, when we have p_total = 2.1408 m_e c, that\'s 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c) ≈ 1.094 MeV / c.\n\nBut each photon\'s momentum is 1.533 MeV / c. So, the total horizontal momentum from both photons is 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 3.066 * cos(theta) MeV / c.\n\nSetting this equal to the initial momentum:\n\n3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094\n\nTherefore, cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568\n\nSo theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees.\n\nBut wait, 138 degrees is a very large angle. Let me check if this makes sense. If the photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, their angle with respect to each other is indeed twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. But is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum in 4-vector formalism. Let\'s consider the total energy and momentum before collision. The total energy is E_total = gamma_e m_e c^2 + gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) * 0.511 MeV = 3.066 MeV. The total momentum is p_total = gamma_e m_e beta_e c - gamma_p m_e beta_p c. Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So, p_total = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.\n\nCalculating gamma_e beta_e for the electron: gamma = 4, beta ≈ 0.9682, so gamma beta ≈ 4 * 0.9682 ≈ 3.8728.\n\nFor the positron, gamma = 2, beta ≈ 0.8660, so gamma beta ≈ 2 * 0.8660 ≈ 1.732. Since it\'s moving left, subtract this: 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408. Therefore, p_total = 2.1408 m_e c. As before.\n\nAfter annihilation, the two photons must have total energy 3.066 MeV and total momentum 2.1408 m_e c. Since the photons have equal energy, each has energy 1.533 MeV. Let’s denote the two photons as having momentum vectors p1 and p2. Since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = |p| c. Therefore, |p1| = |p2| = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nThe total momentum vector is p1 + p2. Let’s denote the angles of the photons with respect to the horizontal axis as theta and -theta (since one is upper, the other lower). Then, the horizontal components are p1 cos(theta) + p2 cos(-theta) = 2 p_photon cos(theta). The vertical components are p1 sin(theta) + p2 sin(-theta) = 0, which cancels out. Therefore, the total momentum is 2 p_photon cos(theta) in the horizontal direction. Setting this equal to the initial momentum:\n\n2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nBut m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV / c.\n\nThus:\n\n2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094\n\nSo, 3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094\n\ncos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568\n\nTherefore, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Hence, the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees. That\'s 180 - 42 = 138 degrees. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if there\'s a possible mistake in the direction of the positron\'s momentum.\n\nWait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So, the total momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - |p_p|. So, yes, 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, but that might complicate things. Let me try that. If c=1, then energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV. The electron\'s rest mass is 0.511 MeV. The total energy is 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. The total momentum is (4*beta_e - 2*beta_p) * 0.511. Wait, beta_e is 0.9682, beta_p is 0.8660. So, (4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660) * 0.511 ≈ (3.8728 - 1.732) * 0.511 ≈ 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094 MeV. So, total momentum is 1.094 MeV (since c=1, momentum is MeV/c, but with c=1, it\'s MeV). So, the total momentum is 1.094 MeV.\n\nEach photon has energy 1.533 MeV. So, their momenta are 1.533 MeV. The horizontal components must sum to 1.094 MeV. So, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. Same as before. So, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568, theta ≈ 69 degrees. So, angle between them is 138 degrees. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, 138 degrees is quite a large angle. Let me think if that\'s physically reasonable. If the electron is moving faster than the positron, the total momentum is to the right. So, after annihilation, the photons must carry net momentum to the right. If they are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, their horizontal components add up, while vertical components cancel. So, the angle between them is 2 theta. If theta is 69 degrees, then the angle between them is 138 degrees, which is obtuse. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if the photons were emitted in opposite directions, the angle would be 180 degrees, but here, due to the net momentum, the angle is less. Wait, but 138 is less than 180. Wait, no, 138 is more than 90, but less than 180. Hmm. Wait, if the net momentum is to the right, the photons can\'t be emitted directly opposite each other, because that would result in zero net momentum. So, they have to be emitted more in the forward direction. But in this case, the problem states that both are moving to the right, one upper, one lower. So, their directions are both rightward, but with vertical components. So, the angle between them is the angle between two vectors in the upper-right and lower-right quadrants. So, if each is at 69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let\'s use vector addition. Suppose each photon has momentum p, with components p_x and p_y. For the upper photon, p_x = p cos(theta), p_y = p sin(theta). For the lower photon, p_x = p cos(theta), p_y = -p sin(theta). Total momentum is (2p cos(theta), 0). Therefore, the total momentum is 2p cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c. As before.\n\nBut p = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. So, 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c. Since m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV / c. So, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. Same equation. So, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. The invariant mass squared should be equal before and after collision. Let\'s check.\n\nBefore collision, s = (E_e + E_p)^2 - (p_e c - p_p c)^2. Wait, since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So, p_total = p_e - p_p. Let\'s compute s:\n\ns = (E_e + E_p)^2 - (p_e c - p_p c)^2.\n\nE_e = 4 * 0.511 MeV, E_p = 2 * 0.511 MeV. So, E_total = 6 * 0.511 = 3.066 MeV.\n\np_e c = gamma_e beta_e m_e c^2 = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 * 0.511 MeV ≈ sqrt(15) * 0.511 ≈ 3.8728 * 0.511 ≈ 1.979 MeV.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e. But v_e = beta_e c. So, p_e c = gamma_e m_e beta_e c^2. Since m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, p_e c = gamma_e beta_e * 0.511 MeV. For the electron, gamma_e beta_e = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8728. Therefore, p_e c ≈ 3.8728 * 0.511 ≈ 1.979 MeV.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p beta_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Therefore, p_p c = 1.732 * 0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV. But since the positron is moving left, p_p c is -0.885 MeV.\n\nTherefore, total momentum times c is p_total c = 1.979 - 0.885 ≈ 1.094 MeV. Therefore, s = (3.066)^2 - (1.094)^2 ≈ 9.403 - 1.197 ≈ 8.206 (MeV)^2.\n\nAfter collision, the two photons have total energy 3.066 MeV and total momentum 1.094 MeV / c. The invariant s should be the same. For photons, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Since photons are massless, the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since E1 = E2 = 1.533 MeV, and p1 c = E1, p2 c = E2. However, vectors matter. The total momentum vector is (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta), 0). Therefore, (sum p c)^2 = (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta))^2. Therefore, s = (3.066)^2 - (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta))^2. This should equal 8.206 (MeV)^2.\n\nCompute (3.066)^2 = 9.403. Then, 9.403 - (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = 8.206. Therefore, (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = 9.403 - 8.206 = 1.197. Therefore, 3.066 * cos(theta) = sqrt(1.197) ≈ 1.094. Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568. So, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. This confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is approximately 138 degrees. But let me check if there\'s a possible mistake in the calculation of gamma beta.\n\nWait, for the electron, gamma is 4, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. Therefore, gamma beta is 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8728. Correct. For the positron, gamma is 2, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Therefore, gamma beta is 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Correct. So, the momentum contributions are correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this: the system\'s total momentum is to the right. Therefore, the photons must be moving predominantly in the right direction. The fact that they are at angles theta and -theta from the horizontal axis means that their horizontal components add up, and vertical components cancel. The angle between them is 2 theta. Since theta is 69 degrees, the angle between them is 138 degrees, which is 180 - 42 degrees. So, they are not back-to-back, which would be 180 degrees, but slightly bent forward due to the system\'s momentum. This makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. However, let me check if the problem states that both photons are moving to the right. Yes: "one of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction." So, both are moving to the right, with vertical components. Therefore, the angle between them is indeed 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the horizontal. So, 138 degrees is the answer.\n\nBut wait, 138 degrees is quite a large angle. Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose each photon is at 69 degrees from the horizontal. Then, the angle between their direction vectors would be the difference in their angles. Since one is +69 and the other -69, the angle between them is 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees. Yes, that\'s correct. For example, if two vectors are at +theta and -theta from the x-axis, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors, the dot product between the two photon directions. Let’s say photon 1 is (cos(theta), sin(theta)), photon 2 is (cos(theta), -sin(theta)). The dot product is cos(theta)^2 - sin(theta)^2 = cos(2 theta). The angle phi between them satisfies cos(phi) = cos(2 theta). Therefore, phi = 2 theta. So, yes, the angle between them is twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. Therefore, 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees.\n\nTherefore, after thorough calculation and verification, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees. However, to ensure precision, let me compute the arccos(0.3568) more accurately.\n\ncos(theta) ≈ 0.3568. Let\'s compute theta:\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check with a calculator:\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5\n\ncos(70°) ≈ 0.3420\n\nSo, 0.3568 is between 60° and 70°, closer to 69°. Let\'s compute it more precisely.\n\nLet’s use the Taylor series for arccos around 0.35. Alternatively, use linear approximation between 60° and 70°.\n\nAt 65°, cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226. Hmm, 0.3568 is lower. Wait, perhaps between 65° and 70°.\n\nWait, cos(60°) = 0.5\n\ncos(65°) ≈ 0.4226\n\ncos(70°) ≈ 0.3420\n\ncos(75°) ≈ 0.2588\n\nSo, 0.3568 is between 70° and 65°, but closer to 70°. Let\'s do linear interpolation between 65° and 70°.\n\nAt 70°, 0.3420\n\nAt 65°, 0.4226\n\nDifference between 65° and 70°: 0.4226 - 0.3420 = 0.0806 over 5 degrees.\n\nWe need to find x where 0.3420 + (70 - x)/5 * 0.0806 = 0.3568\n\nWait, perhaps better to set up:\n\nLet’s let theta = 70° - delta, where delta is the difference from 70°.\n\ncos(theta) = 0.3420 + delta * (0.4226 - 0.3420)/5 ≈ 0.3420 + delta * 0.0161 per degree.\n\nWait, but actually, the derivative of cos(theta) at theta = 70° is -sin(70°) ≈ -0.9397 radians. Wait, but in degrees, the derivative is different. Wait, perhaps better to convert to radians.\n\nLet’s convert theta to radians. Let’s denote theta in radians.\n\nWe have cos(theta) = 0.3568.\n\nLet’s use a calculator for higher precision. Alternatively, use the inverse cosine function.\n\nBut since I don\'t have a calculator here, let\'s estimate:\n\nWe know that cos(69°) ≈ cos(1.204 radians) ≈ 0.3584. Since 0.3568 is slightly less, so theta ≈ 69.5°. Let\'s check:\n\ncos(69.5°) = cos(69°30\') ≈ ?\n\nUsing a calculator (approximating):\n\ncos(69°) ≈ 0.3584\n\ncos(70°) ≈ 0.3420\n\nThe difference between 69° and 70° is 1°, and 0.3584 - 0.3420 = 0.0164.\n\nWe need to find how much past 69° gives 0.3568.\n\n0.3584 - 0.3568 = 0.0016. So, 0.0016 / 0.0164 ≈ 0.0976 of a degree. So, theta ≈ 69° + 0.0976° ≈ 69.0976°, approximately 69.1 degrees. Therefore, theta ≈ 69.1 degrees, so the angle between the photons is approximately 138.2 degrees. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given Lorentz factors are integers, but the answer might need to be in degrees as a whole number. However, the problem doesn\'t specify, but given the context, maybe an exact value is expected. Wait, but in the calculation, we had cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568. Is there an exact expression?\n\nWait, let\'s see. From the invariant s:\n\ns = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (3.066)^2 - (1.094)^2 ≈ 8.206 (MeV)^2.\n\nBut s is also equal to (sum E_photon)^2 - (sum p_photon c)^2. But sum E_photon = 3.066 MeV, sum p_photon c = 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 3.066 * cos(theta). Therefore,\n\ns = (3.066)^2 - (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = (3.066)^2 (1 - cos^2(theta)) = (3.066)^2 sin^2(theta).\n\nBut s = 8.206, so:\n\nsin(theta) = sqrt(8.206) / 3.066 ≈ sqrt(8.206)/3.066 ≈ 2.864 / 3.066 ≈ 0.934.\n\nTherefore, theta ≈ arcsin(0.934) ≈ 69.0 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. So, this gives the same result. Therefore, the angle is 138 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, since sin(theta) ≈ 0.934, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 138 degrees. However, to check if this is the case, perhaps there\'s a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the center-of-momentum frame. Let\'s compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame. Then, in that frame, the photons would be emitted back-to-back, 180 degrees apart. Then, transforming back to the lab frame, the angle would be different. However, this might complicate things, but let\'s try.\n\nFirst, compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum (COM) frame. The total energy is 3.066 MeV, and the total momentum is 1.094 MeV / c. The velocity of the COM frame is given by v_com = (p_total c^2) / E_total. So,\n\nv_com = (1.094 MeV / c * c^2) / 3.066 MeV = (1.094 c) / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568 c.\n\nTherefore, the COM frame is moving to the right at 0.3568 c. In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons are emitted in opposite directions, 180 degrees apart. However, when we boost back to the lab frame, their angles will change.\n\nBut since the problem states that in the lab frame, both photons are moving to the right, one upper, one lower. Therefore, in the COM frame, they must have been emitted in such a way that when boosted, their directions are both to the right. Let\'s see.\n\nIn the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees to each other. Let\'s say one is emitted at some angle phi, and the other at phi + 180 degrees. When we boost the frame to the lab frame (which is moving at -v_com = -0.3568 c relative to the COM frame), the angles of the photons will be aberrated.\n\nThe angle transformation under a boost can be calculated using the relativistic aberration formula:\n\ncos(theta\') = [cos(theta) + v/c] / [1 + (v/c) cos(theta)]\n\nWhere theta is the angle in the COM frame, and theta\' is the angle in the lab frame.\n\nBut since in the COM frame, the two photons are emitted at theta = phi and theta = phi + 180 degrees. However, since the photons are emitted back-to-back, if one is emitted at phi, the other is at phi + 180. After boosting, their angles will be aberrated.\n\nBut this might get complicated. However, since the problem states that both photons are moving to the right in the lab frame, their angles in the COM frame must be such that after the boost, they are both in the right hemisphere. Therefore, in the COM frame, they must be emitted in the forward direction (relative to the boost direction). Wait, the boost is from the lab frame to the COM frame, which is moving at v_com = 0.3568 c to the right. Therefore, to go from COM to lab, we boost at -v_com.\n\nIf in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at some angle theta, then in the lab frame, their angles will be shifted according to the aberration formula. For a photon emitted at theta = 90 degrees in the COM frame (perpendicular to the boost direction), in the lab frame, it would be shifted forward. However, in our case, the photons in the lab frame are both moving to the right, so their angles in the COM frame must be in the forward hemisphere.\n\nBut this approach might not be straightforward. However, since we already have the answer via conservation laws, and it\'s consistent, perhaps this is sufficient. The angle is 138 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider that in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees. When boosted to the lab frame, their angles will be compressed forward. However, since the boost is not too large (v_com ≈ 0.3568 c), the angle between them reduces. Wait, but in our case, the angle in the lab frame is 138 degrees, which is less than 180 degrees. Wait, but 138 is less than 180, so the angle is compressed. But according to the previous calculation, the angle is 138 degrees. However, this seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees. When you boost in the direction of one of the photons, that photon\'s angle becomes smaller (more forward), and the other photon, which was going opposite, now has a larger angle. Wait, but in our case, both photons are moving to the right in the lab frame. Therefore, in the COM frame, both photons must have been moving in the direction opposite to the boost direction. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s better to stick with the conservation laws approach. Since we\'ve confirmed through multiple methods that the angle is 138 degrees, and all steps check out, I think that\'s the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the directions of the two photons is 138 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is \\boxed{138^\\circ}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446507, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6806, prompt_tokens=1040, total_tokens=7846, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors 4 and 2, respectively. After colliding, they annihilate into two photons with equal energies, moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. We need to determine the angle between these photons.

1. **Energy and Momentum Calculation**:
   - The total energy of the electron and positron is \( E_{\text{total}} = 4 \cdot 0.511 \, \text{MeV} + 2 \cdot 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 3.066 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The momentum of the electron: \( p_e = 4 \cdot m_e \cdot \beta_e \cdot c \approx 3.8728 \cdot m_e \cdot c \).
   - The momentum of the positron: \( p_p = 2 \cdot m_e \cdot \beta_p \cdot c \approx 1.732 \cdot m_e \cdot c \) (negative due to direction).
   - Total momentum: \( p_{\text{total}} = 3.8728 \cdot m_e \cdot c - 1.732 \cdot m_e \cdot c \approx 2.1408 \cdot m_e \cdot c \).

2. **Photon Energies and Momenta**:
   - Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{3.066 \, \text{MeV}}{2} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Momentum of each photon: \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{1.533 \, \text{MeV}}{c} \).

3. **Momentum Conservation**:
   - The horizontal components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum:
     \[
     2 \cdot p_{\text{photon}} \cdot \cos(\theta) = p_{\text{total}}
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     2 \cdot \frac{1.533 \, \text{MeV}}{c} \cdot \cos(\theta) = 2.1408 \cdot \frac{0.511 \, \text{MeV}}{c}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \cos(\theta) \):
     \[
     \cos(\theta) \approx \frac{1.094}{3.066} \approx 0.3568
     \]
   - Finding \( \theta \):
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ
     \]

4. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2 \theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ \).

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

But p = E_photon / c = (1.533 MeV)/c. However, m_e * c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is 0.511 MeV. Therefore, m_e * c = 0.511 MeV / c. Substituting into the equation:

2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c)

Simplify:

2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 2.1408 * 0.511

Calculate the right-hand side: 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094.

Left-hand side: 3.066 * cos(theta) ≈ 1.094

Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

But wait, the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So, each photon is at an angle theta above and below the horizontal axis. Therefore, the angle between them is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees. However, 69 degrees seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations again.

First, let's redo the momentum calculation. The electron's momentum is gamma * m_e * beta_e * c. Gamma for the electron is 4, beta_e is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. So, p_e = 4 * m_e * c * 0.9682 ≈ 3.8728 m_e c.

The positron's momentum is gamma * m_e * beta_p * c. Gamma is 2, beta_p is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. But since it's moving to the left, p_p = -2 * m_e * c * 0.8660 ≈ -1.732 m_e c.

Total momentum before collision: p_total = p_e + p_p = 3.8728 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c ≈ 2.1408 m_e c. Correct.

After collision, two photons with equal energy. Each photon's energy is 3.066 MeV / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Therefore, each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c.

But m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, m_e c = 0.511 / c * c^2 = 0.511 c (MeV units). Wait, perhaps I need to express m_e c in terms of MeV. Let me think.

Actually, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c. Therefore, m_e c has units of MeV / c. So, when we have p_total = 2.1408 m_e c, that's 2.1408 * (0.511 MeV / c) ≈ 1.094 MeV / c.

But each photon's momentum is 1.533 MeV / c. So, the total horizontal momentum from both photons is 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 3.066 * cos(theta) MeV / c.

Setting this equal to the initial momentum:

3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094

Therefore, cos(theta) = 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees.

But wait, 138 degrees is a very large angle. Let me check if this makes sense. If the photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, their angle with respect to each other is indeed twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. But is there another way to approach this?

Alternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum in 4-vector formalism. Let's consider the total energy and momentum before collision. The total energy is E_total = gamma_e m_e c^2 + gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) * 0.511 MeV = 3.066 MeV. The total momentum is p_total = gamma_e m_e beta_e c - gamma_p m_e beta_p c. Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So, p_total = (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) m_e c.

Calculating gamma_e beta_e for the electron: gamma = 4, beta ≈ 0.9682, so gamma beta ≈ 4 * 0.9682 ≈ 3.8728.

For the positron, gamma = 2, beta ≈ 0.8660, so gamma beta ≈ 2 * 0.8660 ≈ 1.732. Since it's moving left, subtract this: 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408. Therefore, p_total = 2.1408 m_e c. As before.

After annihilation, the two photons must have total energy 3.066 MeV and total momentum 2.1408 m_e c. Since the photons have equal energy, each has energy 1.533 MeV. Let’s denote the two photons as having momentum vectors p1 and p2. Since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = |p| c. Therefore, |p1| = |p2| = 1.533 MeV / c.

The total momentum vector is p1 + p2. Let’s denote the angles of the photons with respect to the horizontal axis as theta and -theta (since one is upper, the other lower). Then, the horizontal components are p1 cos(theta) + p2 cos(-theta) = 2 p_photon cos(theta). The vertical components are p1 sin(theta) + p2 sin(-theta) = 0, which cancels out. Therefore, the total momentum is 2 p_photon cos(theta) in the horizontal direction. Setting this equal to the initial momentum:

2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

But m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV / c.

Thus:

2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094

So, 3.066 * cos(theta) = 1.094

cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568

Therefore, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Hence, the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees. That's 180 - 42 = 138 degrees. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the direction of the positron's momentum.

Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So, the total momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - |p_p|. So, yes, 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, but that might complicate things. Let me try that. If c=1, then energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV. The electron's rest mass is 0.511 MeV. The total energy is 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. The total momentum is (4*beta_e - 2*beta_p) * 0.511. Wait, beta_e is 0.9682, beta_p is 0.8660. So, (4*0.9682 - 2*0.8660) * 0.511 ≈ (3.8728 - 1.732) * 0.511 ≈ 2.1408 * 0.511 ≈ 1.094 MeV. So, total momentum is 1.094 MeV (since c=1, momentum is MeV/c, but with c=1, it's MeV). So, the total momentum is 1.094 MeV.

Each photon has energy 1.533 MeV. So, their momenta are 1.533 MeV. The horizontal components must sum to 1.094 MeV. So, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. Same as before. So, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568, theta ≈ 69 degrees. So, angle between them is 138 degrees. So, that seems consistent.

But wait, 138 degrees is quite a large angle. Let me think if that's physically reasonable. If the electron is moving faster than the positron, the total momentum is to the right. So, after annihilation, the photons must carry net momentum to the right. If they are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, their horizontal components add up, while vertical components cancel. So, the angle between them is 2 theta. If theta is 69 degrees, then the angle between them is 138 degrees, which is obtuse. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, if the photons were emitted in opposite directions, the angle would be 180 degrees, but here, due to the net momentum, the angle is less. Wait, but 138 is less than 180. Wait, no, 138 is more than 90, but less than 180. Hmm. Wait, if the net momentum is to the right, the photons can't be emitted directly opposite each other, because that would result in zero net momentum. So, they have to be emitted more in the forward direction. But in this case, the problem states that both are moving to the right, one upper, one lower. So, their directions are both rightward, but with vertical components. So, the angle between them is the angle between two vectors in the upper-right and lower-right quadrants. So, if each is at 69 degrees from the horizontal, then the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. That seems correct.

But let me check with another approach. Let's use vector addition. Suppose each photon has momentum p, with components p_x and p_y. For the upper photon, p_x = p cos(theta), p_y = p sin(theta). For the lower photon, p_x = p cos(theta), p_y = -p sin(theta). Total momentum is (2p cos(theta), 0). Therefore, the total momentum is 2p cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c. As before.

But p = E_photon / c = 1.533 MeV / c. So, 2 * (1.533 MeV / c) * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c. Since m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, m_e c = 0.511 MeV / c. Therefore, 2.1408 m_e c = 2.1408 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.094 MeV / c. So, 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 1.094. Same equation. So, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. The invariant mass squared should be equal before and after collision. Let's check.

Before collision, s = (E_e + E_p)^2 - (p_e c - p_p c)^2. Wait, since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So, p_total = p_e - p_p. Let's compute s:

s = (E_e + E_p)^2 - (p_e c - p_p c)^2.

E_e = 4 * 0.511 MeV, E_p = 2 * 0.511 MeV. So, E_total = 6 * 0.511 = 3.066 MeV.

p_e c = gamma_e beta_e m_e c^2 = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 * 0.511 MeV ≈ sqrt(15) * 0.511 ≈ 3.8728 * 0.511 ≈ 1.979 MeV.

Wait, hold on. Wait, p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e. But v_e = beta_e c. So, p_e c = gamma_e m_e beta_e c^2. Since m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, p_e c = gamma_e beta_e * 0.511 MeV. For the electron, gamma_e beta_e = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8728. Therefore, p_e c ≈ 3.8728 * 0.511 ≈ 1.979 MeV.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p beta_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Therefore, p_p c = 1.732 * 0.511 ≈ 0.885 MeV. But since the positron is moving left, p_p c is -0.885 MeV.

Therefore, total momentum times c is p_total c = 1.979 - 0.885 ≈ 1.094 MeV. Therefore, s = (3.066)^2 - (1.094)^2 ≈ 9.403 - 1.197 ≈ 8.206 (MeV)^2.

After collision, the two photons have total energy 3.066 MeV and total momentum 1.094 MeV / c. The invariant s should be the same. For photons, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Since photons are massless, the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since E1 = E2 = 1.533 MeV, and p1 c = E1, p2 c = E2. However, vectors matter. The total momentum vector is (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta), 0). Therefore, (sum p c)^2 = (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta))^2. Therefore, s = (3.066)^2 - (2 * 1.533 * cos(theta))^2. This should equal 8.206 (MeV)^2.

Compute (3.066)^2 = 9.403. Then, 9.403 - (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = 8.206. Therefore, (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = 9.403 - 8.206 = 1.197. Therefore, 3.066 * cos(theta) = sqrt(1.197) ≈ 1.094. Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ 1.094 / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568. So, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. This confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is approximately 138 degrees. But let me check if there's a possible mistake in the calculation of gamma beta.

Wait, for the electron, gamma is 4, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. Therefore, gamma beta is 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8728. Correct. For the positron, gamma is 2, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Therefore, gamma beta is 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Correct. So, the momentum contributions are correct.

Another way to think about this: the system's total momentum is to the right. Therefore, the photons must be moving predominantly in the right direction. The fact that they are at angles theta and -theta from the horizontal axis means that their horizontal components add up, and vertical components cancel. The angle between them is 2 theta. Since theta is 69 degrees, the angle between them is 138 degrees, which is 180 - 42 degrees. So, they are not back-to-back, which would be 180 degrees, but slightly bent forward due to the system's momentum. This makes sense.

Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. However, let me check if the problem states that both photons are moving to the right. Yes: "one of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction." So, both are moving to the right, with vertical components. Therefore, the angle between them is indeed 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the horizontal. So, 138 degrees is the answer.

But wait, 138 degrees is quite a large angle. Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose each photon is at 69 degrees from the horizontal. Then, the angle between their direction vectors would be the difference in their angles. Since one is +69 and the other -69, the angle between them is 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees. Yes, that's correct. For example, if two vectors are at +theta and -theta from the x-axis, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Alternatively, using vectors, the dot product between the two photon directions. Let’s say photon 1 is (cos(theta), sin(theta)), photon 2 is (cos(theta), -sin(theta)). The dot product is cos(theta)^2 - sin(theta)^2 = cos(2 theta). The angle phi between them satisfies cos(phi) = cos(2 theta). Therefore, phi = 2 theta. So, yes, the angle between them is twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. Therefore, 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees.

Therefore, after thorough calculation and verification, the angle between the photons is 138 degrees. However, to ensure precision, let me compute the arccos(0.3568) more accurately.

cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568. Let's compute theta:

Using a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check with a calculator:

cos(60°) = 0.5

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

So, 0.3568 is between 60° and 70°, closer to 69°. Let's compute it more precisely.

Let’s use the Taylor series for arccos around 0.35. Alternatively, use linear approximation between 60° and 70°.

At 65°, cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226. Hmm, 0.3568 is lower. Wait, perhaps between 65° and 70°.

Wait, cos(60°) = 0.5

cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588

So, 0.3568 is between 70° and 65°, but closer to 70°. Let's do linear interpolation between 65° and 70°.

At 70°, 0.3420

At 65°, 0.4226

Difference between 65° and 70°: 0.4226 - 0.3420 = 0.0806 over 5 degrees.

We need to find x where 0.3420 + (70 - x)/5 * 0.0806 = 0.3568

Wait, perhaps better to set up:

Let’s let theta = 70° - delta, where delta is the difference from 70°.

cos(theta) = 0.3420 + delta * (0.4226 - 0.3420)/5 ≈ 0.3420 + delta * 0.0161 per degree.

Wait, but actually, the derivative of cos(theta) at theta = 70° is -sin(70°) ≈ -0.9397 radians. Wait, but in degrees, the derivative is different. Wait, perhaps better to convert to radians.

Let’s convert theta to radians. Let’s denote theta in radians.

We have cos(theta) = 0.3568.

Let’s use a calculator for higher precision. Alternatively, use the inverse cosine function.

But since I don't have a calculator here, let's estimate:

We know that cos(69°) ≈ cos(1.204 radians) ≈ 0.3584. Since 0.3568 is slightly less, so theta ≈ 69.5°. Let's check:

cos(69.5°) = cos(69°30') ≈ ?

Using a calculator (approximating):

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

The difference between 69° and 70° is 1°, and 0.3584 - 0.3420 = 0.0164.

We need to find how much past 69° gives 0.3568.

0.3584 - 0.3568 = 0.0016. So, 0.0016 / 0.0164 ≈ 0.0976 of a degree. So, theta ≈ 69° + 0.0976° ≈ 69.0976°, approximately 69.1 degrees. Therefore, theta ≈ 69.1 degrees, so the angle between the photons is approximately 138.2 degrees. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given Lorentz factors are integers, but the answer might need to be in degrees as a whole number. However, the problem doesn't specify, but given the context, maybe an exact value is expected. Wait, but in the calculation, we had cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568. Is there an exact expression?

Wait, let's see. From the invariant s:

s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (3.066)^2 - (1.094)^2 ≈ 8.206 (MeV)^2.

But s is also equal to (sum E_photon)^2 - (sum p_photon c)^2. But sum E_photon = 3.066 MeV, sum p_photon c = 2 * 1.533 * cos(theta) = 3.066 * cos(theta). Therefore,

s = (3.066)^2 - (3.066 * cos(theta))^2 = (3.066)^2 (1 - cos^2(theta)) = (3.066)^2 sin^2(theta).

But s = 8.206, so:

sin(theta) = sqrt(8.206) / 3.066 ≈ sqrt(8.206)/3.066 ≈ 2.864 / 3.066 ≈ 0.934.

Therefore, theta ≈ arcsin(0.934) ≈ 69.0 degrees. Therefore, angle between photons is 138 degrees. So, this gives the same result. Therefore, the angle is 138 degrees.

Alternatively, since sin(theta) ≈ 0.934, theta ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 138 degrees. However, to check if this is the case, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, using the center-of-momentum frame. Let's compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame. Then, in that frame, the photons would be emitted back-to-back, 180 degrees apart. Then, transforming back to the lab frame, the angle would be different. However, this might complicate things, but let's try.

First, compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum (COM) frame. The total energy is 3.066 MeV, and the total momentum is 1.094 MeV / c. The velocity of the COM frame is given by v_com = (p_total c^2) / E_total. So,

v_com = (1.094 MeV / c * c^2) / 3.066 MeV = (1.094 c) / 3.066 ≈ 0.3568 c.

Therefore, the COM frame is moving to the right at 0.3568 c. In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons are emitted in opposite directions, 180 degrees apart. However, when we boost back to the lab frame, their angles will change.

But since the problem states that in the lab frame, both photons are moving to the right, one upper, one lower. Therefore, in the COM frame, they must have been emitted in such a way that when boosted, their directions are both to the right. Let's see.

In the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees to each other. Let's say one is emitted at some angle phi, and the other at phi + 180 degrees. When we boost the frame to the lab frame (which is moving at -v_com = -0.3568 c relative to the COM frame), the angles of the photons will be aberrated.

The angle transformation under a boost can be calculated using the relativistic aberration formula:

cos(theta') = [cos(theta) + v/c] / [1 + (v/c) cos(theta)]

Where theta is the angle in the COM frame, and theta' is the angle in the lab frame.

But since in the COM frame, the two photons are emitted at theta = phi and theta = phi + 180 degrees. However, since the photons are emitted back-to-back, if one is emitted at phi, the other is at phi + 180. After boosting, their angles will be aberrated.

But this might get complicated. However, since the problem states that both photons are moving to the right in the lab frame, their angles in the COM frame must be such that after the boost, they are both in the right hemisphere. Therefore, in the COM frame, they must be emitted in the forward direction (relative to the boost direction). Wait, the boost is from the lab frame to the COM frame, which is moving at v_com = 0.3568 c to the right. Therefore, to go from COM to lab, we boost at -v_com.

If in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at some angle theta, then in the lab frame, their angles will be shifted according to the aberration formula. For a photon emitted at theta = 90 degrees in the COM frame (perpendicular to the boost direction), in the lab frame, it would be shifted forward. However, in our case, the photons in the lab frame are both moving to the right, so their angles in the COM frame must be in the forward hemisphere.

But this approach might not be straightforward. However, since we already have the answer via conservation laws, and it's consistent, perhaps this is sufficient. The angle is 138 degrees.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees. When boosted to the lab frame, their angles will be compressed forward. However, since the boost is not too large (v_com ≈ 0.3568 c), the angle between them reduces. Wait, but in our case, the angle in the lab frame is 138 degrees, which is less than 180 degrees. Wait, but 138 is less than 180, so the angle is compressed. But according to the previous calculation, the angle is 138 degrees. However, this seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, in the COM frame, the photons are emitted at 180 degrees. When you boost in the direction of one of the photons, that photon's angle becomes smaller (more forward), and the other photon, which was going opposite, now has a larger angle. Wait, but in our case, both photons are moving to the right in the lab frame. Therefore, in the COM frame, both photons must have been moving in the direction opposite to the boost direction. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the conservation laws approach. Since we've confirmed through multiple methods that the angle is 138 degrees, and all steps check out, I think that's the correct answer.

Therefore, the angle between the directions of the two photons is 138 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The angle between the directions of the photons is \boxed{138^\circ}.
