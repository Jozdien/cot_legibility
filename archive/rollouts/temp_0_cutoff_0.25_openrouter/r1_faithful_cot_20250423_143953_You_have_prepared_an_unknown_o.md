The given 1H NMR data corresponds to **trans-butenyl acetate**. Here's the analysis:

1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:  
   - A doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration in a double bond. This proton is one of the two vinyl protons in the trans arrangement.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:  
   - A doublet of quartets (dq) suggests a proton coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. This corresponds to the proton adjacent to the double bond (coupled to the trans vinyl proton, J = 16 Hz) and a neighboring methyl group (J â‰ˆ 6-7 Hz).

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:  
   - A singlet integrating to 3H is characteristic of the methyl group in the acetate moiety (OAc).

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:  
   - A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group. This methyl is adjacent to the proton at 5.5 ppm, which splits its signal into a doublet.

**Structure and Reasoning**:  
The compound must have a **trans double bond** (J = 16 Hz), a methyl group adjacent to a CH (1.6 ppm), and an acetate group (2.1 ppm). The **butenyl** chain (four carbons) accommodates these features:  
- **trans-2-butenyl acetate**: CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc.  
  - The trans double bond (C2-C3) explains the 7.0 ppm doublet.  
  - The proton on C3 (adjacent to the double bond and CH2-OAc) appears as a dq at 5.5 ppm.  
  - The methyl group on C1 (CH3) is split by the adjacent CH2 group, giving the 1.6 ppm doublet.  

**Conclusion**: The data matches **trans-butenyl acetate**. 

**Answer**: Trans-butenyl acetate.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which compound this NMR data corresponds to. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm. Alright, let's start by recalling what each of these compounds looks like.

First, propenyl vs. butenyl. Propenyl would be a three-carbon chain with a double bond, and butenyl would be four carbons. The acetate part is probably an acetyloxy group, OAc. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-OAc for propenyl acetate, but wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- or CH3-CH=CH-? Actually, propenyl can be allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-, but sometimes it's used for the vinyl group. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the substituents. The acetate would be OAc, so the structure would be something like CH2=CH-OAc if it's propenyl acetate. But wait, propenyl is three carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH3-C(O)O-CH2CH=CH2? Wait, no, the name would be propenyl acetate, which is the ester formed from acetic acid and propenol. So propenol would be allyl alcohol, CH2=CHCH2OH, so propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl acetate would be from a four-carbon alcohol with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, depending on the position of the double bond.

But the question mentions cis and trans for both propenyl and butenyl. So the double bond in the propenyl or butenyl group would have cis or trans stereochemistry. For propenyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (allyl group), so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so there's no possibility for cis or trans because the substituents on both carbons are the same (two H on C1 and CH2-OAc on C2). Wait, no, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-OAc? Wait, that would be vinyl acetate, which is a different compound. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check.

Propenyl groups: The term propenyl refers to a three-carbon chain with a double bond. The possible structures are CH2=CHCH2- (allyl group) or CH3-CH=CH- (1-propenyl or 2-propenyl). Wait, I think the correct IUPAC name for allyl group is 2-propenyl, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But then, where is the double bond? Between C1 and C2 (so 1-propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-?), but I think the allyl group is 2-propenyl. So the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Let me clarify. For propenyl, the three carbons are 1, 2, 3. If the double bond is between 1 and 2, it's 1-propenyl: CH2=CHCH2-. If between 2 and 3, it's 2-propenyl: CH3-CH=CH-. Wait, but I think the allyl group is 2-propenyl, which is CH2=CHCH2-. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the numbering. Let's say the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then the double bond is between C1 and C2. But in that case, the substituents on the double bond are two H's on C1 and a CH2-OAc on C2. So there's no possibility for cis or trans because one end has two identical groups (H and H) and the other has CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but that can't be right. Maybe the propenyl group is actually CH3-CH=CH-OAc? No, that would be butenyl if it's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let's think again.

The problem gives options of cis/trans propenyl acetate and cis/trans butenyl acetate. So the propenyl would have three carbons with a double bond, and butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. The acetate is the ester group, so the structure would be OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHOAc for propenyl acetate (vinyl acetate), but that's only two carbons. Wait, no, vinyl is two carbons. Propenyl would be three. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate). But in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are H and H on C1, and CH2OAc and H on C2. So there's no possibility for cis or trans because one end has two H's. Therefore, maybe the propenyl acetate in the question is actually a different structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it possible for cis and trans isomerism. For example, if the structure is CH2CH=CHOAc, but that would be propenyl if the chain is three carbons. Wait, but that would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc, which is 1-propenyl? No, maybe the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, but that would be a three-carbon chain with the double bond between C2 and C3, making it trans or cis. Wait, but that would be 2-propenyl acetate? I'm getting confused here. Let me try to draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is allyl acetate. In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's no possibility for cis/trans because both substituents on C1 are H, and on C2 are CH2-OAc and H. So that can't have cis/trans isomerism. Therefore, the propenyl acetate in the question must have the double bond in a position where there are two different groups on each carbon of the double bond. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's the same as allyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR data given. The 1H NMR has peaks at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). Let's analyze each peak.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with coupling constant 16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which is typical for trans double bonds. The coupling constant (J) for trans vinyl protons is around 12-18 Hz, while cis is usually lower, around 6-12 Hz. So a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans configuration. But wait, the peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so that proton is coupled to one other proton. If it's part of a double bond, the other proton would be on the adjacent carbon. So maybe this is one of the vinyl protons in a trans configuration.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets). A dq means that the proton is split into a doublet, and each of those is split into a quartet. So two coupling constants. The integration here is 1H. The 2.1 ppm peak is a singlet of 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like the acetate methyl (OAc, which is COOCH3). Wait, but the acetate group's methyl is usually around 2.0-2.1 ppm as a singlet because it's adjacent to the carbonyl. So that's probably the OAc's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. A doublet suggests coupling to one neighboring proton. A methyl group as a doublet would be adjacent to a CH group. For example, a CH(CH3) group. So maybe a methyl attached to a carbon that's next to a proton that's split. Let's think.

Putting this together: The compound has a trans double bond (J=16 Hz), a methyl group adjacent to a CH (1.6 ppm, d, 3H), the acetate methyl (2.1 ppm, s), and a proton at 5.5 ppm that's a dq. Let's try to piece this together.

The trans double bond (7.0 ppm, d, J=16) would have two protons, each as a doublet. But here, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Wait, maybe the other proton is at 5.5 ppm? Let's see. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the two protons would be H1 and H2. If H1 is at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), then H2 would be at a lower ppm, maybe around 5.5. But why is the 5.5 ppm peak a dq? Let's think. The H2 would be coupled to H1 (J=16 Hz) and also to another proton. So if H2 is adjacent to another proton (say, on C3), then it would be a doublet of doublets. But here it's a dq. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the H at 5.5 ppm is part of a CH group that's next to a methyl. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be butenyl, four carbons. Let's see.

Wait, let's consider the possible structures:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: If propenyl is three carbons with a double bond, and the acetate is on the end. For example, CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But as discussed earlier, this might not have cis/trans isomerism. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the chain is CH3-CH=CH-OAc), making it a propenyl group. In that case, the substituents on the double bond would be CH3 and OAc on one carbon, and H and H on the other. Wait, no. If the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, that's vinyl acetate, which is two carbons. But propenyl is three. So maybe the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate), which doesn't have cis/trans isomerism. Therefore, the options given must have the double bond in a position that allows cis/trans.

Alternatively, maybe the propenyl is CH3-C(=CH2)-OAc, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between propenyl and properlyl. Wait, no. Let's think about butenyl. Butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl), or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (2-butenyl), etc. In that case, the double bond could be between C1-C2 or C2-C3. For cis or trans.

Let's take trans-butenyl acetate as an example. If it's trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc with trans configuration. Wait, no. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc for 1-butenyl, but that's similar to allyl acetate but longer. Alternatively, 3-butenyl would be CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl), but then the double bond is at the end, so again, substituents would be H and H on one end, and CH2CH2-OAc on the other, so no cis/trans. Therefore, the double bond must be internal. So 2-butenyl acetate would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents would be CH3 and CH2-OAc on C2 and C3. Wait, no. Let me write it properly. 2-butenyl would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and CH2-OAc, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H? Wait, no. Let's number the chain. The butenyl group is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. If it's 2-butenyl, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. Wait, but the acetate is on C4? No, the acetate is on the end. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc (1-butenyl), but that's a terminal double bond. Alternatively, the acetate is on C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be OAc-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. That would be 3-butenyl acetate. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, with substituents CH2-OAc and CH3. So the configuration could be cis or trans. For example, trans would have the CH2-OAc and CH3 on opposite sides.

In that case, the protons on the double bond would be H2 and H3. The coupling constant J would be around 16 Hz for trans. So the H2 and H3 would each be doublets. But in the NMR data, we have one doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16) and another peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq. Let's see. If H2 is at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), then H3 would be at a lower ppm. But why is the 5.5 ppm peak a dq? Maybe H3 is coupled not only to H2 (J=16) but also to another proton, say, the adjacent CH(CH3) group. Wait, the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H, which would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe there's a CH(CH3) group adjacent to the double bond. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, making it butenyl. So butenyl acetate would have four carbons. Let's see. If the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, then the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a methyl branch on C3. But then the coupling for the double bond would be between H1 and H2. The H1 would be a doublet (coupled to H2), and H2 would be a multiplet. But in the NMR data, we have H at 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and another at 5.5 as a dq. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, but that's three carbons (propenyl). Wait, but then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents would be CH3 and OAc on C2 and C3. So cis or trans would apply here. For example, trans would have CH3 and OAc on opposite sides. The protons on the double bond would be H2 and H3. H2 would be adjacent to CH3 and OAc, and H3 would be adjacent to OAc and another group. Wait, but in this case, the structure would be CH3-CH=CH-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 would be coupled to H on C3 with J=16 Hz (trans). The H on C3 would be adjacent to OAc and maybe another group. But the OAc is on C3? Wait, no. If it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate), but that doesn't have cis/trans. Alternatively, if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the acetate is on C3. But that would make the chain three carbons (propenyl). In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are OAc and H. Wait, but that's not possible for cis/trans because one carbon has two different groups (CH3 and H) and the other has OAc and H. So the configuration would be E or Z. For example, if the CH3 and OAc are on the same side, it's cis (Z), and opposite is trans (E). The coupling constant J would be higher for trans (E), around 16 Hz. So the H on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be a doublet (coupled to H on C3), and the H on C3 would be a doublet as well. But in the NMR data, we have one doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5 ppm as a dq. The dq suggests that the proton is coupled to two different protons. Let's think. If the H on C3 is adjacent to OAc and also to a CH(CH3) group, then it would have coupling to the adjacent CH. Wait, but in the structure CH3-CH=CH-OAc, the C3 is CH-OAc. So the H on C3 is attached to the double bond and the OAc. But there's no adjacent CH group. So maybe that's not the right structure.

Alternatively, consider butenyl acetate. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a doublet (coupled to C2), and the protons on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to C1 and C3). But in the NMR data, there's a doublet at 7.0 ppm and a dq at 5.5. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans-2-butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C2 and C3. The protons on C2 and C3 would each be doublets (J=16 Hz for trans). The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 and the double bond, and H on C3 is adjacent to CH2-OAc and the double bond. So H2 would be a doublet (coupled to H3), and H3 would be a doublet as well. But where would the dq come in? Maybe there's another coupling. For example, if H3 is also adjacent to a CH2 group that's split. Wait, but in this structure, H3 is on C3, which is connected to C4 (CH2-OAc). So the H on C3 would be coupled to H on C2 (J=16 Hz) and possibly to the H's on C4. But the H's on C4 are part of a CH2 group next to OAc. The coupling between H3 and H4 might be small, but usually, coupling between protons separated by more than three bonds (like H-C=C-CH2) is negligible. So maybe the H3 is a doublet. Then why is there a dq at 5.5 ppm?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(OAc)-CH3. Wait, that would be 3-butenyl acetate? No, the acetate is on C3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OAc)-CH3. But that's a four-carbon chain with the double bond at C1-C2 and the acetate on C3. The protons on C1 would be a doublet (J=16), and the proton on C2 would be coupled to C1 and C3. The C3 has an OAc and a CH3. So the H on C2 would be a triplet? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the dq at 5.5 ppm is from a proton that's coupled to both the double bond proton and another proton. For example, if there's a CH group adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. Let's say the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-something. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let's go back to the NMR data. The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. That's a methyl group attached to a CH. For example, CH(CH3). So maybe there's a CH(CH3) group in the molecule. The 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl. The 7.0 ppm is a trans double bond proton (J=16). The 5.5 ppm is a dq. Let's try to build the structure.

Suppose the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (with trans configuration), then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 would be coupled to H on C3 with J=16 Hz. The H on C3 is adjacent to OAc. The H on C2 would be a doublet (coupled to H3), and the H on C3 would be a doublet as well. But where does the dq come in? Maybe the H on C3 is also coupled to another proton. If the OAc is on C3, then the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc. The H on C3 is attached to the double bond and the OAc. There's no adjacent protons except the H on C2. So that H would be a doublet. But in the data, there's a dq at 5.5 ppm. So maybe that's not the right structure.

Alternatively, consider butenyl acetate. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The H on C1 would be a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 would be a triplet (coupled to C1 and C3). But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm. Not matching. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans-2-butenyl acetate), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 is coupled to H on C3 (J=16), and also to the H on C1. So the H on C2 would be a doublet of doublets. Similarly, H on C3 would be coupled to H on C2 and H on C4. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm. Maybe the H on C3 is a dq. Let's see. If H3 is coupled to H2 (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2-OAc group. But coupling to adjacent CH2 would be through two bonds (geminal), which is usually not observed. Or maybe the H on C3 is coupled to a neighboring CH(CH3) group. Wait, but where is the CH(CH3) coming from? The 1.6 ppm peak is a methyl doublet, so it must be attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. That would be 3-butenyl acetate, with a methyl branch on C3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The H on C1 is a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 is coupled to H1 and the CH(CH3) group. So H2 would be a doublet of quartets? Wait, if H2 is coupled to H1 (J=16) and to the H on C3 (which is part of CH(CH3)), then the coupling constant between H2 and H3 would be smaller, maybe around 6-8 Hz. So the H2 would be a doublet of doublets. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the H on C3 is the one at 5.5 ppm. Let's see. If the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, then the H on C3 is attached to a CH(CH3) group. The H on C3 would be split by the adjacent methyl group and by the H on C2. Wait, but the methyl is on the same carbon as the H on C3. Geminal coupling is usually not observed. So the H on C3 would be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2=CH- group. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to draw the structure:

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc

The double bond is between C1 and C2. H1 and H2 are on the double bond. H1 would be a doublet (J=16) at around 7.0 ppm. H2 would be coupled to H1 (J=16) and to the H on C3. The H on C3 is part of a CH(CH3) group, so it's split by the adjacent H2 and by the two H's on C3's CH(CH3). Wait, no, the H on C3 is attached to the same carbon as the methyl. So the H on C3 would be a quartet due to coupling with the methyl group's protons? But methyl protons are all equivalent, so coupling to them would split the H into a quartet. But wait, coupling to three equivalent protons (methyl) would result in a quartet. However, the H on C3 is also coupled to H2. So the splitting would be a quartet (from the methyl) and a doublet (from H2), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). That matches the 5.5 ppm peak being a dq. And the methyl on C3 would be a doublet because it's attached to a CH that is split by the adjacent H. Wait, the methyl is on C3, which is a CH(CH3). The methyl protons are on the same carbon as the H, so they don't couple to it. Wait, no. The methyl group is -CH(CH3), so the H on C3 is adjacent to the methyl group's carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. So C3 is CH(CH3), and the H on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2 (double bond) and the methyl group. The H on C3 would be adjacent to the methyl group's carbon, but coupling between H and the methyl would be through three bonds (H-C-C-C), which is usually small or negligible. So the main coupling for H3 would be to H2 (J=16) and possibly to the adjacent OAc group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the H on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (J=16) and to another proton, like the H on C4 (if there is one). But in this structure, C4 is the OAc group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's summarize:

- The 7.0 ppm doublet (J=16) is one of the double bond protons, trans configuration.
- The 5.5 ppm dq is another proton, possibly adjacent to the double bond and coupled to another group.
- The 2.1 ppm singlet is the OAc methyl.
- The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH.

Putting this together, the structure likely has a trans double bond (J=16), a CH(CH3) group (explaining the 1.6 ppm doublet), and the OAc group. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. That's a four-carbon chain (butenyl), so butenyl acetate. The double bond is between C1 and C2, trans configuration. The CH(CH3) group is on C3. The H on C2 would be coupled to H1 (J=16) and to H3. H3 is on C3, which is CH(CH3). The H3 would be a dq because it's coupled to H2 (J=16) and to the adjacent methyl group's protons. Wait, but coupling to the methyl would be through three bonds (H-C-C-C), which is usually small. Alternatively, maybe the H3 is coupled to another proton. If the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, then the H on C3 is adjacent to the methyl and to the OAc. The OAc is on C4. Wait, no, the OAc is on C3? No, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. The OAc is on C3. So the acetate group is attached to C3. So the full structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that would make the chain three carbons (propenyl?), but with a methyl branch. Wait, no. The chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. That's four carbons: C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and OAc attached to C3. Wait, no, the OAc is an ester group, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3)? No, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 for butenyl acetate, but that's 4-pentenyl? No. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me try to write the correct IUPAC name. If it's trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (1-butenyl), but that's a terminal double bond. Alternatively, 2-butenyl would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on the double bond are CH2-OAc and CH3. So trans configuration would have those groups opposite each other. The protons on C2 and C3 would each be doublets with J=16 Hz. The H on C2 would be adjacent to CH2-OAc, and H on C3 adjacent to CH3. The H on C2 would be a doublet at around 7.0 ppm, and the H on C3 would be a doublet at lower ppm. But where is the dq? Maybe there's another coupling. For example, the H on C3 is also adjacent to the CH3 group. But coupling to CH3 would be through three bonds, which is usually small. Alternatively, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH2-OAc group, and the protons on the CH2 could couple with it. But that would be through three bonds as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider the structure OAc-O-CH(CH2CH2=CH2). No, that doesn't make sense. Let's think differently. The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that is split into a doublet. For example, if there's a CH(CH3) group, and the CH is split by a neighboring proton. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-OAc. Wait, but that would be a branch. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(OAc)-CH3. No, that's five carbons. Wait, but the options are propenyl or butenyl, so four carbons maximum. Let's try to think of a structure where there's a CH(CH3) group next to the double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The H on C1 is a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 is coupled to H1 and to the H on C3. The H on C3 is part of CH(CH3), so it would be a quartet due to coupling with the methyl, but also coupled to H2. So the H on C3 would be a doublet of quartets (dq), which matches the 5.5 ppm peak. The methyl on C3 would be a doublet because it's attached to a CH that is coupled to H2. Wait, but the methyl is on the same carbon as the H on C3. The coupling between the methyl protons and the H on C3 would be geminal, which is usually not observed. So the methyl would be a singlet. But in the data, it's a doublet. Therefore, that structure can't be right.

Wait, maybe the methyl is on a different carbon. Let's say the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3). No, that's not possible. The acetate is an ester, so it's OAc-O-R. The R group is the propenyl or butenyl. So the structure is R-OAc. For example, if R is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-, then the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that's four carbons (butenyl). The double bond is between C1 and C2. The H on C1 is a doublet (J=16), and the H on C2 is coupled to H1 and to the H on C3. The H on C3 is part of CH(CH3), so it's coupled to the methyl and to H2. But again, the methyl would be a singlet unless it's attached to a CH that is coupled to another proton. Wait, the methyl is on C3, which is CH(CH3). The H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (which has H2) and to the methyl. The coupling between H3 and the methyl would be through three bonds (H-C-C-C), which is usually small. So the main coupling for H3 is to H2 (J=16). But then H3 would be a doublet. But the data shows a dq. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dq is from a proton that's coupled to two different protons. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(OAc)-CH3. But that's five carbons. Not matching the options.

Wait, let's consider the possibility that the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 is coupled to H3 (J=16), and the H on C3 is adjacent to OAc. The H on C2 would be a doublet at around 7.0 ppm, and the H on C3 would be a doublet at lower ppm. The OAc methyl is at 2.1 ppm. The CH3 group on C2 would be a singlet? No, the CH3 is on C2, adjacent to the double bond. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc. The H on C2 is part of the double bond (CH=CH-), so the CH3 is on C1. Wait, no. Let me correct. If it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate), which doesn't have cis/trans. Alternatively, if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 and the double bond, and H on C3 is adjacent to OAc and the double bond. The coupling between H2 and H3 is J=16 (trans). The H2 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and H3 would be a doublet at lower ppm. The CH3 on C2 would be a singlet? No, the CH3 is on C1. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc. So C1 is CH3, C2 is CH=, C3 is CH-OAc. The H on C2 is coupled to H3 (J=16), so H2 is a doublet. The H on C3 is coupled to H2 and possibly to the adjacent OAc group. But OAc is an electronegative group, which might deshield the proton, but coupling to OAc's oxygen wouldn't split the proton. So H3 would be a doublet. The CH3 on C1 would be a triplet if it's next to CH2, but in this case, it's CH3-CH=, so the CH3 is a singlet. But in the data, there's a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). So this structure doesn't account for that. Therefore, this can't be the right structure.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet must be a methyl group attached to a CH that is split by a neighboring proton. For example, if there's a CH(CH3) group where the CH is adjacent to another proton. Let's say the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. The CH(CH3) is on C3. The H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (which has H2) and the methyl. The H on C3 would be coupled to H2 (J=16) and possibly to the methyl. But coupling to the methyl would be through three bonds, which is usually small. So the H3 would be a doublet (from J=16) with maybe a small coupling to the methyl, making it a doublet of quartets. But the methyl itself would be a singlet. However, in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm. That suggests the methyl is attached to a CH that is coupled to another proton. For example, if the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-..., where the CH2 is adjacent to a proton that causes splitting. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, consider the structure CH2=CH-OAc-CH(CH3). No, the acetate is an ester, so it's OAc-O-R. The R group must be the propenyl or butenyl. So R is CH2=CHCH2- (allyl) or CH2=CHCH2CH2- (butenyl), etc. If R is CH(CH3)-CH=CH2, then the structure is OAc-O-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. That would be 3-buten-1-yl acetate. The double bond is between C3 and C4. The H on C4 would be a doublet (J=16), and the H on C3 would be coupled to C4 and to the CH(CH3) group. The CH(CH3) group's H would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Let's see. The structure is OAc-O-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. The double bond is between C3 and C4. The H on C4 is a doublet (J=16) at 7.0 ppm. The H on C3 is coupled to H4 (J=16) and to the H on C2 (which is CH(CH3)). The H on C2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the methyl and the H on C3. The methyl on C2 would be a doublet because it's attached to a CH that is coupled to H3. Wait, the methyl is on C2, which is CH(CH3). The H on C2 is adjacent to the methyl and to C3. So the H on C2 would be a quartet (coupled to the three methyl protons) and a doublet (coupled to H3). So overall, a quartet of doublets, which might appear as a multiplet. But in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm, which suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH that is split into a doublet by one neighboring proton. So if the CH(CH3) group's H is split by one proton (from C3), then the methyl would be a doublet. That fits. So in this structure:

OAc-O-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2

The H on C4 (CH2=) is a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16). The H on C3 (CH=) is coupled to H4 (J=16) and to H2 (CH(CH3)). The H on C2 (CH(CH3)) is coupled to H3 and to the methyl. The methyl on C2 is a doublet because the H on C2 is split by H3. The H on C3 would be a dq: coupled to H4 (J=16) and to H2. So the splitting would be a doublet (from J=16) and a quartet (from coupling to H2), making a doublet of quartets, which matches the 5.5 ppm peak. The OAc methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s). The methyl on C2 is at 1.6 ppm (d). This structure fits the data. But what is the name of this compound? The R group is CH(CH3)-CH=CH2, which is 3-buten-1-yl with a methyl branch on C2. The correct IUPAC name would be 3-buten-1-yl acetate, but the options are cis/trans propenyl or butenyl. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (assuming the acetate is on C1). Wait, the structure is OAc-O-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. The chain is four carbons: OAc-O-C1-C2-C3=C4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, making it a 3-butenyl group. The configuration of the double bond would be trans due to J=16 Hz. So the name would be trans-3-butenyl acetate. But the options are cis/trans propenyl or butenyl. The butenyl options are likely 2-butenyl, so maybe this structure isn't one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is trans-2-butenyl acetate.

Let me try another approach. The presence of a dq at 5.5 ppm suggests a proton that is coupled to two different protons with different coupling constants. For example, one coupling from the trans double bond (J=16) and another from a neighboring CH3 group (J=6-7 Hz). So the splitting would be a doublet of quartets, but maybe it's a dq. If the structure is trans-2-butenyl acetate: CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The H on C2 is coupled to H3 (J=16) and to the CH3 on C1. The H on C3 is coupled to H2 (J=16) and to the CH2-OAc on C4. The CH3 on C1 would be a triplet because it's adjacent to CH2. Wait, no, the CH3 is on C1, which is CH3-CH=, so the CH3 is a singlet. The H on C2 would be a doublet (J=16), and the H on C3 would be a doublet as well. The CH2-OAc would be a triplet. But in the data, there's a dq at 5.5 ppm. This doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the structure is trans-1-propenyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is trans-butenyl acetate. The coupling constant of 16 Hz indicates trans configuration. The dq at 5.5 ppm suggests a proton coupled to two others, which would be the case in a butenyl group where the proton is adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. The methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm suggests a CH(CH3) group. Therefore, the structure is likely trans-butenyl acetate with a methyl branch, making it trans-3-butenyl acetate or similar. But the options are cis/trans propenyl or butenyl. Since propenyl can't have cis/trans (if the double bond is terminal), the answer must be trans-butenyl acetate.

But I need to confirm. Let's check the splitting again. If it's trans-butenyl acetate, say, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl, trans), but that's a terminal double bond, which doesn't have cis/trans. So must be internal double bond. For example, trans-2-butenyl acetate: CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The H on C2 and C3 would each be doublets (J=16). The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3, and H on C3 is adjacent to CH2-OAc. The CH3 on C1 would be a singlet. The CH2-OAc would be a triplet. But where is the dq? Not matching. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc (3-butenyl acetate, trans), the H on C1 is a doublet (J=16), H on C2 is coupled to H1 and to H3. H3 is on CH(CH3), so coupled to H2 and to the methyl. The H3 would be a dq (coupled to H2 and methyl). The methyl would be a doublet because it's attached to a CH that is coupled to H3. This matches the data. The name would be trans-2-butenyl acetate? Or trans-3-butenyl acetate? Depending on the numbering. If the acetate is on C4, then the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (trans), the methyl on C3, and the acetate on C4. Wait, but that's four carbons, so butenyl. The correct IUPAC name would be 3-methyl-1-butenyl acetate, but the options are just cis/trans butenyl. Assuming the double bond is trans, the answer would be trans-butenyl acetate. Since the options don't specify the position, but just cis/trans and propenyl/butenyl, the presence of the methyl group (from the 1.6 ppm peak) indicates it's butenyl, as propenyl wouldn't have that methyl. Therefore, the answer is trans-butenyl acetate.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which compound this NMR data corresponds to. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm. Alright, let's start by recalling what each of these compounds looks like.

First, propenyl vs. butenyl. Propenyl would be a three-carbon chain with a double bond, and butenyl would be four carbons. The acetate part is probably an acetyloxy group, OAc. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-OAc for propenyl acetate, but wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- or CH3-CH=CH-? Actually, propenyl can be allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-, but sometimes it's used for the vinyl group. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the substituents. The acetate would be OAc, so the structure would be something like CH2=CH-OAc if it's propenyl acetate. But wait, propenyl is three carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH3-C(O)O-CH2CH=CH2? Wait, no, the name would be propenyl acetate, which is the ester formed from acetic acid and propenol. So propenol would be allyl alcohol, CH2=CHCH2OH, so propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl acetate would be from a four-carbon alcohol with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, depending on the position of the double bond.

But the question mentions cis and trans for both propenyl and butenyl. So the double bond in the propenyl or butenyl group would have cis or trans stereochemistry. For propenyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (allyl group), so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so there's no possibility for cis or trans because the substituents on both carbons are the same (two H on C1 and CH2-OAc on C2). Wait, no, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-OAc? Wait, that would be vinyl acetate, which is a different compound. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check.

Propenyl groups: The term propenyl refers to a three-carbon chain with a double bond. The possible structures are CH2=CHCH2- (allyl group) or CH3-CH=CH- (1-propenyl or 2-propenyl). Wait, I think the correct IUPAC name for allyl group is 2-propenyl, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But then, where is the double bond? Between C1 and C2 (so 1-propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-?), but I think the allyl group is 2-propenyl. So the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Let me clarify. For propenyl, the three carbons are 1, 2, 3. If the double bond is between 1 and 2, it's 1-propenyl: CH2=CHCH2-. If between 2 and 3, it's 2-propenyl: CH3-CH=CH-. Wait, but I think the allyl group is 2-propenyl, which is CH2=CHCH2-. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the numbering. Let's say the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then the double bond is between C1 and C2. But in that case, the substituents on the double bond are two H's on C1 and a CH2-OAc on C2. So there's no possibility for cis or trans because one end has two identical groups (H and H) and the other has CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but that can't be right. Maybe the propenyl group is actually CH3-CH=CH-OAc? No, that would be butenyl if it's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let's think again.

The problem gives options of cis/trans propenyl acetate and cis/trans butenyl acetate. So the propenyl would have three carbons with a double bond, and butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. The acetate is the ester group, so the structure would be OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHOAc for propenyl acetate (vinyl acetate), but that's only two carbons. Wait, no, vinyl is two carbons. Propenyl would be three. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (allyl acetate). But in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are H and H on C1, and CH2OAc and H on C2. So there's no possibility for cis or trans because one end has two H's. Therefore, maybe the propenyl acetate in the question is actually a different structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it possible for cis and trans isomerism. For example, if the structure is CH2CH=CHOAc, but that would be propenyl if the chain is three carbons. Wait, but that would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc, which is 1-propenyl? No, maybe the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, but that would be a three-carbon chain with the double bond between C2 and C3, making it trans or cis. Wait, but that would be 2-propenyl acetate? I'm getting confused here. Let me try to draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is allyl acetate. In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's no possibility for cis/trans because both substituents on C1 are H, and on C2 are CH2-OAc and H. So that can't have cis/trans isomerism. Therefore, the propenyl acetate in the question must have the double bond in a position where there are two different groups on each carbon of the double bond. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's the same as allyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR data given. The 1H NMR has peaks at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). Let's analyze each peak.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with coupling constant 16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which is typical for trans double bonds. The coupling constant (J) for trans vinyl protons is around 12-18 Hz, while cis is usually lower, around 6-12 Hz. So a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans configuration. But wait, the peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so that proton is coupled to one other proton. If it's part of a double bond, the other proton would be on the adjacent carbon. So maybe this is one of the vinyl protons in a trans configuration.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quartets). A dq means that the proton is split into a doublet, and each of those is split into a quartet. So two coupling constants. The integration here is 1H. The 2.1 ppm peak is a singlet of 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like the acetate methyl (OAc, which is COOCH3). Wait, but the acetate group's methyl is usually around 2.0-2.1 ppm as a singlet because it's adjacent to the carbonyl. So that's probably the OAc's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. A doublet suggests coupling to one neighboring proton. A methyl group as a doublet would be adjacent to a CH group. For example, a CH(CH3) group. So maybe a methyl attached to a carbon that's next to a proton that's split. Let's think.

Putting this together: The compound has a trans double bond (J=16 Hz), a methyl group adjacent to a CH (1.6 ppm, d, 3H), the acetate methyl (2.1 ppm, s), and a proton at 5.5 ppm that's a dq. Let's try to piece this together.

The trans double bond (7.0 ppm, d, J=16) would have two protons, each as a doublet. But here, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Wait, maybe the other proton is at 5.5 ppm? Let's see. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the two protons would be H1 and H2. If H1 is at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), then H2 would be at a lower ppm, maybe around 5.5. But why is the 5.5 ppm peak a dq? Let's think. The H2 would be coupled to H1 (J=16 Hz) and also to another proton. So if H2 is adjacent to another proton (say, on C3), then it would be a doublet of doublets. But here it's a dq. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the H at 5.5 ppm is part of a CH group that's next to a methyl. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be butenyl, four carbons. Let's see.

Wait, let's consider the possible structures:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: If propenyl is three carbons with a double bond, and the acetate is on the end. For example, CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But as discussed earlier, this might not have cis/trans isomerism. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the chain is CH3-CH=CH-OAc), making it a propenyl group. In that case, the substituents on the double bond would be CH3 and OAc on one carbon, and H and H on the other. Wait, no. If the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, that's vinyl acetate, which is two carbons. But propenyl is three. So maybe the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate), which doesn't have cis/trans isomerism. Therefore, the options give

# Anthropic completion

Let me analyze which compound matches this NMR data from the given options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

I need to clarify what these structures actually are. For propenyl vs. butenyl, propenyl contains three carbons with a double bond, while butenyl has four carbons with a double bond. The acetate portion is an acetyloxy group (OAc).

I'm initially confused about the exact structure of propenyl acetate. Propenyl could refer to CH2=CHCH2- (allyl group) or CH3-CH=CH- (1-propenyl). If propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate), the double bond would be between C1 and C2, with two hydrogens on one carbon, making cis/trans isomerism impossible. 

Perhaps propenyl acetate is actually CH3-CH=CH-OAc, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing for cis/trans configurations. Similarly, butenyl acetate could be something like CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, which would also permit cis/trans isomerism.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz): This large coupling constant (16 Hz) strongly indicates a trans double bond configuration
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): A doublet of quartets indicates this proton couples with one proton and another set of three protons
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s): Likely the methyl group of the acetate (OAc)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d): A methyl group coupled to one neighboring proton

Analyzing these peaks together, we have a compound with a trans double bond, an acetate methyl group, and a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. The proton at 5.5 ppm couples with both the proton at 7.0 ppm (forming the trans double bond) and the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.

This data most likely corresponds to a structure where we have a trans configuration across the double bond. The compound has a methyl group adjacent to one carbon of the double bond, with the other carbon connected to the acetate group, making it Trans-propenyl acetate with structure CH3-CH=CH-OAc.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's determine which compound corresponds to this NMR data. The choices are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. To start, let's remember the structures of these compounds.

First, consider the difference between propenyl and butenyl groups. A propenyl group has three carbons with a double bond, while a butenyl group has four. The acetate component is an acetyloxy group, OAc. The basic structure might appear as CH2=CH-OAc for propenyl acetate. But actually, propenyl groups can be allyl, CH2=CHCH2-, rather than just vinyl-type, CH2=CH-OAc. The acetate should be connected as an ester, producing something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl acetate, as it comes from an esterification between acetic acid and an alcohol with a propenyl group. Butenyl acetate follows similarly, deriving from a four-carbon alcohol with a double bond, so it might be structured as CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, depending on the location of the double bond.

The question also considers the stereochemistry of cis and trans isomers in both propenyl and butenyl acetates. For propenyl acetate, with the double bond expected in an allyl form, CH2=CHCH2-OAc, cis or trans isomerism isn't likely, given the identical substituents (H, H on one carbon). Hence, this is more straightforward for vinyl derivatives like CH3-CH=CH-OAc, enabling stereochemistry of cis or trans with differing groups on both double bond carbons.

With the NMR data: 
- A doublet at 7.0 ppm with coupling constant J=16.0 Hz implies a trans double bond, where such J values (12-18 Hz) are characteristic of trans-orientation.
- The peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq suggests this proton engages two sets of coupling, fitting a scenario with one double bond and additional protons.
- A singlet at 2.1 ppm implies a methyl group linked to a non-proton neighbor like an acyl group.
- A 1.6 ppm doublet suggests coupling with a nearby shift-inducing group (e.g., CH next to CH3).

Summarizing, the compound features a trans double bond, linked methyls, acetate, and specific proton shadings fit the trans configuration best for vinyl-like scenarios (e.g., CH2CH=CH-OAc). Using these data, you can piece together the structure from this setup, inferring the likely structural fit of a trans-butenyl or more adjustable propenyl acetate underlined by the given distinct shifts and splitting nature.

So the double bond is trans. So the compound is either trans-propenyl acetate or trans-butenyl acetate. Now, the other peaks can help us determine the chain length.\n\nThe 5.5 ppm peak is a dq. Let's think about what a dq (doublet of quartets) would look like. A proton that is coupled to two different protons with different J values. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group and also coupled to another proton. Wait, but a dq would result from coupling to two different protons, each with different J values. Let's say the proton at 5.5 ppm is adjacent to a methyl group (which is split into a quartet due to coupling to the methyl's three protons?), but that doesn't quite fit. Wait, a quartet would come from coupling to three equivalent protons. But if the proton at 5.5 is coupled to a methyl (three protons, J) and another proton (J'), then the splitting would be a quartet (from the methyl) and a doublet (from the other proton), resulting in a doublet of quartets. But the order might be different. Alternatively, the proton is first split by one proton into a doublet, and each of those is split by three equivalent protons into a quartet. But that would be a quartet of doublets. Hmm. Maybe the 5.5 ppm proton is adjacent to a CH group and a methyl. Let's think of a structure like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be butenyl, four carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2, then a CH(CH3) group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. In this case, the protons on the double bond would be H1 and H2. H1 (trans) at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), H2 at lower ppm. Then the H on the CH(CH3) would be at 5.5 ppm. Wait, but the H on the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the double bond and the methyl. So the coupling would be to the adjacent H2 (from the double bond) and to the three methyl protons. Wait, but the H on CH(CH3) would be split by the H2 (J) and by the three methyl protons (J'). But the three methyl protons would split it into a quartet. So the splitting would be a doublet (from H2) of quartets (from the methyl), which is a dq. That fits the 5.5 ppm peak. Then the methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) would be the CH(CH3) group. Wait, but if the methyl is attached to the CH, then the CH would have a proton that's split by the methyl, making the methyl a doublet? Wait, no. The methyl protons are three equivalent protons. If the CH is adjacent to the methyl, the CH proton would be split into a quartet by the three methyl protons. But in the data, the methyl at 1.6 ppm is a doublet. That suggests that the methyl is adjacent to a single proton. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A methyl group (three H) adjacent to a CH would have the CH proton split into a quartet, and the methyl would be a singlet. But here, the methyl is a doublet. So maybe the methyl is adjacent to a proton that is split. Wait, perhaps the methyl is part of a CH2CH3 group? No, but the integration is 3H. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but that's allyl acetate, which doesn't have the methyl at 1.6 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2CH3, but that's ethyl acrylate, which is different.\n\nWait, let's think again. The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. So a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet. That would happen if the methyl is adjacent to a proton that is split. For example, in a structure like CH(CH3)-X, where X is a proton. But the methyl is attached to a carbon that has one proton. So like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but the methyl is on a CH2? No. Wait, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-something? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(O)O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but then the protons on the double bond would be at lower ppm, and the methyl from the acetate is at 2.1 ppm. But in that case, the allyl group's protons would be around 5-6 ppm. The coupling between the two vinyl protons would be around J=10-12 Hz for cis or trans. Wait, but in the data, there's a J=16 Hz, which is trans. So if the double bond is in the propenyl group (allyl), then the coupling between the two protons would be trans, but allyl's double bond is usually between C1 and C2, with H's on C1 and C2. If it's trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But in allyl acetate, the protons on the double bond are typically around 5-6 ppm. Wait, maybe the 7.0 ppm peak is not part of the double bond but something else. Wait, but 7.0 ppm is more typical of aromatic protons, but the compound is an ester, so maybe it's a conjugated system. Wait, if the double bond is conjugated with the ester group, that could deshield the protons and shift them upfield or downfield. For example, in cinnamate esters, the protons are around 6-7 ppm. But this compound isn't aromatic. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: The presence of a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a trans double bond. The other proton on the double bond would be coupled to this one and perhaps another group. The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq, which could be a proton adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. Let's consider the structure of trans-propenyl acetate. If propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but as discussed, that doesn't have cis/trans. Alternatively, if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents would be CH3 and OAc on one carbon, and H and H on the other. Wait, but that can't have cis/trans because one end has two H's. So that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the propenyl acetate in the question is actually a different structure where the double bond is between two carbons each bearing different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2=CHOAc, which is vinyl acetate. But vinyl acetate has the structure CH2=CHOAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. The two protons on the double bond would be H1 and H2. If it's trans, then the coupling constant would be around 16 Hz. In vinyl acetate, the trans isomer would have the two protons on opposite sides. But vinyl acetate typically has the two protons as cis, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are H and H, and on C2 are OAc and H. So there's no possibility for cis/trans isomerism here because one end has two identical groups (H and H). Therefore, vinyl acetate can't have cis/trans isomers. So the propenyl acetate must have a different structure where the double bond is between two carbons each with different substituents.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (allyl acetate), but again, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with H and H on C1 and CH2-OAc and H on C2. No possibility for cis/trans. Therefore, the options given must be butenyl acetate, which has four carbons, allowing for a double bond in a position where cis/trans isomerism is possible.\n\nSo butenyl acetate would be, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate) or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (2-butenyl acetate). The double bond in 2-butenyl acetate would be between C2 and C3, with substituents CH3 and CH2-OAc on either end. That would allow for cis and trans isomers. In the trans isomer, the coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be around 16 Hz, which matches the 7.0 ppm peak. Let's consider trans-2-butenyl acetate: structure would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. The structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, butenyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Let me get this right. The butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond. For example, 3-butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but numbering starts from the oxygen. Wait, the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the butenyl group. So the butenyl group is CH2CH=CHCH2-, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH2-? No, wait, the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- (1-butenyl) or CH3CH=CHCH2- (2-butenyl). So the ester would be, for example, OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (if it's 2-butenyl). In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the butenyl group. The substituents on the double bond would be CH2-OAc and CH3. So cis and trans isomers are possible here. In the trans isomer, the coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be around 16 Hz. The proton on the CH2-OAc side would be one proton, and the proton on the CH3 side would be another. Wait, but in 2-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me clarify:\n\nButenyl group: four carbons with a double bond. The possible structures are:\n\n1. 1-butenyl: CH2=CHCH2CH2-\n\n2. 2-butenyl: CH3CH=CHCH2-\n\n3. 3-butenyl: CH2CH2CH=CH2- (but that's the same as 1-butenyl if we consider direction).\n\nAssuming the ester is formed from butenol and acetic acid, the structure would be OAc-O-R, where R is the butenyl group. For example, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH3, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents are CH2-OAc and CH3. In this case, the two protons on the double bond would be each coupled with J=16 Hz (trans). One proton would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc group, and the other adjacent to the CH3. The proton adjacent to the CH3 would be split by the CH3's protons, but wait, the protons on the CH3 are not adjacent to the double bond. Wait, the protons on the double bond are each on C2 and C3. Let's say the structure is CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure for trans-2-butenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if it's trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's 3-butenyl. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to draw it properly.\n\nButenyl group: four carbons with a double bond. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of butenol with -OAc. For 2-butenol, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OH. So the ester would be CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but in that case, the double bond has substituents CH3 and CH2-OAc on adjacent carbons. So the configuration (cis or trans) would place the CH3 and CH2-OAc groups on the same or opposite sides. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons (on C2 and C3) would be around 16 Hz for trans. So the proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) and the proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR data, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm as a doublet. Where is the other proton?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 and C2 would be H and H on C1, and CH2-CH2-OAc and H on C2. Again, no possibility for cis/trans. So this can't be. Therefore, the correct structure must be 2-butenyl acetate, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing cis/trans isomerism.\n\nIn trans-2-butenyl acetate (structure: CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH-CH3?), wait, no. Let me correct. The correct structure for trans-2-butenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but that would mean the substituents on the double bond are CH3 and CH2-OAc. So the trans configuration would have these groups on opposite sides. The two protons on the double bond (on C2 and C3) would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR data, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Where is the other proton? Maybe it's the one at 5.5 ppm. Let's see. The proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be deshielded and appear downfield, maybe around 7.0 ppm as a doublet (coupled to the proton on C2). The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be upfield, around 5.5 ppm. But why is the 5.5 ppm peak a dq? Let's think. The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 group. So it would be split by the CH3's protons (J=6-7 Hz) and also coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz). So the splitting would be a doublet of quartets. Wait, no. If the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz) and to the three protons of the CH3 group (J=6-7 Hz), then the splitting would be a quartet (from the CH3) and a doublet (from the C3 proton), resulting in a quartet of doublets, which would appear as a multiplet. But the data says it's a dq (doublet of quartets). Maybe the coupling constants are such that it's a doublet first from the C3 proton (J=16 Hz), and each of those is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3 (J=6 Hz). So the splitting would be a doublet (from J=16) of quartets (from J=6), which is a dq. That matches the 5.5 ppm peak. Then the CH3 group on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. Wait, but the CH3 is on C2, adjacent to the proton on C2. Wait, no. The CH3 is on C2, so the protons on the CH3 are adjacent to the C2 proton. Therefore, the C2 proton would be split by the three CH3 protons into a quartet, and also by the C3 proton into a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of doublets (from C3), which is a quartet of doublets, not a doublet of quartets. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to draw the splitting tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is different. Let's consider the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). A methyl group as a doublet must be adjacent to a single proton. So maybe the structure has a CH(CH3) group. For example, if the butenyl group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc. No, that's five carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, the methyl is part of a vinyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-OAc. That would be 2-methyl-1-propenyl acetate. But then the double bond is between C1 and C2, with substituents CH2-OAc and CH(CH3). Wait, but that would allow cis/trans isomerism. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be J=16 Hz for trans. The proton on C1 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on C2 (adjacent to CH(CH3)) would be split by the CH3 and the coupling to C1. So the C2 proton would be a dq. The CH3 on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm because it's adjacent to the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This structure fits the NMR data. Let's check:\n\nStructure: CH2=C(CH3)-OAc. Wait, no, that's two carbons. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-OAc? No, that's three carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc. But that's three carbons. If it's trans, the coupling constant would be 16 Hz. The proton on the CH3 side would be at lower ppm, and the one on the OAc side at higher ppm. The CH3 group adjacent to the double bond would be split into a doublet. Wait, but in this structure (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents are CH3 and OAc. So the two protons on the double bond would be on C2 and C3. The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz) and to the CH3 group (J=6-7 Hz). So the splitting for the C2 proton would be a doublet of quartets (from coupling to C3 and CH3), which matches the 5.5 ppm peak. The proton on C3 (adjacent to OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The CH3 group on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm because it's adjacent to the C2 proton, which is split by the CH3. Wait, no. The CH3 is on C2, so the C2 proton is adjacent to the CH3. The CH3 protons would split the C2 proton into a quartet, and the C2 proton would split the CH3 into a doublet. But the integration for the CH3 is 3H, so three protons as a doublet. That makes sense if the CH3 is adjacent to a single proton (the C2 proton), which is split by the three CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the C2 proton into a doublet. So the CH3 at 1.6 ppm is a doublet. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet. This structure fits the data. So the compound would be trans-propenyl acetate if it's three carbons, but the structure I'm considering is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, which is three carbons (propenyl) with a trans double bond. Therefore, this would be trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, earlier I thought propenyl acetate couldn't have cis/trans, but in this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a three-carbon chain, with substituents CH3 and OAc, allowing cis/trans isomerism. So the correct answer would be trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nBut let's confirm. The NMR data: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) is the proton on the OAc side of the double bond. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is the proton on the CH3 side, coupled to both the OAc-side proton (J=16) and the CH3 (J=6-7), resulting in a dq. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the proton at 5.5 ppm. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s). This all fits. Therefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: If it's trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would have four carbons. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc. But that's 1-butenyl, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, which doesn't allow cis/trans. Alternatively, trans-2-butenyl acetate: CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The protons on the double bond would be at C2 and C3. The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be coupled to C3 proton (J=16) and to the CH3 (J=6), resulting in a dq at around 5.5 ppm. The proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. The CH3 on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This also fits. So how do we distinguish between trans-propenyl and trans-butenyl?\n\nWait, the difference is the chain length. Propenyl is three carbons, butenyl is four. In the trans-propenyl acetate structure (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the chain is three carbons: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 for propenyl, but that's allyl acetate, which is three carbons. But in the structure I considered earlier (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), that's three carbons: OAc-O-CH=CH-CH3. Wait, no, that would be OAc attached to the CH=CH-CH3. So the chain is three carbons: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (allyl acetate) doesn't have cis/trans, but CH3-CH=CH-OAc (if possible) would have cis/trans. But I'm not sure if that's a valid structure. Maybe the correct IUPAC name for CH3-CH=CH-OAc is trans-2-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, maybe it's called trans-1-propenyl acetate. I'm getting a bit stuck on the nomenclature here.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a methyl group (1.6 ppm, d) suggests that there's a CH(CH3) group. In the trans-butenyl acetate structure (CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc), the CH3 is on C2, and the CH2-OAc is on C3. The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 and the double bond. In the trans-propenyl acetate, the CH3 is on C2, and the OAc is on C3 (but propenyl is three carbons, so C3 would be the end). Wait, this is confusing. Let's count the carbons:\n\n- Propenyl: three carbons. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate) which is three carbons. No cis/trans possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the propenyl is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH3, that's three carbons: CH3-CH=CH-OAc. Here, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if we count from the OAc), allowing cis/trans. The substituents on the double bond are CH3 and OAc. So this would be trans-2-propenyl acetate. The NMR data fits this structure. The proton on the OAc side (C3) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on the CH3 side (C2) would be at 5.5 ppm (dq), coupled to both the OAc-side proton and the CH3. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This seems to fit.\n\nIn the trans-butenyl acetate scenario (four carbons), the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (if we count from the OAc), making it trans-3-butenyl acetate. The proton on the CH2-OAc side (C3) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on the CH3 side (C4) would be at 5.5 ppm (dq), coupled to the C3 proton and the CH3. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the C4 proton. But in this case, the chain is longer, but the NMR data would look similar. How can we distinguish between three and four carbons?\n\nWait, the integration data only has four signals: 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. In the three-carbon propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), there are two protons on the double bond (each 1H), the acetate methyl (3H), and the CH3 (3H). That matches the integration. In the four-carbon butenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc), there are two protons on the double bond (1H each), the acetate methyl (3H), the CH3 (3H), and the CH2-OAc protons. Wait, but the CH2-OAc would have two protons. But in the given data, there's no signal for those. Unless they are overlapping or not split. Wait, the CH2-OAc in butenyl acetate would be adjacent to the double bond. The protons on the CH2 would be split by the double bond and possibly others. For example, in CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, the CH2-OAc protons would be next to the double bond. Their chemical shift would be around 4-5 ppm, split into a multiplet. But in the given data, there's no peak in that region except the 5.5 ppm peak. Therefore, the absence of additional peaks suggests that the compound is the three-carbon propenyl acetate, as the four-carbon would have additional protons from the CH2 group.\n\nTherefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, earlier I thought propenyl acetate couldn't have cis/trans, but if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then it can. So the answer is trans-propenyl acetate.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444917, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6667, prompt_tokens=2618, total_tokens=9285, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The given 1H NMR data corresponds to **trans-propenyl acetate**. Here's the analysis:

1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:  
   - A doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration for the double bond. This proton is one of the two vinyl protons on the double bond, deshielded due to conjugation with the ester group.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:  
   - A doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton. It is coupled to the trans proton (J = 16 Hz) and to the adjacent methyl group (J â‰ˆ 6-7 Hz), resulting in the observed splitting pattern.

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:  
   - A singlet integrating to 3H corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc), which is not split due to symmetry.

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:  
   - A doublet integrating to 3H corresponds to the methyl group adjacent to the double bond. The splitting arises from coupling to the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.

**Structure Identification**:  
The data matches **trans-propenyl acetate** (CHâ‚ƒ-CH=CH-OAc). The trans configuration is confirmed by the large J = 16 Hz coupling constant. The absence of additional peaks (e.g., from a CHâ‚‚ group) rules out the butenyl acetate isomers. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts align with a three-carbon propenyl chain with a trans double bond and an acetate group.

**Answer**:  
**Trans-propenyl acetate**

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

cis and trans for propenyl and butenyl, so maybe the butenyl is four carbons with a double bond that can have cis/trans.

Alternatively, maybe the propenyl acetate is actually something like CH2=C(CH3)-OAc, but that would be isopropenyl acetate. Wait, but that's still two carbons. Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Looking at the NMR data again: The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a trans coupling. So the double bond is trans. So the compound is either trans-propenyl acetate or trans-butenyl acetate. Now, the other peaks can help us determine the chain length.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq. Let's think about what a dq (doublet of quartets) would look like. A proton that is coupled to two different protons with different J values. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group and also coupled to another proton. Wait, but a dq would result from coupling to two different protons, each with different J values. Let's say the proton at 5.5 ppm is adjacent to a methyl group (which is split into a quartet due to coupling to the methyl's three protons?), but that doesn't quite fit. Wait, a quartet would come from coupling to three equivalent protons. But if the proton at 5.5 is coupled to a methyl (three protons, J) and another proton (J'), then the splitting would be a quartet (from the methyl) and a doublet (from the other proton), resulting in a doublet of quartets. But the order might be different. Alternatively, the proton is first split by one proton into a doublet, and each of those is split by three equivalent protons into a quartet. But that would be a quartet of doublets. Hmm. Maybe the 5.5 ppm proton is adjacent to a CH group and a methyl. Let's think of a structure like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be butenyl, four carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2, then a CH(CH3) group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. In this case, the protons on the double bond would be H1 and H2. H1 (trans) at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), H2 at lower ppm. Then the H on the CH(CH3) would be at 5.5 ppm. Wait, but the H on the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the double bond and the methyl. So the coupling would be to the adjacent H2 (from the double bond) and to the three methyl protons. Wait, but the H on CH(CH3) would be split by the H2 (J) and by the three methyl protons (J'). But the three methyl protons would split it into a quartet. So the splitting would be a doublet (from H2) of quartets (from the methyl), which is a dq. That fits the 5.5 ppm peak. Then the methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) would be the CH(CH3) group. Wait, but if the methyl is attached to the CH, then the CH would have a proton that's split by the methyl, making the methyl a doublet? Wait, no. The methyl protons are three equivalent protons. If the CH is adjacent to the methyl, the CH proton would be split into a quartet by the three methyl protons. But in the data, the methyl at 1.6 ppm is a doublet. That suggests that the methyl is adjacent to a single proton. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A methyl group (three H) adjacent to a CH would have the CH proton split into a quartet, and the methyl would be a singlet. But here, the methyl is a doublet. So maybe the methyl is adjacent to a proton that is split. Wait, perhaps the methyl is part of a CH2CH3 group? No, but the integration is 3H. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but that's allyl acetate, which doesn't have the methyl at 1.6 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2CH3, but that's ethyl acrylate, which is different.

Wait, let's think again. The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. So a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet. That would happen if the methyl is adjacent to a proton that is split. For example, in a structure like CH(CH3)-X, where X is a proton. But the methyl is attached to a carbon that has one proton. So like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but the methyl is on a CH2? No. Wait, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(O)O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but then the protons on the double bond would be at lower ppm, and the methyl from the acetate is at 2.1 ppm. But in that case, the allyl group's protons would be around 5-6 ppm. The coupling between the two vinyl protons would be around J=10-12 Hz for cis or trans. Wait, but in the data, there's a J=16 Hz, which is trans. So if the double bond is in the propenyl group (allyl), then the coupling between the two protons would be trans, but allyl's double bond is usually between C1 and C2, with H's on C1 and C2. If it's trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But in allyl acetate, the protons on the double bond are typically around 5-6 ppm. Wait, maybe the 7.0 ppm peak is not part of the double bond but something else. Wait, but 7.0 ppm is more typical of aromatic protons, but the compound is an ester, so maybe it's a conjugated system. Wait, if the double bond is conjugated with the ester group, that could deshield the protons and shift them upfield or downfield. For example, in cinnamate esters, the protons are around 6-7 ppm. But this compound isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The presence of a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a trans double bond. The other proton on the double bond would be coupled to this one and perhaps another group. The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq, which could be a proton adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. Let's consider the structure of trans-propenyl acetate. If propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but as discussed, that doesn't have cis/trans. Alternatively, if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents would be CH3 and OAc on one carbon, and H and H on the other. Wait, but that can't have cis/trans because one end has two H's. So that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the propenyl acetate in the question is actually a different structure where the double bond is between two carbons each bearing different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2=CHOAc, which is vinyl acetate. But vinyl acetate has the structure CH2=CHOAc, with the double bond between C1 and C2. The two protons on the double bond would be H1 and H2. If it's trans, then the coupling constant would be around 16 Hz. In vinyl acetate, the trans isomer would have the two protons on opposite sides. But vinyl acetate typically has the two protons as cis, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are H and H, and on C2 are OAc and H. So there's no possibility for cis/trans isomerism here because one end has two identical groups (H and H). Therefore, vinyl acetate can't have cis/trans isomers. So the propenyl acetate must have a different structure where the double bond is between two carbons each with different substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (allyl acetate), but again, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with H and H on C1 and CH2-OAc and H on C2. No possibility for cis/trans. Therefore, the options given must be butenyl acetate, which has four carbons, allowing for a double bond in a position where cis/trans isomerism is possible.

So butenyl acetate would be, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate) or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (2-butenyl acetate). The double bond in 2-butenyl acetate would be between C2 and C3, with substituents CH3 and CH2-OAc on either end. That would allow for cis and trans isomers. In the trans isomer, the coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be around 16 Hz, which matches the 7.0 ppm peak. Let's consider trans-2-butenyl acetate: structure would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. The structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, butenyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Let me get this right. The butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond. For example, 3-butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but numbering starts from the oxygen. Wait, the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the butenyl group. So the butenyl group is CH2CH=CHCH2-, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH2-? No, wait, the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- (1-butenyl) or CH3CH=CHCH2- (2-butenyl). So the ester would be, for example, OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (if it's 2-butenyl). In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the butenyl group. The substituents on the double bond would be CH2-OAc and CH3. So cis and trans isomers are possible here. In the trans isomer, the coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be around 16 Hz. The proton on the CH2-OAc side would be one proton, and the proton on the CH3 side would be another. Wait, but in 2-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me clarify:

Butenyl group: four carbons with a double bond. The possible structures are:

1. 1-butenyl: CH2=CHCH2CH2-

2. 2-butenyl: CH3CH=CHCH2-

3. 3-butenyl: CH2CH2CH=CH2- (but that's the same as 1-butenyl if we consider direction).

Assuming the ester is formed from butenol and acetic acid, the structure would be OAc-O-R, where R is the butenyl group. For example, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2CH=CHCH3, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents are CH2-OAc and CH3. In this case, the two protons on the double bond would be each coupled with J=16 Hz (trans). One proton would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc group, and the other adjacent to the CH3. The proton adjacent to the CH3 would be split by the CH3's protons, but wait, the protons on the CH3 are not adjacent to the double bond. Wait, the protons on the double bond are each on C2 and C3. Let's say the structure is CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure for trans-2-butenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if it's trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's 3-butenyl. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to draw it properly.

Butenyl group: four carbons with a double bond. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of butenol with -OAc. For 2-butenol, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OH. So the ester would be CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but in that case, the double bond has substituents CH3 and CH2-OAc on adjacent carbons. So the configuration (cis or trans) would place the CH3 and CH2-OAc groups on the same or opposite sides. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons (on C2 and C3) would be around 16 Hz for trans. So the proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) and the proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR data, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm as a doublet. Where is the other proton?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 and C2 would be H and H on C1, and CH2-CH2-OAc and H on C2. Again, no possibility for cis/trans. So this can't be. Therefore, the correct structure must be 2-butenyl acetate, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing cis/trans isomerism.

In trans-2-butenyl acetate (structure: CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH-CH3?), wait, no. Let me correct. The correct structure for trans-2-butenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 are CH3 and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and H. Wait, but that would mean the substituents on the double bond are CH3 and CH2-OAc. So the trans configuration would have these groups on opposite sides. The two protons on the double bond (on C2 and C3) would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz. But in the NMR data, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Where is the other proton? Maybe it's the one at 5.5 ppm. Let's see. The proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be deshielded and appear downfield, maybe around 7.0 ppm as a doublet (coupled to the proton on C2). The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be upfield, around 5.5 ppm. But why is the 5.5 ppm peak a dq? Let's think. The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 group. So it would be split by the CH3's protons (J=6-7 Hz) and also coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz). So the splitting would be a doublet of quartets. Wait, no. If the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz) and to the three protons of the CH3 group (J=6-7 Hz), then the splitting would be a quartet (from the CH3) and a doublet (from the C3 proton), resulting in a quartet of doublets, which would appear as a multiplet. But the data says it's a dq (doublet of quartets). Maybe the coupling constants are such that it's a doublet first from the C3 proton (J=16 Hz), and each of those is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3 (J=6 Hz). So the splitting would be a doublet (from J=16) of quartets (from J=6), which is a dq. That matches the 5.5 ppm peak. Then the CH3 group on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. Wait, but the CH3 is on C2, adjacent to the proton on C2. Wait, no. The CH3 is on C2, so the protons on the CH3 are adjacent to the C2 proton. Therefore, the C2 proton would be split by the three CH3 protons into a quartet, and also by the C3 proton into a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of doublets (from C3), which is a quartet of doublets, not a doublet of quartets. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to draw the splitting tree.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Let's consider the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). A methyl group as a doublet must be adjacent to a single proton. So maybe the structure has a CH(CH3) group. For example, if the butenyl group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc. No, that's five carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, the methyl is part of a vinyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-OAc. That would be 2-methyl-1-propenyl acetate. But then the double bond is between C1 and C2, with substituents CH2-OAc and CH(CH3). Wait, but that would allow cis/trans isomerism. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons would be J=16 Hz for trans. The proton on C1 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on C2 (adjacent to CH(CH3)) would be split by the CH3 and the coupling to C1. So the C2 proton would be a dq. The CH3 on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm because it's adjacent to the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This structure fits the NMR data. Let's check:

Structure: CH2=C(CH3)-OAc. Wait, no, that's two carbons. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-OAc? No, that's three carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc. But that's three carbons. If it's trans, the coupling constant would be 16 Hz. The proton on the CH3 side would be at lower ppm, and the one on the OAc side at higher ppm. The CH3 group adjacent to the double bond would be split into a doublet. Wait, but in this structure (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents are CH3 and OAc. So the two protons on the double bond would be on C2 and C3. The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be coupled to the proton on C3 (J=16 Hz) and to the CH3 group (J=6-7 Hz). So the splitting for the C2 proton would be a doublet of quartets (from coupling to C3 and CH3), which matches the 5.5 ppm peak. The proton on C3 (adjacent to OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The CH3 group on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm because it's adjacent to the C2 proton, which is split by the CH3. Wait, no. The CH3 is on C2, so the C2 proton is adjacent to the CH3. The CH3 protons would split the C2 proton into a quartet, and the C2 proton would split the CH3 into a doublet. But the integration for the CH3 is 3H, so three protons as a doublet. That makes sense if the CH3 is adjacent to a single proton (the C2 proton), which is split by the three CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the C2 proton into a doublet. So the CH3 at 1.6 ppm is a doublet. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet. This structure fits the data. So the compound would be trans-propenyl acetate if it's three carbons, but the structure I'm considering is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, which is three carbons (propenyl) with a trans double bond. Therefore, this would be trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, earlier I thought propenyl acetate couldn't have cis/trans, but in this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a three-carbon chain, with substituents CH3 and OAc, allowing cis/trans isomerism. So the correct answer would be trans-propenyl acetate.

But let's confirm. The NMR data: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) is the proton on the OAc side of the double bond. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is the proton on the CH3 side, coupled to both the OAc-side proton (J=16) and the CH3 (J=6-7), resulting in a dq. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the proton at 5.5 ppm. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s). This all fits. Therefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.

But wait, another possibility: If it's trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would have four carbons. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc. But that's 1-butenyl, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, which doesn't allow cis/trans. Alternatively, trans-2-butenyl acetate: CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. The protons on the double bond would be at C2 and C3. The proton on C2 (adjacent to CH3) would be coupled to C3 proton (J=16) and to the CH3 (J=6), resulting in a dq at around 5.5 ppm. The proton on C3 (adjacent to CH2-OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. The CH3 on C2 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This also fits. So how do we distinguish between trans-propenyl and trans-butenyl?

Wait, the difference is the chain length. Propenyl is three carbons, butenyl is four. In the trans-propenyl acetate structure (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the chain is three carbons: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 for propenyl, but that's allyl acetate, which is three carbons. But in the structure I considered earlier (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), that's three carbons: OAc-O-CH=CH-CH3. Wait, no, that would be OAc attached to the CH=CH-CH3. So the chain is three carbons: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (allyl acetate) doesn't have cis/trans, but CH3-CH=CH-OAc (if possible) would have cis/trans. But I'm not sure if that's a valid structure. Maybe the correct IUPAC name for CH3-CH=CH-OAc is trans-2-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, maybe it's called trans-1-propenyl acetate. I'm getting a bit stuck on the nomenclature here.

Alternatively, the presence of a methyl group (1.6 ppm, d) suggests that there's a CH(CH3) group. In the trans-butenyl acetate structure (CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc), the CH3 is on C2, and the CH2-OAc is on C3. The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 and the double bond. In the trans-propenyl acetate, the CH3 is on C2, and the OAc is on C3 (but propenyl is three carbons, so C3 would be the end). Wait, this is confusing. Let's count the carbons:

- Propenyl: three carbons. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate) which is three carbons. No cis/trans possible.

Alternatively, if the propenyl is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH3, that's three carbons: CH3-CH=CH-OAc. Here, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if we count from the OAc), allowing cis/trans. The substituents on the double bond are CH3 and OAc. So this would be trans-2-propenyl acetate. The NMR data fits this structure. The proton on the OAc side (C3) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on the CH3 side (C2) would be at 5.5 ppm (dq), coupled to both the OAc-side proton and the CH3. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This seems to fit.

In the trans-butenyl acetate scenario (four carbons), the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (if we count from the OAc), making it trans-3-butenyl acetate. The proton on the CH2-OAc side (C3) would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the proton on the CH3 side (C4) would be at 5.5 ppm (dq), coupled to the C3 proton and the CH3. The CH3 at 1.6 ppm (d) is adjacent to the C4 proton. But in this case, the chain is longer, but the NMR data would look similar. How can we distinguish between three and four carbons?

Wait, the integration data only has four signals: 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. In the three-carbon propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), there are two protons on the double bond (each 1H), the acetate methyl (3H), and the CH3 (3H). That matches the integration. In the four-carbon butenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc), there are two protons on the double bond (1H each), the acetate methyl (3H), the CH3 (3H), and the CH2-OAc protons. Wait, but the CH2-OAc would have two protons. But in the given data, there's no signal for those. Unless they are overlapping or not split. Wait, the CH2-OAc in butenyl acetate would be adjacent to the double bond. The protons on the CH2 would be split by the double bond and possibly others. For example, in CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, the CH2-OAc protons would be next to the double bond. Their chemical shift would be around 4-5 ppm, split into a multiplet. But in the given data, there's no peak in that region except the 5.5 ppm peak. Therefore, the absence of additional peaks suggests that the compound is the three-carbon propenyl acetate, as the four-carbon would have additional protons from the CH2 group.

Therefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, earlier I thought propenyl acetate couldn't have cis/trans, but if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then it can. So the answer is trans-propenyl acetate.

In propenyl acetate, if the structure is CH2=CHOAc, but that\'s vinyl acetate, which would have a different coupling. Alternatively, if it\'s CH3-CH=CH-OAc, the trans isomer would have the two substituents (OAc and CH3) on opposite sides. The proton on the double bond adjacent to OAc would couple with the proton on the other end (J=16 Hz), and the dq at 5.5 ppm would be the proton next to the methyl group (CH3-CH=CH-OAc). The dq arises from coupling to the trans proton (J=16) and the adjacent methyl (J=6-7 Hz). The methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) would be split by the adjacent proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet.\n\nAlternatively, butenyl acetate would have a longer chain. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The coupling constant for the double bond would still be around 16 Hz if trans. But then the splitting might involve more protons. However, the presence of a dq (doublet of quartets) suggests that the proton at 5.5 ppm is adjacent to a methyl group (quartet from coupling to three protons?), but wait, a dq (doublet of quartets) would have two coupling partners. If the proton is part of a CH2 group, but the data shows 1H, so it\'s a single proton. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc? But that would be a branched group. Alternatively, the butenyl could be CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc. The trans double bond would have coupling J=16 Hz. The proton on the double bond adjacent to the CH2-OAc would couple with the other proton (trans), and perhaps the neighboring CH3. But the splitting would be different. \n\nWait, let\'s think again. The key is the 1H at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) which is a trans double bond. Then the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) must be the other proton on the double bond. The dq would be because this proton is coupled to the trans proton (J=16) and also to a neighboring group. If the structure is CH2=CHOAc (vinyl acetate), the coupling would be between the two protons on the double bond. But vinyl acetate\'s NMR would have two doublets (each 1H) with J around 14-16 Hz. However, the data here has one doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5 ppm as a dq. So that\'s different. \n\nAlternatively, if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (propenyl acetate), then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The trans configuration would have the OAc and CH3 on opposite sides. The proton on the C2 would be coupled to the C3 proton (J=16 Hz), and the C3 proton (which is adjacent to the methyl group) would be split by both the C2 proton (J=16) and the methyl group (J=6-7 Hz), leading to a dq. The methyl group at 1.6 ppm (d) would be split by the C3 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet. This seems to fit. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. \n\nBut wait, propenyl acetate could also be allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc). In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a doublet (coupled to C2), and the C2 proton would be a multiplet. But allyl acetate\'s NMR typically shows a triplet for the CH2-OAc. However, the data here doesn\'t match that. So the correct structure is more likely CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), which would have the two protons on the double bond as a doublet each, with one of them split by the adjacent methyl. \n\nAlternatively, butenyl acetate would have a longer chain, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The trans double bond would have a coupling of 16 Hz. The protons on the double bond would be split, but the adjacent protons would be CH2 groups. The splitting might be more complex. However, the presence of a dq (doublet of quartets) in the data suggests that the proton is coupled to two different groups: one with a large coupling (16 Hz, trans) and another with a smaller coupling (maybe to a neighboring CH3). \n\nWait, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group split by one proton. So that methyl is adjacent to a CH group. In the propenyl acetate scenario (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the methyl (1.6 ppm) is on the CH adjacent to the double bond. The CH would have a proton that\'s part of the double bond. Wait, no. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between the middle and the end. The CH3 is on the CH that\'s adjacent to the double bond. The proton on the CH (CH3-CH=CH-OAc) would be the one next to the double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that\'s allyl acetate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-OAc. But that would be isopropenyl acetate. The NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 on the double bond. But the data has a 1.6 ppm (d) which is split. So that\'s not it. \n\nAlternatively, if the structure is CH2=CH-OAc (vinyl acetate), the protons on the double bond would be two doublets. But the data shows one doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5 ppm as a dq. So that\'s not matching. \n\nWait, let\'s think again. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) must be a proton that is coupled to two different sets of protons. The d (doublet) comes from coupling to one proton (J=16 Hz), and the q (quartet) comes from coupling to three protons? But a quartet would be from coupling to three equivalent protons? Wait, no. A quartet (quartet) is from coupling to three equivalent protons? No, a quartet is from coupling to three protons with the same J. Wait, no, a quartet (n=4 peaks) arises from coupling to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule). But in this case, the 5.5 ppm proton is a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So that would mean it\'s coupling to two different groups: one with a coupling of J1 (splitting into a doublet) and another with J2 (splitting each of those into a quartet). So total of 2x4=8 peaks? But the data says "dq" which is a doublet of quartets, but in reality, it\'s a multiplet that might appear as a dq. \n\nAlternatively, the 5.5 ppm proton is coupled to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to a neighboring methyl group (J=6-7 Hz). The coupling to the methyl would split the peak into a quartet (since the methyl has three protons, n+1=4). But since the coupling to the trans proton is a doublet, the overall splitting would be a doublet of quartets. So each of the two peaks from the doublet would be split into four, resulting in 8 peaks. However, in practice, this might be observed as a dq if the coupling constants are different enough. \n\nSo if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), the proton on the CH adjacent to the methyl would be coupled to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to the methyl (J=6-7 Hz). The methyl would be split by the adjacent proton, giving a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This fits the data. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. \n\nBut wait, propenyl acetate is usually allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), which doesn\'t have cis/trans isomerism. So maybe the correct answer is Trans-butenyl acetate. Let\'s check that. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl acetate), the double bond is between C1 and C2. The trans configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. The protons on the double bond would be a doublet (J=16 Hz) and a multiplet. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 would be adjacent to a CH2-OAc group. The coupling to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to the adjacent CH2 group. But the splitting would be more complex. The methyl group (1.6 ppm, d) would be on the C2 (CH3-CH=CH...), but in that case, the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond, so it would be a CH3 attached to a CH=CH... So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc? But that would be a branched group. The splitting would be different. \n\nAlternatively, the correct structure is Trans-propenyl acetate, which is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), where the OAc is on one end, and the CH3 is on the other, trans to each other. The proton on the CH3 side (C2) would be coupled to the C3 proton (trans, J=16 Hz) and to the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz), leading to the dq. The methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) is the CH3 on C2, split by the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Trans-propenyl acetate. But I need to confirm if propenyl acetate can have such a structure. Alternatively, maybe the correct name is Trans-1-propenyl acetate, but the options given are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, etc. So the answer is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445225, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2726, prompt_tokens=614, total_tokens=3340, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The unknown compound can be identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate** based on the provided NMR data. Here's the breakdown:

1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:  
   - A doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration across the double bond. This proton is part of the double bond and couples with the proton on the adjacent carbon.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:  
   - A doublet of quartets arises from coupling with two groups:  
     - The trans proton on the double bond (J = 16 Hz, splitting into a doublet).  
     - The adjacent methyl group (J â‰ˆ 6â€“7 Hz, splitting into a quartet).  
   - This matches the proton on the CH group adjacent to the methyl (CH3-CH=CH-OAc).

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:  
   - A singlet for 3H corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc), which has no neighboring protons.

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:  
   - A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group adjacent to a single proton (the CH group in CH3-CH=CH-OAc). The splitting arises from coupling with the proton on the CH.

**Structure Justification**:  
The data aligns with **Trans-propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-OAc)**. The trans configuration explains the large J = 16 Hz coupling. The dq at 5.5 ppm matches the proton on the CH adjacent to the methyl, and the splitting patterns of the methyl groups are consistent with the structure. Propenyl acetate (unlike butenyl acetate) has a three-carbon chain, and the trans isomer is distinguished by the coupling constants and splitting observed.

**Answer**: Trans-propenyl acetate.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Alternatively, if it's butenyl, maybe CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the coupling constants and splitting would differ.

Wait, but the coupling constant J=16 Hz is typical for trans double bonds. In propenyl acetate, if the structure is CH2=CHOAc, but that's vinyl acetate, which would have a different coupling. Alternatively, if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, the trans isomer would have the two substituents (OAc and CH3) on opposite sides. The proton on the double bond adjacent to OAc would couple with the proton on the other end (J=16 Hz), and the dq at 5.5 ppm would be the proton next to the methyl group (CH3-CH=CH-OAc). The dq arises from coupling to the trans proton (J=16) and the adjacent methyl (J=6-7 Hz). The methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) would be split by the adjacent proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet.

Alternatively, butenyl acetate would have a longer chain. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The coupling constant for the double bond would still be around 16 Hz if trans. But then the splitting might involve more protons. However, the presence of a dq (doublet of quartets) suggests that the proton at 5.5 ppm is adjacent to a methyl group (quartet from coupling to three protons?), but wait, a dq (doublet of quartets) would have two coupling partners. If the proton is part of a CH2 group, but the data shows 1H, so it's a single proton. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc? But that would be a branched group. Alternatively, the butenyl could be CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc. The trans double bond would have coupling J=16 Hz. The proton on the double bond adjacent to the CH2-OAc would couple with the other proton (trans), and perhaps the neighboring CH3. But the splitting would be different. 

Wait, let's think again. The key is the 1H at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) which is a trans double bond. Then the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) must be the other proton on the double bond. The dq would be because this proton is coupled to the trans proton (J=16) and also to a neighboring group. If the structure is CH2=CHOAc (vinyl acetate), the coupling would be between the two protons on the double bond. But vinyl acetate's NMR would have two doublets (each 1H) with J around 14-16 Hz. However, the data here has one doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5 ppm as a dq. So that's different. 

Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (propenyl acetate), then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The trans configuration would have the OAc and CH3 on opposite sides. The proton on the C2 would be coupled to the C3 proton (J=16 Hz), and the C3 proton (which is adjacent to the methyl group) would be split by both the C2 proton (J=16) and the methyl group (J=6-7 Hz), leading to a dq. The methyl group at 1.6 ppm (d) would be split by the C3 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm as a singlet. This seems to fit. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. 

But wait, propenyl acetate could also be allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc). In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a doublet (coupled to C2), and the C2 proton would be a multiplet. But allyl acetate's NMR typically shows a triplet for the CH2-OAc. However, the data here doesn't match that. So the correct structure is more likely CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), which would have the two protons on the double bond as a doublet each, with one of them split by the adjacent methyl. 

Alternatively, butenyl acetate would have a longer chain, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The trans double bond would have a coupling of 16 Hz. The protons on the double bond would be split, but the adjacent protons would be CH2 groups. The splitting might be more complex. However, the presence of a dq (doublet of quartets) in the data suggests that the proton is coupled to two different groups: one with a large coupling (16 Hz, trans) and another with a smaller coupling (maybe to a neighboring CH3). 

Wait, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group split by one proton. So that methyl is adjacent to a CH group. In the propenyl acetate scenario (CH3-CH=CH-OAc), the methyl (1.6 ppm) is on the CH adjacent to the double bond. The CH would have a proton that's part of the double bond. Wait, no. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between the middle and the end. The CH3 is on the CH that's adjacent to the double bond. The proton on the CH (CH3-CH=CH-OAc) would be the one next to the double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's allyl acetate. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-OAc. But that would be isopropenyl acetate. The NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 on the double bond. But the data has a 1.6 ppm (d) which is split. So that's not it. 

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CH-OAc (vinyl acetate), the protons on the double bond would be two doublets. But the data shows one doublet at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5 ppm as a dq. So that's not matching. 

Wait, let's think again. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) must be a proton that is coupled to two different sets of protons. The d (doublet) comes from coupling to one proton (J=16 Hz), and the q (quartet) comes from coupling to three protons? But a quartet would be from coupling to three equivalent protons? Wait, no. A quartet (quartet) is from coupling to three equivalent protons? No, a quartet is from coupling to three protons with the same J. Wait, no, a quartet (n=4 peaks) arises from coupling to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule). But in this case, the 5.5 ppm proton is a dq, which is a doublet of quartets. So that would mean it's coupling to two different groups: one with a coupling of J1 (splitting into a doublet) and another with J2 (splitting each of those into a quartet). So total of 2x4=8 peaks? But the data says "dq" which is a doublet of quartets, but in reality, it's a multiplet that might appear as a dq. 

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm proton is coupled to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to a neighboring methyl group (J=6-7 Hz). The coupling to the methyl would split the peak into a quartet (since the methyl has three protons, n+1=4). But since the coupling to the trans proton is a doublet, the overall splitting would be a doublet of quartets. So each of the two peaks from the doublet would be split into four, resulting in 8 peaks. However, in practice, this might be observed as a dq if the coupling constants are different enough. 

So if the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), the proton on the CH adjacent to the methyl would be coupled to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to the methyl (J=6-7 Hz). The methyl would be split by the adjacent proton, giving a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This fits the data. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. 

But wait, propenyl acetate is usually allyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), which doesn't have cis/trans isomerism. So maybe the correct answer is Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's check that. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl acetate), the double bond is between C1 and C2. The trans configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. The protons on the double bond would be a doublet (J=16 Hz) and a multiplet. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 would be adjacent to a CH2-OAc group. The coupling to the trans proton (J=16 Hz) and to the adjacent CH2 group. But the splitting would be more complex. The methyl group (1.6 ppm, d) would be on the C2 (CH3-CH=CH...), but in that case, the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond, so it would be a CH3 attached to a CH=CH... So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc? But that would be a branched group. The splitting would be different. 

Alternatively, the correct structure is Trans-propenyl acetate, which is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), where the OAc is on one end, and the CH3 is on the other, trans to each other. The proton on the CH3 side (C2) would be coupled to the C3 proton (trans, J=16 Hz) and to the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz), leading to the dq. The methyl at 1.6 ppm (d) is the CH3 on C2, split by the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. 

Therefore, the answer should be Trans-propenyl acetate. But I need to confirm if propenyl acetate can have such a structure. Alternatively, maybe the correct name is Trans-1-propenyl acetate, but the options given are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, etc. So the answer is Trans-propenyl acetate.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16.0 Hz. High coupling constants (like 16 Hz) are typical for trans double bonds. For example, in cinnamic acid derivatives, the trans double bond between the aromatic ring and the carbonyl gives a J around 16 Hz. So, this suggests that the compound has a trans double bond adjacent to an electronegative group (like oxygen in the ester).\n\nThe 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). Let's think about what that means. A dq would result from a proton that is coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, if there's a CH group next to a double bond and adjacent to a CH3 group, the proton on the CH would couple with the double bond proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J around 6-7 Hz). So, the splitting would be a doublet from the coupling with the trans double bond proton and a quartet from coupling with the CH3. But since it's a dq, maybe the coupling constants are such that it's a doublet of quartets. Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a vinyl group adjacent to a methyl and another proton.\n\nThe 2.1 ppm singlet is a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like the acetate (OAc). The acetate methyl is typically around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because it's next to the carbonyl and there are no neighboring protons to split the signal.\n\nThe 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group that is split by a neighboring proton. For example, a CH3 group attached to a CH that's next to a double bond. The coupling constant here would be around 6-7 Hz, typical for vicinal coupling (adjacent CH and CH3).\n\nPutting this together, the structure likely has a trans double bond (from the 7.0 ppm, J=16 Hz), an acetate group (2.1 ppm singlet), a methyl group adjacent to a CH (1.6 ppm doublet), and a proton that's part of the double bond system (5.5 ppm dq). \n\nLet's consider trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl would be a three-carbon chain. The structure would be CH2=CH-OAc. But wait, that's a vinyl acetate. However, vinyl acetate's structure is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the adjacent CH2 on opposite sides. But in vinyl acetate, the double bond is between the CH2 and the OAc. The coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be trans (J=16 Hz). The proton on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3 (from the acetate?), but wait, the acetate is OAc, which is OCOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. The trans configuration would have the two protons on the CH2 and the OAc on opposite sides. However, in vinyl acetate, the double bond is between the CH2 and the OAc. The two protons on the CH2 would be cis or trans to the OAc. If it's trans, then the coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be J=16 Hz. But in vinyl acetate, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond is typically around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check.\n\nWait, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc. The double bond is between the two carbons. The OAc is on one carbon (the second carbon), and the first carbon has two protons. The coupling between the two protons on the double bond (the one on the CH2 and the one on the CHOAc) would be trans if they are on opposite sides. But in reality, vinyl acetate's coupling constant is around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. So maybe the trans-propenyl acetate would have a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons, but that's not possible. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the OAc is on the third carbon. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would have coupling constants. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would couple with each other (cis or trans). Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, each coupling with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But in allyl groups, the coupling between the two protons on the same CH2 (C1) would be geminal, but they are equivalent. The coupling between C1 and C2 would be vicinal, and the J value would depend on the geometry. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, if the structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl acetate), but that's not exactly. Wait, butenyl would be four carbons. Let's think again.\n\nThe options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's consider butenyl acetate. Butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond. The possible structures could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl), CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (2-butenyl), etc. The cis and trans would refer to the configuration of the double bond. For example, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be CH3-C(trans)=CH-OAc. Wait, but the OAc would be on the end. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl acetate). But the key is the position of the double bond and the ester group.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure for propenyl acetate is allyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the protons on the double bond (the two CH2 groups) would have coupling. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be split by the adjacent proton. But in allyl acetate, the protons on the central CH2 (the one next to the double bond) would be split by the protons on the double bond. However, the NMR data here shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz), which is a high coupling constant, suggesting a trans double bond. In allyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group. The coupling between the protons on C1 and C2 would be vicinal, and the J value would be around 10-12 Hz for cis or trans. Wait, but in allyl systems, the coupling between the protons on the same carbon (geminal) is usually around 2 Hz, but vicinal coupling (across the double bond) would be higher. However, in allyl acetate, the protons on the CH2=CH- group would be split by each other. For example, the protons on the CH2 (C1) would each couple with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3. Wait, that's vinyl acetate. But in vinyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHOAc. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. The coupling between the two protons on the CH2 and the proton on the CHOAc would be trans if the double bond is in the trans configuration. But in vinyl acetate, the coupling constant between the two protons on the double bond is around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. So if the coupling here is 16 Hz, that's trans. Therefore, the compound must have a trans double bond adjacent to the ester group.\n\nLooking at the options, trans-propenyl acetate would have a trans double bond in the propenyl group. Similarly, trans-butenyl acetate would have a trans double bond in the butenyl group. The key is to determine whether the compound is propenyl or butenyl.\n\nThe 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. For example, if there's a CH(CH3) group. In the case of butenyl acetate, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would be a branched structure. Alternatively, if the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the methyl group would be at the end. Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so the methyl is next to a proton. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl adjacent to a CH. But that would require the double bond to be between C1 and C2, and the CH(CH3) on C3. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans or cis), then the methyl (CH3) is on C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc. The methyl on C1 would be a triplet if coupled with the two protons on C2. But in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm, so maybe it's a CH3 adjacent to a CH that's next to the double bond.\n\nAlternatively, consider the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C1) would couple with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, the coupling constant would be higher. But in this case, the CH2 would have two protons, each coupling with the proton on C2. However, the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), which is one proton. That suggests that the proton on the double bond (the one next to the ester) is a doublet due to coupling with the trans proton. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHOAc, where the proton on the CH (C2) is coupled with the proton on the CH2 (C1) with J=16 Hz. But in that case, the C1 protons would be a doublet of doublets, but the data shows a doublet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but that's the same as propenyl acetate. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be at around 5-6 ppm. But the data shows a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is more deshielded, suggesting a proton adjacent to an electronegative group. For example, in cinnamate esters, the protons on the double bond adjacent to the ester are around 6-7 ppm. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 (vinyl acetate), but with a trans configuration. However, vinyl acetate typically has a cis double bond. If it's trans, the coupling constant would be higher. Let's check: in trans-Î²-substituted acrylates, the coupling constant between the Î± and Î² protons is around 15-16 Hz. For example, trans-cinnamate esters have J around 16 Hz. So if the compound is trans-propenyl acetate, which would be the trans isomer of vinyl acetate (CH2=CHOAc), then the proton on the CH (Î² position) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz. The adjacent proton (on the CH2) would be a doublet of quartets. Wait, but in vinyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the CH2 on opposite sides. The proton on the CH2 would be split by the coupling with the CH (J=16 Hz) and possibly by the adjacent protons. But in vinyl acetate, the CH2 group has two protons, which are equivalent if the double bond is trans. Wait, no, if the double bond is trans, the two protons on the CH2 would be on the same side as each other, but opposite to the OAc. However, in reality, vinyl acetate is usually in the cis configuration because the ester group is electron-withdrawing, stabilizing the cis form. But if it's trans, the coupling constant would be higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is trans-butenyl acetate. For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate), but the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, and the coupling between C1 and C2 would be J=10-12 Hz. But the data shows J=16 Hz. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans-2-butenyl acetate), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc. The trans configuration would lead to a coupling constant of around 16 Hz between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 (CH) would be a doublet (coupled with C2), and the methyl on C1 (CH3) would be a doublet if it's adjacent to a CH (C2). Let's see: in trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, trans-2-butenyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be a CH group. The coupling between C2 and C3 would be J=16 Hz (trans), so the proton on C3 would be a doublet at around 5.5 ppm (since it's next to the ester group, which deshields it). The methyl group on C1 (CH3) would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on C2. But in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)-, but that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, let's go back to the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (1H, d, J=16 Hz). This is likely the proton on the double bond adjacent to the ester group. The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq (doublet of quartets), which would be a proton that's coupled with two different protons. The 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group adjacent to a CH.\n\nPutting this together, the structure might be CH3-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but that's propenyl acetate. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be around 5-6 ppm, but the 7.0 ppm suggests a more deshielded proton. Alternatively, if the ester is conjugated to the double bond, like in CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 (vinyl acetate), but trans-configured. In that case, the proton on the CH (next to the ester) would be at higher ppm. Let's consider that structure: trans-vinyl acetate would be OAc-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but that's not right. Wait, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the CH2 on opposite sides. The proton on the CH (the one attached to the OAc) would be trans to the CH2 protons, leading to a coupling constant of 16 Hz. So the proton on the CH (OAc side) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The protons on the CH2 would be a doublet of doublets, but in the data, there's a 5.5 ppm peak as a dq. If the CH2 protons are split by the coupling with the CH (J=16 Hz) and another coupling, perhaps with a neighboring group. Wait, but in vinyl acetate, the CH2 is only adjacent to the CH (OAc) and nothing else. Unless there's branching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate). The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be around 5-6 ppm. The CH2-OAc would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2=CH- group. But this doesn't explain the 7.0 ppm peak. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, such as CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C3 and C4. The proton on C4 (CH2) would be coupled with C3 (CH) with J=16 Hz (trans). The proton on C3 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. The proton on C2 (CH2-OAc) would be adjacent to C3 and perhaps split into a dq. The methyl on C1 (CH3COO-) is the singlet at 2.1 ppm. The methyl at 1.6 ppm would be on C4 (CH2), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would have a methyl branch. The methyl at 1.6 ppm (doublet) would be adjacent to the CH (C3), which is next to the double bond (C2=C3). So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-OAc. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, with a methyl on C3. The proton on C3 would be a doublet (coupled with C2, J=16 Hz) at 7.0 ppm. The methyl on C3 would be a doublet (coupled with the C3 proton) at 1.6 ppm. The C2 proton would be part of the double bond and coupled with C3. The C1 proton (CH2) would be split by the C2 proton. But this is getting complicated. Let me draw this structure:\n\nStructure: CH2=CH-C(CH3)(OAc)- ?\n\nNo, the ester is OAc, so it's more like CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (cis or trans). In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 (attached to OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz) if trans. The proton on C2 (CH) would be a dq at 5.5 ppm, coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz). The CH3 on C1 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm (coupled with the C2 proton). The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This fits the data. So the structure would be trans-propenyl acetate: CH2=CH-OAc is vinyl acetate, but if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, that's propenyl acetate. Wait, propenyl is three carbons. So CH3-CH=CH-OAc would be propenyl acetate. The double bond between C2 and C3. The trans isomer would have the CH3 and OAc on opposite sides. The proton on C3 (OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The proton on C2 (CH) would be a dq, coupled with C3 (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz). The CH3 on C1 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This matches the given NMR data. Therefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, the options include Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. So based on the coupling constant J=16 Hz, which indicates trans configuration, the answer should be Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nBut let me verify again. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), the proton on the double bond adjacent to OAc (C3) would be trans to the CH3 on C2. The coupling between C2 and C3 protons would be J=16 Hz. The proton on C2 (CH) would be split by both the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq) at 5.5 ppm. The CH3 on C1 (attached to C2) would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm due to coupling with the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This all fits. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAlternatively, if it's butenyl acetate, the structure would have an extra carbon. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, and the coupling between C1 and C2 would be J=10-12 Hz (cis) or higher (trans). But the data shows J=16 Hz, which is more consistent with a trans configuration. However, in that case, the proton on C2 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the protons on C1 would be a doublet of doublets. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm, which might not fit. Also, the methyl group at 1.6 ppm would need to be on a different carbon. If it's butenyl, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would have a branched chain, and the methyl would be adjacent to a CH. However, the coupling constants and shifts might not align. \n\nGiven all this, the most plausible structure is Trans-propenyl acetate, where the trans double bond gives the J=16 Hz, the adjacent CH proton is split into a dq, the acetate methyl is a singlet, and the CH3 next to the CH is a doublet.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445350, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5384, prompt_tokens=696, total_tokens=6080, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The given 1H NMR data corresponds to **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans double bond** adjacent to an electronegative group (the acetate). The proton on the double bond (Î²-position to the ester) is deshielded and coupled to the Î±-proton.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This doublet of quartets arises from the Î±-proton (CH) adjacent to the trans double bond. It couples with the Î²-proton (J = 16 Hz, trans configuration) and the neighboring methyl group (J â‰ˆ 6-7 Hz), leading to the observed splitting pattern.

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet integrating to three protons corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc), which is not split due to no neighboring protons.

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group adjacent to the Î±-CH. This methyl (CH3) couples with the Î±-proton (J â‰ˆ 6-7 Hz), consistent with the structure CH3-CH=CH-OAc.

**Structure**: The compound is **CH3-CH=CH-OAc** in the **trans configuration**. The trans arrangement of the double bond explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), and the splitting patterns of the Î±-proton and methyl group align with the NMR data. 

**Answer**: **Trans-propenyl acetate**

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

But let's break it down step by step. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16.0 Hz. High coupling constants (like 16 Hz) are typical for trans double bonds. For example, in cinnamic acid derivatives, the trans double bond between the aromatic ring and the carbonyl gives a J around 16 Hz. So, this suggests that the compound has a trans double bond adjacent to an electronegative group (like oxygen in the ester).

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). Let's think about what that means. A dq would result from a proton that is coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, if there's a CH group next to a double bond and adjacent to a CH3 group, the proton on the CH would couple with the double bond proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J around 6-7 Hz). So, the splitting would be a doublet from the coupling with the trans double bond proton and a quartet from coupling with the CH3. But since it's a dq, maybe the coupling constants are such that it's a doublet of quartets. Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a vinyl group adjacent to a methyl and another proton.

The 2.1 ppm singlet is a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like the acetate (OAc). The acetate methyl is typically around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because it's next to the carbonyl and there are no neighboring protons to split the signal.

The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group that is split by a neighboring proton. For example, a CH3 group attached to a CH that's next to a double bond. The coupling constant here would be around 6-7 Hz, typical for vicinal coupling (adjacent CH and CH3).

Putting this together, the structure likely has a trans double bond (from the 7.0 ppm, J=16 Hz), an acetate group (2.1 ppm singlet), a methyl group adjacent to a CH (1.6 ppm doublet), and a proton that's part of the double bond system (5.5 ppm dq). 

Let's consider trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl would be a three-carbon chain. The structure would be CH2=CH-OAc. But wait, that's a vinyl acetate. However, vinyl acetate's structure is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the adjacent CH2 on opposite sides. But in vinyl acetate, the double bond is between the CH2 and the OAc. The coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be trans (J=16 Hz). The proton on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3 (from the acetate?), but wait, the acetate is OAc, which is OCOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. The trans configuration would have the two protons on the CH2 and the OAc on opposite sides. However, in vinyl acetate, the double bond is between the CH2 and the OAc. The two protons on the CH2 would be cis or trans to the OAc. If it's trans, then the coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be J=16 Hz. But in vinyl acetate, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond is typically around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check.

Wait, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc. The double bond is between the two carbons. The OAc is on one carbon (the second carbon), and the first carbon has two protons. The coupling between the two protons on the double bond (the one on the CH2 and the one on the CHOAc) would be trans if they are on opposite sides. But in reality, vinyl acetate's coupling constant is around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. So maybe the trans-propenyl acetate would have a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons, but that's not possible. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the OAc is on the third carbon. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would have coupling constants. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would couple with each other (cis or trans). Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, each coupling with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But in allyl groups, the coupling between the two protons on the same CH2 (C1) would be geminal, but they are equivalent. The coupling between C1 and C2 would be vicinal, and the J value would depend on the geometry. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, if the structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl acetate), but that's not exactly. Wait, butenyl would be four carbons. Let's think again.

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's consider butenyl acetate. Butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond. The possible structures could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl), CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (2-butenyl), etc. The cis and trans would refer to the configuration of the double bond. For example, trans-2-butenyl acetate would be CH3-C(trans)=CH-OAc. Wait, but the OAc would be on the end. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate) or CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl acetate). But the key is the position of the double bond and the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for propenyl acetate is allyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the protons on the double bond (the two CH2 groups) would have coupling. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be split by the adjacent proton. But in allyl acetate, the protons on the central CH2 (the one next to the double bond) would be split by the protons on the double bond. However, the NMR data here shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz), which is a high coupling constant, suggesting a trans double bond. In allyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group. The coupling between the protons on C1 and C2 would be vicinal, and the J value would be around 10-12 Hz for cis or trans. Wait, but in allyl systems, the coupling between the protons on the same carbon (geminal) is usually around 2 Hz, but vicinal coupling (across the double bond) would be higher. However, in allyl acetate, the protons on the CH2=CH- group would be split by each other. For example, the protons on the CH2 (C1) would each couple with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, then the coupling constant would be higher. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3. Wait, that's vinyl acetate. But in vinyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHOAc. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. The coupling between the two protons on the CH2 and the proton on the CHOAc would be trans if the double bond is in the trans configuration. But in vinyl acetate, the coupling constant between the two protons on the double bond is around 6-8 Hz, which is cis. So if the coupling here is 16 Hz, that's trans. Therefore, the compound must have a trans double bond adjacent to the ester group.

Looking at the options, trans-propenyl acetate would have a trans double bond in the propenyl group. Similarly, trans-butenyl acetate would have a trans double bond in the butenyl group. The key is to determine whether the compound is propenyl or butenyl.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. For example, if there's a CH(CH3) group. In the case of butenyl acetate, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would be a branched structure. Alternatively, if the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the methyl group would be at the end. Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so the methyl is next to a proton. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, the CH(CH3) would have a methyl adjacent to a CH. But that would require the double bond to be between C1 and C2, and the CH(CH3) on C3. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans or cis), then the methyl (CH3) is on C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc. The methyl on C1 would be a triplet if coupled with the two protons on C2. But in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm, so maybe it's a CH3 adjacent to a CH that's next to the double bond.

Alternatively, consider the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C1) would couple with the proton on C2. If the double bond is trans, the coupling constant would be higher. But in this case, the CH2 would have two protons, each coupling with the proton on C2. However, the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), which is one proton. That suggests that the proton on the double bond (the one next to the ester) is a doublet due to coupling with the trans proton. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHOAc, where the proton on the CH (C2) is coupled with the proton on the CH2 (C1) with J=16 Hz. But in that case, the C1 protons would be a doublet of doublets, but the data shows a doublet. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but that's the same as propenyl acetate. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be at around 5-6 ppm. But the data shows a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is more deshielded, suggesting a proton adjacent to an electronegative group. For example, in cinnamate esters, the protons on the double bond adjacent to the ester are around 6-7 ppm. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 (vinyl acetate), but with a trans configuration. However, vinyl acetate typically has a cis double bond. If it's trans, the coupling constant would be higher. Let's check: in trans-Î²-substituted acrylates, the coupling constant between the Î± and Î² protons is around 15-16 Hz. For example, trans-cinnamate esters have J around 16 Hz. So if the compound is trans-propenyl acetate, which would be the trans isomer of vinyl acetate (CH2=CHOAc), then the proton on the CH (Î² position) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz. The adjacent proton (on the CH2) would be a doublet of quartets. Wait, but in vinyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the CH2 on opposite sides. The proton on the CH2 would be split by the coupling with the CH (J=16 Hz) and possibly by the adjacent protons. But in vinyl acetate, the CH2 group has two protons, which are equivalent if the double bond is trans. Wait, no, if the double bond is trans, the two protons on the CH2 would be on the same side as each other, but opposite to the OAc. However, in reality, vinyl acetate is usually in the cis configuration because the ester group is electron-withdrawing, stabilizing the cis form. But if it's trans, the coupling constant would be higher.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is trans-butenyl acetate. For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (1-butenyl acetate), but the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, and the coupling between C1 and C2 would be J=10-12 Hz. But the data shows J=16 Hz. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (trans-2-butenyl acetate), the double bond is between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc. The trans configuration would lead to a coupling constant of around 16 Hz between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 (CH) would be a doublet (coupled with C2), and the methyl on C1 (CH3) would be a doublet if it's adjacent to a CH (C2). Let's see: in trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, trans-2-butenyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. The protons on C3 would be a CH group. The coupling between C2 and C3 would be J=16 Hz (trans), so the proton on C3 would be a doublet at around 5.5 ppm (since it's next to the ester group, which deshields it). The methyl group on C1 (CH3) would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on C2. But in the data, the methyl is a doublet at 1.6 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)-, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, let's go back to the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (1H, d, J=16 Hz). This is likely the proton on the double bond adjacent to the ester group. The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq (doublet of quartets), which would be a proton that's coupled with two different protons. The 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group adjacent to a CH.

Putting this together, the structure might be CH3-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl acetate), but that's propenyl acetate. The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be around 5-6 ppm, but the 7.0 ppm suggests a more deshielded proton. Alternatively, if the ester is conjugated to the double bond, like in CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 (vinyl acetate), but trans-configured. In that case, the proton on the CH (next to the ester) would be at higher ppm. Let's consider that structure: trans-vinyl acetate would be OAc-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but that's not right. Wait, vinyl acetate is CH2=CHOAc. The trans isomer would have the OAc and the CH2 on opposite sides. The proton on the CH (the one attached to the OAc) would be trans to the CH2 protons, leading to a coupling constant of 16 Hz. So the proton on the CH (OAc side) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The protons on the CH2 would be a doublet of doublets, but in the data, there's a 5.5 ppm peak as a dq. If the CH2 protons are split by the coupling with the CH (J=16 Hz) and another coupling, perhaps with a neighboring group. Wait, but in vinyl acetate, the CH2 is only adjacent to the CH (OAc) and nothing else. Unless there's branching.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (allyl acetate). The protons on the double bond (CH2=CH-) would be around 5-6 ppm. The CH2-OAc would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2=CH- group. But this doesn't explain the 7.0 ppm peak. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, such as CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl acetate). The double bond is between C3 and C4. The proton on C4 (CH2) would be coupled with C3 (CH) with J=16 Hz (trans). The proton on C3 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. The proton on C2 (CH2-OAc) would be adjacent to C3 and perhaps split into a dq. The methyl on C1 (CH3COO-) is the singlet at 2.1 ppm. The methyl at 1.6 ppm would be on C4 (CH2), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would have a methyl branch. The methyl at 1.6 ppm (doublet) would be adjacent to the CH (C3), which is next to the double bond (C2=C3). So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-OAc. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, with a methyl on C3. The proton on C3 would be a doublet (coupled with C2, J=16 Hz) at 7.0 ppm. The methyl on C3 would be a doublet (coupled with the C3 proton) at 1.6 ppm. The C2 proton would be part of the double bond and coupled with C3. The C1 proton (CH2) would be split by the C2 proton. But this is getting complicated. Let me draw this structure:

Structure: CH2=CH-C(CH3)(OAc)- ?

No, the ester is OAc, so it's more like CH2=CH-CH(CH2OAc)-? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (cis or trans). In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The proton on C3 (attached to OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz) if trans. The proton on C2 (CH) would be a dq at 5.5 ppm, coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz). The CH3 on C1 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm (coupled with the C2 proton). The acetate methyl is at 2.1 ppm. This fits the data. So the structure would be trans-propenyl acetate: CH2=CH-OAc is vinyl acetate, but if it's CH3-CH=CH-OAc, that's propenyl acetate. Wait, propenyl is three carbons. So CH3-CH=CH-OAc would be propenyl acetate. The double bond between C2 and C3. The trans isomer would have the CH3 and OAc on opposite sides. The proton on C3 (OAc) would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm (J=16 Hz). The proton on C2 (CH) would be a dq, coupled with C3 (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz). The CH3 on C1 would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This matches the given NMR data. Therefore, the compound is trans-propenyl acetate. But wait, the options include Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. So based on the coupling constant J=16 Hz, which indicates trans configuration, the answer should be Trans-propenyl acetate.

But let me verify again. If the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc (trans), the proton on the double bond adjacent to OAc (C3) would be trans to the CH3 on C2. The coupling between C2 and C3 protons would be J=16 Hz. The proton on C2 (CH) would be split by both the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and the adjacent CH3 (J=6-7 Hz), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq) at 5.5 ppm. The CH3 on C1 (attached to C2) would be a doublet at 1.6 ppm due to coupling with the C2 proton. The acetate methyl is a singlet at 2.1 ppm. This all fits. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.

Alternatively, if it's butenyl acetate, the structure would have an extra carbon. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 would be a CH2 group, and the coupling between C1 and C2 would be J=10-12 Hz (cis) or higher (trans). But the data shows J=16 Hz, which is more consistent with a trans configuration. However, in that case, the proton on C2 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the protons on C1 would be a doublet of doublets. But the data shows a dq at 5.5 ppm, which might not fit. Also, the methyl group at 1.6 ppm would need to be on a different carbon. If it's butenyl, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that would have a branched chain, and the methyl would be adjacent to a CH. However, the coupling constants and shifts might not align. 

Given all this, the most plausible structure is Trans-propenyl acetate, where the trans double bond gives the J=16 Hz, the adjacent CH proton is split into a dq, the acetate methyl is a singlet, and the CH3 next to the CH is a doublet.
