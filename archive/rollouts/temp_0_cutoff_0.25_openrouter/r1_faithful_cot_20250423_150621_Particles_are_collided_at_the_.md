# Original Question

Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. 
The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

What Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by understanding the relationship between the Lorentz factor, time dilation, and exponential decay. The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector is given by \( \exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}\right) \), where \( r \) is the radius of the detector, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

Given that one-third of the particles reach the walls when \( \gamma = 20 \), we set up the equation:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \tau}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
-\frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \tau} = \ln(3)
\]
Solving for \( \tau \), we find:
\[
\tau = \frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \ln(3)}
\]

For two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, we set up the similar equation:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting \( \tau \) from the previous result:
\[
\frac{r}{c \gamma \cdot \frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \ln(3)}} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
\]
Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

Using the values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):
\[
\gamma \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.18
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. The original Lorentz factor is around 20, and at that value, one-third of the particles make it to the walls. Now, they want to know what Lorentz factor would result in two-thirds reaching the walls. 

First, let me recall that Lorentz factor (γ) is related to time dilation. For particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is γ times their proper lifetime. So, if the particles are moving close to the speed of light, their lifetime is significantly extended from their own rest frame's perspective. 

The problem states that the particles travel "uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities," which I think means we can neglect any acceleration or deceleration; they move at a constant velocity. The decay is the main factor here. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, and if they don't decay before reaching the walls (30 meters away), they will be detected. 

So, the key idea is that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (γτ, where τ is the proper lifetime) must be long enough for them to travel the 30 meters to the detector walls. But since they decay, there's a probability that they decay before reaching the walls. The average number that reach the walls would depend on the ratio of the travel time to the lab-frame lifetime. 

Wait, but how exactly does the probability work here? The decay process is exponential. The probability that a particle survives until time t is given by exp(-t/(γτ)), right? Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by γ. 

But the time t it takes to reach the detector walls depends on the velocity. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed v ≈ c. So, the time to reach the wall is t = r / v ≈ r / c. Since r is 30 meters, t ≈ 30 m / 3e8 m/s = 1e-7 seconds. 

But the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)). So, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)). 

Wait, but the problem says that with γ ≈ 20, one-third reach the walls. So, we can set up the equation: exp(- (r / c) / (20τ)) = 1/3. Then, if we want two-thirds to reach the walls, we need exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)) = 2/3. 

But we don't know τ, the proper lifetime. However, since the first scenario gives us γ=20 and survival probability 1/3, we can use that to solve for τ, and then use that τ to find the required γ for survival probability 2/3. 

Let me write that out. 

For γ₁ = 20, survival probability P₁ = 1/3 = exp(- (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)). 

We can solve for τ:

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

So, τ = (r / c) / (γ₁ ln(3))

Now, for the second case, we want survival probability P₂ = 2/3. So:

ln(2/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Again, multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

But we already have τ in terms of r, c, γ₁, and ln(3). Substitute τ from above:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3)) ))

Simplify the right-hand side:

(r / c) divided by (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3))) ) = (r / c) * (c γ₁ ln(3)) / (γ₂ r) ) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

So, ln(3/2) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

Solve for γ₂:

γ₂ = γ₁ ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Plug in γ₁ = 20:

γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Calculate the numerical value. 

First, compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So, γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18

So, approximately 54.18. 

But let me check the calculations again to make sure. 

Wait, ln(3) is about 1.0986, and ln(3/2) is about 0.4055. So, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709. Then 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18. That seems right. 

But let me verify the steps again. 

We started with the survival probability P = exp(-t/(γτ)), where t = r/c. 

Given that for γ₁=20, P₁=1/3, so we solved for τ. Then, using the same τ, we found γ₂ such that P₂=2/3. 

But is the survival probability correctly modeled here? Let me think. 

The survival probability for a particle to live longer than time t is indeed exp(-t/(γτ)), since the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(γτ)). 

Therefore, the fraction of particles that reach the detector is equal to the probability that they survive the time it takes to reach the detector. 

Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity v ≈ c, so the time to reach the detector is t = r / c. 

Therefore, the survival probability is exp(- (r/c) / (γτ) ). 

So, the setup is correct. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. 

But let me check the algebra again. 

From the first scenario:

ln(1/3) = - (r / c) / (20 τ)

So, rearranged:

(r / c) / (20 τ) = ln(3)

Therefore, τ = (r / c) / (20 ln(3))

Then, for the second scenario:

ln(2/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Substitute τ:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ * (r / (20 c ln(3))) )

Simplify denominator:

γ₂ * (r / (20 c ln(3))) 

So, (r / c) divided by (γ₂ * (r / (20 c ln(3))) ) = (r/c) * (20 c ln(3) ) / (γ₂ r ) = (20 ln(3)) / γ₂

Therefore, ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / γ₂

Therefore, γ₂ = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Yes, that's correct. 

So, the calculation is correct. 

So, γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.18. 

So, approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe we need to round it. But perhaps we can write it more accurately. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 10 times the original? Wait, 20 to 54 is more than double, but not 10 times. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way to think about it: the number of particles that survive is a function of the ratio between the lab-frame lifetime (γτ) and the time it takes to reach the detector (r/c). 

So, if we denote t = r/c, then the survival probability is exp(- t / (γτ) )

Given that when γ=20, survival is 1/3, so:

1/3 = exp( - t / (20 τ) )

When we want survival probability 2/3, so:

2/3 = exp( - t / (γ_new τ) )

Take the ratio of the two equations:

(2/3)/(1/3) = exp( - t / (γ_new τ) ) / exp( - t / (20 τ) )

Which simplifies to:

2 = exp( t/(20 τ) - t/(γ_new τ) )

Take natural log:

ln(2) = t/(20 τ) - t/(γ_new τ)

But from the first equation, we have:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 τ) => t/(20 τ) = ln(3)

Therefore, substitute into the second equation:

ln(2) = ln(3) - t/(γ_new τ)

But t/(γ_new τ) = ln(3) - ln(2) = ln(3/2)

Therefore, t/(γ_new τ) = ln(3/2)

But t/(τ) = (r/c)/τ. From the first equation, t/(20 τ) = ln(3), so t/τ = 20 ln(3)

Therefore, t/(γ_new τ) = 20 ln(3) / γ_new = ln(3/2)

Therefore, γ_new = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.18

Same result. So, that's correct. 

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe we can round it to the nearest integer, 54. But perhaps the answer expects an exact expression. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where instead of using the exponential decay, they assume that the particles either decay instantaneously or not, but given the mention of average, it's more likely the exponential decay. 

Alternatively, if the decay time is such that the average distance a particle travels before decaying is γ c τ. Then, the fraction of particles that reach the wall would be the fraction for which γ c τ >= r. 

But that's not quite right. The average distance traveled is indeed γ c τ, but the distribution is exponential. The probability that the particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime exceeds t = r/(c). 

Which is the same as the survival probability beyond time t, which is exp(- t / (γ τ) ). So, that's the same as before. 

Alternatively, if the average distance is γ c τ, then the fraction of particles that reach the wall would be exp(- r / (γ c τ) ). Which is the same as before. 

So, the same result. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

But let me check with exact values. 

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081

So, 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.709511549

Multiply by 20: 2.709511549 * 20 ≈ 54.19023098

So, approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe the answer is approximately 55 or 54. But given that the original Lorentz factor was ~20, and the answer is about 54, which is 2.7 times larger. 

Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way: if one third reach the detector at γ=20, that means two thirds decay before reaching the detector. So, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The average time before decay is γτ. The time needed to reach the detector is t = r/c ≈ 1e-7 seconds. 

So, the average number of lifetimes is t / (γτ). For a Poisson process, the survival probability is exp(- t / (γτ) ). 

But given that at γ=20, exp(- t / (20 τ) ) = 1/3. So, solving for t / τ = 20 ln(3). 

Then, for the survival probability to be 2/3, we need exp(- t / (γ τ) ) = 2/3. Therefore, t / (γ τ) = ln(3/2). But t / τ is 20 ln(3), so 20 ln(3) / γ = ln(3/2). Therefore, γ = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 54.19. 

Same result. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "Lorentz factor of ~20" and asks "what Lorentz factor is needed..." so maybe the answer is approximately 55, but given that in particle physics, Lorentz factors are often quoted to a couple of decimal places, but maybe as an integer. Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact expression in terms of logarithms. 

But the question says "about two thirds," so maybe approximate. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the same proper lifetime τ. Wait, the problem says "new type of particles," so the proper lifetime τ is fixed, right? Because it's a property of the particle. So, when we change γ, we're changing the lab frame lifetime, but τ remains the same. 

Therefore, the approach is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. If one third reach the walls at γ=20, then to have two thirds reach, you need the lab frame lifetime to be doubled? Wait, no. Because the survival probability is exponential. 

Wait, if you want the survival probability to go from 1/3 to 2/3, that's doubling the survival probability. But since it's an exponential function, you can't just double γ. 

Alternatively, since the exponent is - (r / c) / (γ τ). Let me denote k = (r / c) / τ. Then, the survival probability is exp(-k / γ). 

Given that when γ=20, exp(-k / 20) = 1/3. So, k = 20 ln(3). 

Then, for survival probability 2/3, we need exp(-k / γ_new) = 2/3. Therefore, k / γ_new = ln(3/2). Therefore, γ_new = k / ln(3/2) = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 54.18. 

Same result. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

But maybe the problem expects an answer of 60? Let me check with γ=60. 

Compute ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 2.7095, so 20*2.7095≈54.19. So, 54.19. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. If one third reach the walls at γ=20, then to have two thirds reach, you need the particles to live twice as long, so γ=40? But that would be the case if the decay time was linearly related to the survival probability, but it's exponential. So, no, that approach is incorrect. 

Alternatively, if the average distance is γcτ, then to have twice as many particles reach the detector, you need the average distance to be doubled? Wait, no. The average distance is γcτ. If you increase γ, the average distance increases. The fraction of particles that reach the wall is the probability that their decay length is greater than r. 

The decay length distribution is f(x) = (1/(γcτ)) exp(-x/(γcτ)). So, the probability that x >= r is exp(-r/(γcτ)). 

So, same as before. 

Therefore, the required γ is 54.18. 

So, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "about" two thirds, so maybe 55 is acceptable, but given that the original was ~20, which is approximate, the answer is approximately 55. But maybe they want an exact expression. 

Alternatively, write the answer as 20 ln 3 / ln (3/2). 

But the question asks for "what Lorentz factor is needed," so boxed as a number. 

Given that, I think the answer is approximately 54.2, which can be rounded to 54 or 55. But let me check with precise calculation. 

Compute ln(3) = 1.098612289

ln(3/2) = 0.4054651081

Divide ln(3) by ln(3/2):

1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 = 2.709511549

Multiply by 20:

2.709511549 * 20 = 54.19023098

So, approximately 54.19. 

So, 54.2 is accurate. 

But in experimental physics, factors are often quoted to the nearest whole number, so 54. But maybe 55. 

Alternatively, the problem might expect an answer of 60, but that's not correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check once more. 

We have two equations:

1) exp(-r/(c γ₁ τ)) = 1/3

2) exp(-r/(c γ₂ τ)) = 2/3

Divide equation 2 by equation 1:

exp(-r/(c γ₂ τ)) / exp(-r/(c γ₁ τ)) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2

Which simplifies to:

exp( r/(c τ) (1/γ₁ - 1/γ₂) ) = 2

Take natural log:

r/(c τ) (1/γ₁ - 1/γ₂) = ln(2)

But from equation 1:

r/(c τ) = γ₁ ln(3)

Therefore:

γ₁ ln(3) (1/γ₁ - 1/γ₂) = ln(2)

Simplify:

ln(3) (1 - γ₁/γ₂) = ln(2)

Therefore:

1 - γ₁/γ₂ = ln(2)/ln(3)

Thus:

γ₁/γ₂ = 1 - ln(2)/ln(3)

Therefore:

γ₂ = γ₁ / (1 - ln(2)/ln(3))

Compute 1 - ln(2)/ln(3):

ln(3) ≈1.0986, ln(2)≈0.6931

ln(2)/ln(3) ≈0.6309

1 - 0.6309≈0.3691

Therefore, γ₂=20 /0.3691≈54.18

Same result. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

So, I think that's the correct answer. 

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

Okay, so I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. The original Lorentz factor is around 20, and at that value, one-third of the particles make it to the walls. Now, they want to know what Lorentz factor would result in two-thirds reaching the walls. 

First, let me recall that Lorentz factor (γ) is related to time dilation. For particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is γ times their proper lifetime. So, if the particles are moving close to the speed of light, their lifetime is significantly extended from their own rest frame's perspective. 

The problem states that the particles travel "uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities," which I think means we can neglect any acceleration or deceleration; they move at a constant velocity. The decay is the main factor here. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, and if they don't decay before reaching the walls (30 meters away), they will be detected. 

So, the key idea is that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (γτ, where τ is the proper lifetime) must be long enough for them to travel the 30 meters to the detector walls. But since they decay, there's a probability that they decay before reaching the walls. The average number that reach the walls would depend on the ratio of the travel time to the lab-frame lifetime. 

Wait, but how exactly does the probability work here? The decay process is exponential. The probability that a particle survives until time t is given by exp(-t/(γτ)), right? Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by γ. 

But the time t it takes to reach the detector walls depends on the velocity. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed v ≈ c. So, the time to reach the wall is t = r / v ≈ r / c. Since r is 30 meters, t ≈ 30 m / 3e8 m/s = 1e-7 seconds. 

But the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)). So, the fraction of particles that reach the wall is exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)). 

Wait, but the problem says that with γ ≈ 20, one-third reach the walls. So, we can set up the equation: exp(- (r / c) / (20τ)) = 1/3. Then, if we want two-thirds to reach the walls, we need exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)) = 2/3. 

But we don't know τ, the proper lifetime. However, since the first scenario gives us γ=20 and survival probability 1/3, we can use that to solve for τ, and then use that τ to find the required γ for survival probability 2/3. 

Let me write that out. 

For γ₁ = 20, survival probability P₁ = 1/3 = exp(- (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)). 

We can solve for τ:

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

So, τ = (r / c) / (γ₁ ln(3))

Now, for the second case, we want survival probability P₂ = 2/3. So:

ln(2/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Again, multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

But we already have τ in terms of r, c, γ₁, and ln(3). Substitute τ from above:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3)) ))

Simplify the right-hand side:

(r / c) divided by (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3))) ) = (r / c) * (c γ₁ ln(3)) / (γ₂ r) ) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

So, ln(3/2) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

Solve for γ₂:

γ₂ = γ₁ ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Plug in γ₁ = 20:

γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Calculate the numerical value. 

First, compute

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine what Lorentz factor would allow two-thirds of particles to reach the detector's inner walls. The detector is spherical with a 30-meter radius. Currently, with a Lorentz factor of approximately 20, one-third of the particles successfully reach the walls.

I should note that the Lorentz factor (γ) relates to time dilation for particles moving at relativistic speeds. In the laboratory frame, particles have a lifetime that's γ times longer than their proper lifetime. For particles traveling near light speed, this significantly extends their observable lifetime.

According to the problem, these particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities without interruption, suggesting they maintain constant velocity. Decay is the primary concern here. The particles originate at the detector's center, and if they don't decay before traveling 30 meters to reach the walls, they will be detected.

The critical factor is whether the particle's laboratory-frame lifetime (γτ, where τ represents proper lifetime) is sufficient for them to traverse the 30 meters to the detector walls. Since they decay exponentially, there's a probability distribution governing how many reach the walls before decaying.

For exponential decay, the probability of a particle surviving until time t is given by exp(-t/(γτ)). The time required to reach the detector walls depends on velocity. At ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so the travel time is approximately t = r/c = 30m/(3×10^8 m/s) = 10^-7 seconds.

The fraction of particles reaching the wall is therefore exp(-(r/c)/(γτ)). With γ ≈ 20, we know one-third reach the walls, so: exp(-(r/c)/(20τ)) = 1/3. For two-thirds to reach the walls, we need: exp(-(r/c)/(γτ)) = 2/3.

While we don't know τ directly, we can use the first scenario to solve for it, then find the required γ for the second scenario.

For γ₁ = 20 with survival probability P₁ = 1/3:
ln(1/3) = -(r/c)/(γ₁τ)
ln(3) = (r/c)/(γ₁τ)
τ = (r/c)/(γ₁ln(3))

For the second case with P₂ = 2/3:
ln(2/3) = -(r/c)/(γ₂τ)
ln(3/2) = (r/c)/(γ₂τ)

Substituting our expression for τ:
ln(3/2) = (r/c)/(γ₂·(r/(cγ₁ln(3))))
ln(3/2) = (γ₁ln(3))/γ₂

Solving for γ₂:
γ₂ = γ₁ln(3)/ln(3/2) = 20·ln(3)/ln(3/2)

From here, I can calculate the numerical value.

# OpenAI completion

Sure, here's the rephrased text:

Alright, I need to determine the Lorentz factor necessary for approximately two-thirds of the particles to reach the inner walls of the spherical detector, which has a radius of 30 meters. The initial Lorentz factor is about 20, allowing one-third of the particles to reach the walls. The goal is to find a Lorentz factor where two-thirds of the particles make it to the walls.

Let me remember that the Lorentz factor (γ) is associated with time dilation. When particles move at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime in the lab frame is γ times their proper lifetime. Thus, near-light-speed particles have significantly extended lifetimes from their rest frame perspective.

The scenario indicates that the particles move "uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic speeds," implying negligible acceleration or deceleration; they maintain a constant velocity. The main issue is particle decay. Particles are generated at the center, and they need to avoid decaying before reaching the walls 30 meters away to be detected.

The key point is that the particle's lab-frame lifetime (γτ, with τ as the proper lifetime) should be lengthy enough for them to cover the 30 meters to the detector walls. As decay occurs, a probability exists for decay before wall contact. The average reaching the walls depends on the travel time to lab-frame lifetime ratio.

How exactly does this probability work? The decay process follows an exponential pattern. The probability of a particle surviving until time t is given by exp(-t/(γτ)), because γ multiplies lifetime dilation in the lab frame.

The time t to reach the detector walls is a function of velocity. With ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c. Hence, the time to reach the wall is t = r / v ≈ r / c. Since r = 30 meters, t ≈ 30 m / 3e8 m/s = 1e-7 seconds.

The survival probability is exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)). Therefore, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)).

When γ ≈ 20, one-third reach the walls. Therefore, the equation is: exp(- (r / c) / (20τ)) = 1/3. For two-thirds to reach the walls, we need exp(- (r / c) / (γτ)) = 2/3.

We don't know τ, the proper lifetime, but with γ=20 and a 1/3 survival probability in the first case, we can find τ and use it to determine γ for a 2/3 survival probability.

Let's work through that. 

For γ₁ = 20, with survival probability P₁ = 1/3, we have:

ln(1/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = (r / c) / (γ₁ τ)

Thus, τ = (r / c) / (γ₁ ln(3))

Now, for the desired survival probability P₂ = 2/3:

ln(2/3) = - (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Again, multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ τ)

Substituting τ from the previous step:

ln(3/2) = (r / c) / (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3))))

Simplify:

(r / c) divided by (γ₂ * (r / (c γ₁ ln(3)))) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

So, ln(3/2) = (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂

Solving for γ₂:

γ₂ = γ₁ ln(3) / ln(3/2)

With γ₁ = 20:

γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Now proceed to calculate the numerical value.

If you want to increase the survival probability from 1/3 to 2/3, you need to decrease the decay probability, which would require increasing the Lorentz factor. \n\nBut the relation is exponential, so it\'s not linear. However, the way we set up the equations seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance traveled would be v * γτ ≈ c γτ. So, the average distance is c γτ. \n\nIf the radius is 30 meters, then the condition for half of the particles to survive would be when the average distance c γτ is equal to the radius. But in our case, it\'s not half, but two-thirds. \n\nWait, but the survival probability is P = exp(-t/(γτ)). If the average lifetime is γτ, then the average time before decay is γτ. The time to reach the wall is t = r / c. So, the ratio t/(γτ) = (r / c)/(γτ). \n\nBut in the first scenario, with γ=20, P=1/3. So, we can relate these. \n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of the required gamma to make t/(γτ) smaller, so that the exponent is smaller in magnitude, leading to a higher survival probability. \n\nBut the steps I did earlier seem correct. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s think about the relation between the two gammas. \n\nWe have for the first case:\n\n- ln(1/3) = (r / c)/(20 τ)\n\nFor the second case:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (r / c)/(γ₂ τ)\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n[ - ln(1/3) ] / [ - ln(2/3) ] = (r / c)/(20 τ) / ( (r / c)/(γ₂ τ) ) = γ₂ / 20\n\nTherefore:\n\nln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n\nThus, γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.18\n\nSame result. \n\nSo, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. \n\nBut the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe we can round to the nearest integer, so 54. But maybe they want a more precise answer or perhaps a fractional value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe express it as 20 multiplied by ln3 divided by ln(3/2). \n\nBut since the question is from a physics problem, they might expect a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s compute ln(3)/ln(3/2):\n\nln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 ≈ 0.4055\n\nSo, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709\n\nThus, 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18. \n\nSo, approximately 54.2. \n\nBut maybe the answer is 54.2, but given that Lorentz factors are usually given to a reasonable precision, maybe 54 or 55. \n\nBut the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe approximate. But let\'s check if 54.18 is the exact answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. \n\nWait, another way: the number of particles surviving is a function of the ratio between the detector radius and the decay length. The decay length is γ c τ. So, if the decay length is L = γ c τ, then the survival probability is exp(-r / L) = exp(-r / (γ c τ)). \n\nGiven that when γ=20, the survival probability is 1/3, so:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 c τ))\n\nSimilarly, when we want survival probability 2/3:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ c τ))\n\nSo, taking the ratio or relating the two equations. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for c τ:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 c τ)) => ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 c τ) => c τ = 30 / (20 ln 3) ≈ 30 / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters. \n\nWait, c τ is a decay length in the rest frame? Wait, no. c τ is the decay length in the rest frame. Because τ is the proper lifetime, so c τ is how far the particle would travel in its rest frame before decaying. But in the lab frame, the decay length is γ c τ. \n\nSo, in the first case, decay length L1 = 20 c τ. \n\nBut from the first equation, 1/3 = exp(-30 / L1) => 30 / L1 = ln(3) => L1 = 30 / ln(3) ≈ 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters. \n\nWait, but L1 is γ c τ = 20 c τ. So, 20 c τ = 30 / ln(3) => c τ = 30 / (20 ln(3)) ≈ 1.365 meters. \n\nThen, for the second case, we want 2/3 = exp(-30 / L2), where L2 = γ c τ. \n\nSo, 30 / L2 = ln(3/2) => L2 = 30 / ln(3/2) ≈ 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 73.97 meters. \n\nBut L2 = γ c τ = γ * (30 / (20 ln(3))) from above. \n\nSo, γ * (30 / (20 ln(3))) = 30 / ln(3/2)\n\nCancel 30:\n\nγ / (20 ln(3)) = 1 / ln(3/2)\n\nThus, γ = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 54.18. \n\nSame result. \n\nSo, this confirms the previous calculation. \n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. \n\nBut let me check if there\'s a simpler way to see this ratio. \n\nSince the survival probability depends exponentially on -r/(γ c τ). So, if we want to go from P1=1/3 to P2=2/3, the ratio of the exponents is ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) = (ln 2 - ln 3)/( - ln 3) )= (ln 3 - ln 2)/ln 3 = 1 - (ln 2)/ln 3 ≈ 1 - 0.6309 ≈ 0.3691. \n\nBut the exponent for P2 is ln(2/3) = -0.4055, and for P1 is ln(1/3) = -1.0986. The ratio of the exponents is 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369, which is the same as above. \n\nBut how does this relate to the gamma? \n\nThe exponent is proportional to 1/γ. So, if we want the exponent to be 0.369 times the original exponent, then 1/γ2 = 0.369 * (1/γ1). Therefore, γ2 = γ1 / 0.369 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2. \n\nYes, that\'s another way to see it. \n\nSo, all methods lead to approximately 54.2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. \n\nBut let me check if the problem states "ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20". So, maybe the velocity distribution is peaked around γ=20, but the question is asking for a similar distribution centered around a higher γ where two-thirds reach the walls. \n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it\'s about changing the Lorentz factor so that the fraction changes from one-third to two-thirds. Since the survival probability depends on the Lorentz factor, we need to solve for γ such that P=2/3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is γ ≈ 54.2. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of a multiple of the original gamma? For example, noticing that going from 1/3 to 2/3 requires the exponent to change sign, but since it\'s exponential, the factor is as we calculated. \n\nAlternatively, since 1/3 to 2/3 is doubling the survival probability, but because it\'s exponential decay, the relation isn\'t linear. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the number of particles surviving is inversely related to the decay probability. But no, it\'s an exponential relation. \n\nAlternatively, think in terms of half-life, but it\'s not exactly a half-life here. \n\nBut all approaches lead to the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 54.2. Since the problem says "about two thirds," and the original gamma was ~20, the answer is approximately 55. But maybe they want it more precise. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s compute ln(3)/ln(3/2) more accurately. \n\nln(3) = 1.098612289\n\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) = 1.098612289 - 0.693147181 ≈ 0.405465108\n\nSo, ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.098612289 / 0.405465108 ≈ 2.70951155\n\nMultiply by 20: 20 * 2.70951155 ≈ 54.190231\n\nSo, approximately 54.2. \n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. \n\nBut in exams or textbooks, sometimes they round it to two significant figures, so 54. But since the original gamma was given as ~20 (one sig fig?), but maybe two. If 20 is two sig figs, then 54.2 would be three, but perhaps they want two. \n\nBut the problem says "about" two thirds, so maybe approximate to the nearest integer. So, 54 or 55. \n\nBut 54.19 is closer to 54.2, which is approximately 54. So, maybe 54. \n\nBut let\'s check with γ=54. \n\nCompute the survival probability with γ=54. \n\nFirst, compute τ from the original condition. \n\nFrom before, τ = (r / c) / (γ₁ ln 3) = 30 / (3e8) / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 1e-7 / 21.972 ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds. \n\nThen, for γ=54, the survival probability is exp(- (r / c) / (γ τ)) = exp(-30 / (3e8 * 54 * 4.55e-9)). \n\nCompute denominator: 3e8 * 54 = 1.62e10; 1.62e10 * 4.55e-9 ≈ 1.62 * 4.55 * 10 ≈ 7.371 * 10 ≈ 73.71. \n\nSo, 30 / 73.71 ≈ 0.407. \n\nSo, exp(-0.407) ≈ 0.666. \n\nWhich is approximately 2/3 (0.6667). \n\nSo, with γ=54, the survival probability is approximately 66.6%, which is about two-thirds. \n\nTherefore, γ≈54 is correct. \n\nBut the calculation gave 54.19, so 54.2. But since we can\'t have a fraction of a Lorentz factor in practical terms, but since the question is theoretical, we can state it as approximately 54.2. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects an exact answer in terms of logarithms, but since they asked for a numerical value, 54.2 is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.2. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately \\boxed{54}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446233, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3566, prompt_tokens=1074, total_tokens=4640, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by understanding the relationship between the Lorentz factor (γ) and the survival probability of the particles. The survival probability is given by an exponential decay law:

\[ P = \exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}\right) \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the detector (30 meters), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particles. 

Given that one-third of the particles reach the walls when \( \gamma = 20 \), we can solve for \( \tau \):

\[ \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau}\right) \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau} \]

Solving for \( \tau \):

\[ \tau = \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \ln(3)} \]

Next, we need to find the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) such that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls:

\[ \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma \tau}\right) \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma \tau} \]

Substituting \( \tau \) from the previous result:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{30}{c \gamma \cdot \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \ln(3)}} \]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma} \]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[ \gamma = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \]

Using the values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[ \gamma \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the required Lorentz factor is approximately:

\[
\boxed{54}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So, γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18

So, approximately 54.18. 

But the question says "about two thirds," so maybe we need to round it, but perhaps they want an exact expression. However, the original gamma was ~20, so maybe approximate answer is okay. 

Wait, but let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting from the survival probability:

P = exp(-t/(γτ)) where t = r / c (since v ≈ c). 

Given that for γ₁ = 20, P₁ = 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp(- (r / c)/(20 τ)). 

Then, solving for τ gives τ = (r / c)/(20 ln 3). 

Then, for P₂ = 2/3, we have 2/3 = exp(- (r / c)/(γ₂ τ)). 

Substituting τ:

2/3 = exp(- (r / c)/(γ₂ * (r / (20 c ln 3)) )) = exp(- (20 ln 3)/γ₂ )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = - (20 ln 3)/γ₂

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln 3)/γ₂

Therefore, γ₂ = (20 ln 3)/ln(3/2) ≈ (20 * 1.0986)/0.4055 ≈ 54.18. 

Yes, that seems correct. 

So, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. 

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. 

Alternatively, since the survival probability is inversely related to the Lorentz factor. If you want to increase the survival probability from 1/3 to 2/3, you need to decrease the decay probability, which would require increasing the Lorentz factor. 

But the relation is exponential, so it's not linear. However, the way we set up the equations seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe using the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance traveled would be v * γτ ≈ c γτ. So, the average distance is c γτ. 

If the radius is 30 meters, then the condition for half of the particles to survive would be when the average distance c γτ is equal to the radius. But in our case, it's not half, but two-thirds. 

Wait, but the survival probability is P = exp(-t/(γτ)). If the average lifetime is γτ, then the average time before decay is γτ. The time to reach the wall is t = r / c. So, the ratio t/(γτ) = (r / c)/(γτ). 

But in the first scenario, with γ=20, P=1/3. So, we can relate these. 

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of the required gamma to make t/(γτ) smaller, so that the exponent is smaller in magnitude, leading to a higher survival probability. 

But the steps I did earlier seem correct. 

Alternatively, let's think about the relation between the two gammas. 

We have for the first case:

- ln(1/3) = (r / c)/(20 τ)

For the second case:

- ln(2/3) = (r / c)/(γ₂ τ)

Dividing the two equations:

[ - ln(1/3) ] / [ - ln(2/3) ] = (r / c)/(20 τ) / ( (r / c)/(γ₂ τ) ) = γ₂ / 20

Therefore:

ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20

Thus, γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.18

Same result. 

So, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. 

But the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe we can round to the nearest integer, so 54. But maybe they want a more precise answer or perhaps a fractional value. 

Alternatively, maybe express it as 20 multiplied by ln3 divided by ln(3/2). 

But since the question is from a physics problem, they might expect a numerical answer. 

Alternatively, let's compute ln(3)/ln(3/2):

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 ≈ 0.4055

So, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709

Thus, 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18. 

So, approximately 54.2. 

But maybe the answer is 54.2, but given that Lorentz factors are usually given to a reasonable precision, maybe 54 or 55. 

But the problem says "about two thirds," so maybe approximate. But let's check if 54.18 is the exact answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, another way: the number of particles surviving is a function of the ratio between the detector radius and the decay length. The decay length is γ c τ. So, if the decay length is L = γ c τ, then the survival probability is exp(-r / L) = exp(-r / (γ c τ)). 

Given that when γ=20, the survival probability is 1/3, so:

1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 c τ))

Similarly, when we want survival probability 2/3:

2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ c τ))

So, taking the ratio or relating the two equations. 

From the first equation, we can solve for c τ:

1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 c τ)) => ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 c τ) => c τ = 30 / (20 ln 3) ≈ 30 / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters. 

Wait, c τ is a decay length in the rest frame? Wait, no. c τ is the decay length in the rest frame. Because τ is the proper lifetime, so c τ is how far the particle would travel in its rest frame before decaying. But in the lab frame, the decay length is γ c τ. 

So, in the first case, decay length L1 = 20 c τ. 

But from the first equation, 1/3 = exp(-30 / L1) => 30 / L1 = ln(3) => L1 = 30 / ln(3) ≈ 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters. 

Wait, but L1 is γ c τ = 20 c τ. So, 20 c τ = 30 / ln(3) => c τ = 30 / (20 ln(3)) ≈ 1.365 meters. 

Then, for the second case, we want 2/3 = exp(-30 / L2), where L2 = γ c τ. 

So, 30 / L2 = ln(3/2) => L2 = 30 / ln(3/2) ≈ 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 73.97 meters. 

But L2 = γ c τ = γ * (30 / (20 ln(3))) from above. 

So, γ * (30 / (20 ln(3))) = 30 / ln(3/2)

Cancel 30:

γ / (20 ln(3)) = 1 / ln(3/2)

Thus, γ = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 54.18. 

Same result. 

So, this confirms the previous calculation. 

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. 

But let me check if there's a simpler way to see this ratio. 

Since the survival probability depends exponentially on -r/(γ c τ). So, if we want to go from P1=1/3 to P2=2/3, the ratio of the exponents is ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) = (ln 2 - ln 3)/( - ln 3) )= (ln 3 - ln 2)/ln 3 = 1 - (ln 2)/ln 3 ≈ 1 - 0.6309 ≈ 0.3691. 

But the exponent for P2 is ln(2/3) = -0.4055, and for P1 is ln(1/3) = -1.0986. The ratio of the exponents is 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369, which is the same as above. 

But how does this relate to the gamma? 

The exponent is proportional to 1/γ. So, if we want the exponent to be 0.369 times the original exponent, then 1/γ2 = 0.369 * (1/γ1). Therefore, γ2 = γ1 / 0.369 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. 

So, all methods lead to approximately 54.2. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. 

But let me check if the problem states "ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20". So, maybe the velocity distribution is peaked around γ=20, but the question is asking for a similar distribution centered around a higher γ where two-thirds reach the walls. 

But the way the problem is phrased, it's about changing the Lorentz factor so that the fraction changes from one-third to two-thirds. Since the survival probability depends on the Lorentz factor, we need to solve for γ such that P=2/3. 

Therefore, the answer is γ ≈ 54.2. 

But maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of a multiple of the original gamma? For example, noticing that going from 1/3 to 2/3 requires the exponent to change sign, but since it's exponential, the factor is as we calculated. 

Alternatively, since 1/3 to 2/3 is doubling the survival probability, but because it's exponential decay, the relation isn't linear. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the number of particles surviving is inversely related to the decay probability. But no, it's an exponential relation. 

Alternatively, think in terms of half-life, but it's not exactly a half-life here. 

But all approaches lead to the same result. 

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 54.2. Since the problem says "about two thirds," and the original gamma was ~20, the answer is approximately 55. But maybe they want it more precise. 

Alternatively, let's compute ln(3)/ln(3/2) more accurately. 

ln(3) = 1.098612289

ln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) = 1.098612289 - 0.693147181 ≈ 0.405465108

So, ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.098612289 / 0.405465108 ≈ 2.70951155

Multiply by 20: 20 * 2.70951155 ≈ 54.190231

So, approximately 54.2. 

Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. 

But in exams or textbooks, sometimes they round it to two significant figures, so 54. But since the original gamma was given as ~20 (one sig fig?), but maybe two. If 20 is two sig figs, then 54.2 would be three, but perhaps they want two. 

But the problem says "about" two thirds, so maybe approximate to the nearest integer. So, 54 or 55. 

But 54.19 is closer to 54.2, which is approximately 54. So, maybe 54. 

But let's check with γ=54. 

Compute the survival probability with γ=54. 

First, compute τ from the original condition. 

From before, τ = (r / c) / (γ₁ ln 3) = 30 / (3e8) / (20 * 1.0986) ≈ 1e-7 / 21.972 ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds. 

Then, for γ=54, the survival probability is exp(- (r / c) / (γ τ)) = exp(-30 / (3e8 * 54 * 4.55e-9)). 

Compute denominator: 3e8 * 54 = 1.62e10; 1.62e10 * 4.55e-9 ≈ 1.62 * 4.55 * 10 ≈ 7.371 * 10 ≈ 73.71. 

So, 30 / 73.71 ≈ 0.407. 

So, exp(-0.407) ≈ 0.666. 

Which is approximately 2/3 (0.6667). 

So, with γ=54, the survival probability is approximately 66.6%, which is about two-thirds. 

Therefore, γ≈54 is correct. 

But the calculation gave 54.19, so 54.2. But since we can't have a fraction of a Lorentz factor in practical terms, but since the question is theoretical, we can state it as approximately 54.2. 

Alternatively, if the problem expects an exact answer in terms of logarithms, but since they asked for a numerical value, 54.2 is acceptable. 

Therefore, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.2. 

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the required Lorentz factor (γ) for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze their survival probability based on relativistic time dilation and exponential decay.

**Given:**
- Detector radius, \( r = 30 \, \text{m} \)
- Initial Lorentz factor, \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), with survival probability \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Desired survival probability, \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \)

**Key Equations:**
1. Survival probability: \( P = e^{-t/(\gamma \tau)} \)
2. Travel time (ultra-relativistic): \( t \approx \frac{r}{c} \)

**Step 1: Relate τ using initial conditions**
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{r}{c \gamma_1 \tau} \implies \tau = \frac{r}{c \gamma_1 \ln 3}
\]

**Step 2: Apply desired probability to find new γ**
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{r}{c \gamma_2 \tau} \implies \gamma_2 = \frac{\gamma_1 \ln 3}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate γ₂**
\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \times \frac{\ln 3}{\ln(3/2)} \approx 20 \times \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.2
\]

**Answer:** A Lorentz factor of approximately **54** is needed.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Let me compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So γ₂ ≈ 20·1.0986/0.4055 ≈ 20·2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Therefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 would be needed to have two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by noting that the survival probability of a particle is given by an exponential decay law. The survival probability \( P \) is:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}\right)
\]

where \( r \) is the radius of the detector, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

Given that one-third of the particles reach the walls when \( \gamma = 20 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
\]

Solving for \( \tau \):

\[
\tau = \frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \ln(3)}
\]

For two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, we need:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{r}{c \gamma \tau}
\]

Substituting \( \tau \) from the previous result:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{r}{c \gamma \cdot \frac{r}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \ln(3)}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma}
\]

Multiplying both sides by -1:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma}
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

Using the approximations \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.19
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Let's compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So, γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Therefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 would be needed. Let me check the steps again to ensure no errors.

First, the survival probability is exp(-t/(γτ)), where t = r/(c). For the first case, γ=20, P=1/3. So, exp(-r/(c γ τ)) = 1/3. Then, solving for τ gives τ = r/(c γ ln(3)). Then, for P=2/3, exp(-r/(c γ₂ τ)) = 2/3. Substitute τ from before, so exp(-r/(c γ₂ * (r/(c γ₁ ln(3))))) = exp(- (γ₁ ln(3)) / γ₂ ) = 2/3. Taking natural logs: - (γ₁ ln(3))/γ₂ = ln(2/3). Multiply both sides by -1: (γ₁ ln(3))/γ₂ = ln(3/2). Then, γ₂ = γ₁ ln(3)/ln(3/2). The calculation seems correct.

Yes, so the answer is approximately 54.2. Since the problem states "about two thirds," maybe rounding to two significant figures, so 54. But perhaps the answer expects an exact expression? Let me check the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the survival probability is inversely proportional to the Lorentz factor. If one-third survive at γ=20, then to have two-thirds survive, which is twice the survival probability, the argument of the exponential must be half. Wait, but exponentials don't scale linearly. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the survival probability is exp(-k/γ), where k is a constant. So, if at γ=20, exp(-k/20) = 1/3. Then, we need to find γ such that exp(-k/γ) = 2/3. Let's take the ratio:

exp(-k/γ) / exp(-k/20) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2.

Thus, exp( -k/γ + k/20 ) = 2.

Take natural log: -k/γ + k/20 = ln(2).

But from the first equation, exp(-k/20) = 1/3 => -k/20 = ln(1/3) => k = 20 ln(3).

Substitute into the second equation:

- (20 ln(3))/γ + 20 ln(3)/20 = ln(2)

Simplify:

- (20 ln(3))/γ + ln(3) = ln(2)

Then,

- (20 ln(3))/γ = ln(2) - ln(3) = ln(2/3)

Multiply both sides by -1:

(20 ln(3))/γ = ln(3/2)

Then,

γ = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Which is the same as before. So, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Since the original Lorentz factor was given as ~20, the answer should be presented as approximately 54. However, maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of logarithms, but likely a numerical value. Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081

So, 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.70951155

Multiply by 20: 2.70951155 * 20 ≈ 54.190231

So, approximately 54.2. Since the original Lorentz factor was given as ~20, the answer is approximately 54. So, the Lorentz factor needed is about 54.

But let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the particles are moving at velocity v = βc. The time to reach the detector is t = r / (βc). The lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. The survival probability is exp(-t / (γ τ)) = exp(-r / (β c γ τ)).

But in the ultra-relativistic limit, β ≈ 1. So, the survival probability is approximately exp(-r / (c γ τ)). However, if we don't assume β=1, then we have to consider β. But the problem states "ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20", so β is very close to 1, so β ≈ 1. Therefore, the approximation t ≈ r/c is valid. So, the previous calculation holds.

Alternatively, if we don't make the β ≈ 1 assumption, then t = r/(β c), and the survival probability is exp(- t / (γ τ)) = exp(- r / (β c γ τ)). But since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). For γ=20, β ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/400) ≈ sqrt(399/400) ≈ 0.999875. So, β is very close to 1, so even if we include β, the difference would be negligible. For example, at γ=20, β ≈ 0.999875, so r/(β c) ≈ 30 / (0.999875 * 3e8) ≈ 1.000125e-7 seconds. The original approximation was 1e-7 seconds. The difference is 0.0125%, which is negligible. Therefore, the approximation β=1 is valid here.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 54.2. Since the problem says "about two thirds," and the original Lorentz factor is ~20, the answer is approximately 54. So, the required Lorentz factor is around 54.

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.
