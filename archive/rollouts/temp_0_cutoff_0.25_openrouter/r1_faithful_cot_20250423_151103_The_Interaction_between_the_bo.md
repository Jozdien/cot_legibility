The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:  
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( v + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]  
where \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs \( \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \), the condition \( m_X \geq 2m_f \) must hold. Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are allowed.  

**Standard Model fermions satisfying \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \):**  
- **Charged leptons:**  
  - Electron (\( e^\pm \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu^\pm \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau^\pm \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.776 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  

- **Quarks (current masses):**  
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  

**Kinematically allowed decays:**  
\[
X \to e^+ e^-, \quad X \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \quad X \to \tau^+ \tau^-, \quad X \to u \bar{u}, \quad X \to d \bar{d}, \quad X \to s \bar{s}, \quad X \to c \bar{c}.
\]  

**Note:**  
- Decays to quarks (\( u, d, s, c \)) would manifest as hadronic jets in detectors due to confinement.  
- Neutrino decays (\( X \to \nu \bar{\nu} \)) are kinematically allowed if neutrinos have non-zero mass, but their negligible coupling (if any) makes them experimentally unobservable.  

**Final Answer:**  
The kinematically allowed decays of the \( X \) boson at the lowest order are:  
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}}.

Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Hmm, let me start by understanding the interaction term here.

First, the Lagrangian term describes an interaction between the boson X and the fermions ψ_f. The term has a coupling constant λf, and there's a vacuum expectation value (VEV) v involved. The interaction is of the form X ψ̄_f ψ_f, which suggests that the boson X couples to the fermion bilinear ψ̄_f ψ_f. So, this looks like a Yukawa interaction, similar to how the Higgs boson couples to fermions. In the Standard Model, the Higgs has a similar term, where the Higgs field (after symmetry breaking) gives mass to the fermions through the Yukawa coupling. So, in this case, the fermion mass would be m_f = λf v, right? Because when X is zero (the vacuum), the term becomes -λf v ψ̄_f ψ_f, which is a mass term for the fermion with mass m_f = λf v.

Now, the question is about the decays of the X boson. At the lowest order (tree level), the possible decay channels would be those that are allowed by the interaction terms in the Lagrangian. Since the interaction is X ψ̄_f ψ_f, the boson X can decay into a pair of fermion and anti-fermion, X → f + f̄. But this decay is only possible if the mass of the boson X is greater than twice the mass of the fermion, because of energy conservation. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So, the fermion mass must be less than 3 GeV for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

Wait, but the fermion mass here is m_f = λf v. However, we don't know the values of λf or v. But maybe the problem assumes that the fermions in question are Standard Model fermions? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's a general question, perhaps we need to consider known fermions with masses less than 3 GeV. Let me think. In the Standard Model, the heaviest fermion is the top quark, but it's about 173 GeV, which is way too heavy. Then the next is the bottom quark at around 4.5 GeV, and the charm quark at about 1.5 GeV. The tau lepton is about 1.7 GeV. Wait, but the X boson is 6 GeV. So, if the fermion in question is, say, the charm quark (mass ~1.5 GeV), then 2*m_f = 3 GeV < 6 GeV, so X could decay into charm and anti-charm. Similarly, for the tau lepton, 2*m_tau ≈ 3.4 GeV, which is still less than 6 GeV. Wait, 1.7 GeV * 2 is 3.4 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So, X could decay into tau+ tau-? Similarly, for bottom quarks, 4.5 GeV * 2 = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so that decay is not allowed. Similarly, the strange quark is lighter, but maybe the problem is considering all possible fermions. But perhaps the fermion f in the Lagrangian is a specific fermion? The problem says "fermions" in plural, but the Lagrangian is written with f as a subscript, which might indicate that it's a sum over different fermion species, each with their own coupling λf. So, the interaction term could be a sum over all fermions f, each coupling to X with strength λf. Therefore, the possible decays would be into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f < m_X = 6 GeV.

But the problem is asking for kinematically allowed decays. So, we need to list all fermions (assuming Standard Model fermions) with mass less than 3 GeV. Let's list them:

- Leptons:
  - Electron: 0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
  - Muon: 0.105 GeV
  - Tau: 1.776 GeV (so 2*1.776 ≈ 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 3.55 < 6, so yes. Wait, 1.776*2=3.552 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

- Quarks (masses as constituent masses or current masses? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. For decay products, we need to consider the actual mass of the quark, but quarks are confined, so maybe the decay would be into hadrons. But in the context of a theoretical problem, perhaps we consider the quark masses as given in the Lagrangian. If the fermions here are quarks, then their masses would be the current masses. For example, up quark is ~2 MeV, down ~5 MeV, strange ~100 MeV, charm ~1.5 GeV, bottom ~4.5 GeV, top ~173 GeV. But if the X couples to all fermions, then the possible quark pairs would be up, down, strange, charm. Because 2*m_charm = 3 GeV < 6 GeV. But bottom is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV, so not allowed. Similarly, top is way too heavy. So, for quarks, possible decays are into pairs of up, down, strange, charm. But wait, in reality, quarks are confined, so the decay products would be hadrons, but maybe in this theoretical context, we can consider the decay into quark-antiquark pairs as allowed if kinematically possible. Similarly, for leptons, electrons, muons, taus. But tau is 1.776 GeV, so 2*1.776=3.55 GeV <6 GeV, so allowed. So, the kinematically allowed decays would be X → e+ e-, X → μ+ μ-, X → τ+ τ-, and X → q q̄ where q is u, d, s, c. But wait, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". So, assuming that the X couples to all these fermions, then all these channels are allowed. But maybe the problem is considering only the fermions that are in the Lagrangian. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If f is a single fermion, then the decay is only to that specific fermion-antifermion pair. But the subscript f on λf and ψ_f might indicate that there are multiple fermion species, each with their own coupling. The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions", so it's possible that X couples to multiple fermion species. Therefore, the possible decays are into each fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f < m_X =6 GeV.

But we need to know the masses of the fermions. If we take the Standard Model fermions, then:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.

- Muon: 0.105 GeV → allowed.

- Tau: 1.776 GeV → allowed (since 3.55 <6).

- Quarks:

  - Up: ~0.002 GeV → allowed.

  - Down: ~0.005 GeV → allowed.

  - Strange: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.

  - Charm: ~1.5 GeV → allowed (3 GeV <6 GeV).

  - Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

  - Top: way too heavy.

So, the kinematically allowed decays would be X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and the quark pairs uū, dđ, sš, cč. However, since quarks cannot exist as free particles, the actual decay products would be hadrons. But in the context of a theoretical question, they might just ask for the quark-antiquark pairs. However, the problem doesn't specify whether the fermions are quarks or leptons. Wait, the Lagrangian is written generally, so ψ_f could be any fermion. If the problem is in the context of the Standard Model, then the answer would include both leptons and quarks. But if X is a new boson beyond the Standard Model, maybe it only couples to certain fermions. However, the problem doesn't specify, so we have to assume that the fermions f are all possible fermions that satisfy the kinematic condition.

But wait, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". The lowest order would be tree-level diagrams, which for this interaction would be X decaying to a fermion and anti-fermion. So, all fermions with mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed. Therefore, the answer should list all such fermion pairs. However, in the Standard Model, the charm quark has a mass around 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 GeV, so allowed. The tau lepton is 1.776 GeV, so 2*1.776=3.55 GeV <6 GeV, allowed. The other quarks (up, down, strange) are much lighter, so definitely allowed. The muon and electron as well.

But wait, the problem might be considering only the fermions that acquire their mass through the Higgs mechanism, i.e., where the mass comes from the VEV v. In the given Lagrangian, the fermion mass is m_f = λf v. So, if we assume that all the fermions in the theory get their mass from this interaction, then their masses are all less than v, but since X is part of the same field that gives the VEV, similar to the Higgs. However, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV, which is separate from the Higgs mass. Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs mass is not directly related to the fermion masses, except through the couplings. Here, the X boson's mass is 6 GeV, but we don't know its relation to v. However, the problem doesn't give any information about v or the couplings λf, so we can't calculate the fermion masses. Therefore, perhaps the question is assuming that the fermions in question have masses such that 2m_f < m_X =6 GeV. But without knowing the specific fermion masses, how can we answer? Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the fermions are the Standard Model fermions, and we need to check which of them have masses less than 3 GeV. As I listed before, all charged leptons (e, μ, τ) have masses below 3 GeV (since τ is ~1.78 GeV), and quarks up, down, strange, charm. But the charm quark's mass is around 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is exactly the threshold. But the X mass is 6 GeV, which is larger than 3 GeV, so charm quark pairs are allowed. Similarly, tau pairs at 3.55 GeV <6 GeV. So, all these are allowed.

However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs boson can decay to fermion-antifermion pairs, but only if the Higgs mass is above the threshold. For example, the Higgs is 125 GeV, so it can decay to top quarks (but top is too heavy), so it decays to bottom quarks, charm, tau, etc. Similarly, here, the X boson is 6 GeV, so lighter than the Higgs. But in this case, the X is a different boson. So, the answer would be that the kinematically allowed decays are into all fermion-antifermion pairs where twice the fermion mass is less than 6 GeV. Assuming the fermions are Standard Model fermions, then the allowed decays are:

- Charged leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-

- Quarks: uū, dđ, sš, cč

But since quarks are confined, the actual decays would be into hadrons. However, the problem might be asking for the fundamental fermions, not the composite hadrons. So, in terms of elementary particles, the decays are into each fermion type that satisfies 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But wait, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays". So, even if the coupling λf is zero for some fermions, but the problem states the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which includes all fermions ψ_f with coupling λf. But unless told otherwise, we have to assume that the couplings λf are non-zero for all fermions, or at least for those that are kinematically allowed. However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the couplings, so we can only go by kinematics.

Therefore, the answer is that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. For Standard Model fermions, that includes electrons, muons, taus, and up, down, strange, and charm quarks. So, the allowed decays are:

X → e⁺ e⁻

X → μ⁺ μ⁻

X → τ⁺ τ⁻

X → u ū

X → d đ

X → s š

X → c č

But since the problem might expect the answer in terms of detectable particles, and quarks aren't observed directly, but the question doesn't specify that. It just asks for kinematically allowed decays at lowest order, which would be the fundamental fermions. So, the answer should list all these fermion pairs.

Alternatively, if the boson X only couples to a specific fermion, but the Lagrangian is written generally. However, the subscript f on ψ_f might indicate a sum over all fermion species, so each with their own λf. Therefore, all the above decays are possible, provided the couplings are non-zero. Since the problem doesn't mention any couplings being zero, we have to include all kinematically allowed channels.

Another thing to consider is whether the decay into neutrinos is possible. But neutrinos are neutral and in the Standard Model, they don't have Dirac masses unless there's a neutrino Yukawa coupling. If the Lagrangian includes neutrinos, then X could decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. But neutrinos have very small masses, so definitely allowed. However, the problem's Lagrangian uses ψ_f, which could include neutrinos if they are part of the theory. But in the Standard Model, neutrinos are either massless or have tiny masses. If they have masses, even small ones, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But since the mass is negligible, the phase space is effectively maximal. However, the problem doesn't specify whether neutrinos are included. If the Lagrangian includes all fermions, then yes. But if it's only charged fermions, then no. The problem says "fermions", which generally includes neutrinos. But in many theories, neutrinos might not couple to the Higgs-like field unless they have a Yukawa interaction. Since the given Lagrangian is similar to the Higgs-fermion interaction, if neutrinos have Dirac masses via this coupling, then X could decay into neutrinos. But if neutrinos are Majorana, the interaction might be different. However, without more information, it's hard to say. The problem might not expect neutrinos to be considered here, especially since in the minimal Standard Model without right-handed neutrinos, neutrinos are massless and don't couple. But given that the problem mentions "fermions" generally, and if we consider that neutrinos have mass (as in the real world), then X → ν ν̄ would also be allowed. But since neutrino masses are extremely small (sub-eV), the decay would be kinematically allowed, but the coupling might be negligible. However, the problem is about kinematic allowance, not the coupling strength. So, technically, if the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV, the decay is allowed. Since neutrino masses are way below that threshold, X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But again, the problem might not expect this answer unless specified.

In summary, considering Standard Model fermions with masses less than 3 GeV, the kinematically allowed decays of the X boson at tree level are into charged lepton pairs (e, μ, τ) and quark pairs (u, d, s, c). If neutrinos are included and have mass, then also neutrino pairs, but that's uncertain. Given the problem's context, probably the expected answer is the charged leptons and the quarks up, down, strange, and charm. However, since the problem doesn't specify the fermion content, but just says "fermions", it's safer to include all possible fermions that meet the kinematic condition. Therefore, the allowed decays are:

X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, u ū, d đ, s š, c č

But to confirm, let's check the quark masses again. Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 GeV, allowed. Bottom is 4.5 GeV, 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV, not allowed. Top is too heavy. Up, down, strange are light quarks with masses <<3 GeV. Tau is 1.776 GeV, so 3.55 GeV <6 GeV, allowed. So yes, all these decays are allowed.

Therefore, the final answer should list all these decay channels.

Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Hmm, let me start by understanding the interaction term here.

I need to determine the kinematically permitted decay pathways for the boson X at lowest order. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), with the boson X having a mass of 6 GeV. Let me analyze the interaction term in this equation.

The Lagrangian describes an interaction between boson X and fermions ψ_f, characterized by a coupling constant λf and involving a vacuum expectation value (VEV) v. The interaction form X ψ̄_f ψ_f indicates that boson X couples to the fermion bilinear ψ̄_f ψ_f. This resembles a Yukawa interaction, similar to how the Higgs boson interacts with fermions in the Standard Model. In this scenario, when X equals zero (in vacuum), the term becomes -λf v ψ̄_f ψ_f, which represents a mass term for the fermion where mass m_f = λf v.

Regarding the X boson's decays, at tree level (lowest order), the possible channels would be those permitted by the Lagrangian's interaction terms. Given the X ψ̄_f ψ_f interaction, boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair: X → f + f̄. However, this decay is only physically possible if the X boson's mass exceeds twice the fermion mass, due to energy conservation principles. Since X has a mass of 6 GeV, the fermion mass must be below 3 GeV for the decay to be kinematically viable.

The fermion mass is given by m_f = λf v, but we don't know λf or v values. Perhaps we should consider Standard Model fermions with masses under 3 GeV. In the Standard Model, the top quark (173 GeV) is far too heavy, and the bottom quark (4.5 GeV) also exceeds our limit. However, the charm quark (~1.5 GeV) and tau lepton (~1.7 GeV) both have masses such that 2m_f < 6 GeV, making X → charm + anti-charm and X → tau+ + tau- kinematically allowed decays.

For the tau lepton, 2*1.776 = 3.552 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so this decay is permitted. For bottom quarks, 2*4.5 = 9 GeV, which exceeds 6 GeV, making this decay forbidden.

The notation in the Lagrangian suggests it might sum over different fermion species, each with its own coupling λf. Therefore, X could potentially decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f < 6 GeV.

Considering Standard Model fermions with masses below 3 GeV:

- Leptons:
  - Electron: 0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
  - Muon: 0.105 GeV
  - Tau: 1.776 GeV (2*1.776 = 3.552 GeV < 6 GeV, so tau pairs are allowed)

- Quarks (though there's some ambiguity regarding constituent vs. current masses)...

Alright, I need to determine the possible kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), and the mass of boson X is 6 GeV. Let's begin by analyzing the interaction term.

This Lagrangian term represents the interaction between the boson X and the fermions ψ_f, characterized by a coupling constant λf and a vacuum expectation value (VEV) v. The interaction is of the form X ψ̄_f ψ_f, indicating that the boson X couples to the fermion bilinear ψ̄_f ψ_f, much like a Yukawa interaction, which is similar to the coupling between the Higgs boson and fermions in the Standard Model. In this context, the mass of the fermion would be m_f = λf v, right? Because if X is zero (the vacuum state), the term becomes -λf v ψ̄_f ψ_f, which acts as a mass term for the fermion with mass m_f = λf v.

Now, regarding the decays of the X boson, the possible decay channels at the lowest order (tree level) would be those allowed by the Lagrangian's interaction terms. Since the interaction is X ψ̄_f ψ_f, boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, X → f + f̄. However, this decay only occurs if the boson's mass exceeds twice the fermion's mass, due to energy conservation. With boson X's mass at 6 GeV, the fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV for the decay to be kinematically possible.

Hold on, the problem involves the fermion mass m_f = λf v, yet the values of λf and v are unspecified. Perhaps the exercise assumes these are Standard Model fermions? Although not explicitly mentioned, if we consider known fermions with masses below 3 GeV, the analysis progresses. Within the Standard Model, the heaviest fermion is the top quark at approximately 173 GeV, which is far too massive. The subsequent is the bottom quark near 4.5 GeV and the charm quark close to 1.5 GeV. The tau lepton is roughly 1.7 GeV. Thus, if the fermion of focus is the charm quark (mass ~1.5 GeV), then 2*m_f = 3 GeV < 6 GeV, allowing decay into charm and anti-charm. Similarly, for the tau lepton, 2*m_tau ≈ 3.4 GeV, which remains under 6 GeV. Therefore, X could decay into tau+ tau-. Conversely, for bottom quarks, 4.5 GeV * 2 = 9 GeV, exceeding 6 GeV, so such decay isn't viable. The strange quark is lighter, and perhaps considering all possible fermions is intended. The Lagrangian features a subscript f, indicating perhaps a summation over different fermion species, each with individual coupling λf. Consequently, the decay occurrences would include any fermion-antifermion pair with 2m_f < m_X = 6 GeV.

As the task is to identify kinematically allowed decays, we should enumerate all fermions (assuming Standard Model fermions) whose mass is under 3 GeV. Here's the list:

- Leptons:
  - Electron: 0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
  - Muon: 0.105 GeV
  - Tau: 1.776 GeV (thus 2*1.776 ≈ 3.55 GeV is less than 6 GeV. Hold on, 1.776*2 = 3.552 GeV, which fits under 6 GeV. Therefore, tau pairs are permissible).

- Quarks (mass consideration is whether constituent or current is pertinent, a bit ambiguous for decay purposes).

However, quark masses are a bit tricky. The current quark masses are:\n\n- Up: ~2.2 MeV\n- Down: ~4.7 MeV\n- Strange: ~95 MeV\n- Charm: ~1.27 GeV\n- Bottom: ~4.18 GeV\n- Top: ~173 GeV\n\nBut if we use current quark masses, then charm quark is 1.27 GeV, so 2*1.27 = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV. So X could decay into charm-anticharm. The bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so 2*4.18 = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so that\'s not allowed. The tau lepton is 1.776 GeV, so 2*1.776 ≈ 3.55 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed. Then, the other quarks (up, down, strange) are much lighter, so their pairs are definitely allowed. However, in practice, when a boson decays into quarks, it\'s more complicated because quarks are confined, but in terms of perturbative decays, the process X → q q̄ is allowed if 2m_q < m_X. So, for up, down, strange, charm quarks, and tau leptons, the decays are allowed. But the problem is probably considering all possible fermions, so we need to check which of the Standard Model fermions have masses below 3 GeV. So, all fermions except top, bottom, and maybe the tau? Wait, tau is 1.776 GeV, so 2*tau is 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed. So, X can decay into:\n\n- e+ e-\n- μ+ μ-\n- τ+ τ-\n- u ū\n- d d̄\n- s s̄\n- c c̄\n\nBut not into top or bottom quarks, since 2m_t and 2m_b are larger than 6 GeV. However, the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". So, assuming that the couplings λf are non-zero for all these fermions, then all the above are allowed. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass, so heavier fermions have larger couplings. But in this problem, the Lagrangian is given as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, so the coupling of X to fermion f is λf. The mass of the fermion is m_f = λf v. Therefore, if we assume that the couplings λf are such that m_f = λf v, then the coupling is proportional to the mass. So, heavier fermions have larger couplings. But kinematically allowed decays only depend on the mass, not the coupling strength. So even if the coupling is small, as long as the decay is allowed by kinematics, it\'s possible. However, in reality, the decay width would depend on the coupling squared times the phase space. But the question is only about kinematically allowed decays, not their probabilities or branching ratios. So, even if the coupling is tiny, if 2m_f < m_X, then it\'s allowed. But perhaps in the context of the problem, we are to assume that the fermions in question are those for which the interaction exists. Since the Lagrangian is written for a general fermion ψ_f, with a subscript f, maybe f is a specific fermion? Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. The subscript f on ψ_f might indicate that it\'s a specific fermion, but the problem says "fermions" in plural. Maybe the interaction is for a multiplet of fermions? Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n"The Interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by\n\nL(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)"\n\nThe subscript f on ψ_f could be a flavor index, meaning that the interaction is for each fermion flavor f, with their own coupling λf. So, if that\'s the case, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair f f̄ where 2m_f < m_X. So, as per the masses, the allowed decays are into:\n\n- Electrons: e+ e-\n- Muons: μ+ μ-\n- Taus: τ+ τ-\n- Up quarks: u ū\n- Down quarks: d d̄\n- Strange quarks: s s̄\n- Charm quarks: c c̄\n\nBut not top, bottom quarks, because their masses are too large. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs can\'t decay into top quarks because the Higgs is 125 GeV and top quarks are 173 GeV, so 2m_t > m_Higgs. Similarly, here, the X boson is 6 GeV, so 2m_b = ~8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so no. But wait, the problem doesn\'t specify whether we should consider the fermions as quarks or leptons, and whether color is a factor. For quarks, the decay would be into quark-antiquark pairs, but since quarks are confined, the actual decay products would be hadrons. However, in terms of fundamental processes, the decay is into quark pairs. The problem is about kinematically allowed decays, so we can consider the fundamental fermions, regardless of confinement. So, the answer would include all fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. But let\'s check the actual masses:\n\nElectron: 0.000511 GeV\nMuon: 0.1057 GeV\nTau: 1.776 GeV\nUp quark: ~0.0022 GeV\nDown quark: ~0.0047 GeV\nStrange quark: ~0.095 GeV\nCharm quark: ~1.27 GeV\nBottom quark: ~4.18 GeV\nTop quark: ~173 GeV\n\nSo, for each fermion f, if 2m_f < 6 GeV, then X → f f̄ is allowed. So:\n\n- Electron: 2*0.000511 ≈ 0.001 < 6: allowed\n- Muon: 2*0.1057 ≈ 0.211 < 6: allowed\n- Tau: 2*1.776 ≈ 3.55 < 6: allowed\n- Up: 2*0.0022 ≈ 0.0044 < 6: allowed\n- Down: 2*0.0047 ≈ 0.0094 < 6: allowed\n- Strange: 2*0.095 ≈ 0.19 < 6: allowed\n- Charm: 2*1.27 ≈ 2.54 < 6: allowed\n- Bottom: 2*4.18 ≈ 8.36 > 6: not allowed\n- Top: way too heavy\n\nTherefore, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are into each of these fermion-antifermion pairs except top and bottom. However, the problem might be considering only charged leptons and quarks, but maybe also neutrinos? Wait, neutrinos are fermions, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn\'t couple to neutrinos unless they have a Dirac mass. But in this case, the Lagrangian is written for ψ_f, which could include neutrinos if they are Dirac. However, neutrino masses are very small, so even if they are included, 2m_ν would be negligible, so X could decay into neutrinos. But if neutrinos are Majorana, the coupling might be different. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so maybe we should assume that the fermions f include all possible fermions, including neutrinos. But neutrino masses are on the order of eV, so 2m_ν is negligible compared to 6 GeV. So, X could decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs as well. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn\'t couple to neutrinos because they are either massless or have Majorana masses, but in extensions of the SM with Dirac neutrinos, they would have Yukawa couplings. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, maybe we should include all possible fermions, including neutrinos. But the problem statement might be expecting us to consider only charged fermions. Let me check the original Lagrangian: it\'s written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If this is similar to the Higgs mechanism, then in the SM, the Higgs couples to charged leptons and quarks (giving them mass), but not to neutrinos unless they have a Dirac mass term. So, if we follow the SM analogy, neutrinos might not be included. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we should mention both possibilities. However, given that the problem mentions "fermions" generally, and doesn\'t specify that neutrinos are excluded, maybe we should include them. But since neutrino masses are so small, the decay into neutrinos would be kinematically allowed, but the coupling might be negligible. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the actual likelihood. So, even if the coupling is tiny, if 2m_f < m_X, it\'s allowed. So, neutrinos would be allowed. But in practice, such decays would be highly suppressed due to the small coupling (if neutrinos have Dirac masses, their Yukawa couplings would be tiny). But again, the question is about kinematics, not dynamics. So, strictly speaking, X → ν ν̄ is allowed if neutrinos are in the theory. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, maybe we should stick to charged fermions. Alternatively, the problem might be in a model where X only couples to certain fermions. But the Lagrangian is written generally. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the mass of X is 6 GeV, and the possible Standard Model fermions it can decay into are those with mass less than 3 GeV. So, the answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are into charged leptons (e, μ, τ), and quarks (u, d, s, c), each pair. So, X can decay into:\n\n- Electrons: e+ e-\n- Muons: μ+ μ-\n- Taus: τ+ τ-\n- Up quarks: u ū\n- Down quarks: d d̄\n- Strange quarks: s s̄\n- Charm quarks: c c̄\n\nBut not bottom or top quarks. However, when writing the answer, we need to present them properly. Also, for quarks, since they are confined, the actual decay products would be mesons or hadrons, but the question is about the fundamental decays. So, the answer should list the fermion pairs. Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the known particles, using their standard names. For example, for quarks, the pairs would result in hadrons, but maybe the question wants the fundamental process. So, the answer is all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are into electron, muon, tau, up, down, strange, and charm quark pairs. So, the boson X can decay into any of these fermion pairs at the lowest order, provided the coupling λf is non-zero. Since the problem doesn\'t mention any restrictions on the couplings, we assume all these decays are allowed. Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are X → e+ e-, X → μ+ μ-, X → τ+ τ-, X → u ū, X → d d̄, X → s s̄, and X → c c̄.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the interaction term is -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. The term with v is the mass term, and the term with X is the interaction. So, the coupling of X to the fermions is proportional to λf, which is the same as the coupling that gives the fermion mass m_f = λf v. Therefore, if a fermion has a non-zero mass, then λf is non-zero, and hence X can decay into that fermion-antifermion pair. So, if the fermion is massless, then λf = 0, and X cannot decay into that fermion. But in the Standard Model, only the Higgs couples to fermions with mass, so if X is a similar boson, then only massive fermions would have couplings. But in the problem statement, since the Lagrangian is given as coupling to ψ_f with a term (v + X), it\'s implying that all the fermions ψ_f have masses m_f = λf v, so they are all massive. Therefore, if we consider that in this model, all the fermions that X couples to are massive, then their masses are given by m_f = λf v. But the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV. However, the mass of X is not directly related to the fermion masses here. The X boson\'s mass would come from its own potential, which is not specified here. The given Lagrangian only describes the interaction between X and the fermions. So, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV, independent of the fermion masses. Therefore, the decay is allowed if 2m_f < 6 GeV. But since m_f = λf v, and we don\'t know v or λf, but if we assume that for each fermion f, m_f is such that 2m_f < 6 GeV, then the decay is allowed. However, without knowing the specific values of m_f, we can\'t say for sure. Wait, but the problem is asking for kinematically allowed decays, which only depend on the mass of X and the mass of the decay products. Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, the decay into a fermion pair is allowed if the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV. But since they are produced in pairs, and assuming they are produced on-shell, the condition is 2m_f ≤ m_X. Therefore, m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So, regardless of the actual m_f, the decay is allowed if m_f ≤ 3 GeV. However, the problem doesn\'t specify the masses of the fermions. But in the absence of specific information, we have to assume that the fermions in question are Standard Model fermions, as that\'s the usual context unless specified otherwise. Therefore, using Standard Model fermion masses, the kinematically allowed decays are into the fermions listed above. So, the answer should list all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are:\n\n- X → e+ e-\n- X → μ+ μ-\n- X → τ+ τ-\n- X → u ū\n- X → d d̄\n- X → s s̄\n- X → c c̄\n\nBut not the heavier fermions. So, that\'s the conclusion. I think that\'s it. The boson X can decay into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs at tree level if their combined mass is less than the mass of X. Since the X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are as listed.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446503, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3921, prompt_tokens=1118, total_tokens=5039, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:  
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( v + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]  
where \( X \) couples to fermion pairs \( f\bar{f} \). The decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is allowed if the fermion mass satisfies \( 2m_f < m_X \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are kinematically permitted.  

**Standard Model fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \):**  
- **Charged leptons:**  
  - Electron (\( e^\pm \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu^\pm \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau^\pm \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.776 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- **Quarks (current masses):**  
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)  

**Kinematically allowed decays:**  
\[
X \to e^+ e^-, \quad X \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \quad X \to \tau^+ \tau^-, \quad X \to u\bar{u}, \quad X \to d\bar{d}, \quad X \to s\bar{s}, \quad X \to c\bar{c}.
\]  

**Excluded decays:**  
- \( X \to b\bar{b} \) (\( 2m_b \approx 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  
- \( X \to t\bar{t} \) (\( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  

Thus, the boson \( X \) can decay into all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

products, quarks would hadronize, but in terms of perturbative decays, we consider the quark masses. However, quark masses are a bit tricky. The current quark masses are:

- c c̄

But not into top or bottom quarks, since 2m_t and 2m_b are larger than 6 GeV. However, the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". So, assuming that the couplings λf are non-zero for all these fermions, then all the above are allowed. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass, so heavier fermions have larger couplings.

Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the user wrote:

The subscript f on ψ_f could be a flavor index, meaning that the interaction is for each fermion flavor f, with their own coupling λf. So, if that's the case, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair f f̄ where 2m_f < m_X. So, as per the masses, the allowed decays are into:

Down quark: ~0.0047 GeV
Strange quark: ~0.095 GeV
Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV

So, for each fermion f, if 2m_f < 6 GeV, then X → f f̄ is allowed. So:

- Electron: 2*0.000511 ≈ 0.001 < 6: allowed
- Muon: 2*0.1057 ≈ 0.211 < 6: allowed

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are into each of these fermion-antifermion pairs except top and bottom.

So, the answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are into charged leptons (e, μ, τ), and quarks (u, d, s, c), each pair. So, X can decay into:

- Electrons: e+ e-
- Muons: μ+ μ-
- Taus: τ+ τ-
- Up quarks: u ū

Also, for quarks, since they are confined, the actual decay products would be mesons or hadrons, but the question is about the fundamental decays. So, the answer should list the fermion pairs.

So, the answer is all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are into electron, muon, tau, up, down, strange, and charm quark pairs. So, the boson X can decay into any of these fermion pairs at the lowest order, provided the coupling λf is non-zero.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are X → e+ e-, X → μ+ μ-, X → τ+ τ-, X → u ū, X → d d̄, X → s s̄, and X → c c̄.

But wait, another thought: the interaction term is -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. The term with v is the mass term, and the term with X is the interaction. So, the coupling of X to the fermions is proportional to λf, which is the same as the coupling that gives the fermion mass m_f = λf v. Therefore, if a fermion has a non-zero mass, then λf is non-zero, and hence X can decay into that fermion-antifermion pair. So, if the fermion is massless, then λf = 0, and X cannot decay into that fermion. But in the Standard Model, only the Higgs couples to fermions with mass, so if X is a similar boson, then only massive fermions would have couplings. But in the problem statement, since the Lagrangian is given as coupling to ψ_f with a term (v + X), it's implying that all the fermions ψ_f have masses m_f = λf v, so they are all massive. Therefore, if we consider that in this model, all the fermions that X couples to are massive, then their masses are given by m_f = λf v. But the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV. However, the mass of X is not directly related to the fermion masses here. The X boson's mass would come from its own potential, which is not specified here. The given Lagrangian only describes the interaction between X and the fermions. So, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV, independent of the fermion masses. Therefore, the decay is allowed if 2m_f < 6 GeV. But since m_f = λf v, and we don't know v or λf, but if we assume that for each fermion f, m_f is such that 2m_f < 6 GeV, then the decay is allowed. However, without knowing the specific values of m_f, we can't say for sure. Wait, but the problem is asking for kinematically allowed decays, which only depend on the mass of X and the mass of the decay products. Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, the decay into a fermion pair is allowed if the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV. But since they are produced in pairs, and assuming they are produced on-shell, the condition is 2m_f ≤ m_X. Therefore, m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So, regardless of the actual m_f, the decay is allowed if m_f ≤ 3 GeV. However, the problem doesn't specify the masses of the fermions. But in the absence of specific information, we have to assume that the fermions in question are Standard Model fermions, as that's the usual context unless specified otherwise. Therefore, using Standard Model fermion masses, the kinematically allowed decays are into the fermions listed above. So, the answer should list all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are:

- X → e+ e-
- X → μ+ μ-
- X → τ+ τ-
- X → u ū
- X → d d̄
- X → s s̄
- X → c c̄

But not the heavier fermions. So, that's the conclusion. I think that's it. The boson X can decay into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs at tree level if their combined mass is less than the mass of X. Since the X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are as listed.

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:  
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( v + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]  
where \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs \( f\bar{f} \). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the fermion mass must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

**Standard Model fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \):**  
- **Charged leptons:**  
  - Electron (\( e^+e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu^+\mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau^+\tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.776 \, \text{GeV} \)  

- **Quarks:**  
  - Up (\( u\bar{u} \)): \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d\bar{d} \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s\bar{s} \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c\bar{c} \)): \( m_c \approx 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)  

**Kinematically forbidden decays:**  
- Bottom (\( b\bar{b} \)): \( 2m_b \approx 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Top (\( t\bar{t} \)): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  

**Conclusion:**  
At the lowest order, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:  
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+e^-, \, \mu^+\mu^-, \, \tau^+\tau^-, \, u\bar{u}, \, d\bar{d}, \, s\bar{s}, \, c\bar{c}}.

For quark masses, the current masses are:

However, if the coupling is to neutrinos, then m_f would be very small, so X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But since neutrinos are nearly massless, their production is always allowed kinematically. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn\'t couple to neutrinos directly unless they have a right-handed component. But the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we can ignore neutrinos unless told otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, if the fermion in question is a specific one, but the problem states "fermions" in general. The Lagrangian is written with ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So, if the coupling exists for all fermions, then all fermions with 2m_f < m_X are allowed. But if the coupling is only to a specific fermion, then only that one. However, the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we need to assume that all possible fermions are included, each with their own λf. Therefore, the answer would be all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion\'s mass is less than 3 GeV.\n\nBut in the Standard Model, the known fermions with masses below 3 GeV are:\n\n- Charged leptons: e, μ, τ (tau is 1.776 GeV)\n- Quarks: u, d, s, c (charm is 1.27 GeV)\n\nBut the problem is that quarks are confined, so the actual decay products would be hadrons. However, in terms of fundamental decays, the X boson would decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which then form jets. But the question is about kinematically allowed decays, so even if they form jets, as long as the quark masses are below 3 GeV, the decay is allowed. So, the answer would include all these fermion pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering only the possible tree-level decays. Since the interaction term is X ψ̄_f ψ_f, the decay X → f f̄ is possible for each fermion f that couples to X. The kinematic condition is m_X ≥ 2m_f. So, for each fermion f with m_f ≤ 3 GeV, the decay is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:\n\n- X → e+ e-\n- X → μ+ μ-\n- X → τ+ τ-\n- X → c c̄\n- X → s s̄\n- X → u ū\n- X → d d̄\n\nBut wait, the up and down quarks have very small masses (MeV scale), so their production is definitely allowed. However, in practice, the decay width would be proportional to (m_f)^2, so lighter fermions would have much smaller decay rates. But the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not their probabilities or branching ratios. So even if the coupling is small, as long as the decay is allowed by kinematics, it\'s possible. But the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order," so even if the coupling is tiny, if the interaction exists, the decay is allowed. However, the problem\'s Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, which suggests that each fermion f has its own coupling λf. If λf is non-zero for all these fermions, then all these decays are possible. But if λf is zero for some fermions, then those decays are not possible. However, the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we need to assume that X couples to all fermions, similar to the Higgs boson. In the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all massive fermions. So, if X is a similar boson, then it would couple to all fermions with mass m_f = λf v. Therefore, the allowed decays would be to all fermions where 2m_f < m_X. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs can\'t decay to top quarks because the top is heavier than half the Higgs mass (which is 125 GeV, so half is ~62.5 GeV, and the top is 173 GeV). But in this case, X is 6 GeV, so the allowed fermions are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.\n\nBut in the Standard Model, the Higgs couplings are proportional to the fermion mass. However, in this problem, the coupling is given by λf, which is related to the fermion mass via m_f = λf v. So, if v is the same for all fermions, then λf = m_f / v. Therefore, the decay amplitude would be proportional to m_f, but the kinematic condition is 2m_f < m_X. So, even though the coupling is proportional to the mass, the kinematic condition is separate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are into all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. For the Standard Model fermions, this includes:\n\n- Electrons (e+ e-)\n- Muons (μ+ μ-)\n- Taus (τ+ τ-)\n- Charm quarks (c c̄)\n- Strange quarks (s s̄)\n- Up quarks (u ū)\n- Down quarks (d d̄)\n\nBut since quarks cannot exist freely, the actual observable decays would involve hadrons. However, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, which are the fundamental processes. Therefore, the answer should list all these fermion pairs. However, sometimes in such problems, only the charged leptons and the heaviest possible quarks are considered, but given the mass of X is 6 GeV, charm quarks (1.27 GeV) are allowed, but bottom (4.18 GeV) are not. So, the allowed quark decays are up, down, strange, and charm.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects only the charged leptons and the charm quark, since the others (u, d, s) have much smaller masses and their decays would be highly suppressed, but kinematically allowed. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not suppression. So, all of them are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the interaction is only with a specific fermion, but the Lagrangian is written generally as ψ_f, which could be any fermion. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, we have to assume all possible fermions. Therefore, the answer is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion\'s mass is less than 3 GeV. For the Standard Model, that includes e, μ, τ, c, s, u, d. But since the problem might be in a context where only charged leptons and quarks are considered, and perhaps neutrinos are excluded (if they are massless or nearly so), but if neutrinos have mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But given that the mass of neutrinos is extremely small (sub-eV), the decay is kinematically allowed, but again, the coupling would be proportional to the neutrino mass, making the decay rate negligible. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the decay rate. So, if neutrinos have non-zero mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But in the Standard Model with massless neutrinos, this decay is not possible. But in reality, neutrinos have mass, so perhaps it\'s allowed. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, maybe we should exclude neutrinos.\n\nIn summary, the kinematically allowed decays of X at tree level are into all charged lepton pairs (e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-) and all quark-antiquark pairs (u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄), assuming the fermions have masses below 3 GeV.

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:  
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( v + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]  
which couples \( X \) to fermion-antifermion pairs \( f\bar{f} \). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the fermion mass must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).  

**Standard Model fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \):**  
- **Charged leptons:**  
  - Electron (\( e^\pm \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu^\pm \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau^\pm \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.776 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- **Quarks (current masses):**  
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)  

**Kinematically allowed decays:**  
At tree level, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:  
\[
X \to e^+ e^-, \quad \mu^+ \mu^-, \quad \tau^+ \tau^-, \quad u\bar{u}, \quad d\bar{d}, \quad s\bar{s}, \quad c\bar{c}.
\]  
**Note:**  
- Quark-antiquark pairs (\( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \)) manifest as hadronic jets in detectors due to confinement.  
- The decay \( X \to b\bar{b} \) is forbidden because \( 2m_b \approx 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- Neutrino pairs (\( \nu\bar{\nu} \)) are excluded if neutrinos are massless in the Standard Model, but allowed with negligible rates if neutrinos have tiny masses.  

**Final Answer:**  
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are:  
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, c\bar{c}, \, s\bar{s}, \, u\bar{u}, \, d\bar{d}}.
\]

For quark-antiquark pairs, the masses are current quark masses. The relevant quarks with masses below 3 GeV are:

  - Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
  - Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
  - Strange quark: ~95 MeV
  - Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV (so 2*1.27 = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV)
  - Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV (2*4.18 = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so excluded)
  - Top quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

Therefore, the kinematically allowed fermion pairs are:

- Electron-positron (e+ e-)
- Muon-antimuon (μ+ μ-)
- Tau-antitau (τ+ τ-)
- Up quark-antiquark (u ū)
- Down quark-antiquark (d d̄)
- Strange quark-antiquark (s s̄)
- Charm quark-antiquark (c c̄)

But wait, quarks are confined, so the actual decay products would be hadrons. However, at the fundamental level, the decay would be into quark-antiquark pairs, which then hadronize. The problem might be considering only the fundamental particles, not the composite ones. So, if the question is about the allowed decays at the particle level, then X can decay into any of these fermion pairs. However, if considering observable particles, like mesons or leptons, then only the leptons (e, μ, τ) and possibly the charm quark pairs (which form D mesons) would be observable. But the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order," so likely referring to the fundamental decay channels, i.e., into the fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But wait, the tau mass is about 1.776 GeV, so 2m_tau ≈ 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so X → τ+ τ- is allowed. Similarly, charm quark pairs: 2*1.27 ≈ 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV. So, X can decay into c c̄. The bottom quark is too heavy. So, all fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV. But in the Standard Model, the only fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV are the ones listed above. So, the allowed decays are into each of these fermion-antifermion pairs.

But perhaps the problem is considering only the charged leptons and quarks. However, neutrinos are also fermions, but they are neutral. The interaction term is ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If the fermion is a neutrino, then the mass term would be Dirac, but neutrinos in the Standard Model are massless (though in reality they have tiny masses). However, if the coupling is to neutrinos, then m_f would be very small, so X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But since neutrinos are nearly massless, their production is always allowed kinematically. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn't couple to neutrinos directly unless they have a right-handed component. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can ignore neutrinos unless told otherwise.

Alternatively, if the fermion in question is a specific one, but the problem states "fermions" in general. The Lagrangian is written with ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So, if the coupling exists for all fermions, then all fermions with 2m_f < m_X are allowed. But if the coupling is only to a specific fermion, then only that one. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to assume that all possible fermions are included, each with their own λf. Therefore, the answer would be all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

But in the Standard Model, the known fermions with masses below 3 GeV are:

- Charged leptons: e, μ, τ (tau is 1.776 GeV)
- Quarks: u, d, s, c (charm is 1.27 GeV)

But the problem is that quarks are confined, so the actual decay products would be hadrons. However, in terms of fundamental decays, the X boson would decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which then form jets. But the question is about kinematically allowed decays, so even if they form jets, as long as the quark masses are below 3 GeV, the decay is allowed. So, the answer would include all these fermion pairs.

But perhaps the problem is considering only the possible tree-level decays. Since the interaction term is X ψ̄_f ψ_f, the decay X → f f̄ is possible for each fermion f that couples to X. The kinematic condition is m_X ≥ 2m_f. So, for each fermion f with m_f ≤ 3 GeV, the decay is allowed.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:

- X → e+ e-
- X → μ+ μ-
- X → τ+ τ-
- X → c c̄
- X → s s̄
- X → u ū
- X → d d̄

But wait, the up and down quarks have very small masses (MeV scale), so their production is definitely allowed. However, in practice, the decay width would be proportional to (m_f)^2, so lighter fermions would have much smaller decay rates. But the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not their probabilities or branching ratios. So even if the coupling is small, as long as the decay is allowed by kinematics, it's possible. But the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order," so even if the coupling is tiny, if the interaction exists, the decay is allowed. However, the problem's Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, which suggests that each fermion f has its own coupling λf. If λf is non-zero for all these fermions, then all these decays are possible. But if λf is zero for some fermions, then those decays are not possible. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to assume that X couples to all fermions, similar to the Higgs boson. In the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all massive fermions. So, if X is a similar boson, then it would couple to all fermions with mass m_f = λf v. Therefore, the allowed decays would be to all fermions where 2m_f < m_X. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs can't decay to top quarks because the top is heavier than half the Higgs mass (which is 125 GeV, so half is ~62.5 GeV, and the top is 173 GeV). But in this case, X is 6 GeV, so the allowed fermions are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

But in the Standard Model, the Higgs couplings are proportional to the fermion mass. However, in this problem, the coupling is given by λf, which is related to the fermion mass via m_f = λf v. So, if v is the same for all fermions, then λf = m_f / v. Therefore, the decay amplitude would be proportional to m_f, but the kinematic condition is 2m_f < m_X. So, even though the coupling is proportional to the mass, the kinematic condition is separate.

Therefore, the answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are into all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. For the Standard Model fermions, this includes:

- Electrons (e+ e-)
- Muons (μ+ μ-)
- Taus (τ+ τ-)
- Charm quarks (c c̄)
- Strange quarks (s s̄)
- Up quarks (u ū)
- Down quarks (d d̄)

But since quarks cannot exist freely, the actual observable decays would involve hadrons. However, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, which are the fundamental processes. Therefore, the answer should list all these fermion pairs. However, sometimes in such problems, only the charged leptons and the heaviest possible quarks are considered, but given the mass of X is 6 GeV, charm quarks (1.27 GeV) are allowed, but bottom (4.18 GeV) are not. So, the allowed quark decays are up, down, strange, and charm.

But perhaps the problem expects only the charged leptons and the charm quark, since the others (u, d, s) have much smaller masses and their decays would be highly suppressed, but kinematically allowed. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not suppression. So, all of them are allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the interaction is only with a specific fermion, but the Lagrangian is written generally as ψ_f, which could be any fermion. Since the problem doesn't specify, we have to assume all possible fermions. Therefore, the answer is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. For the Standard Model, that includes e, μ, τ, c, s, u, d. But since the problem might be in a context where only charged leptons and quarks are considered, and perhaps neutrinos are excluded (if they are massless or nearly so), but if neutrinos have mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But given that the mass of neutrinos is extremely small (sub-eV), the decay is kinematically allowed, but again, the coupling would be proportional to the neutrino mass, making the decay rate negligible. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the decay rate. So, if neutrinos have non-zero mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But in the Standard Model with massless neutrinos, this decay is not possible. But in reality, neutrinos have mass, so perhaps it's allowed. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should exclude neutrinos.

In summary, the kinematically allowed decays of X at tree level are into all charged lepton pairs (e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-) and all quark-antiquark pairs (u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄), assuming the fermions have masses below 3 GeV. Therefore, the answer should list these decay channels.
