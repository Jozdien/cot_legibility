# Original Question

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?

Given an atomic nucleus of mass \( M = 300 \) GeV (rest-mass energy) that undergoes fission into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass \( M \):

1. **Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**
   \[
   m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \text{ GeV}
   \]
   Given \( m_1 = 2m_2 \):
   \[
   2m_2 + m_2 = 297 \implies 3m_2 = 297 \implies m_2 = 99 \text{ GeV}
   \]
   \[
   m_1 = 2 \times 99 = 198 \text{ GeV}
   \]

2. **Relativistic calculation:**
   - Conservation of energy:
     \[
     E_1 + E_2 = 300 \text{ GeV}
     \]
   - Conservation of momentum:
     \[
     \sqrt{E_1^2 - m_1^2} = \sqrt{E_2^2 - m_2^2}
     \]
   - Solving the equations:
     \[
     E_1 - E_2 = \frac{m_1^2 - m_2^2}{300} = \frac{198^2 - 99^2}{300} = \frac{29403}{300} = 98.01 \text{ GeV}
     \]
     \[
     E_1 + E_2 = 300 \text{ GeV}
     \]
     \[
     E_1 = \frac{300 + 98.01}{2} = 199.005 \text{ GeV}
     \]
     \[
     E_2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 \text{ GeV}
     \]
   - Kinetic energies:
     \[
     T_1 = E_1 - m_1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \text{ GeV}
     \]
     \[
     T_2 = E_2 - m_2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 \text{ GeV}
     \]

3. **Classical calculation:**
   - Conservation of momentum:
     \[
     m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \implies v_2 = 2v_1
     \]
   - Total kinetic energy:
     \[
     T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 198 \times v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} \times 99 \times (2v_1)^2 = 297 v_1^2
     \]
     \[
     297 v_1^2 = 3 \implies v_1^2 = \frac{1}{99}
     \]
   - Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:
     \[
     T_1^{\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 198 \times \frac{1}{99} = 1 \text{ GeV}
     \]

4. **Difference between relativistic and classical results:**
   \[
   \Delta T_1 = 1.005 \text{ GeV} - 1 \text{ GeV} = 0.005 \text{ GeV} = 5 \text{ MeV}
   \]

\[
\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem about a nucleus undergoing fission. Let me try to parse it step by step. The nucleus is initially at rest, with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the original mass. The question is about finding the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value obtained using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Hmm, okay.

First, let's note down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV/c² (but since we're using natural units where c=1, maybe we can just say M = 300 GeV? Not sure, but probably okay as long as we're consistent with units.)

- The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2.

- The sum of the rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, and m1 = 2*m2. Let me solve for m1 and m2.

If m1 = 2*m2, then substituting into the sum:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV

Therefore, m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV

Then m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV

So the two fragments have rest masses 198 GeV and 99 GeV. Got that.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But since this is a relativistic scenario, we need to use relativistic conservation laws. The problem asks for the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment (which is m1 = 198 GeV) using both relativistic and classical calculations, then find the difference between them.

First, let's recall that in relativity, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for each fragment:

E1 = m1 + T1

E2 = m2 + T2

But wait, actually, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E1 = γ1*m1 and E2 = γ2*m2. The kinetic energy is then T1 = (γ1 - 1)*m1 and similarly for T2.

But since the total energy must be conserved, the sum of the energies of the fragments should equal the initial energy of the nucleus. However, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, but the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 297 GeV. The missing 3 GeV must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So total energy is 300 GeV = E1 + E2.

But wait, the rest mass of the original nucleus is 300 GeV, so its total energy when at rest is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments, which includes their rest mass energies and their kinetic energies. But since the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, the remaining 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy T1 + T2.

But in relativity, energy and momentum are conserved. So we need to set up equations for conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

Let me write down the equations.

Conservation of energy:

E1 + E2 = M = 300 GeV

But E1 = γ1*m1 and E2 = γ2*m2

Conservation of momentum:

p1 + p2 = 0 => p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p

In relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv, but since we are using natural units (c=1), p = γmv. But m is the rest mass. Alternatively, another formula is E² = p² + m², so p = sqrt(E² - m²). That might be more useful here.

So for each fragment:

p1 = sqrt(E1² - m1²)

p2 = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

But since |p1| = |p2|, we have sqrt(E1² - m1²) = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

Squaring both sides:

E1² - m1² = E2² - m2²

But we also know that E1 + E2 = M = 300 GeV

So we have two equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1² - E2² = m1² - m2²

Note that E1² - E2² = (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (E1 - E2)*300 = m1² - m2²

Therefore, E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300

So now we can solve for E1 and E2.

Let me compute m1² - m2²:

m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV

m1² - m2² = (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 99*297

Compute 99*297:

99*300 = 29,700

Minus 99*3 = 297

So 29,700 - 297 = 29,403

Therefore, m1² - m2² = 29,403 (GeV²)

Then E1 - E2 = 29,403 / 300 = 29,403 / 300

Let me compute that:

29,403 ÷ 300

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 9,801 / 100 = 98.01 GeV

So E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Now we have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding these two equations:

2*E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Then E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

So the energies of the two fragments are approximately 199.005 GeV and 100.995 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

So the more massive fragment (m1) has kinetic energy T1 = 1.005 GeV, and the less massive one has T2 = 1.995 GeV. The total kinetic energy is 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the missing rest mass (300 - 297 = 3 GeV). That checks out.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (1.005 GeV) and the T1 calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to compute the classical T1 and subtract it from the relativistic one.

In classical physics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2)mv². But in the classical approximation, how would we approach this problem?

In classical mechanics, when a stationary object splits into two parts, conservation of momentum tells us that the momenta are equal and opposite. So m1*v1 = m2*v2. Then, the kinetic energies would be T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² and T2 = (1/2)m2*v2². The total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2².

But in the problem, the total kinetic energy in the relativistic case is 3 GeV, but in the classical case, would the total kinetic energy be the same? Wait, no. Because in the classical case, the rest masses are just the masses, and the kinetic energy is separate. But in the problem statement, the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, so the "classical" calculation would probably assume that the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect of 3 GeV. But in reality, in classical physics, mass is conserved, so the total mass after fission would still be 300 GeV. Wait, but the problem says that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So maybe in the classical approximation, they still take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, and compute the kinetic energy based on that. But in reality, in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so if the total mass is 300 GeV, then the two fragments would have masses adding up to 300 GeV. But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, which is 99% of the original. So perhaps in the problem, even in the classical approximation, they consider that the rest masses are 198 and 99, and the kinetic energy comes from the 3 GeV mass deficit. But in classical mechanics, mass is not converted to energy, so that might not make sense. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says: "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So regardless of relativity, the rest masses are 198 and 99 GeV, sum to 297 GeV. Then, the kinetic energy comes from the 3 GeV difference. But in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is separate from mass. So in the classical calculation, the initial mass is 300 GeV, and after fission, the masses are 198 and 99, so 297 GeV, and the remaining 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy. But in reality, in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so this wouldn't happen. But maybe the problem is assuming that in the classical case, the rest masses are still 198 and 99, and the kinetic energy is computed via classical mechanics, ignoring relativistic effects. So we have to proceed with that.

So, in the classical case, the two fragments have rest masses m1 = 198 GeV and m2 = 99 GeV. The initial total mass is 300 GeV, so 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy. But in classical mechanics, how is the kinetic energy distributed between the two fragments?

In classical mechanics, when an object at rest splits into two parts, the momenta are equal and opposite. So m1*v1 = -m2*v2. Therefore, v2 = -(m1/m2)*v1. Since m1 = 2*m2, v2 = -2*v1.

The total kinetic energy is (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2². Substituting v2 = -2*v1:

T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*(4*v1²) = (1/2)m1*v1² + 2*m2*v1²

But m1 = 2*m2, so:

T = (1/2)(2*m2)*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1²

But the total kinetic energy T is 3 GeV (as per the problem statement, since 300 - 297 = 3 GeV). So:

3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, m2*v1² = 1 GeV

But m2 is 99 GeV (rest mass). Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is in GeV/c², but if we are using natural units where c=1, then mass is in GeV, and velocity is unitless (in terms of c). So m2 is 99 GeV, and v1 is in units of c.

But in classical kinetic energy, T = (1/2)m*v², but with m in GeV/c² and v in m/s, but here with natural units, c=1, so T = (1/2)m*v², where v is a fraction of c.

But in the problem, the rest masses are given in GeV, so m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV. Then, the kinetic energy in classical terms would be (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2².

But we have to relate v1 and v2 through momentum conservation. As before, m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So v2 = -(m1/m2)*v1 = -2*v1.

Therefore, substituting into T:

T = (1/2)*198*v1² + (1/2)*99*(2*v1)^2

= (99*v1²) + (1/2)*99*4*v1²

= 99*v1² + 198*v1²

= 297*v1²

But T is given as 3 GeV, so:

297*v1² = 3

v1² = 3 / 297 = 1 / 99

v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 (since sqrt(100) = 10, so sqrt(99) ≈ 9.9499)

Therefore, v1 ≈ 0.1005c

Then, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is T1_classical = (1/2)*m1*v1²

= (1/2)*198*(1/99)

= (1/2)*198/99

= (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV

Wait, that's interesting. So T1_classical is 1 GeV, and the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check the calculation again.

From the classical calculation:

Total kinetic energy T = 3 GeV = 297*v1² => v1² = 3 / 297 = 1/99

Then T1_classical = (1/2)*m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(1/99) = 0.5*2 = 1 GeV. Correct.

In the relativistic case, T1 = 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me confirm the relativistic calculation again.

We had:

E1 = 199.005 GeV

m1 = 198 GeV

So T1 = E1 - m1 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check if there was any approximation in the relativistic calculation. When we calculated E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV, that was from m1² - m2² = 29,403 GeV² divided by 300 GeV, which is 29,403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV. Then solving E1 + E2 = 300 and E1 - E2 = 98.01 gives E1 = (300 + 98.01)/2 = 398.01/2 = 199.005 GeV. Then E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV. Then T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. T2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV. Total T = 3 GeV. All correct.

So the difference between relativistic T1 and classical T1 is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me think again: in the classical case, we assumed that the kinetic energy comes purely from the mass deficit, which is 3 GeV. But in reality, in classical mechanics, mass isn't converted to energy. However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so regardless of the framework, we have to take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, and the total kinetic energy as 3 GeV. So even in the classical approximation, we are to calculate the kinetic energy distribution based on those rest masses and momentum conservation, leading to T1_classical = 1 GeV. Then the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in GeV, so 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But perhaps we need to write it as 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. The problem says "difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But maybe we need to compute it more accurately?

Wait, let's check the exact value. In the relativistic case, E1 was 199.005 GeV. But let's see if that's exact.

We had m1² - m2² = 198² - 99² = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 29403 GeV²

Then E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 29403 ÷ 300.

Let me compute that more precisely:

29403 ÷ 300:

29400 ÷ 300 = 98.

3 ÷ 300 = 0.01

So total is 98.01 exactly.

Therefore, E1 = (300 + 98.01)/2 = 398.01/2 = 199.005 GeV exactly.

So T1 is exactly 1.005 GeV.

In the classical case, T1 is exactly 1 GeV.

Therefore, the difference is exactly 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the answer should be 0.005 GeV, or 5 MeV. Since the question says "difference", and doesn't specify units, but the original units are GeV, so 0.005 GeV. But maybe convert it to MeV for clarity? The problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and often in physics problems, the answer is expected in the same units as given, unless specified. The initial rest mass energy is given in GeV, and the kinetic energies are in GeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, but perhaps the answer is 0.005 GeV. However, sometimes MeV is more standard for such differences. But the problem says "ignore the electrons", which probably isn't related.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check once more.

Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV

Classical T1: 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of GeV, so 0.005 GeV. But 5 MeV is also correct. However, since the original units are GeV, and the question doesn't specify, it's safer to go with GeV. But let me check the exact question:

"What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

So the answer is T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV. But let's write it as 0.005 GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But maybe the answer is 5 MeV. But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and in the problem statement, all energies are in GeV. So perhaps 0.005 GeV is acceptable. But maybe the answer is 5 MeV. Let me check if 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV. Yes, because 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So both are correct, but depending on the convention. In particle physics, MeV is commonly used for such differences. But since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV is better. However, the problem might expect the answer in MeV. Let me check the calculation once again.

Wait, in the relativistic calculation, T1 is 1.005 GeV. The classical is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV. But to be precise, 0.005 GeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Hmm. Let me see. The initial energy is given in GeV, the fragments' rest masses in GeV, so the kinetic energy is also in GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But since the question didn't specify, but the given data is in GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV is the answer. However, in high-energy physics, sometimes people use MeV for smaller energies. But the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me check the exact numbers again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me verify the relativistic calculation once more.

We have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300 GeV = (198² - 99²)/300 = (39204 - 9801)/300 = (29403)/300 = 98.01 GeV

Therefore, solving:

E1 = (300 + 98.01)/2 = 398.01/2 = 199.005 GeV

E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

Thus, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

Classical:

T1_classical = 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Given that the problem uses GeV, but the difference is small, it's possible that the answer is expected in MeV. However, since the problem mentions "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical...", and both T1 values are in GeV, the difference should also be in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, to match the precision, since the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is three decimal places, the difference is 0.005 GeV. So I think the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But to be safe, check if the problem expects the answer in the same unit as T1, which is GeV. So 0.005 GeV.

But let me check with another approach. Maybe using velocities.

In the relativistic case, for the more massive fragment:

E1 = γ1*m1 = 199.005 GeV

So γ1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.0050757...

Then, γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²) => sqrt(1 - v1²) = 1 / γ1 ≈ 0.99495

Then, 1 - v1² ≈ (0.99495)^2 ≈ 0.9899

Therefore, v1² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101

v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005c

Which matches the classical velocity we found earlier (0.1005c). Then, classical kinetic energy is (1/2)*m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(0.0101) ≈ 0.5*198*0.0101 ≈ 0.5*2.0 ≈ 1.0 GeV, which is consistent.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ1 - 1)*m1 = (1.0050757 - 1)*198 ≈ 0.0050757*198 ≈ 1.005 GeV, which matches.

Therefore, the difference is indeed approximately 0.005 GeV.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more precise way to calculate the difference. Let's compute it exactly.

Relativistic T1 = (γ1 - 1)*m1

Classical T1 = (1/2)*m1*v1²

The difference is (γ1 - 1)*m1 - (1/2)*m1*v1² = m1[(γ1 - 1) - (1/2)v1²]

But since γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²), we can expand γ1 in terms of v1.

Using a Taylor expansion for γ1 around v1 = 0:

γ1 ≈ 1 + (1/2)v1² + (3/8)v1^4 + ...

Therefore, γ1 - 1 ≈ (1/2)v1² + (3/8)v1^4

So the difference is m1[(1/2)v1² + (3/8)v1^4 - (1/2)v1²] = m1*(3/8)v1^4

So the difference is approximately (3/8)*m1*v1^4

Given that v1 ≈ 0.1005c, v1^4 ≈ (0.1005)^4 ≈ 0.00000101 (since 0.1^4 = 0.0001, but 0.1005 is slightly more, so 0.1005^4 ≈ (0.1 + 0.0005)^4 ≈ 0.0001 + 4*0.1^3*0.0005 + ... ≈ 0.0001 + 4*0.0001*0.0005 ≈ 0.0001 + 0.0000002 ≈ 0.0001002). But actually, 0.1005^4 = (0.1005)^2*(0.1005)^2. (0.1005)^2 = 0.01010025, so squared again: 0.01010025^2 ≈ 0.00010205. So v1^4 ≈ 0.00010205.

Then, (3/8)*m1*v1^4 ≈ (3/8)*198*0.00010205 ≈ (3/8)*198*0.00010205 ≈ (74.25)*0.00010205 ≈ 0.00758 GeV, which is approximately 7.58 MeV. But this contradicts our previous result of 5 MeV. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Wait, but this is an approximation using the Taylor series. The exact difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, but the Taylor expansion up to v^4 gives around 7.5 MeV. This suggests that higher-order terms are significant. Therefore, the exact calculation is better.

Therefore, the correct difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. The Taylor expansion gives a different result because the velocity is not extremely small, so higher-order terms contribute. Therefore, the exact calculation is necessary, which we did earlier, giving 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. Given the problem's use of GeV, but the smallness of the value, I think 5 MeV is more appropriate. However, since the problem didn't specify, but the initial units are GeV, I'll go with 0.005 GeV. But to confirm, let's check with precise calculation.

Alternatively, let's compute the difference exactly.

Relativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV

Classical T1 = 1 GeV

Difference = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Yes, that's exact. Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Given that the problem mentions "ignore the electrons", which probably isn't relevant here, and the answer is a small fraction of GeV, I think the answer is 5 MeV. But to be safe, since the problem is in GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, in particle physics, 5 MeV is a common unit. Let me check with the initial problem statement.

The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The fragments have rest-masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV. The kinetic energies are on the order of 1-2 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So both are correct, but 5 MeV is more intuitive. However, the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me see if 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Yes, 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Therefore, both are correct, but since the problem uses GeV, but the difference is small, it's better to write it as 0.005 GeV. However, the answer might be 5 MeV. But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and in the problem statement, all energies are in GeV. So I think 0.005 GeV is acceptable. But to be safe, check if the calculation is correct.

Yes, the difference is exactly 0.005 GeV. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0.005} GeV. But maybe the problem expects \boxed{5} MeV. Hmm. Since the problem didn't specify, but the given data is in GeV, I think 0.005 GeV is the answer. However, in many textbooks, such differences are often expressed in MeV. But since the problem is at the GeV scale, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Both are correct, but the answer should be in the box. Given that the problem is from a physics context, and MeV is a standard unit for such energy differences, I think \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}} is more appropriate. But the problem might want it in GeV. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

The problem doesn't specify units for the answer, but the given data is in GeV. However, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. In particle physics, 5 MeV is a small energy, so it's more natural to write it as 5 MeV. But since the problem didn't specify, but the initial data is in GeV, it's ambiguous. However, given that 0.005 GeV is exact and in the same unit as the problem's context, I think \boxed{0.005} GeV is correct. Alternatively, if the answer requires units, then \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". In many cases, if the answer is numerical with units, you include the units in the box. But since the original problem uses GeV, but the difference is small, it's safer to check both. However, given that the calculation gives 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV, and the problem might prefer the answer in MeV, but the user hasn't specified, I'll go with \boxed{5} MeV. But I need to check the exact calculation once more.

Yes, the difference is exactly 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Therefore, both are correct, but since MeV is a subunit of GeV, and the difference is small, writing it as 5 MeV is clearer. Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{5} MeV.

But let me check with the initial calculation:

Relativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV

Classical T1 = 1 GeV

Difference = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Yes. So the answer is 5 MeV. Therefore, \boxed{5} MeV.

But in the problem statement, all energies are given in GeV, so maybe the answer should be in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me see. If I were to write 0.005 GeV, that's correct. If I write 5 MeV, that's also correct. But since the question is from a physics problem, and MeV is a common unit for such energy differences, I think 5 MeV is better. But to be safe, since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, the answer is likely 5 MeV. Given that, I'll go with \boxed{5} MeV.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem about a nucleus undergoing fission. Let me try to parse it step by step. The nucleus is initially at rest, with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the original mass. The question is about finding the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value obtained using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Hmm, okay.

First, let's note down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV/c² (but since we're using natural units where c=1, maybe we can just say M = 300 GeV? Not sure, but probably okay as long as we're consistent with units.)

- The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2.

- The sum of the rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, and m1 = 2*m2. Let me solve for m1 and m2.

If m1 = 2*m2, then substituting into the sum:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV

Therefore, m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV

Then m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV

So the two fragments have rest masses 198 GeV and 99 GeV. Got that.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But since this is a relativistic scenario, we need to use relativistic conservation laws. The problem asks for the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment (which is m1 = 198 GeV) using both relativistic and classical calculations, then find the difference between them.

First, let's recall that in relativity, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for each fragment:

E1 = m1 + T1

E2 = m2 + T2

But wait, actually, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E1 = γ1*m1 and E2 = γ2*m2. The kinetic energy is then T1 = (γ1 - 1)*m1 and similarly for T2.

But since the total energy must be conserved, the sum of the energies of the fragments should equal the initial energy of the nucleus. However, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, but the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 297 GeV. The missing 3 GeV must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. So total energy is 300 GeV = E1 + E2.

But wait, the rest mass of the original nucleus is 300 GeV, so its total energy when at rest is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments, which includes their rest mass energies and their kinetic energies. But since the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, the remaining 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy T1 + T2.

But in relativity, energy and momentum are conserved. So we need to set up equations for conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

Let me write down the equations.

Conservation of energy:

E1 + E2 = M = 300 GeV

But E1 = γ1*m1 and E2 = γ2*m2

Conservation of momentum:

p1 + p2 = 0 => p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p

In relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv, but since we are using natural units (c=1), p = γmv. But m is the rest mass. Alternatively, another formula is E² = p² + m², so p = sqrt(E² - m²). That might be more useful here.

So for each fragment:

p1 = sqrt(E1² - m1²)

p2 = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

But since |p1| = |p2|, we have sqrt(E1² - m1²) = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

Squaring both sides:

E1² - m1² = E2² - m2²

But we also know that E1 + E2 = M = 300 GeV

So we have two equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1² - E2² = m1² - m2²

Note that E1² - E2² = (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (E1 - E2)*300 = m1² - m2²

Therefore, E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300

So now we can solve for E1 and E2.

Let me compute m1² - m2²:

m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV

m1² - m2² = (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 99*297

Compute 99*297:

99*300 = 29,700

Minus 99*3 = 297

So 29,700 - 297 = 29,403

Therefore, m1² - m2² = 29,403 (GeV²)

Then E1 - E2 = 29,403 / 300 = 29,403 / 300

Let me compute that:

29,403 ÷ 300

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 9,801 / 100 = 98.01 GeV

So E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Now we have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding these two equations:

2*E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Then E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

So the energies of the two fragments are approximately 199.005 GeV and 100.995 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

So the more massive fragment (m1) has kinetic energy T1 = 1.005 GeV, and the less massive one has T2 = 1.995 GeV. The total kinetic energy is 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the missing rest mass (300 - 297 = 3 GeV). That checks out.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (1.005 GeV) and the T1 calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to compute the classical T1 and subtract it from the relativistic one.

In classical physics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2)mv². But in the classical approximation, how would we approach this problem?

In classical mechanics, when a stationary object splits into two parts, conservation of momentum tells us that the momenta are equal and opposite. So m1*v1 = m2*v2. Then, the kinetic energies would be T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² and T2 = (1/2)m2*v2². The total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2².

But in the problem, the total kinetic energy in the relativistic case is 3 GeV, but in the classical case, would the total kinetic energy be the same? Wait, no. Because in the classical case, the rest masses are just the mass

# Anthropic completion

I'm analyzing a fission problem where a nucleus with rest mass energy of 300 GeV splits into two fragments. The fragments have rest masses in a 2:1 ratio, with their combined rest mass being 99% of the original nucleus (297 GeV). I need to find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment and its classical approximation.

Given information:
- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV
- Two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂, where m₁ = 2m₂
- m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M = 297 GeV

First, I'll solve for the individual masses:
m₁ + m₂ = 297 GeV
2m₂ + m₂ = 297 GeV
3m₂ = 297 GeV
m₂ = 99 GeV

Therefore, m₁ = 198 GeV

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude to conserve momentum.

For the relativistic analysis, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum:
E₁ + E₂ = M = 300 GeV
p₁ + p₂ = 0, so |p₁| = |p₂| = p

In relativity, E² = p² + m², so:
p₁ = √(E₁² - m₁²)
p₂ = √(E₂² - m₂²)

Since |p₁| = |p₂|:
E₁² - m₁² = E₂² - m₂²

Using these equations:
E₁² - E₂² = m₁² - m₂²
(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = m₁² - m₂²
(E₁ - E₂)(300) = m₁² - m₂²

Calculating m₁² - m₂²:
m₁² - m₂² = 198² - 99² = 99(198 + 99) = 99 × 297 = 29,403 GeV²

Therefore:
E₁ - E₂ = 29,403/300 = 98.01 GeV

From the two equations:
E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV
E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV

Solving for E₁:
2E₁ = 398.01 GeV
E₁ = 199.005 GeV

And E₂ = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

The kinetic energies are:
T₁ = E₁ - m₁ = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV
T₂ = E₂ - m₂ = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which matches the mass deficit of 3 GeV (300 - 297), confirming our calculation.

Now I need to calculate the classical kinetic energy for comparison with the relativistic result of 1.005 GeV.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I have a problem involving a nucleus undergoing fission. I'll break it down step by step. Initially, the nucleus is at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. It then splits into two fragments, one of which is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of the rest masses of these two fragments is 99% of the original mass. The task is to find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy, T1, of the more massive fragment, and the value obtained using a classical approximation.

Here's what we know:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV. Since we are using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to M = 300 GeV.

- The nucleus divides into fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2.

- The total rest mass of the fragments: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 297 GeV.

Using these:

If m1 = 2*m2, substitute it into the equation:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV

Thus, m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV

Then m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV

So, the fragments have rest masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV.

With the initial nucleus at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, after splitting, the fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, with equal magnitude momenta.

Using relativistic conservation laws, the goal is to calculate the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV) using both classical and relativistic approaches, and then find their difference.

Recall that in relativity, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy: E1 = m1 + T1 and E2 = m2 + T2. In relativistic terms, the total energy is γ times the rest mass energy, so E1 = γ1*m1 and E2 = γ2*m2, where the kinetic energy is T1 = (γ1 - 1)*m1.

The conservation of energy states that the sum of the fragment energies equals the initial energy of the nucleus (300 GeV). Given the rest mass totals 297 GeV, the missing 3 GeV is the kinetic energy of the fragments. Thus, the energy balance is 300 GeV = E1 + E2.

Conservation of momentum implies p1 + p2 = 0, so p1 = -p2 or |p1| = |p2|. In relativity, momentum is p = γmv. Also, p = sqrt(E² - m²) is useful here, so:

p1 = sqrt(E1² - m1²)

p2 = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

Since |p1| = |p2|, we have sqrt(E1² - m1²) = sqrt(E2² - m2²)

Squaring gives us E1² - m1² = E2² - m2². Knowing E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, leads to:

1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

2. E1² - E2² = m1² - m2²

Thus, E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300

Compute m1² - m2²:

m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV

m1² - m2² = (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 29,403 GeV²

Then E1 - E2 = 29,403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV

Now:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding gives 2*E1 = 398.01 GeV, so E1 = 199.005 GeV

E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

Therefore, the fragments’ energies are approximately 199.005 GeV and 100.995 GeV.

The kinetic energies are:

T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

Thus, the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment is 1.005 GeV. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, matching the lost rest mass.

The problem asks for the difference between the exact T1 (1.005 GeV) and the classical T1. For classical approximations, kinetic energy T = (1/2)mv². Using conservation of momentum, m1*v1 = m2*v2, where T1 = (1/2)m1*v1². The challenge is to compute this classical T1 and the difference with the relativistic one.

But the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy should still be 3 GeV. Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is conserved. Wait, but in reality, in nuclear reactions, mass isn\'t conserved, but in classical physics, mass is conserved. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M". So even in the classical approximation, we have the same rest masses: m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV. The initial mass is 300 GeV, but after fission, the rest masses are 297 GeV, so 3 GeV of mass has been converted to kinetic energy. But in classical physics, mass is conserved, so this wouldn\'t happen. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in the classical approximation, we still take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, but ignore relativistic effects when calculating the kinetic energy. So even though in reality, the mass difference is converted to kinetic energy, in the classical approximation, we might still have the same rest masses but compute the kinetic energy using classical formulas. But this is a bit inconsistent because in reality, the mass deficit is converted to energy, but in classical physics, that doesn\'t happen. So perhaps the problem is assuming that in the classical case, the kinetic energy is still 3 GeV, but computed using classical expressions. Wait, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the classical approximation, we ignore the mass-energy equivalence, so the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV, but the way it\'s distributed between the two fragments is calculated using classical mechanics. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and we need to find T1 in the classical case, then compare it to the relativistic T1 (1.005 GeV). But how?\n\nWait, let\'s think. In the classical case, the kinetic energy comes from the conversion of mass, but since classically mass is conserved, this is a bit of a contradiction. However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so perhaps even in the classical approximation, we take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, and the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but computed using classical formulas. So the problem is not about the source of the kinetic energy, but just the calculation of T1 using classical vs. relativistic mechanics.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nIn the relativistic case, we have T1 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nIn the classical case, we need to compute T1 using classical conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nSo, in the classical case:\n\nTotal kinetic energy T = 3 GeV.\n\nMomentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2.\n\nBut m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c². Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is in kg, but here we have mass in GeV/c². But since we are using natural units where c=1, maybe we can ignore the units and just treat mass as GeV (since c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²)*c²). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe we need to convert everything to SI units, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, since we are dealing with ratios, maybe we can proceed with the given units.\n\nWait, but in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². But if we are using GeV for energy, and mass is in GeV/c², then velocity would be in terms of c. Let me see.\n\nLet me define the masses as m1 = 198 GeV/c² and m2 = 99 GeV/c². Then, in classical mechanics, the kinetic energy T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², and T2 = (1/2)m2 v2². The total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\nMomentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2. So v2 = (m1/m2) v1 = (198/99) v1 = 2 v1.\n\nTherefore, T1 = (1/2)m1 v1²\n\nT2 = (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(99)(2 v1)² = (1/2)(99)(4 v1²) = 2*99 v1² = 198 v1²\n\nBut m1 = 198, so T1 = (1/2)(198) v1² = 99 v1²\n\nTherefore, total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = 99 v1² + 198 v1² = 297 v1² = 3 GeV\n\nTherefore, v1² = 3 / 297 = 1 / 99 GeV / (GeV/c²) )? Wait, units are a bit messy here.\n\nWait, m1 is in GeV/c², v1 is in terms of c. Let\'s see:\n\nIf we write T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², where m1 is in GeV/c² and v1 is in units of c, then:\n\nT1 (GeV) = (1/2) * m1 (GeV/c²) * v1² (c²) = (1/2) m1 v1² (GeV)\n\nSo the units work out. Therefore, v1 is a dimensionless number (in units of c). So proceeding:\n\nFrom T = 297 v1² = 3 GeV\n\nTherefore, v1² = 3 / 297 = 1/99\n\nTherefore, v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nThen, T1 = 99 v1² = 99*(1/99) = 1 GeV\n\nSo in the classical approximation, T1 = 1 GeV, whereas in the relativistic case, T1 = 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nWait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, in the classical case:\n\nMomentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => v2 = 2*v1.\n\nTotal kinetic energy: T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)(2*m2)*v1² + (1/2)m2*(2*v1)^2 = m2*v1² + (1/2)m2*4*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1²\n\nBut m2 = 99 GeV/c², so T = 3*99*v1² = 297*v1²\n\nGiven that T = 3 GeV, then 297*v1² = 3 => v1² = 3/297 = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nThen, T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(1/99) = 0.5*2 = 1 GeV. Correct.\n\nIn the relativistic case, T1 was found to be 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check the relativistic calculation again to make sure.\n\nWe had:\n\nE1 = 199.005 GeV\n\nm1 = 198 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5 MeV, or in GeV, 0.005 GeV. But the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Depending on the required units, but since the initial energy is given in GeV, probably GeV is acceptable. But let me check if the question specifies units. The problem says "what is the difference...", and the initial rest-mass energy is given in GeV, so likely GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, which is a small number. Let me see if there\'s a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let\'s check the relativistic calculation again.\n\nWe had:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nE1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300 GeV\n\nWe calculated m1² - m2² as (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 29403 (GeV²)\n\nThen, E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV\n\nThen, solving:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300\n\nE1 - E2 = 98.01\n\nAdding:\n\n2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.\n\nClassical T1 is 1 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if gamma is close to 1, which would validate the classical approximation.\n\nFor the more massive fragment, gamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.005, which is very close to 1, meaning the velocity is non-relativistic. Therefore, the classical approximation should be fairly good, which is why the difference is small (0.5% of T1). So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV or MeV. The initial rest mass is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy is on the order of GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Since the question doesn\'t specify, but given that the rest mass is in GeV, and the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 5 MeV is a more tangible number in nuclear physics. But the problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}", and doesn\'t specify units. But in the problem statement, all units are in GeV, so maybe 0.005 GeV. But 5 MeV is also correct. Wait, 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV, since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is expected in MeV. However, the problem mentions "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical..." so if T1 is in GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. But maybe the answer is 5 MeV. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute the velocity in the relativistic case.\n\nFor the more massive fragment, E1 = 199.005 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV.\n\ngamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²)\n\nSo 1.005075 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²)\n\nsqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495\n\n1 - v² ≈ (0.99495)^2 ≈ 0.9899\n\nTherefore, v² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101\n\nv ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005, which is about 10% the speed of light. So v ≈ 0.1c. Which is non-relativistic, hence why the classical and relativistic results are close.\n\nBut in the classical calculation, we found v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c, which matches the relativistic velocity. Wait, that\'s interesting. The velocity is the same in both cases? Wait, no. In the classical case, the velocity is 0.1005c, and in the relativistic case, the velocity is also approximately 0.1005c. But how come the kinetic energies differ?\n\nWait, in the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV, and in the relativistic case, T1 = 1.005 GeV. But if the velocities are the same, why the difference? Because in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m, whereas classically it\'s (1/2)mv². So even with the same velocity, the kinetic energy is different. Wait, but in our case, the velocities aren\'t exactly the same. Wait, in the relativistic case, the velocity is v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/1.005075)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9899) ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005, same as classical. Wait, so the velocity is the same, but the kinetic energy is different? That can\'t be. Wait, no, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and in the relativistic case, it\'s (gamma - 1)m. If the velocity is the same, then these would be different. But in our problem, the velocities are the same, but the kinetic energies are different. However, in reality, the velocities aren\'t exactly the same because in the relativistic case, the momentum is p = gamma mv, whereas in the classical case, p = mv. But in our problem, we had to conserve momentum. Wait, in the relativistic case, the momentum is p = gamma mv, but in the classical case, p = mv. Therefore, even if the velocities are the same, the momenta would differ by a factor of gamma. But in our problem, we have to conserve momentum. Therefore, the velocities in the relativistic and classical cases can\'t be the same. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that in the relativistic case, the momentum p1 = sqrt(E1² - m1²) = sqrt(199.005² - 198²). Let\'s compute that.\n\nCompute 199.005²: (200 - 0.995)^2 = 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² = 40,000 - 398 + 0.990025 = 40,000 - 398 is 39,602 + 0.990025 ≈ 39,602.990025\n\nm1² = 198² = 39,204\n\nTherefore, p1² = 39,602.990025 - 39,204 = 398.990025\n\nTherefore, p1 = sqrt(398.990025) ≈ 19.9747 GeV\n\nSimilarly, in the classical case, p1 = m1*v1 = 198*(1/sqrt(99)) ≈ 198/9.94987 ≈ 19.899 GeV\n\nSo the relativistic momentum is higher: ~19.975 GeV vs. ~19.899 GeV. Therefore, the velocities are slightly different. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that v is ~0.1005c in both cases. Wait, maybe not. Let\'s compute the velocity in the relativistic case.\n\nIn the relativistic case, p1 = gamma1*m1*v1\n\nWe have p1 ≈ 19.9747 GeV\n\ngamma1 = 1.005075\n\nm1 = 198 GeV/c²\n\nTherefore, v1 = p1 / (gamma1*m1) = 19.9747 / (1.005075*198) ≈ 19.9747 / 199.005 ≈ 0.1003c\n\nIn the classical case, v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c. So they are very close, but not exactly the same. Therefore, the velocities are slightly different, leading to slightly different kinetic energies. But the main point is that in the relativistic calculation, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m, which for gamma ≈ 1.005, gives T1 ≈ 0.005*m1 = 0.005*198 = 0.99 GeV. Wait, but we calculated T1 as 1.005 GeV. Wait, no:\n\nWait, gamma is 1.005075, so (gamma - 1) = 0.005075. Then T1 = 0.005075*198 ≈ 1.005 GeV. Correct.\n\nWhereas in the classical case, T1 = 0.5*m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(0.1005)^2 ≈ 0.5*198*0.0101 ≈ 0.5*198*0.0101 ≈ 0.5*2.0 ≈ 1.0 GeV. So that\'s why the difference is 0.005 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. Since the problem didn\'t specify units, but the given rest mass energy is in GeV, it\'s safer to provide both, but likely 0.005 GeV. However, in particle/nuclear physics, MeV is commonly used for such differences. Let me check the exact question again.\n\nThe problem says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"\n\nSince T1 is given in GeV in both cases, the difference would be 0.005 GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. The problem might expect the answer in MeV, as it\'s a small difference. Let me check the calculation once more to ensure.\n\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\n\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\n\nDifference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV. But to write it in GeV, it\'s 0.005 GeV. However, the problem might prefer the answer in MeV. Since the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy is ~1 GeV, 5 MeV is a small difference. Given that, and the context of nuclear physics where MeV is more common for such energy differences, I think the answer is 5 MeV. But the problem statement uses GeV, so maybe 0.005 GeV. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}". It\'s possible that the answer is expected in GeV. Let me check the calculation once again.\n\nYes, relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, classical is 1 GeV, difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is correct. Alternatively, 5 MeV. But since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, in high-energy physics, sometimes "MeV" is used for smaller energies. But the problem doesn\'t specify. Given that, I think both are correct, but to match the units of the problem (GeV), 0.005 GeV is appropriate. However, the numerical answer is 5 MeV. Let me check with exact values.\n\nWait, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So both are correct. The problem might accept either, but given that the rest mass is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy is in GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 5 MeV is more precise in a way. But since the question is from a physics problem, and in such contexts, the difference might be presented in MeV. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nWait, in the relativistic calculation, T1 was exactly 1.005 GeV. In the classical, exactly 1 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is exact. If we were to write it as 5 MeV, that\'s also correct, but since the original units are GeV, 0.005 GeV is more consistent. However, the problem might prefer 5 MeV. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact answer is 0.005 GeV, but expressed as 5 MeV. Since 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But to be safe, I can write both. But the problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}", so probably as 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Let me check if the initial problem has any clues. The initial rest mass is 300 GeV, fragments are 198 and 99 GeV. The kinetic energy T1 is about 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Given that, and since MeV is a more natural unit for such a small energy difference in nuclear physics, I think the answer is 5 MeV, so \\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s see. If the problem is from a textbook, usually such differences are in MeV. But since the problem mentions "ignore the electrons", which is common in nuclear physics, where MeV is standard. So I think 5 MeV is the answer. Therefore, I will go with \\boxed{5} MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But since the problem didn\'t specify, but given the context, 5 MeV is more likely. So I\'ll put \\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5 \\text{ MeV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447554, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5533, prompt_tokens=1881, total_tokens=7414, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

of the fragments, and the kinetic energy is separate. But the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy should still be 3 GeV. Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is conserved. Wait, but in reality, in nuclear reactions, mass isn't conserved, but in classical physics, mass is conserved. So this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M". So even in the classical approximation, we have the same rest masses: m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV. The initial mass is 300 GeV, but after fission, the rest masses are 297 GeV, so 3 GeV of mass has been converted to kinetic energy. But in classical physics, mass is conserved, so this wouldn't happen. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the classical approximation, we still take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, but ignore relativistic effects when calculating the kinetic energy. So even though in reality, the mass difference is converted to kinetic energy, in the classical approximation, we might still have the same rest masses but compute the kinetic energy using classical formulas. But this is a bit inconsistent because in reality, the mass deficit is converted to energy, but in classical physics, that doesn't happen. So perhaps the problem is assuming that in the classical case, the kinetic energy is still 3 GeV, but computed using classical expressions. Wait, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe in the classical approximation, we ignore the mass-energy equivalence, so the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV, but the way it's distributed between the two fragments is calculated using classical mechanics. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and we need to find T1 in the classical case, then compare it to the relativistic T1 (1.005 GeV). But how?

Wait, let's think. In the classical case, the kinetic energy comes from the conversion of mass, but since classically mass is conserved, this is a bit of a contradiction. However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so perhaps even in the classical approximation, we take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, and the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but computed using classical formulas. So the problem is not about the source of the kinetic energy, but just the calculation of T1 using classical vs. relativistic mechanics.

Therefore, perhaps we can proceed as follows:

In the relativistic case, we have T1 = 1.005 GeV.

In the classical case, we need to compute T1 using classical conservation of momentum and energy.

So, in the classical case:

Total kinetic energy T = 3 GeV.

Momentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2.

But m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c². Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is in kg, but here we have mass in GeV/c². But since we are using natural units where c=1, maybe we can ignore the units and just treat mass as GeV (since c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²)*c²). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe we need to convert everything to SI units, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, since we are dealing with ratios, maybe we can proceed with the given units.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². But if we are using GeV for energy, and mass is in GeV/c², then velocity would be in terms of c. Let me see.

Let me define the masses as m1 = 198 GeV/c² and m2 = 99 GeV/c². Then, in classical mechanics, the kinetic energy T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², and T2 = (1/2)m2 v2². The total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2. So v2 = (m1/m2) v1 = (198/99) v1 = 2 v1.

Therefore, T1 = (1/2)m1 v1²

T2 = (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(99)(2 v1)² = (1/2)(99)(4 v1²) = 2*99 v1² = 198 v1²

But m1 = 198, so T1 = (1/2)(198) v1² = 99 v1²

Therefore, total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = 99 v1² + 198 v1² = 297 v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, v1² = 3 / 297 = 1 / 99 GeV / (GeV/c²) )? Wait, units are a bit messy here.

Wait, m1 is in GeV/c², v1 is in terms of c. Let's see:

If we write T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², where m1 is in GeV/c² and v1 is in units of c, then:

T1 (GeV) = (1/2) * m1 (GeV/c²) * v1² (c²) = (1/2) m1 v1² (GeV)

So the units work out. Therefore, v1 is a dimensionless number (in units of c). So proceeding:

From T = 297 v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, v1² = 3 / 297 = 1/99

Therefore, v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c

Then, T1 = 99 v1² = 99*(1/99) = 1 GeV

So in the classical approximation, T1 = 1 GeV, whereas in the relativistic case, T1 = 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

But let me check the calculations again to be sure.

First, in the classical case:

Momentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => v2 = 2*v1.

Total kinetic energy: T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)(2*m2)*v1² + (1/2)m2*(2*v1)^2 = m2*v1² + (1/2)m2*4*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1²

But m2 = 99 GeV/c², so T = 3*99*v1² = 297*v1²

Given that T = 3 GeV, then 297*v1² = 3 => v1² = 3/297 = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c

Then, T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(1/99) = 0.5*2 = 1 GeV. Correct.

In the relativistic case, T1 was found to be 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check the relativistic calculation again to make sure.

We had:

E1 = 199.005 GeV

m1 = 198 GeV

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

So the difference is indeed 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer should be 5 MeV, or in GeV, 0.005 GeV. But the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Depending on the required units, but since the initial energy is given in GeV, probably GeV is acceptable. But let me check if the question specifies units. The problem says "what is the difference...", and the initial rest-mass energy is given in GeV, so likely GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, which is a small number. Let me see if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check the relativistic calculation again.

We had:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = (m1² - m2²)/300 GeV

We calculated m1² - m2² as (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 - 99)(198 + 99) = 99*297 = 29403 (GeV²)

Then, E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV

Then, solving:

E1 + E2 = 300

E1 - E2 = 98.01

Adding:

2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

Classical T1 is 1 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check if gamma is close to 1, which would validate the classical approximation.

For the more massive fragment, gamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075

So gamma is approximately 1.005, which is very close to 1, meaning the velocity is non-relativistic. Therefore, the classical approximation should be fairly good, which is why the difference is small (0.5% of T1). So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV.

But let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV or MeV. The initial rest mass is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy is on the order of GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Since the question doesn't specify, but given that the rest mass is in GeV, and the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 5 MeV is a more tangible number in nuclear physics. But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and doesn't specify units. But in the problem statement, all units are in GeV, so maybe 0.005 GeV. But 5 MeV is also correct. Wait, 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV, since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is expected in MeV. However, the problem mentions "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical..." so if T1 is in GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. But maybe the answer is 5 MeV. Let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute the velocity in the relativistic case.

For the more massive fragment, E1 = 199.005 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV.

gamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²)

So 1.005075 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²)

sqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495

1 - v² ≈ (0.99495)^2 ≈ 0.9899

Therefore, v² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101

v ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005, which is about 10% the speed of light. So v ≈ 0.1c. Which is non-relativistic, hence why the classical and relativistic results are close.

But in the classical calculation, we found v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c, which matches the relativistic velocity. Wait, that's interesting. The velocity is the same in both cases? Wait, no. In the classical case, the velocity is 0.1005c, and in the relativistic case, the velocity is also approximately 0.1005c. But how come the kinetic energies differ?

Wait, in the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV, and in the relativistic case, T1 = 1.005 GeV. But if the velocities are the same, why the difference? Because in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m, whereas classically it's (1/2)mv². So even with the same velocity, the kinetic energy is different. Wait, but in our case, the velocities aren't exactly the same. Wait, in the relativistic case, the velocity is v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/1.005075)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9899) ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005, same as classical. Wait, so the velocity is the same, but the kinetic energy is different? That can't be. Wait, no, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and in the relativistic case, it's (gamma - 1)m. If the velocity is the same, then these would be different. But in our problem, the velocities are the same, but the kinetic energies are different. However, in reality, the velocities aren't exactly the same because in the relativistic case, the momentum is p = gamma mv, whereas in the classical case, p = mv. But in our problem, we had to conserve momentum. Wait, in the relativistic case, the momentum is p = gamma mv, but in the classical case, p = mv. Therefore, even if the velocities are the same, the momenta would differ by a factor of gamma. But in our problem, we have to conserve momentum. Therefore, the velocities in the relativistic and classical cases can't be the same. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that in the relativistic case, the momentum p1 = sqrt(E1² - m1²) = sqrt(199.005² - 198²). Let's compute that.

Compute 199.005²: (200 - 0.995)^2 = 200² - 2*200*0.995 + 0.995² = 40,000 - 398 + 0.990025 = 40,000 - 398 is 39,602 + 0.990025 ≈ 39,602.990025

m1² = 198² = 39,204

Therefore, p1² = 39,602.990025 - 39,204 = 398.990025

Therefore, p1 = sqrt(398.990025) ≈ 19.9747 GeV

Similarly, in the classical case, p1 = m1*v1 = 198*(1/sqrt(99)) ≈ 198/9.94987 ≈ 19.899 GeV

So the relativistic momentum is higher: ~19.975 GeV vs. ~19.899 GeV. Therefore, the velocities are slightly different. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that v is ~0.1005c in both cases. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute the velocity in the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, p1 = gamma1*m1*v1

We have p1 ≈ 19.9747 GeV

gamma1 = 1.005075

m1 = 198 GeV/c²

Therefore, v1 = p1 / (gamma1*m1) = 19.9747 / (1.005075*198) ≈ 19.9747 / 199.005 ≈ 0.1003c

In the classical case, v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005c. So they are very close, but not exactly the same. Therefore, the velocities are slightly different, leading to slightly different kinetic energies. But the main point is that in the relativistic calculation, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m, which for gamma ≈ 1.005, gives T1 ≈ 0.005*m1 = 0.005*198 = 0.99 GeV. Wait, but we calculated T1 as 1.005 GeV. Wait, no:

Wait, gamma is 1.005075, so (gamma - 1) = 0.005075. Then T1 = 0.005075*198 ≈ 1.005 GeV. Correct.

Whereas in the classical case, T1 = 0.5*m1*v1² = 0.5*198*(0.1005)^2 ≈ 0.5*198*0.0101 ≈ 0.5*198*0.0101 ≈ 0.5*2.0 ≈ 1.0 GeV. So that's why the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Therefore, the difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. Since the problem didn't specify units, but the given rest mass energy is in GeV, it's safer to provide both, but likely 0.005 GeV. However, in particle/nuclear physics, MeV is commonly used for such differences. Let me check the exact question again.

The problem says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

Since T1 is given in GeV in both cases, the difference would be 0.005 GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. The problem might expect the answer in MeV, as it's a small difference. Let me check the calculation once more to ensure.

Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV

Classical T1: 1.000 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Yes.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV. But to write it in GeV, it's 0.005 GeV. However, the problem might prefer the answer in MeV. Since the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy is ~1 GeV, 5 MeV is a small difference. Given that, and the context of nuclear physics where MeV is more common for such energy differences, I think the answer is 5 MeV. But the problem statement uses GeV, so maybe 0.005 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". It's possible that the answer is expected in GeV. Let me check the calculation once again.

Yes, relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, classical is 1 GeV, difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is correct. Alternatively, 5 MeV. But since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, in high-energy physics, sometimes "MeV" is used for smaller energies. But the problem doesn't specify. Given that, I think both are correct, but to match the units of the problem (GeV), 0.005 GeV is appropriate. However, the numerical answer is 5 MeV. Let me check with exact values.

Wait, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So both are correct. The problem might accept either, but given that the rest mass is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy is in GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV. However, 5 MeV is more precise in a way. But since the question is from a physics problem, and in such contexts, the difference might be presented in MeV. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the exact numbers again.

Wait, in the relativistic calculation, T1 was exactly 1.005 GeV. In the classical, exactly 1 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is exact. If we were to write it as 5 MeV, that's also correct, but since the original units are GeV, 0.005 GeV is more consistent. However, the problem might prefer 5 MeV. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the exact answer is 0.005 GeV, but expressed as 5 MeV. Since 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But to be safe, I can write both. But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so probably as 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Let me check if the initial problem has any clues. The initial rest mass is 300 GeV, fragments are 198 and 99 GeV. The kinetic energy T1 is about 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Given that, and since MeV is a more natural unit for such a small energy difference in nuclear physics, I think the answer is 5 MeV, so \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

But to confirm, let's see. If the problem is from a textbook, usually such differences are in MeV. But since the problem mentions "ignore the electrons", which is common in nuclear physics, where MeV is standard. So I think 5 MeV is the answer. Therefore, I will go with \boxed{5} MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So both are correct. But since the problem didn't specify, but given the context, 5 MeV is more likely. So I'll put \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}

Let’s denote v₁ and v₂ as the velocities of the fragments.\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\nm₁v₁ = m₂v₂\n198v₁ = 99v₂\nv₂ = 2v₁\n\nTotal kinetic energy in classical case:\nT_total = (1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂²\n= (1/2)(198)v₁² + (1/2)(99)(4v₁²)\n= 99v₁² + 198v₁²\n= 297v₁²\n\nThe total kinetic energy should be 3 GeV (from mass deficit), so:\n297v₁² = 3 GeV\nv₁² = 3 / 297 = 1/99 GeV\n\nBut wait, in classical physics, the units here are inconsistent. The kinetic energy in GeV would require converting velocity to units where c=1. Let me correct that.\n\nIn natural units (c=1), energy in GeV, mass in GeV/c². So, kinetic energy T = (1/2)m v² (with v in units of c). So, the calculation is correct if we consider v as a fraction of the speed of light.\n\nSo, solving for v₁²:\nv₁² = (2T₁_classical)/m₁\n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT_total = (1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂² = 3 GeV\n\nBut since v₂ = 2v₁, substitute:\n= (1/2)(198)v₁² + (1/2)(99)(4v₁²)\n= 99v₁² + 198v₁²\n= 297v₁² = 3 GeV\nv₁² = 3 / 297 = 0.0101 (unitless, since v is in terms of c)\nv₁ = sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nThen, the classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:\nT1_classical = (1/2)m₁v₁² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 0.5 * 2.0 ≈ 1.0 GeV\n\nWait, but 198 * 0.0101 = 1.9998, so 0.5 * 1.9998 ≈ 0.9999 GeV ≈ 1 GeV\n\nSo, the classical T1 is approximately 1 GeV, while the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV.

The fragments have masses 198 and 99 GeV.

Then, T1_classical = (1/2)m₁v₁² = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV. Exactly. So yes, T1_classical is exactly 1 GeV. The relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV. Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check if 0.005 GeV is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is 300 GeV. The rest masses are 198 and 99 GeV. The total rest mass is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energies are 1.005 and 1.995 GeV, which sum to 3 GeV. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using velocities. Let me compute the velocities in the relativistic case and see if the classical calculation is different.\n\nIn the relativistic case, for the heavier fragment:\n\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV, m₁ = 198 GeV\n\nSo, gamma₁ = E₁ / m₁ = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075\n\nThen, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so:\n\nsqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / gamma ≈ 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495\n\n1 - v² ≈ (0.99495)^2 ≈ 0.9899\n\nv² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101\n\nv ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nWhich matches the classical velocity. But in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 1 GeV. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma - 1)m c². So, (1.005075 - 1)*198 ≈ 0.005075 * 198 ≈ 1.005 GeV. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV. So the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in MeV, so 5 MeV. But since the original units are GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, in high-energy physics, MeV is common. Let me check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me check the step where I set E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV. Since the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, and the total energy must be conserved. The rest masses of the fragments are 198 and 99 GeV, but their total energy includes kinetic energy. So yes, E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV. Then, using conservation of momentum, which in relativity is a vector, so the magnitudes must be equal and opposite. So, the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV. But to confirm, let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV. The problem says "What is the difference...", and the initial data is in GeV, so 0.005 GeV is acceptable, but 5 MeV is also correct. However, since the problem mentions "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical...", and the T1 values are in GeV, the difference would be 0.005 GeV.

Yes, T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV, T1_classical = 1 GeV, difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But maybe the problem wants the answer in units of GeV, so 0.005 GeV. Alternatively, 5 MeV. But since the problem didn\'t specify, but the initial data is in GeV, I think 0.005 GeV is acceptable. However, in particle physics, MeV is often used for such differences. Let me check the conversion: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So both are correct. The answer is either 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. The problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}", so I\'ll go with 0.005 GeV, but check once more.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the fragments\' rest masses sum to 297 GeV. The kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, which is 3 GeV. The relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV, classical gives 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV.

The problem involves an atomic nucleus with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV undergoing fission into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio. The combined rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, resulting in a mass deficit of 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. 

**Relativistic Calculation:**
1. **Fragment Masses:**
   - \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \)

2. **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:**
   - Total energy: \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Momentum conservation: \( |p_1| = |p_2| \)

3. **Relating Energies:**
   - Using \( E_1^2 - m_1^2 = E_2^2 - m_2^2 \), we find:
     - \( E_1 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV} \)

2. **Total Kinetic Energy:**
   - \( T_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Solving gives \( v_1^2 = \frac{1}{99} \)

3. **Kinetic Energy of Heavier Fragment:**
   - \( T_{1 \text{(classical)}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

In classical physics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2)mv². Since momentum is conserved, m₁v₁ = m₂v₂. Let’s denote v₁ and v₂ as the velocities of the fragments.

From momentum conservation:
m₁v₁ = m₂v₂
198v₁ = 99v₂
v₂ = 2v₁

Total kinetic energy in classical case:
T_total = (1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂²
= (1/2)(198)v₁² + (1/2)(99)(4v₁²)
= 99v₁² + 198v₁²
= 297v₁²

The total kinetic energy should be 3 GeV (from mass deficit), so:
297v₁² = 3 GeV
v₁² = 3 / 297 = 1/99 GeV

But wait, in classical physics, the units here are inconsistent. The kinetic energy in GeV would require converting velocity to units where c=1. Let me correct that.

In natural units (c=1), energy in GeV, mass in GeV/c². So, kinetic energy T = (1/2)m v² (with v in units of c). So, the calculation is correct if we consider v as a fraction of the speed of light.

So, solving for v₁²:
v₁² = (2T₁_classical)/m₁

But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:
T_total = (1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂² = 3 GeV

But since v₂ = 2v₁, substitute:
= (1/2)(198)v₁² + (1/2)(99)(4v₁²)
= 99v₁² + 198v₁²
= 297v₁² = 3 GeV
v₁² = 3 / 297 = 0.0101 (unitless, since v is in terms of c)
v₁ = sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005 c

Then, the classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
T1_classical = (1/2)m₁v₁² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 0.5 * 2.0 ≈ 1.0 GeV

Wait, but 198 * 0.0101 = 1.9998, so 0.5 * 1.9998 ≈ 0.9999 GeV ≈ 1 GeV

So, the classical T1 is approximately 1 GeV, while the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check the exact calculation.

From the total kinetic energy in classical case:

297v₁² = 3 GeV
v₁² = 3 / 297 = 1/99 ≈ 0.010101...

Then, T1_classical = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*198/99 = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV

So exactly 1 GeV. The relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me confirm the relativistic calculation again.

From earlier steps:

E₁ = 199.005 GeV
m₁ = 198 GeV
T₁ = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But the problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But let me check if there's a mistake in units or calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the classical result more precisely. Wait, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, and the relativistic is 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV. But let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV. The question says "What is the difference...", so likely in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But maybe the answer is 0.005 GeV. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me verify.

We had:

E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV

E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV

Adding: 2E₁ = 398.01 => E₁ = 199.005 GeV

E₂ = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

T₁ = E₁ - m₁ = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T₂ = E₂ - m₂ = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

Total T = 3 GeV, which matches the mass deficit. So that's correct.

Classical calculation gives T1 = 1 GeV. So difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. The problem says "the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical...", so the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But maybe the problem expects the answer in MeV, but since the original units are GeV, perhaps 0.005 GeV. But let me check if there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the classical calculation is not exactly 1 GeV. Let me check again.

In the classical case, T_total = 3 GeV. The fragments have masses 198 and 99 GeV. Since momentum conservation gives m₁v₁ = m₂v₂, so 198v₁ = 99v₂ => v₂ = 2v₁.

Total kinetic energy:

T = (1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂² = (1/2)(198)v₁² + (1/2)(99)(4v₁²) = 99v₁² + 198v₁² = 297v₁² = 3 GeV

So, v₁² = 3 / 297 = 1/99. Then, T1_classical = (1/2)m₁v₁² = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV. Exactly. So yes, T1_classical is exactly 1 GeV. The relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV. Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check if 0.005 GeV is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is 300 GeV. The rest masses are 198 and 99 GeV. The total rest mass is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energies are 1.005 and 1.995 GeV, which sum to 3 GeV. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps using velocities. Let me compute the velocities in the relativistic case and see if the classical calculation is different.

In the relativistic case, for the heavier fragment:

E₁ = 199.005 GeV, m₁ = 198 GeV

So, gamma₁ = E₁ / m₁ = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so:

sqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / gamma ≈ 1 / 1.005075 ≈ 0.99495

1 - v² ≈ (0.99495)^2 ≈ 0.9899

v² ≈ 1 - 0.9899 = 0.0101

v ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005 c

Which matches the classical velocity. But in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.0101 ≈ 1 GeV. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma - 1)m c². So, (1.005075 - 1)*198 ≈ 0.005075 * 198 ≈ 1.005 GeV. So that's correct.

Therefore, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV. So the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in MeV, so 5 MeV. But since the original units are GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. However, in high-energy physics, MeV is common. Let me check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me check the step where I set E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV. Since the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, and the total energy must be conserved. The rest masses of the fragments are 198 and 99 GeV, but their total energy includes kinetic energy. So yes, E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV. Then, using conservation of momentum, which in relativity is a vector, so the magnitudes must be equal and opposite. So, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV. But to confirm, let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV. The problem says "What is the difference...", and the initial data is in GeV, so 0.005 GeV is acceptable, but 5 MeV is also correct. However, since the problem mentions "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical...", and the T1 values are in GeV, the difference would be 0.005 GeV. But maybe the answer is 5 MeV. Let me check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in GeV, so 0.005 GeV. But let me check if the calculation is correct. Yes, T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV, T1_classical = 1 GeV, difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But maybe the problem wants the answer in units of GeV, so 0.005 GeV. Alternatively, 5 MeV. But since the problem didn't specify, but the initial data is in GeV, I think 0.005 GeV is acceptable. However, in particle physics, MeV is often used for such differences. Let me check the conversion: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So both are correct. The answer is either 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. The problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so I'll go with 0.005 GeV, but check once more.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the initial mass is 300 GeV, and the fragments' rest masses sum to 297 GeV. The kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, which is 3 GeV. The relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV, classical gives 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. Alternatively, 5 MeV. But since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. But let me check if the problem expects units. The problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical...", so the units would be GeV. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0.005} GeV. But maybe the problem expects it in MeV, so \boxed{5} MeV. However, since the problem didn't specify, but the given data is in GeV, I think 0.005 GeV is correct. But to be safe, perhaps convert to MeV. 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So, either is correct, but I'll go with 5 MeV as the more precise unit for such a small difference. So, the answer is \boxed{5} MeV.

Wait, but in the classical case, the kinetic energy would be calculated based on the velocities, but the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy released is 3 GeV. However, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy would be calculated using the classical formula, but the actual energy comes from the rest mass difference. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. However, in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². But if we use the same rest mass difference (3 GeV), but compute T1 and T2 classically, how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated using the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but in the classical approach, the kinetic energy would be calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy available for kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy would be the same 3 GeV? Wait, but in the classical case, the kinetic energy is not related to the rest mass difference. Wait, perhaps the problem is that in reality, the rest mass difference is converted into kinetic energy, but in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated using the classical formulas. So, perhaps the problem is that the rest mass difference is 3 GeV, which in reality is converted into kinetic energy (relativistic), but in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², which would not account for the rest mass difference. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference (3 GeV), but in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated using the classical formulas, which would not account for the rest mass difference. Wait, but how is the kinetic energy determined in the classical case? If the rest mass is converted into kinetic energy, but classically, mass is conserved. So, perhaps the problem is that in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², but the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV. So, the same total kinetic energy, but the distribution between T1 and T2 is different. Therefore, the problem is to compute T1 in the relativistic case (1.005 GeV) and T1 in the classical case (using classical mechanics with the same total kinetic energy of 3 GeV), then find the difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated based on the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but the total kinetic energy is not 3 GeV. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference. However, in classical physics, mass is conserved, so the rest mass would not change. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that in the classical approximation, the rest masses are considered to be the same as the original nucleus, but that\'s not the case here. Wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So, in reality, the rest mass is not conserved, but in the classical approximation, perhaps the rest mass is considered to be conserved? Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the rest mass of the system decreases by 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. In the classical case, the rest mass is considered to be conserved (so the rest masses of the fragments sum to 300 GeV), but the kinetic energy is calculated classically. But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so 297 GeV. Therefore, in the problem, the rest mass is not conserved, which is a relativistic effect. So, in the classical approximation, perhaps the rest mass is considered to be conserved (summing to 300 GeV), but the problem says that the sum is 297 GeV. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that even in the classical calculation, the rest masses are 198 GeV and 99 GeV, but the kinetic energy is calculated classically. Then, the total kinetic energy would be different. Wait, but the problem says that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 297 GeV. Therefore, the available kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. In the classical case, if we use the same rest masses (198 and 99 GeV), then the kinetic energy would be calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², but the total kinetic energy would be 3 GeV. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the classical case, the rest masses are considered to be 198 and 99 GeV, but the kinetic energy is calculated using classical mechanics. So, the problem is to compute T1 in both cases and find the difference.\n\nSo, in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV. In the classical case, we need to compute T1 using classical mechanics. Let\'s proceed.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the total momentum is zero, so m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => 2*v1 = v2.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2². Substitute m1 = 2*m2 and v2 = 2*v1:\n\nT = (1/2)*(2*m2)*v1² + (1/2)*m2*(2*v1)^2 = m2*v1² + (1/2)*m2*4*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1²\n\nBut the total kinetic energy T is given as 3 GeV (since the rest mass difference is 3 GeV). Therefore:\n\n3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV\n\nBut m2 is 99 GeV (since m2 = 99 GeV). Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is in kg, but here we are using GeV for mass. Wait, but in natural units (c=1), mass and energy are in the same units. However, in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but with c=1, velocity is in units of c. So, if we are to use GeV for mass, then velocity is unitless (v/c), and kinetic energy would be (1/2)m(v/c)². But since we are using natural units (c=1), then the classical kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², where v is in units of c. However, in the problem, the rest mass energies are given in GeV, so m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Therefore, to compute kinetic energy in GeV, we need to use T = (1/2)(m/c²)v², but since c=1, T = (1/2)m v², where v is in units of c. Therefore, m is in GeV/c², and T is in GeV.\n\nBut in the problem, m1 and m2 are given in GeV (rest mass energy), so m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².\n\nSo, in the classical case, T = (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². With m1 = 2m2, and v2 = 2v1, then:\n\nT = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2v1² + 2m2v1² = 3m2v1²\n\nBut T is given as 3 GeV (the same as the relativistic case). Therefore:\n\n3m2v1² = 3 GeV\n\nm2 = 99 GeV/c², so:\n\n3*(99 GeV/c²)*v1² = 3 GeV\n\nDivide both sides by 3 GeV:\n\n(99 GeV/c²)*v1² / GeV = 1\n\nSimplify units: GeV cancels, so (99/c²)*v1² = 1\n\nBut in natural units, c=1, so 99*v1² = 1 => v1² = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 (in units of c)\n\nThen, T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1v1² = (1/2)*198 GeV*(1/99) = (1/2)*198/99 = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV\n\nWait, that\'s interesting. So, in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, and in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check this again.\n\nGiven m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².\n\nIn classical mechanics, with momentum conservation:\n\nm1*v1 = m2*v2\n\nv2 = (m1/m2)*v1 = 2*v1\n\nTotal kinetic energy:\n\nT = (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2² = (1/2)*198*v1² + (1/2)*99*(2v1)^2\n\n= 99*v1² + (1/2)*99*4*v1² = 99*v1² + 198*v1² = 297*v1²\n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so:\n\n297*v1² = 3 GeV\n\nv1² = 3 / 297 = 1/99\n\nv1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c\n\nThen, T1 (classical) = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So, the classical calculation gives T1 = 1 GeV, and the relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. But the problem asks for the difference in T1 values. So, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check the relativistic calculation again. The relativistic T1 was found to be 1.005 GeV. Let\'s confirm:\n\nE1 = 199.005 GeV\n\nm1 = 198 GeV\n\nT1 = E1 - m1 = 1.005 GeV\n\nYes. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV. But let me check if the units are correct. The problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let\'s redo the steps:\n\nGiven m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV.\n\nTotal energy: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nMomentum conservation: p1 = p2 (magnitude)\n\nRelativistic momentum: p = sqrt(E² - m²)\n\nSo, sqrt(E1² - 198²) = sqrt(E2² - 99²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nE1² - 198² = E2² - 99²\n\nBut E2 = 300 - E1\n\nSubstitute:\n\nE1² - 198² = (300 - E1)^2 - 99²\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(300^2 - 600E1 + E1²) - 99²\n\nSo:\n\nE1² - 198² = 300² - 600E1 + E1² - 99²\n\nCancel E1²:\n\n-198² = 300² - 600E1 - 99²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n600E1 = 300² - 99² + 198²\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n300² = 90,000\n\n99² = 9,801\n\n198² = 39,204\n\nSo:\n\n600E1 = 90,000 - 9,801 + 39,204 = 90,000 + 29,403 = 119,403\n\nTherefore:\n\nE1 = 119,403 / 600 ≈ 199.005 GeV\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Then T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. So, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 MeV. The problem might expect the answer in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Since the question doesn\'t specify units, but the original values are in GeV, it\'s safer to present it in GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, which is a more standard unit for such small energy differences. But let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" It doesn\'t specify units, but since the original T1 is in GeV, the answer is 0.005 GeV. However, in particle physics, MeV is commonly used, so 5 MeV. But the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the classical calculation. Let\'s verify:\n\nIn classical mechanics, T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV, totaling 3 GeV.

The problem involves an atomic nucleus of mass \( M = 300 \) GeV undergoing fission into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \). The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, giving \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \) GeV. Solving for \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \):

\[
3m_2 = 297 \implies m_2 = 99 \text{ GeV} \implies m_1 = 198 \text{ GeV}
\]

Using conservation of energy and momentum, the relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment is calculated. The total energy of the system is 300 GeV, and the momentum conservation gives:

\[
\sqrt{E_1^2 - m_1^2} = \sqrt{E_2^2 - m_2^2}
\]

Solving the system of equations:

\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \text{ GeV}
\]
\[
E_1^2 - E_2^2 = m_1^2 - m_2^2
\]

Substituting \( m_1 = 198 \) GeV and \( m_2 = 99 \) GeV:

\[
E_1 - E_2 = \frac{198^2 - 99^2}{300} = 98.01 \text{ GeV}
\]

Solving for \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):

\[
E_1 = 199.005 \text{ GeV}, \quad E_2 = 100.995 \text{ GeV}
\]

The relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) is:

\[
T_1 = E_1 - m_1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \text{ GeV}
\]

For the classical calculation, using momentum conservation \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \) and kinetic energy \( T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 \):

\[
2m_2 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \implies v_2 = 2v_1
\]
\[
T = 3m_2 v_1^2 = 3 \text{ GeV} \implies v_1^2 = \frac{1}{99}
\]

The classical kinetic energy \( T_1 \) is:

\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 198 \times \frac{1}{99} = 1 \text{ GeV}
\]

The difference between the relativistic and classical \( T_1 \):

\[
1.005 \text{ GeV} - 1 \text{ GeV} = 0.005 \text{ GeV}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0.005}
\]

In the classical case, since momentum is conserved:

m1*v1 = m2*v2

But since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => 2*v1 = v2

Total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2²

But T = 3 GeV (since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, as per the rest mass difference). Wait, but in the classical case, the kinetic energy would be calculated based on the velocities, but the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy released is 3 GeV. However, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy would be calculated using the classical formula, but the actual energy comes from the rest mass difference. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. However, in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². But if we use the same rest mass difference (3 GeV), but compute T1 and T2 classically, how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated using the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, but in the classical approach, the kinetic energy would be calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². However, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the energy available for kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy would be the same 3 GeV? Wait, but in the classical case, the kinetic energy is not related to the rest mass difference. Wait, perhaps the problem is that in reality, the rest mass difference is converted into kinetic energy, but in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated using the classical formulas. So, perhaps the problem is that the rest mass difference is 3 GeV, which in reality is converted into kinetic energy (relativistic), but in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², which would not account for the rest mass difference. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference (3 GeV), but in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated using the classical formulas, which would not account for the rest mass difference. Wait, but how is the kinetic energy determined in the classical case? If the rest mass is converted into kinetic energy, but classically, mass is conserved. So, perhaps the problem is that in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², but the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV. So, the same total kinetic energy, but the distribution between T1 and T2 is different. Therefore, the problem is to compute T1 in the relativistic case (1.005 GeV) and T1 in the classical case (using classical mechanics with the same total kinetic energy of 3 GeV), then find the difference.

Alternatively, maybe in the classical case, the kinetic energy is calculated based on the velocities derived from momentum conservation, but the total kinetic energy is not 3 GeV. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference. However, in classical physics, mass is conserved, so the rest mass would not change. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that in the classical approximation, the rest masses are considered to be the same as the original nucleus, but that's not the case here. Wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So, in reality, the rest mass is not conserved, but in the classical approximation, perhaps the rest mass is considered to be conserved? Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the rest mass of the system decreases by 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. In the classical case, the rest mass is considered to be conserved (so the rest masses of the fragments sum to 300 GeV), but the kinetic energy is calculated classically. But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, so 297 GeV. Therefore, in the problem, the rest mass is not conserved, which is a relativistic effect. So, in the classical approximation, perhaps the rest mass is considered to be conserved (summing to 300 GeV), but the problem says that the sum is 297 GeV. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that even in the classical calculation, the rest masses are 198 GeV and 99 GeV, but the kinetic energy is calculated classically. Then, the total kinetic energy would be different. Wait, but the problem says that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so 297 GeV. Therefore, the available kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. In the classical case, if we use the same rest masses (198 and 99 GeV), then the kinetic energy would be calculated as (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2², but the total kinetic energy would be 3 GeV. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe in the classical case, the rest masses are considered to be 198 and 99 GeV, but the kinetic energy is calculated using classical mechanics. So, the problem is to compute T1 in both cases and find the difference.

So, in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV. In the classical case, we need to compute T1 using classical mechanics. Let's proceed.

In classical mechanics, the total momentum is zero, so m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => 2*v1 = v2.

The total kinetic energy is T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2². Substitute m1 = 2*m2 and v2 = 2*v1:

T = (1/2)*(2*m2)*v1² + (1/2)*m2*(2*v1)^2 = m2*v1² + (1/2)*m2*4*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1²

But the total kinetic energy T is given as 3 GeV (since the rest mass difference is 3 GeV). Therefore:

3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV

But m2 is 99 GeV (since m2 = 99 GeV). Wait, but in classical mechanics, mass is in kg, but here we are using GeV for mass. Wait, but in natural units (c=1), mass and energy are in the same units. However, in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but with c=1, velocity is in units of c. So, if we are to use GeV for mass, then velocity is unitless (v/c), and kinetic energy would be (1/2)m(v/c)². But since we are using natural units (c=1), then the classical kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², where v is in units of c. However, in the problem, the rest mass energies are given in GeV, so m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Therefore, to compute kinetic energy in GeV, we need to use T = (1/2)(m/c²)v², but since c=1, T = (1/2)m v², where v is in units of c. Therefore, m is in GeV/c², and T is in GeV.

But in the problem, m1 and m2 are given in GeV (rest mass energy), so m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².

So, in the classical case, T = (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2². With m1 = 2m2, and v2 = 2v1, then:

T = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2v1² + 2m2v1² = 3m2v1²

But T is given as 3 GeV (the same as the relativistic case). Therefore:

3m2v1² = 3 GeV

m2 = 99 GeV/c², so:

3*(99 GeV/c²)*v1² = 3 GeV

Divide both sides by 3 GeV:

(99 GeV/c²)*v1² / GeV = 1

Simplify units: GeV cancels, so (99/c²)*v1² = 1

But in natural units, c=1, so 99*v1² = 1 => v1² = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 (in units of c)

Then, T1 (classical) = (1/2)m1v1² = (1/2)*198 GeV*(1/99) = (1/2)*198/99 = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV

Wait, that's interesting. So, in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, and in the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check this again.

Given m1 = 198 GeV/c², m2 = 99 GeV/c².

In classical mechanics, with momentum conservation:

m1*v1 = m2*v2

v2 = (m1/m2)*v1 = 2*v1

Total kinetic energy:

T = (1/2)m1v1² + (1/2)m2v2² = (1/2)*198*v1² + (1/2)*99*(2v1)^2

= 99*v1² + (1/2)*99*4*v1² = 99*v1² + 198*v1² = 297*v1²

But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so:

297*v1² = 3 GeV

v1² = 3 / 297 = 1/99

v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c

Then, T1 (classical) = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV

Yes, that's correct. So, the classical calculation gives T1 = 1 GeV, and the relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. But the problem asks for the difference in T1 values. So, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me check the relativistic calculation again. The relativistic T1 was found to be 1.005 GeV. Let's confirm:

E1 = 199.005 GeV

m1 = 198 GeV

T1 = E1 - m1 = 1.005 GeV

Yes. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV. But let me check if the units are correct. The problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So, the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me check if there's a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let's redo the steps:

Given m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV.

Total energy: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

Momentum conservation: p1 = p2 (magnitude)

Relativistic momentum: p = sqrt(E² - m²)

So, sqrt(E1² - 198²) = sqrt(E2² - 99²)

Square both sides:

E1² - 198² = E2² - 99²

But E2 = 300 - E1

Substitute:

E1² - 198² = (300 - E1)^2 - 99²

Expand the right side:

(300^2 - 600E1 + E1²) - 99²

So:

E1² - 198² = 300² - 600E1 + E1² - 99²

Cancel E1²:

-198² = 300² - 600E1 - 99²

Bring all terms to one side:

600E1 = 300² - 99² + 198²

Calculate each term:

300² = 90,000

99² = 9,801

198² = 39,204

So:

600E1 = 90,000 - 9,801 + 39,204 = 90,000 + 29,403 = 119,403

Therefore:

E1 = 119,403 / 600 ≈ 199.005 GeV

Yes, that's correct. Then T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. So, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV. The problem might expect the answer in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Since the question doesn't specify units, but the original values are in GeV, it's safer to present it in GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, which is a more standard unit for such small energy differences. But let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" It doesn't specify units, but since the original T1 is in GeV, the answer is 0.005 GeV. However, in particle physics, MeV is commonly used, so 5 MeV. But the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the classical calculation. Let's verify:

In classical mechanics, T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV, totaling 3 GeV. But in reality, T1 = 1.005 GeV, T2 = 1.995 GeV. The difference for T1 is 0.005 GeV. So, yes, 0.005 GeV is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. Since the problem mentions "the difference", and the options might prefer one unit over the other, but given that the original T1 is in GeV, and the difference is small, 0.005 GeV is correct. However, in high-energy physics, 5 MeV is a standard unit. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the problem statement again: it says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But to write it as 5 MeV is also correct. However, since the problem uses GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV is better. But let me check if 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Yes, 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Both are correct, but the problem might expect the answer in MeV. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.005 GeV. But in the problem statement, the rest mass energies are given in GeV, so the answer in GeV is appropriate. However, 5 MeV is more precise. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.

Yes, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV. So, 0.005 GeV is the answer. But converting to MeV, it's 5 MeV. Since the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and the answer is likely expected in GeV, but 5 MeV is more natural. However, the problem might accept both.
