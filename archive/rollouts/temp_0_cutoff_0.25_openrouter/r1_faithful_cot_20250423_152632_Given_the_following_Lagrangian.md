The mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) in the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) is determined by ensuring the total mass dimension of the term is 4 (the required dimension for a Lagrangian density in 4D spacetime). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Field dimensions**:
   - The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) (and \(\bar{\psi}\)) has mass dimension \(3/2\).
   - The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \(2\).
   - The matrix \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless.

2. **Total dimension of the interaction term**:
   \[
   [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
   \]
   To make the Lagrangian term have dimension 4, \(\kappa\) must compensate by contributing \([ \kappa ] = -1\).

**Conclusion**: The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is **-1**.

**Renormalizability**: A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \(\kappa\) has a negative mass dimension (\(-1\)), the interaction term introduces non-renormalizable divergences. Thus, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

**Final Answer**  
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(\boxed{-1}\), and the theory is not renormalizable.

Okay, so I need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in the given Lagrangian interaction term, and then determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me start by recalling some basics about dimensional analysis in quantum field theory. 

First, the Lagrangian density in quantum field theory has a mass dimension of 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime because the action S, which is the integral of the Lagrangian over all spacetime, is dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 to keep the action dimensionless. 

The given interaction Lagrangian is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break down the dimensions of each part. 

Starting with the fields: 

1. The Dirac field ψ: In 4D, the mass dimension of a spinor field ψ is 3/2. This is because the kinetic term for the Dirac field is i\bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension 1 + [ψ]. Then, the term \bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension [ψ] + 1 + [ψ] = 2[ψ] + 1. Setting this equal to 4 gives 2[ψ] + 1 = 4 ⇒ [ψ] = 3/2. So both ψ and \bar{ψ} have mass dimension 3/2 each.

2. The electromagnetic field tensor F^{μν}: The field strength tensor F^{μν} is defined as ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. The gauge field A^μ has mass dimension 1, since the kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is -(1/4) F^{μν} F_{μν}, which must have dimension 4. Each F_{μν} has two derivatives (each of dimension 1) acting on A^μ (dimension 1), so F_{μν} has dimension 2. Therefore, [F^{μν}] = 2.

3. The σ_{μν} matrix: σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless in 4D because they are just constant matrices (they don't depend on spacetime coordinates or momenta). The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Therefore, [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Putting it all together, the interaction term is κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's compute the total mass dimension of this term. 

The product \bar{ψ} ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then, multiplying by σ_{μν} (dimension 0) doesn't change the dimension. Then multiplying by F^{μν} (dimension 2) gives a total dimension of 3 + 2 = 5. 

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Therefore, the coupling constant κ must compensate for the excess dimension. The interaction term must have dimension 4, so:

[κ] + [\bar{ψ}] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = 4

Plugging in the known dimensions:

[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4

Adding those up: 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, and 3 + 2 = 5. So:

[κ] + 5 = 4 ⇒ [κ] = -1

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. 

Now, for renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because, in 4D spacetime, the superficial degree of divergence D of a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - L*4 - Σ_i (4 - d_i - n_i), where L is the number of loops, d_i is the mass dimension of each coupling, and n_i is the number of times the coupling appears. Wait, maybe I need to recall the standard formula for superficial degree of divergence. 

Alternatively, the standard formula for D in 4D is:

D = 4L - (I - V)

But perhaps a better approach is to use the criterion that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have mass dimensions such that the interaction terms have dimensions less than or equal to 4. Wait, actually, the standard rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all interaction terms have mass dimension 4 (since in 4D spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4). If the interaction terms have higher dimensions, then the coupling constants have negative mass dimensions, leading to non-renormalizable interactions. 

Wait, let me recall: In 4D, the renormalizability is determined by the dimension of the coupling constants. For an interaction term of the form g φ^n, the dimension of g is 4 - n*[φ]. For a scalar field, [φ] = 1, so [g] = 4 - n. If [g] ≥ 0, then the interaction is renormalizable (if [g] = 0, it's marginal, i.e., renormalizable; if [g] > 0, it's super-renormalizable). If [g] < 0, the interaction is non-renormalizable. 

In our case, the interaction term is not a simple φ^n term, but let's see. The interaction term here is dimension 5 (as we calculated before considering κ), so to make the total dimension 4, κ must have dimension -1. Since κ has negative mass dimension, the interaction is non-renormalizable by power counting. 

Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling constant κ has a negative mass dimension. 

Wait, but let me check again. The interaction term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The given interaction term without κ would have dimension 5, so κ must have dimension -1 to make the total dimension 4. But interactions with coupling constants of negative mass dimension lead to non-renormalizable theories. 

Yes, that's the standard result. For example, Fermi's theory of the weak interaction has a four-fermion interaction term with a coupling constant of dimension -2, which is non-renormalizable. Similarly, here, since κ has dimension -1, the interaction is non-renormalizable. 

Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Setting this equal to 4 gives 2[ψ] + 1 = 4 ⇒ [ψ] = 3/2. So both ψ and \bar{ψ} have mass dimension 3/2 each.

Alright, I need to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in the specified Lagrangian interaction term, and then analyze whether the theory is renormalizable. I'll start by reviewing some fundamental concepts about dimensional analysis in quantum field theory.

In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action S, which integrates the Lagrangian over all spacetime, needs to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). Therefore, every term in the Lagrangian must possess a mass dimension of 4 to maintain a dimensionless action.

The interaction Lagrangian under consideration is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I'll analyze the dimensions of each component.

For the fields involved:

1. The Dirac field ψ: In 4D spacetime, a spinor field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. This can be verified by examining the kinetic term of the Dirac field, i\bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Since the derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension 1 + [ψ]. Thus, the term \bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension [ψ] + 1 + [ψ] = 2[ψ] + 1. Setting this equal to 4 gives 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, which yields [ψ] = 3/2. Consequently, both ψ and \bar{ψ} each have a mass dimension of 3/2.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in the specified Lagrangian interaction term and assess the renormalizability of the theory, let's begin by reviewing some fundamental aspects of dimensional analysis in quantum field theory.

In a 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action S, obtained by integrating the Lagrangian over all of spacetime, is dimensionless when using natural units (ħ = c = 1). Therefore, each component in the Lagrangian must also possess a mass dimension of 4 to ensure the action remains dimensionless.

The specified interaction Lagrangian is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let’s analyze the dimensions of each segment:

1. The Dirac field ψ: Within a 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a spinor field ψ is 3/2. The reasoning is that the kinetic term for the Dirac field is i\bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must be dimension 4. As the derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, γ^μ ∂_μ ψ consequently has dimension 1 + [ψ]. Consequently, \bar{ψ} γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has a mass dimension of [ψ] + 1 + [ψ] = 2[ψ] + 1. Equating this to dimension 4, we solve 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, yielding [ψ] = 3/2. Thus, both ψ and \bar{ψ} possess a mass dimension of 3/2 respectively.

2. The electromagnetic field tensor F^{μν}: The field strength tensor F^{μν} is defined by ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, where the gauge field A.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) in the given Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\), we start by analyzing the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction term.

1. **Dirac field \(\psi\)**: The mass dimension of a spinor field \(\psi\) in 4-dimensional spacetime is \(3/2\). This is derived from the kinetic term \(i\bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi\), which must have a total mass dimension of 4. The derivative \(\partial_\mu\) has mass dimension 1, leading to the conclusion that \(\psi\) has mass dimension \(3/2\).

2. **Electromagnetic field tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\)**: The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is constructed from the gauge field \(A^\mu\), which has mass dimension 1. Since \(F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu\), each term involves a derivative (dimension 1) and a gauge field (dimension 1), giving \(F^{\mu\nu}\) a mass dimension of 2.

3. **Sigma matrices \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\)**: The matrices \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\) are dimensionless because the gamma matrices \(\gamma_\mu\) are constants and do not contribute to the mass dimension.

Putting these together, the interaction term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has a total mass dimension calculated as follows:
- Each \(\psi\) and \(\bar{\psi}\) contributes \(3/2\), so together they contribute \(3/2 + 3/2 = 3\).
- The field tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) contributes 2.
- The sigma matrices \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) contribute 0.

Thus, the total mass dimension of the term without \(\kappa\) is \(3 + 2 = 5\). Since the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4, the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must compensate by having a mass dimension of \(4 - 5 = -1\).

Regarding renormalizability, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \(\kappa\) has a mass dimension of \(-1\), which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \boxed{-1} and the theory is not renormalizable.

ld A^μ has mass dimension 1, since the kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is -(1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}, which must have dimension 4. Each F_{μν} has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

3. The sigma matrices σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless in 4D spacetime because they are just constant matrices (they don't depend on spacetime coordinates or momenta). The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Therefore, σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

Putting this all together, the interaction term is κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's compute the total mass dimension of this term. 

Each ψ and \bar{ψ} has dimension 3/2, so together they contribute 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. The σ_{μν} is 0, and F^{μν} is 2. So the total dimension of the term without κ is 3 (from the spinors) + 2 (from F) = 5. Since the entire Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant κ must compensate for the excess. That is, the dimension of κ plus 5 must equal 4. Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is 4 - 5 = -1. So [κ] = -1.

Wait, but mass dimensions are usually positive? Hmm, but coupling constants can have negative mass dimensions. For example, in Fermi's theory of weak interactions, the coupling constant has dimension -2. So a dimension of -1 is possible here. Let me check again.

Yes, the calculation seems right. The term has dimension 5 without κ, so κ must have dimension -1 to make the total dimension 4. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? 

Renormalizability in 4D depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. If a coupling has negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable by power counting. 

Since κ here has mass dimension -1, which is negative, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. 

Wait, but let me recall: the general rule is that in 4D, a term in the Lagrangian with coupling constant of mass dimension [g] will lead to a renormalizable theory if [g] ≥ 0. If [g] < 0, the theory is non-renormalizable. 

So in this case, since κ has [κ] = -1 < 0, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable.

But let me think again. Another way to check renormalizability is to compute the superficial degree of divergence for the diagrams. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the criterion is that for a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ^n (∂)^m, the mass dimension of g must be 4 - n*(dimension of φ) - m. If that's non-negative, then the term is renormalizable. 

But in our case, the interaction term is κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the fields involved are two spinors (each of dimension 3/2) and one F^{μν} (dimension 2). So the product of the fields has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the coupling κ must have dimension 4 - 5 = -1. 

Since κ has negative dimension, the interaction is non-renormalizable. 

Alternatively, another way to see is that operators of mass dimension higher than 4 lead to non-renormalizable theories. But here, the operator \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} has dimension 5, which is higher than 4, so it's a dimension 5 operator, which is non-renormalizable. Therefore, the coupling κ must have dimension -1 to make the total dimension 4. 

So yes, the conclusion is that κ has mass dimension -1 and the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait a second. The operator is of dimension 5, but the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the coupling constant must have dimension -1. But in 4D, operators of dimension higher than 4 are called irrelevant (in the Wilsonian sense) and lead to non-renormalizable theories. So that's consistent. 

Therefore, the answer is that κ has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Final Answer**
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \boxed{-1} and the theory is not renormalizable.

This is because, in 4D, the superficial degree of divergence D of a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - L*4 - Σ_i (4 - [O_i]), where L is the number of loops and [O_i] are the dimensions of the interaction terms. However, a more straightforward approach is to recall that for a term in the Lagrangian with n fields and m derivatives, the mass dimension of the coupling constant is 4 - n*(sum of the dimensions of the fields) - m.

The mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) in the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) is determined by ensuring the total dimension of the term equals 4 (the spacetime dimension). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Field Dimensions**:
   - Spinor field \(\psi\): \([ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}\),
   - Field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\): \([ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 2\),
   - Sigma matrices \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\): Dimensionless (\([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] = 0\)).

2. **Dimensional Analysis**:
   \[
   [\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4 \implies [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
   \]
   Solving gives \([\kappa] = -1\).

**Renormalizability**: A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \(\kappa\) has a mass dimension of \(-1\), the interaction term is **non-renormalizable**. This negative dimension implies that higher-order loop corrections generate divergences requiring an infinite number of counterterms, violating renormalizability.

**Final Answer**:
- The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).
- The theory is **not renormalizable**.

A^μ has a mass dimension of 1, as seen from the Maxwell kinetic term, (F_{μν})^2, which must have dimension 4. Since F_{μν} is constructed from derivatives of A^μ, each F_{μν} term has dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1 and A^μ is dimension 1, so ∂A has dimension 2). Therefore, F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

3. The sigma matrices σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]: The gamma matrices γ_μ are dimensionless in 4D spacetime. This is because they are essentially constant matrices that satisfy the Clifford algebra {γ_μ, γ_ν} = 2g_{μν}, and the metric tensor g_{μν} is dimensionless. Therefore, the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless, and multiplying by i/2 doesn't change the dimension. Hence, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, with mass dimension 0.

Putting it all together, the interaction term κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have a total mass dimension of 4. Let's compute the sum of the dimensions of each part:

- [κ] (the coupling constant) is what we need to find.
- [\bar{ψ}] = 3/2
- [σ_{μν}] = 0
- [ψ] = 3/2
- [F^{μν}] = 2

Adding these up: [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 5. This must equal 4, so:

[κ] + 5 = 4 ⇒ [κ] = -1.

Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, moving on to the question of renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because, in 4D, the superficial degree of divergence D of a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - L*4 - Σ_i (4 - [O_i]), where L is the number of loops and [O_i] are the dimensions of the interaction terms. However, a more straightforward approach is to recall that for a term in the Lagrangian with n fields and m derivatives, the mass dimension of the coupling constant is 4 - n*(sum of the dimensions of the fields) - m. For renormalizability, the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.

In our case, κ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the interaction term is non-renormalizable by power counting. This means that this theory would require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb all possible divergences, making it non-renormalizable.

To confirm, let's recall that in 4D, renormalizable interactions have coupling constants with mass dimensions ≥ 0. For example:

- Yukawa coupling (dimension 0): g \bar{ψ} ψ φ, where [g] = 0 (since [ψ] = 3/2, [φ] = 1; 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4, so [g] = 4 - 4 = 0)
- Scalar φ^4: λ φ^4, [λ] = 0 (since 4*1 = 4, so [λ] = 4 - 4 = 0)
- Electromagnetic interaction: e \bar{ψ} γ^μ ψ A_μ, [e] = 0 (3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4, so [e] = 0)
- Fermi's theory of weak interactions: G_F (\bar{ψ} ψ)^2, [G_F] = -2 (since 4*(3/2) = 6, so [G_F] = 4 - 6 = -2; non-renormalizable)

Our case here is similar to Fermi's theory but with a different structure. The coupling κ has dimension -1, which is better than Fermi's -2, but still negative. Therefore, the interaction term is non-renormalizable.

Another way to see this is to note that the interaction term is of the form ψ ψ F, which in terms of fields is two spinors and a field strength tensor. The field strength tensor is a derivative of the gauge field, so it's like having two spinors and two derivatives (since F ~ ∂A). But even if we consider F as a separate entity, the combination of two spinors (each 3/2) and F (dimension 2) gives a total of 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5, so the coupling must compensate with dimension -1 to get to 4. Since the coupling is dimension -1, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Therefore, the conclusion is that κ has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

The mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) in the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) is determined by ensuring the total mass dimension of the term equals 4 (the dimension of the Lagrangian density in 4 spacetime dimensions). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Fields and Tensors**:
   - The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([\psi] = \frac{3}{2}\).
   - The electromagnetic field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([F^{\mu\nu}] = 2\).
   - The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\) is dimensionless (\([\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0\)).

2. **Dimensional Analysis**:
   The interaction term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has total mass dimension:
   \[
   [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
   \]
   For the Lagrangian density to have mass dimension 4, the coupling \(\kappa\) must compensate:
   \[
   [\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
   \]

3. **Renormalizability**:
   A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\) (negative), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**. This means the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences and is only valid as an effective field theory below some energy cutoff.

**Final Answer**:
- The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).
- The theory is **not renormalizable**.

The mass dimension of A is 1, as the kinetic term for the gauge field is -(1/4) F^{μν} F_{μν}, which must be dimension 4. Each F^{μν} has two derivatives (each of dimension 1) acting on A (dimension 1), so F^{μν} has mass dimension 2. Therefore, [F^{μν}] = 2.

3. The sigma matrix σ_{μν}: The sigma matrices are defined as σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since the gamma matrices γ_μ are dimensionless (they are constant matrices with no dependence on spacetime coordinates or energy-momentum scales), their commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. The factor of i/2 is a numerical coefficient and does not affect the mass dimension. Therefore, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Now, combining these components in the interaction term:

L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}

The mass dimension of each part is:

- [\bar{ψ}] = 3/2
- [σ_{μν}] = 0
- [ψ] = 3/2
- [F^{μν}] = 2

Multiplying these together (and adding dimensions since multiplication corresponds to addition in exponents), the total dimension of the product \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} is:

3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 5

Since the entire Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant κ must compensate for the excess dimension. Let [κ] denote the mass dimension of κ. Then:

[κ] + 5 = 4 ⇒ [κ] = -1

Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Next, to determine whether the theory is renormalizable, we need to consider the renormalizability criteria. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because operators (interaction terms) with coupling constants of non-negative dimensions become less significant at lower energy scales (infrared) and do not introduce new divergences that require an infinite number of counterterms. Conversely, couplings with negative mass dimensions correspond to non-renormalizable interactions, as they become more significant at higher energies, leading to the necessity of an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences, rendering the theory non-renormalizable.

In this case, κ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the interaction term is non-renormalizable by power counting. This implies that the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to renormalize, making it non-renormalizable.

To confirm this conclusion, we can recall that in 4 dimensions, renormalizable interactions are those with coupling constants of mass dimension ≥ 0. For example:

- Yukawa coupling (dimension 0): Renormalizable.
- Scalar φ^4 coupling (dimension 0): Renormalizable.
- Electromagnetic coupling (dimension 0): Renormalizable.
- Fermi's theory of weak interactions (coupling with dimension -2): Non-renormalizable.

Since κ here has dimension -1, which is better (less negative) than Fermi's coupling but still negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. This suggests that the theory is an effective field theory valid up to some energy scale where the interaction becomes strong, but it cannot be a fundamental theory valid at all energy scales.

Additionally, the interaction term \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} is a dimension-5 operator. In 4-dimensional spacetime, operators of dimension higher than 4 are non-renormalizable. The dimension of the operator is calculated as the sum of the dimensions of the fields and derivatives involved. Here, the operator has dimension 5 (as calculated earlier), which is higher than 4, confirming that it is a non-renormalizable interaction.

Therefore, the coupling constant κ has a mass dimension of -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.
