# Original Question

Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?

To determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, we start by noting that the energy levels are given by \( E_N = \left( N + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega \), where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. 

The third excited state corresponds to \( N = 3 \), as the ground state is \( N = 0 \), the first excited state is \( N = 1 \), the second excited state is \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state is \( N = 3 \). Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula gives:

\[
E_3 = \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

Next, we calculate the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for \( N = 3 \). This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). The number of solutions is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, and also determine how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the quantum harmonic oscillator, especially in three dimensions.

First, in one dimension, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). Each energy level corresponds to a single eigenfunction. But in three dimensions, things are different because the potential is spherically symmetric (isotropic), so the problem has spherical symmetry. 

I remember that in three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator can be treated either in Cartesian coordinates or in spherical coordinates. The energy levels in 3D can be found by considering the sum of three 1D oscillators (one for each coordinate x, y, z). So the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, the energy levels are characterized by the principal quantum number, but I think the Cartesian approach might be easier here.

Wait, but the problem mentions the third excited state. So I need to figure out what the ordering of the energy levels is. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states can have the same energy. The ground state (lowest energy) is when n_x + n_y + n_z is the smallest. For the ground state, n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so E_0 = (0 + 0 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. Then the first excited state would be the next possible energy level. Since the energy depends on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z, each value of N corresponds to a different energy level. So the energy levels are E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω, where N = 0, 1, 2, ...

Therefore, the ground state is N=0, first excited state N=1, second excited state N=2, third excited state N=3. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If N=0 is the ground state, then N=1 is the first excited, N=2 the second, N=3 the third. So the third excited state would have N=3. Therefore, the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. But let me confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe the third excited state is the fourth energy level (since ground is 0, first excited is 1, etc.), but in terms of N, each N corresponds to a different energy. So N=0: ground, N=1: first excited, N=2: second excited, N=3: third excited. So yes, the third excited state is N=3. Therefore, energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. So that's the energy.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are there for this energy? In other words, what's the degeneracy of the N=3 energy level?

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy (number of ways to write N = n_x + n_y + n_z) is given by the combination formula. For a given N, the number of non-negative integer solutions (n_x, n_y, n_z) to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (N + 2 choose 2). So that's (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. For N=3, that would be (5)(4)/2 = 10. So 10 states. Therefore, the degeneracy is 10. But wait, is this correct?

Wait, but in the 3D harmonic oscillator, sometimes the degeneracy is different when considering the separation into radial and angular parts. Because in spherical coordinates, the eigenfunctions are labeled by the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum numbers l and m. However, in the case of the isotropic harmonic oscillator, there's an additional degeneracy beyond the usual (2l + 1) degeneracy for each l. That is, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, energy levels can be degenerate for different l values. For example, for a given N, which is related to the principal quantum number, but I need to recall the exact relation.

Wait, perhaps in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(2n + l + 3/2), where n is the radial quantum number (number of nodes in the radial wavefunction), and l is the angular momentum quantum number. But in this case, the energy depends on 2n + l. So different combinations of n and l that give the same 2n + l will have the same energy. Therefore, the principal quantum number N can be defined as N = 2n + l. Then, the energy is E = (N + 3/2)ħω. So for each N, the possible values of l are such that l = N - 2n, where n is a non-negative integer. Therefore, for each N, l can be N, N - 2, N - 4, ..., down to 0 or 1, depending on whether N is even or odd.

Therefore, the degeneracy for each N is the sum over all possible l (with step 2) of (2l + 1). So for N=3, which is odd, l can be 3, 1. So l=3 and l=1. Then, the degeneracy is (2*3 + 1) + (2*1 + 1) = 7 + 3 = 10. So that's 10, which matches the previous result from the Cartesian approach. Therefore, the degeneracy is indeed 10. So the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.

But let me check with the Cartesian case. For N=3, the number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So that's the same. Therefore, both methods give the same degeneracy. So that's good.

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the answer should be E = (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me just make sure that the third excited state is indeed N=3. Let's list the energy levels:

N=0: ground state (0 + 3/2)ħω = 3/2 ħω

N=1: first excited state (1 + 3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω

N=2: second excited state (2 + 3/2)ħω = 7/2 ħω

N=3: third excited state (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω

Yes, so the third excited state is N=3. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if someone counts the ground state as the first state, but no, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the 0th energy level, and the first excited is the next one. So the third excited state is N=3.

Therefore, the energy is (9/2)ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.

# Anthropic completion

I must determine the energy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential and find how many linearly independent eigenfunctions share this energy level. Let me think about what I know regarding quantum harmonic oscillators, particularly in three dimensions.

For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels follow E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n must be a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, etc.). Each energy level in the 1D case corresponds to exactly one eigenfunction. However, the three-dimensional case differs because the isotropic potential creates spherical symmetry.

For a 3D harmonic oscillator, I can approach this either using Cartesian or spherical coordinates. Using the Cartesian approach, the total energy can be expressed as a sum of three 1D oscillators (representing the x, y, and z directions): E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω, where n_x, n_y, and n_z are all non-negative integers. While I could use spherical coordinates with the principal quantum number, the Cartesian method seems more straightforward for this problem.

Since the question asks about the third excited state, I need to identify the correct energy level ordering. An important characteristic of the 3D harmonic oscillator is degeneracy—multiple quantum states can possess identical energy values. To begin, I'll need to determine which combination of quantum numbers corresponds to the ground state (lowest energy) when n_x + n_y + n_z is minimal.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the energy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential and identify the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with that energy. Let's start by reviewing what I know about the quantum harmonic oscillator, particularly in three dimensions.

In one dimension, energy levels are quantized and expressed as E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), and each level corresponds to a single eigenfunction. However, in three dimensions, things change due to the isotropic, spherically symmetric nature of the potential, which introduces spherical symmetry.

In three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator can be approached using either Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The energy levels in 3D stem from summing the energies of three 1D oscillators (one for each coordinate x, y, z), resulting in a total energy of E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω, where n_x, n_y, and n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, spherical coordinates define energy levels via the principal quantum number, but the Cartesian method may be simpler for this purpose.

Now, considering the problem involves the third excited state, I need to understand the sequence of energy levels. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, multiple states share the same energy due to degeneracy. The ground state, representing the lowest energy, corresponds to the smallest sum of n_x + n_y + n_z.

To determine the energy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions, we start by noting that the energy levels in a 3D harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[ E_n = \left( n + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega \]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[ E_3 = \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \]

Next, we calculate the degeneracy of this energy level, which is the number of ways to partition \( n = 3 \) into three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the combination formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \):

\[ \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \]

We can also verify this by considering the possible values of the angular momentum quantum number \( l \) and their degeneracies. For \( n = 3 \), the possible \( l \) values are 3 and 1. The degeneracies for these \( l \) values are \( 2l + 1 \):

- For \( l = 3 \): \( 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7 \)
- For \( l = 1 \): \( 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \)

Summing these gives a total degeneracy of \( 7 + 3 = 10 \).

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions.

, which is 0. So the ground state energy is (0 + 3/2)ħω = 3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state would be the next possible energy, which is when n_x + n_y + n_z = 1. Then the energy is (1 + 3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω. The second excited state would be when the sum is 2, giving (2 + 3/2)ħω = 7/2 ħω. The third excited state would then be when the sum is 3, so energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the energy of the third excited state is 9/2 ħω. 

But wait, let me confirm. In 3D, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is n = 0, first excited n = 1, second excited n = 2, third excited n = 3. So yes, the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. That seems right.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are there for this energy eigenvalue? That is, the degeneracy of the energy level with n = 3. In Cartesian coordinates, the degeneracy is the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. For n = 3, the number of solutions is the combination with repetition, which is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Wait, but let me check that formula. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N + 2 choose 2). So for N = 3, that's (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 states. But is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe in spherical coordinates, the degeneracy is different? Wait, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so the degeneracy is indeed the same as the number of ways to partition n into three non-negative integers. So for n = 3, the number is 10. Let me list them to check:

For n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

Possible combinations:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 permutations

(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2) → 6 permutations

(1,1,1) → 1 permutation

Total: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Yes, that's 10. So the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

But wait, hold on. In some systems, like the hydrogen atom, the degeneracy is higher due to different angular momentum states having the same energy. But in the harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so the degeneracy is indeed (n + 2 choose 2). So for n = 3, 10. So the answer should be energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.

But let me cross-verify with another approach. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, another way to think about the states is in terms of the radial quantum number and angular momentum. The energy can also be written as E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. Since the potential is isotropic, energy depends on 2n_r + l. But in the Cartesian approach, the energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. Therefore, equating the two expressions: 2n_r + l = n_x + n_y + n_z. So for a given n = n_x + n_y + n_z, the possible values of l are n, n - 2, n - 4, ..., down to 0 or 1. For each l, the degeneracy is (2l + 1) due to the magnetic quantum number m. So the total degeneracy would be the sum over all possible l of (2l + 1). Let's check for n = 3.

So n = 3. Then possible l values: 3, 1 (since 3 - 2 = 1, and 1 - 2 = -1 which is not allowed). So l = 3 and l = 1.

For l = 3: degeneracy is 2*3 + 1 = 7.

For l = 1: degeneracy is 2*1 + 1 = 3.

Total degeneracy: 7 + 3 = 10. Which matches the previous result. So that's good. Therefore, the degeneracy is indeed 10. So the answer is energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me just make sure that the third excited state corresponds to n = 3. The ground state is n = 0 (E = 3/2 ħω), first excited n = 1 (E = 5/2 ħω), second excited n = 2 (E = 7/2 ħω), third excited n = 3 (E = 9/2 ħω). Yes, that's correct. So the third excited state is n = 3. So energy is 9/2 ħω, degeneracy 10. Therefore, the answer is energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Then, the energy is (0 + 0 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be the next energy level, which occurs when the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 1. Each of the three possibilities (n_x=1, others 0; n_y=1, others 0; n_z=1, others 0) gives the same energy (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. So the first excited state is three-fold degenerate.\n\nThe second excited state would correspond to the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 2. The possible combinations here are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1). Let me count them: three with two quanta in one direction and zero in the others, and three with one quantum in two different directions. That's six total combinations. Therefore, the energy is (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is six.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the third excited state would be the next energy level, which is when the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Let me verify this. The ground state is n=0 (sum 0), first excited is sum 1, second excited sum 2, so third excited should be sum 3. The energy would then be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. Now, how many combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z sum to 3? This is a problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + k - 1 choose k - 1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3, so (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (5 choose 2) = 10.

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced, each increasing by ħω. The ground state is 3/2 ħω, first excited 5/2, second 7/2, third 9/2. So yes, the third excited state is 9/2 ħω. The degeneracy for each energy level (n_x + n_y + n_z = N) is (N + 2 choose 2), which for N=3 is (5 choose 2) = 10. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator: the number of states with energy (N + 3/2)ħω is (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. For N=3, that's (4)(5)/2 = 10. So that matches. Therefore, the third excited state has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is using the principal quantum number in spherical coordinates. However, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are also characterized by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the radial and angular momentum quantum numbers.

However, in the Cartesian approach, the energy depends only on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z, which is equivalent to 2n + l. Therefore, for each N, there are multiple possible l values.

So regardless of the approach, the degeneracy should be the same.\n\nBut perhaps the confusion arises if the problem is considered in spherical coordinates. However, the problem statement mentions that the potential is isotropic, so the energy depends only on the radial part and angular momentum. But in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate for different l values. For example, for a given N = 2n + l, the energy is (N + 3/2)ħω. So for each N, there are multiple l's possible. For example, N=0: l=0. N=1: l=1. N=2: l=0,2. N=3: l=1,3. Wait, but how does this affect the degeneracy?\n\nWait, perhaps in the spherical basis, the degeneracy is calculated differently. For each N, the possible l values are N, N-2, N-4,... down to l=0 or 1. For each l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1). So the total degeneracy would be the sum over l of (2l + 1) for each allowed l. For example, for N=3, l can be 3 and 1. So degeneracy would be (2*3 +1) + (2*1 +1) = 7 + 3 = 10. Which matches the Cartesian result. So regardless of the approach, the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the third excited state (N=3) has energy (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.\n\nBut let me check again the counting of excited states. The ground state is N=0 (energy 3/2 ħω). Then first excited state is N=1 (5/2 ħω), second excited N=2 (7/2), third excited N=3 (9/2). So yes, third excited state is N=3.

So for N=3, l=3,1. Then the degeneracy is sum over l (2l +1). For l=3: 7, l=1:3. Total 10. So same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the third excited state (N=3) has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.

To determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, we start by noting that the energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[ E = \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega \]

where \( n_x \), \( n_y \), and \( n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy levels are determined by the sum \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \). The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \).

For the third excited state (\( N = 3 \)):

1. **Energy Calculation**:
   \[
   E = \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]

2. **Degeneracy Calculation**:
   The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is given by the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three dimensions \( n_x \), \( n_y \), and \( n_z \). This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \), which is calculated using the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
   \]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Then, the first, second, and third excited states will follow.

The ground state (lowest energy) occurs when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then, the energy is (0 + 0 + 0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be the next energy level, which occurs when the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 1. Each of the three possibilities (n_x=1, others 0; n_y=1, others 0; n_z=1, others 0) gives the same energy (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. So the first excited state is three-fold degenerate.

The second excited state would correspond to the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 2. The possible combinations here are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1). Let me count them: three with two quanta in one direction and zero in the others, and three with one quantum in two different directions. That's six total combinations. Therefore, the energy is (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is six.

Continuing this pattern, the third excited state would be the next energy level, which is when the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Let me verify this. The ground state is n=0 (sum 0), first excited is sum 1, second excited sum 2, so third excited should be sum 3. The energy would then be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. Now, how many combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z sum to 3? This is a problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + k - 1 choose k - 1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3, so (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 possible states. Therefore, the third excited state has energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10.

Wait, but I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me check the ordering. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced, each increasing by ħω. The ground state is 3/2 ħω, first excited 5/2, second 7/2, third 9/2. So yes, the third excited state is 9/2 ħω. The degeneracy for each energy level (n_x + n_y + n_z = N) is (N + 2 choose 2), which for N=3 is (5 choose 2) = 10. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, using the formula for degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator: the number of states with energy (N + 3/2)ħω is (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. For N=3, that's (4)(5)/2 = 10. So that matches. Therefore, the third excited state has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.

But wait, another way to think about this is using the principal quantum number in spherical coordinates. However, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are also characterized by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the radial and angular momentum quantum numbers. The energy in that case is given by E_n = (2n + l + 3/2)ħω, where n is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. However, in the Cartesian approach, the energy depends only on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z, which is equivalent to 2n + l. Therefore, for each N, there are multiple possible l values. But in the Cartesian case, the degeneracy is (N + 1)(N + 2)/2, which is the same as the number of ways to distribute N quanta among the three directions. So regardless of the approach, the degeneracy should be the same.

But perhaps the confusion arises if the problem is considered in spherical coordinates. However, the problem statement mentions that the potential is isotropic, so the energy depends only on the radial part and angular momentum. But in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate for different l values. For example, for a given N = 2n + l, the energy is (N + 3/2)ħω. So for each N, there are multiple l's possible. For example, N=0: l=0. N=1: l=1. N=2: l=0,2. N=3: l=1,3. Wait, but how does this affect the degeneracy?

Wait, perhaps in the spherical basis, the degeneracy is calculated differently. For each N, the possible l values are N, N-2, N-4,... down to l=0 or 1. For each l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1). So the total degeneracy would be the sum over l of (2l + 1) for each allowed l. For example, for N=3, l can be 3 and 1. So degeneracy would be (2*3 +1) + (2*1 +1) = 7 + 3 = 10. Which matches the Cartesian result. So regardless of the approach, the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the third excited state (N=3) has energy (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.

Therefore, the answer should be energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me check again the counting of excited states. The ground state is N=0 (energy 3/2 ħω). Then first excited state is N=1 (5/2 ħω), second excited N=2 (7/2), third excited N=3 (9/2). So yes, third excited state is N=3. So energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. Degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the answer is energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in terms of the principal quantum number n, but in some references, the principal quantum number is defined as n = n_r + l, where n_r is the radial quantum number. But in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω. So if we set N = 2n_r + l, then E = (N + 3/2)ħω. But N can be 0,1,2,... So for each N, the possible l's are N, N-2, N-4,... So for N=3, l=3,1. Then the degeneracy is sum over l (2l +1). For l=3: 7, l=1:3. Total 10. So same result.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the third excited state (N=3) has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10. So the answer is energy (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Let me check.\n\nWait, in Cartesian coordinates, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. So if we set N = n_x + n_y + n_z, then E = (N + 3/2)ħω. The number of states for each N is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. However, in spherical coordinates, the energy is E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω. So if we set N = 2n_r + l, then E = (N + 3/2)ħω. So in this case, N can be any non-negative integer, and for each N, the possible values of l are N, N-2, N-4, ..., down to 0 or 1, depending on whether N is even or odd. For each l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1). Therefore, the total degeneracy is the sum over l of (2l + 1) where l = N, N-2, ..., 0 or 1. Let\'s check for N=3. Then l can be 3, 1. For l=3: 2*3 +1=7.

So yes, the degeneracy is the same as in the Cartesian case. Therefore, both approaches agree. So the energy levels are indeed E = (N + 3/2)ħω, with degeneracy (N + 1)(N + 2)/2.

To determine the energy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions, we start by noting that the energy levels are given by \( E = (N + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega \), where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. 

The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \). Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( N \) is calculated using the combination formula for the number of ways to partition \( N \) into three non-negative integers, which is \(\frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}\). For \( N = 3 \):

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.

Each subsequent excited state is determined by the next possible sum of these quantum numbers.

Let me list the energy levels systematically. The energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. Let's denote N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then, E = (N + 3/2)ħω. The ground state is N=0 (all n_i=0), first excited state N=1, second excited state N=2, third excited state N=3, and so on. Wait, but hold on. In 3D, the degeneracy (number of states with the same N) increases with N, so the first excited state (N=1) has a certain degeneracy, the second (N=2) higher, etc. But I need to confirm if the "third excited state" refers to the fourth energy level (since ground is 0, first excited is 1, etc.) or if there's a different counting.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state. Then the first excited state is the next one, and so on. So, if the energy levels are labeled by N=0,1,2,..., then the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. Therefore, the third excited state corresponds to N=3. So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. But let me verify this.

Alternatively, maybe the energy levels are grouped by the value of N. For each N, the energy is E = (N + 3/2)ħω, and the number of states (degeneracy) for each N is given by the combination formula. For three quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, such that their sum is N, the number of states is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. Wait, no. Let me recall: the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's a stars and bars problem. The formula is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (N + 2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for each N, the degeneracy is (N+2)(N+1)/2. For example, N=0: (0+2)(0+1)/2 = 1, which is correct (ground state). N=1: (1+2)(1+1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3. So three states. N=2: (2+2)(2+1)/2 = 4*3/2 = 6. N=3: (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So the degeneracy for N=3 is 10. Therefore, if the third excited state is N=3, then the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

But wait, let me check if the counting of excited states is correct. The ground state is N=0. Then first excited state is N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So yes, the third excited state is N=3. Therefore, the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the answer would be energy 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me cross-verify this with another approach. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, another way to think about the energy levels is in terms of the principal quantum number n in spherical coordinates. However, in the spherical case, the energy levels are given by E_n = (2n + l + 3/2)ħω, where n is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. But in the case of the isotropic harmonic oscillator, there's an additional degeneracy beyond the usual spherical symmetry. That is, energy depends only on 2n + l, which is similar to the principal quantum number in hydrogen but here leads to higher degeneracy. Wait, but in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are actually E = (n + 3/2)ħω where n is a non-negative integer, and n = 2n_r + l, with n_r being the radial quantum number and l the angular momentum. So for each n, which is even or odd, you can have different combinations of n_r and l. But in this case, the energy depends only on n = n_x + n_y + n_z, which is equivalent to 2n_r + l. Therefore, the degeneracy for each n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, but this seems conflicting with the previous approach. Wait, perhaps not. Let me check.

Wait, in Cartesian coordinates, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. So if we set N = n_x + n_y + n_z, then E = (N + 3/2)ħω. The number of states for each N is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. However, in spherical coordinates, the energy is E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω. So if we set N = 2n_r + l, then E = (N + 3/2)ħω. So in this case, N can be any non-negative integer, and for each N, the possible values of l are N, N-2, N-4, ..., down to 0 or 1, depending on whether N is even or odd. For each l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1). Therefore, the total degeneracy is the sum over l of (2l + 1) where l = N, N-2, ..., 0 or 1. Let's check for N=3. Then l can be 3, 1. For l=3: 2*3 +1=7. For l=1: 2*1 +1=3. Total degeneracy: 7 + 3 = 10. Which matches the Cartesian result. For N=2: l=2,0. For l=2: 5, l=0:1. Total 6. For N=1: l=1. 3. For N=0: l=0. 1. So yes, the degeneracy is the same as in the Cartesian case. Therefore, both approaches agree. So the energy levels are indeed E = (N + 3/2)ħω, with degeneracy (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. Therefore, the third excited state, which is N=3, has energy (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10.

Therefore, the answer should be energy (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me just make sure that the counting of excited states is correct. The ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So yes, third excited state is N=3. So energy is (9/2)ħω, degeneracy 10. Therefore, the answer is E = (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, if someone counts the first excited state as the first state above the ground state, which is N=1, then the third would be N=3. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if someone confuses the principal quantum number in hydrogen with this, but in hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n, but here, the energy levels are different. So in this case, the energy levels are spaced by ħω each time N increases by 1, but the degeneracy is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking in terms of the 3D harmonic oscillator and the number of nodes or something else, but I think the standard approach is as above.

Therefore, I think the answer is energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.
