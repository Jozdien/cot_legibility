The kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) in the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν, when the pion is stationary, is calculated using conservation of energy and momentum. 

**Key steps:**
1. **Energy Conservation:** The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( m_\pi c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \).
2. **Momentum Conservation:** The muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.
3. **Relativistic Energy Relation:** For the muon, \( E_\mu = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2} \), and for the neutrino, \( E_\nu = p c \).
4. **Solve for Kinetic Energy:** Using the energy difference and momentum conservation, the muon's kinetic energy is derived as:
   \[
   K_\mu = \frac{(m_\pi - m_\mu)^2}{2 m_\pi} c^2
   \]
   Plugging in \( m_\pi = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
   \[
   K_\mu = \frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6} \, \text{MeV} \approx \frac{33.9^2}{279.2} \, \text{MeV} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

**Answer:**  
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(\boxed{4.12 \, \text{MeV}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially stationary. The rest masses are given: 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? I think neutrinos have very tiny mass, so maybe we can consider it as zero here. 

First, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum. 

Energy conservation also applies here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle includes their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. 

Let me denote the rest mass of the pion as m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², the rest mass of the muon as m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's rest mass as m_ν ≈ 0. 

Let’s denote the kinetic energy of the muon as K_μ and the kinetic energy of the neutrino as K_ν. But wait, since the neutrino has negligible rest mass, its energy is almost entirely kinetic, and equal to its momentum times the speed of light (since for massless particles, E = pc). 

But the muon has rest mass, so its total energy is E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. The neutrino's energy is E_ν = p_ν c, where p_ν is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum. 

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum p_μ must equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum p_ν, but in opposite directions. So, p_μ = p_ν = p. 

So, the total energy after decay is E_total = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μ c² + K_μ) + p c. 

But the total energy before decay is m_π c². Therefore:

m_π c² = m_μ c² + K_μ + p c. 

But we also know that the total momentum is zero, so p_μ = p_ν = p. 

For the muon, the total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

But E_μ is also equal to m_μ c² + K_μ. So,

(m_μ c² + K_μ)² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

Expanding the left side:

(m_μ c²)² + 2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

Subtracting (m_μ c²)² from both sides:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)². 

But from the energy conservation equation, we have:

p c = m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ. 

So, substitute p c into the previous equation:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ)². 

Let me write that out:

Left side: 2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ²

Right side: (m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ)²

Let’s expand the right side:

= (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ²

So, setting left and right sides equal:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ²

Subtract K_μ² from both sides:

2 m_μ c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ

Bring all terms to the left side:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Factor out K_μ:

[2 m_μ c² + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²)] K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

2 m_μ c² + 2 m_π c² - 2 m_μ c² = 2 m_π c²

So:

2 m_π c² K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Then:

2 m_π c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2

Solving for K_μ:

K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 / (2 m_π c²)

Since the c² terms are in the numerator and denominator, they can cancel out. Let me check:

If we write the masses in units where c=1 (like MeV/c²), then m_π c² is 139.6 MeV, m_μ c² is 105.7 MeV. So, the equation becomes:

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6)

Compute the numerator: (139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9, so 33.9² = 33.9 * 33.9

Let me calculate that: 30*30=900, 30*3.9=117, 3.9*30=117, 3.9*3.9=15.21, so total is 900 + 117 + 117 +15.21 = 900 + 234 +15.21 = 1149.21

Wait, actually, that's (30 + 3.9)^2 = 33.9². Alternatively, 33.9 * 33.9:

33 * 33 = 1089

33 * 0.9 = 29.7

0.9 * 33 = 29.7

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81

So total: 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21

Yes, so numerator is 1149.21 (MeV)²

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV

So K_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 1149.21 by 279.2:

First, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

So 4 + 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116

But wait, 279.2 * 4.1 = 279.2*4 + 279.2*0.1 = 1116.8 + 27.92 = 1144.72

1149.21 - 1144.72 = 4.49

So 4.1 + 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 4.1 + 0.016 ≈ 4.116

So approximately 4.116 MeV

Wait, but let me check with calculator steps:

1149.21 ÷ 279.2

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

Difference: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116

So total ≈ 4.116

So K_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV

But let me check with more precise calculation:

32.41 / 279.2 = 32.41 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.1161

So total K_μ ≈ 4.1161 MeV

So approximately 4.12 MeV.

But let me verify with exact division:

1149.21 / 279.2

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

1149210 / 279200

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 114921 / 27920

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 57460.5 / 13960

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 11492.1 / 2792

Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, use decimal division:

1149.21 ÷ 279.2

Set up as 1149.21 ÷ 279.2

How many times does 279.2 go into 1149.21?

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

Subtract: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

Bring down decimal: 32.41 is now 32.410

279.2 goes into 32.410 about 0.116 times, as before.

So total is 4.116

So approximately 4.116 MeV.

But let me check with another method. Let's compute 33.9^2 / (2*139.6)

33.9 squared is 1149.21

2*139.6 is 279.2

So 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116

So the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.116 MeV.

But wait, the problem says "Find KE of product particles". So, the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So, E_ν = p c. But we can also find E_ν from energy conservation: E_ν = m_π c² - E_μ

Since E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ = 105.7 + 4.116 ≈ 109.816 MeV

So E_ν = 139.6 - 109.816 ≈ 29.784 MeV

But since the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy (because m_ν ≈ 0), then K_ν = 29.784 MeV

But the question says "Find KE of product particles". So, do they want both? Or just the muon? The problem statement says "product particles", plural, but the answer might expect both. Wait, let me check the original problem again.

Original problem: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

So, the products are mu+ and nu. The question is asking for the KE of the product particles. So, both mu+ and nu have kinetic energy. But maybe in the context of the problem, since the neutrino's KE is hard to detect, perhaps they just want the muon's KE? But the problem doesn't specify. However, in pion decay, typically the neutrino's energy is significant, but since it's hard to measure, maybe the question is expecting just the muon's KE. But let's check.

Wait, the problem says "Find KE of product particles". So both the muon and the neutrino. But the answer might need to specify both. However, in many cases, when a problem like this is posed, especially in textbooks, they might just ask for the KE of the massive particle, since the neutrino's KE is equal to its energy, which can be found via conservation, but it's often considered that the answer is the muon's KE. Let me check with calculation.

But let's see. If the rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and it decays into a muon (105.7 MeV) and a neutrino (0), then the total energy of the system is 139.6 MeV. The muon has rest mass 105.7, so the remaining energy is split as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino. But due to momentum conservation, the kinetic energies are related.

But according to our previous calculation, the muon's KE is approximately 4.116 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.784 MeV. So, the total kinetic energy is 4.116 + 29.784 = 33.9 MeV, which is equal to (139.6 - 105.7) MeV, which makes sense because the available energy is the rest mass difference, which is 33.9 MeV, and that's distributed as kinetic energy between the two particles. 

But the question is to find the KE of the product particles. So, both. But maybe the question expects just the muon's KE? Let me check standard pion decay. 

In the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, the muon is the only massive particle, and the neutrino is massless (approx). The kinetic energy of the muon can be calculated using the formula we used, and it's a standard result. The neutrino's energy is the remaining energy. 

But the problem statement doesn't specify which one, so perhaps we need to give both. However, the way the question is phrased, "Find KE of product particles", plural, so maybe both. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, but in the initial equations, we found K_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV. Let me verify this with another approach to be sure.

Alternative approach: Using conservation of energy and momentum.

Total energy: E_π = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV

Total momentum: 0, so the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

Let’s denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of both particles.

For the muon: E_μ = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 )

For the neutrino: E_ν = p c (since m_ν ≈ 0)

Total energy: E_μ + E_ν = m_π c²

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) + p c = m_π c²

Let’s let’s define x = p c, so:

sqrt(x² + (m_μ c²)²) + x = m_π c²

Let’s rearrange:

sqrt(x² + (m_μ c²)^2) = m_π c² - x

Square both sides:

x² + (m_μ c²)^2 = (m_π c² - x)^2

Expand the right side:

(m_π c²)^2 - 2 m_π c² x + x²

So,

x² + (m_μ c²)^2 = (m_π c²)^2 - 2 m_π c² x + x²

Cancel x² from both sides:

(m_μ c²)^2 = (m_π c²)^2 - 2 m_π c² x

Rearrange:

2 m_π c² x = (m_π c²)^2 - (m_μ c²)^2

So,

x = [ (m_π c²)^2 - (m_μ c²)^2 ] / (2 m_π c² )

But x = p c, so p = [ (m_π² - m_μ²) c² ] / (2 m_π c² ) * c ?

Wait, let's compute x:

x = [ (m_π² c^4 - m_μ² c^4 ) ] / (2 m_π c² )

Simplify numerator:

c^4 (m_π² - m_μ² )

Denominator: 2 m_π c²

So,

x = [ c^4 (m_π² - m_μ² ) ] / (2 m_π c² ) = [ c² (m_π² - m_μ² ) ] / (2 m_π )

Therefore, x = c² (m_π² - m_μ² ) / (2 m_π )

But x is p c, so p = x / c = c (m_π² - m_μ² ) / (2 m_π )

But maybe we don't need to compute p directly. Instead, recall that the kinetic energy of the muon is E_μ - m_μ c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) - m_μ c²

But from the previous result, we have:

E_μ = m_π c² - x = m_π c² - [ (m_π² - m_μ² ) c² / (2 m_π ) ]

Wait, let's substitute x back into E_μ:

E_μ = m_π c² - x = m_π c² - [ (m_π² - m_μ² ) c² / (2 m_π ) ]

Factor out c²:

E_μ = c² [ m_π - (m_π² - m_μ² ) / (2 m_π ) ]

Simplify the expression inside:

= c² [ (2 m_π² - m_π² + m_μ² ) / (2 m_π ) ]

= c² [ (m_π² + m_μ² ) / (2 m_π ) ]

Therefore, E_μ = c² (m_π² + m_μ² ) / (2 m_π )

Then, the kinetic energy K_μ = E_μ - m_μ c² = c² (m_π² + m_μ² ) / (2 m_π ) - m_μ c²

Factor out c²:

= c² [ (m_π² + m_μ² ) / (2 m_π ) - m_μ ]

= c² [ (m_π² + m_μ² - 2 m_π m_μ ) / (2 m_π ) ]

= c² [ (m_π - m_μ )² / (2 m_π ) ]

So,

K_μ = (m_π - m_μ )² c² / (2 m_π )

But since the rest masses are given in MeV/c², when we plug in the numbers, the c² cancels out appropriately. Let's verify:

Given m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²

So,

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7 )² / (2 * 139.6 ) MeV

Which is exactly the same as we calculated before: (33.9)^2 / (279.2 ) ≈ 4.116 MeV

So that's consistent. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.116 MeV.

As for the neutrino, its energy is E_ν = p c = x = [ (m_π² - m_μ² ) c² ] / (2 m_π )

Plugging in the numbers:

E_ν = (139.6² - 105.7² ) / (2 * 139.6 ) MeV

Compute numerator:

139.6² = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16

105.7² = (100 + 5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7² = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49

So numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV²

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So E_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

279.2 * 30 = 8376

That's more than 8315.67, so 29.8 times.

29.8 * 279.2 = 30*279.2 - 0.2*279.2 = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16

But 8315.67 is less than 8320.16 by 4.49

So 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2 ) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784

So E_ν ≈ 29.784 MeV

Which matches our previous result. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so K_ν = 29.784 MeV.

Therefore, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.116 MeV for the muon and 29.784 MeV for the neutrino. 

But the problem says "Find KE of product particles". Depending on the context, sometimes problems might ask for just the muon's KE, but since both are product particles, technically both should be given. However, in many textbooks, when they ask for the KE in pion decay, they refer to the muon's KE because the neutrino's is harder to detect. Let me check standard pion decay KE.

Looking up, the kinetic energy of the muon in pion decay at rest is indeed given by the formula (m_π - m_μ )² / (2 m_π ), which we calculated as approximately 4.12 MeV. The neutrino gets the remaining energy, which is around 29.78 MeV. 

But since the problem doesn't specify which particle, but says "product particles", plural, maybe we need to provide both. However, the way the problem is structured, it might expect the KE of the muon, as the neutrino's KE is often considered equal to its energy, and since the rest mass is zero, but maybe they want both. 

But let's check units. The rest masses are given in MeV, which is actually MeV/c². So when we calculate K_μ, we have to make sure the units work out. But since we used the formula where the c² cancels, the result is in MeV. 

Alternatively, if we consider the units more carefully:

m_π c² = 139.6 MeV

m_μ c² = 105.7 MeV

So, K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c² )² / (2 m_π c² )

Which is ( (139.6 - 105.7) MeV )² / (2 * 139.6 MeV )

= (33.9 MeV )² / (279.2 MeV )

= (1149.21 MeV² ) / (279.2 MeV ) = 4.116 MeV

Yes, units work out. So the answer is 4.12 MeV for the muon. 

But the problem says "product particles", so maybe both. However, in typical notation, the neutrino is often not assigned a kinetic energy but just energy, but since KE is energy minus rest mass energy, and neutrino's rest mass is zero, its KE is equal to its energy. So, technically, both should be reported. 

But let me check the total energy to confirm:

Total energy after decay: E_μ + E_ν = (105.7 + 4.116) + 29.784 = 139.6 MeV, which matches the pion's rest energy. So that checks out.

Momentum check:

For the muon, p_μ = sqrt( E_μ² - (m_μ c² )² ) / c

E_μ = 105.7 + 4.116 = 109.816 MeV

So p_μ c = sqrt( (109.816 )² - (105.7 )² ) MeV

Calculate inside the sqrt:

(109.816)^2 = Let's compute 110^2 = 12100, subtract (0.184)^2 and subtract 2*110*0.184

Wait, alternatively:

109.816² = (105.7 + 4.116 )² = 105.7² + 2*105.7*4.116 + 4.116²

= 11172.49 + 2*105.7*4.116 + 16.94

Calculate 2*105.7*4.116:

105.7*4.116 = Let's compute 100*4.116 = 411.6, 5.7*4.116 = 23.4612, total = 411.6 + 23.4612 = 435.0612

Multiply by 2: 870.1224

So total 11172.49 + 870.1224 + 16.94 ≈ 11172.49 + 887.0624 ≈ 12059.5524

Then subtract (105.7)^2 = 11172.49

So sqrt(12059.5524 - 11172.49 ) = sqrt(887.0624 ) ≈ 29.78 MeV/c

So p_μ c ≈ 29.78 MeV, which matches E_ν = 29.784 MeV. So momentum is conserved, as p_μ = p_ν. 

Therefore, the calculations are consistent. 

But the problem asks for the KE of the product particles. Since there are two product particles, the muon and the neutrino, both have kinetic energy. However, in many cases, especially in introductory problems, the focus is on the muon's kinetic energy because it's the massive particle, and the neutrino's energy is often considered separately. But strictly following the problem statement, both should be given. 

However, given that the rest mass of the neutrino is negligible (treated as zero), its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, which we found to be approximately 29.78 MeV. 

But let me check standard sources or textbooks. For example, in the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, the muon's kinetic energy is indeed given by the formula we used, approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino carries away the remaining energy, about 29.78 MeV. 

Since the problem gives rest masses in MeV, which are actually rest energies (divided by c²), but in particle physics, it's common to express masses in MeV/c² and energies in MeV. 

Given that, the answer should be the kinetic energy of the muon, which is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.78 MeV. But the problem might expect just the muon's KE. 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

The problem mentions the rest mass of the Pi+ and mu+, but not the neutrino, which is massless. So, the products are mu+ and nu, both particles. The KE of both should be found. However, in many cases, especially in exams or textbooks, when they ask for the KE of the products in pion decay, they are referring to the muon's KE. But to be precise, since the question says "product particles", we should provide both. 

But let's see. The total energy available is m_π c² = 139.6 MeV. The rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the remaining energy is 33.9 MeV, which is split as kinetic energy. However, due to momentum conservation, the split isn't equal. The muon gets a small portion, and the neutrino gets most of it. 

But how to present the answer? The problem might expect the answer in a box, as per the instructions. If the assistant is to provide the final answer within a box, maybe they expect just the muon's KE. But to be safe, perhaps both. 

However, let's check the calculation once more for the muon's KE:

K_μ = (m_π - m_μ )² / (2 m_π )

Plugging in the numbers:

(139.6 - 105.7 ) = 33.9

33.9² = 1149.21

2 * 139.6 = 279.2

1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV

Rounded to three significant figures, since the given masses are four significant figures, but the difference is three (33.9), so the answer should be 4.12 MeV.

Similarly, the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, which is 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

But the problem might expect the answer as a single value, but since there are two particles, it's ambiguous. However, in standard decay problems, when the parent is at rest, the kinetic energy of the massive daughter particle is usually asked for, and the neutrino's energy is sometimes considered as the other part. But since the question says "product particles", plural, perhaps we need to state both. 

But looking at similar problems, for example, in textbooks like Griffiths or online resources, when asked for the kinetic energy in pion decay, the answer is the muon's kinetic energy, which is around 4.1 MeV. The neutrino's energy is significant but often not the focus. 

Given that, and considering the problem gives the rest masses of the pion and muon but not the neutrino (which is massless), the answer expected is likely the kinetic energy of the muon, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. 

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy.

Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially stationary. The rest masses are given: 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? I think neutrinos have very tiny mass, so maybe we can consider it as zero here. 

First, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum. 

Energy conservation also applies here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle includes their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. 

Let me denote the rest mass of the pion as m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², the rest mass of the muon as m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's rest mass as m_ν ≈ 0. 

Let’s denote the kinetic energy of the muon as K_μ and the kinetic energy of the neutrino as K_ν. But wait, since the neutrino has negligible rest mass, its energy is almost entirely kinetic, and equal to its momentum times the speed of light (since for massless particles, E = pc). 

But the muon has rest mass, so its total energy is E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. The neutrino's energy is E_ν = p_ν c, where p_ν is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum. 

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum p_μ must equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum p_ν, but in opposite directions. So, p_μ = p_ν = p. 

So, the total energy after decay is E_total = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μ c² + K_μ) + p c. 

But the total energy before decay is m_π c². Therefore:

m_π c² = m_μ c² + K_μ + p c. 

But we also know that the total momentum is zero, so p_μ = p_ν = p. 

For the muon, the total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

But E_μ is also equal to m_μ c² + K_μ. So,

(m_μ c² + K_μ)² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

Expanding the left side:

(m_μ c²)² + 2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)². 

Subtracting (m_μ c²)² from both sides:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)². 

But from the energy conservation equation, we have:

p c = m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ. 

So, substitute p c into the previous equation:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ)². 

Let me write that out:

Left side: 2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ²

Right side: (m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ)²

Let’s expand the right side:

= (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ²

So, setting left and right sides equal:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ²

Subtract K_μ² from both sides:

2 m_μ c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ

Bring all terms to the left side:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Factor out K_μ:

[2 m_μ c² + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²)] K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

2 m_μ c² + 2 m_π c² - 2 m_μ c² = 2 m_π c²

So:

2 m_π c² K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 = 0

Then:

2 m_π c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2

Solving for K_μ:

K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)^2 / (2 m_π c²)

Since the c² terms are in the numerator and denominator, they can cancel out. Let me check:

If we write the masses in units where c=1 (like MeV/c²), then m_π c² is 139.6 MeV, m_μ c² is 105.7 MeV. So, the equation becomes:

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6)

Compute the numerator: (139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9, so 33.9² = 33.9 * 33.9

Let me calculate that: 30*30=900, 30*3.9=117, 3.9*30=117, 3.9*3.9=15.21, so total is 900 + 117 + 117 +15.21 = 900 + 234 +15.21 = 1149.21

Wait, actually, that's (30 + 3.9)^2 = 33.9². Alternatively, 33.9 * 33.9:

33 * 33 = 1089

33 * 0.9 = 29.7

0.9 * 33 = 29.7

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81

So total: 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21

Yes, so numerator is 1149.21 (MeV)²

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV

So K_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 1149.21 by 279.2:

First, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

So 4 + 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116

But wait, 279.2 * 4.1 = 279.2*4 + 279.2*0.1 = 1116.8 + 27.92 = 1144.72

1149.21 - 1144.72 = 4.49

So 4.1 + 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 4.1 + 0.016 ≈ 4.116

So approximately 4.116 MeV

Wait, but let me check with calculator steps:

1149.21 ÷ 279.2

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

Difference: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116

So total ≈ 4.116

So K_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV

But let me check with more precise calculation:

32.41 / 279.2 = 32.41 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.1161

So total K_μ ≈ 4.1161 MeV

So approximately

I need to calculate the kinetic energy of particles produced when a stationary positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon, while the neutrino's rest mass is negligibly small and can be treated as zero.

Since the initial pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal magnitude of momentum but in opposite directions to maintain momentum conservation.

For energy conservation, the total energy before decay equals the pion's rest energy (139.6 MeV). After decay, this equals the sum of the muon's energy (rest mass plus kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy.

Let me denote the pion's rest mass as m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², the muon's rest mass as m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's rest mass as m_ν ≈ 0.

If K_μ represents the muon's kinetic energy and K_ν the neutrino's kinetic energy, then since the neutrino is essentially massless, its energy is almost entirely kinetic and equals its momentum times the speed of light (E = pc).

The muon's total energy is E_μ = m_μc² + K_μ, while the neutrino's energy is E_ν = p_νc, where p_ν is the neutrino's momentum magnitude.

Due to momentum conservation, the muon's momentum p_μ equals the neutrino's momentum p_ν in magnitude (p), but in opposite directions.

The total energy after decay is E_total = (m_μc² + K_μ) + pc, and this equals the pre-decay energy m_πc². Therefore:
m_πc² = m_μc² + K_μ + pc

For the muon, the relativistic energy-momentum relation gives:
E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²

Since E_μ = m_μc² + K_μ, we can write:
(m_μc² + K_μ)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²

Expanding the left side:
(m_μc²)² + 2m_μc²K_μ + K_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²

Simplifying:
2m_μc²K_μ + K_μ² = (pc)²

From energy conservation, pc = m_πc² - m_μc² - K_μ, so:
2m_μc²K_μ + K_μ² = (m_πc² - m_μc² - K_μ)²

Expanding the right side:
2m_μc²K_μ + K_μ² = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² - 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)K_μ + K_μ²

After cancelation:
2m_μc²K_μ + 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)K_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²

Factoring out K_μ:
[2m_μc² + 2(m_πc² - m_μc²)]K_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²

Simplifying:
2m_πc²K_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²

Therefore:
K_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)²/(2m_πc²)

Substituting numerical values (with c=1):
K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)²/(2 × 139.6)
K_μ = 33.9²/279.2

Computing 33.9²:
33.9 × 33.9 = 1149.21

So:
K_μ = 1149.21/279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV

Therefore, the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.116 MeV.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to calculate the kinetic energy of the particles produced when a positive pion (π+) decays into a positive muon (μ+) and a neutrino (ν). The pion starts off stationary. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The rest mass of the neutrino is practically zero, isn't it? Neutrinos have tiny masses, so we can assume it to be zero.

Initially, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve total momentum. Therefore, they will move in opposite directions with identical momentum magnitudes.

Energy conservation holds as well. Before decay, the total energy equals the rest energy of the pion, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies, incorporating rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Let’s specify: the pion's rest mass is m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², the muon's rest mass is m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's rest mass is approximately m_ν ≈ 0.

Let K_μ represent the muon's kinetic energy, and K_ν represent the neutrino's kinetic energy. Given the neutrino's negligible rest mass, its energy is almost purely kinetic, equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light since E = pc for massless particles.

The muon, however, possesses rest mass, so its total energy is E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. The neutrino's energy is expressed as E_ν = p_ν c, with p_ν as the neutrino's momentum magnitude.

From momentum conservation, the muon's momentum p_μ equals the neutrino's momentum p_ν in magnitude, albeit in opposite directions. Therefore, p_μ = p_ν = p.

Now, the total energy post-decay is E_total = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μ c² + K_μ) + p c.

The total energy pre-decay is m_π c². Hence:

m_π c² = m_μ c² + K_μ + p c.

Additionally, total momentum conservation implies p_μ = p_ν = p.

For the muon, the relation between total energy, momentum, and rest mass is given by:

E_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)².

As E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ, we have:

(m_μ c² + K_μ)² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)².

Expanding gives:

(m_μ c²)² + 2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μ c²)².

Removing (m_μ c²)² from both sides gives:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (p c)².

From energy conservation:

p c = m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ.

Substitute p c into the equation:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c² - K_μ)².

Expand the right side:

= (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ².

Equating both sides gives:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + K_μ² = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ + K_μ².

Subtract K_μ²:

2 m_μ c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² - 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ.

Move terms left:

2 m_μ c² K_μ + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²) K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² = 0.

Factor K_μ:

[2 m_μ c² + 2 (m_π c² - m_μ c²)] K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² = 0.

Simplify within brackets:

2 m_μ c² + 2 m_π c² - 2 m_μ c² = 2 m_π c².

Thus:

2 m_π c² K_μ - (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² = 0.

Solving gives:

2 m_π c² K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)².

Thus, K_μ = (m_π c² - m_μ c²)² / (2 m_π c²).

Mass terms in c² units cancel. Using MeV/c²: m_π c² is 139.6 MeV, m_μ c² is 105.7 MeV.

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6).

Numerator: (33.9)² = 1149.21 MeV².

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So, K_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

Hence, approximately K_μ ≈ 4.116 MeV.

The difference is 33.9 MeV, which is the total energy available for kinetic energy of the products. But since the neutrino is massless, it carries away some energy, and the muon gets the remaining. But according to this calculation, the muon\'s kinetic energy is only about 4.1 MeV. That seems low, but maybe that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the energy conservation.

So the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n(139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2 ≈ 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV\n\nSo the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the neutrino\'s kinetic energy would then be the remaining energy. Let\'s check:\n\nTotal energy available: m_pi c² - m_mu c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\nIf the muon has 4.116 MeV kinetic energy, then the neutrino\'s energy is 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\nBut since the neutrino is (approximately) massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c, and its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy. So the neutrino\'s kinetic energy is about 29.784 MeV.\n\nBut the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So both the muon and the neutrino have kinetic energy. But maybe the question is asking for the kinetic energy of the muon, since the neutrino\'s is harder to measure and maybe considered negligible? Wait, no, the neutrino does have significant kinetic energy here. But let me check the original question.\n\n"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nSo the product particles are mu(+) and nu. So we need to find the kinetic energy of both. But the problem might be expecting just the muon\'s KE, since the neutrino\'s is tricky. But let me check.\n\nWait, in particle physics, when a pion decays at rest into a muon and a neutrino, the muon gets a certain kinetic energy, and the neutrino gets the rest. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. The neutrino being nearly massless, its energy is approximately |p|c, and the muon\'s energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). The total energy is m_pi c^2. So combining these, we can solve for p, and then get the kinetic energy of the muon.\n\nBut according to the calculation above, the muon\'s kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino\'s is approximately 29.78 MeV.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay \(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\) where the pion is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses of the pion and muon are 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV respectively, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The pion is initially stationary, so the total momentum before decay is zero.
   - After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion: \(E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).
   - After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:
   - For the muon: \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}\)
   - For the neutrino: \(E_{\nu} = p c\) (since its rest mass is negligible)

4. **Energy Conservation Equation**:
   - \(E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}\)
   - Substituting the expressions for \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\):
     \[
     139.6 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c
     \]

5. **Solving for Momentum \(p\)**:
   - Let \(x = p c\), then:
     \[
     139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x
     \]
   - Solving this equation, we find \(x = \frac{(139.6^2 - 105.7^2)}{2 \cdot 139.6}\).

6. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:
   - The kinetic energy \(K_{\mu}\) is the total energy of the muon minus its rest energy:
     \[
     K_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (105.7)^2} - 105.7
     \]
   - Substituting the value of \(p c\) found above:
     \[
     K_{\mu} = \frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
     \]
   - Calculating the numerical value:
     \[
     K_{\mu} = \frac{(33.9)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

4.12 MeV.

But let me verify with exact division:

1149.21 ÷ 279.2

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

1149210 ÷ 279200

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 114921 / 27920

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 57460.5 / 13960

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 11492.1 / 2792

Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, use decimal division:

279.2 ) 1149.21

279.2 goes into 1149.21 how many times?

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

Subtract: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

Bring down a zero: 324.1

279.2 goes into 324.1 once (279.2), subtract: 324.1 - 279.2 = 44.9

Bring down a zero: 449.0

279.2 goes into 449 once again, 279.2, subtract: 449 - 279.2 = 169.8

Bring down a zero: 1698.0

279.2 goes into 1698 six times (279.2*6=1675.2), subtract: 1698 - 1675.2 = 22.8

Bring down a zero: 228.0

279.2 goes into 228.0 zero times. So decimal places so far: 4.116...

So approximately 4.116 MeV. So rounding to three decimal places, 4.116 MeV. But maybe we need to check if the initial calculation was correct.

Wait, but let me check the formula again. The kinetic energy of the muon is [(m_pi - m_mu)^2]/(2 m_pi). Let me plug in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So (139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9 MeV

33.9 squared is 1149.21 MeV²

Divide by (2 * 139.6) = 279.2 MeV

So 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV

Yes, that seems right.

But wait, the rest mass energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The difference is 33.9 MeV, which is the total energy available for kinetic energy of the products. But since the neutrino is massless, it carries away some energy, and the muon gets the remaining. But according to this calculation, the muon's kinetic energy is only about 4.1 MeV. That seems low, but maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the energy conservation. Let me check the steps again.

We started with:

Total energy before decay: m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV

Total energy after decay: E_mu + E_nu

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu

E_nu = p_nu c

Since momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_nu = p

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

But also, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = m_mu c² + K_mu

Squaring both sides:

(p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 = (m_mu c²)^2 + 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²

Cancel (m_mu c²)^2:

(p c)^2 = 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²

But from energy conservation:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c²

Which is:

m_mu c² + K_mu + p c = m_pi c²

So, p c = m_pi c² - m_mu c² - K_mu

Substitute into the previous equation:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c² - K_mu)^2 = 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²

Expanding the left side:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 - 2 (m_pi c² - m_mu c²) K_mu + K_mu² = 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²

Cancel K_mu² from both sides:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 - 2 (m_pi c² - m_mu c²) K_mu = 2 m_mu c² K_mu

Bring all terms to left side:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 - 2 (m_pi c² - m_mu c²) K_mu - 2 m_mu c² K_mu = 0

Factor out K_mu:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 - K_mu [2 (m_pi c² - m_mu c²) + 2 m_mu c²] = 0

Simplify the bracket:

2 (m_pi c² - m_mu c² + m_mu c²) = 2 m_pi c²

So:

(m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 - 2 m_pi c² K_mu = 0

Therefore:

2 m_pi c² K_mu = (m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2

So:

K_mu = (m_pi c² - m_mu c²)^2 / (2 m_pi c²)

Which is the same as before. So the calculation seems correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

(139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2 ≈ 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV

So the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV.

But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy would then be the remaining energy. Let's check:

Total energy available: m_pi c² - m_mu c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV

If the muon has 4.116 MeV kinetic energy, then the neutrino's energy is 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV

But since the neutrino is (approximately) massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c, and its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is about 29.784 MeV.

But the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So both the muon and the neutrino have kinetic energy. But maybe the question is asking for the kinetic energy of the muon, since the neutrino's is harder to measure and maybe considered negligible? Wait, no, the neutrino does have significant kinetic energy here. But let me check the original question.

"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

So the product particles are mu(+) and nu. So we need to find the kinetic energy of both. But the problem might be expecting just the muon's KE, since the neutrino's is tricky. But let me check.

Wait, in particle physics, when a pion decays at rest into a muon and a neutrino, the muon gets a certain kinetic energy, and the neutrino gets the rest. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. The neutrino being nearly massless, its energy is approximately |p|c, and the muon's energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). The total energy is m_pi c^2. So combining these, we can solve for p, and then get the kinetic energy of the muon.

But according to the calculation above, the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is approximately 29.78 MeV. But the question says "Find KE of product particles". So both? But maybe the answer is just the muon's KE, as the neutrino's is assumed to be all KE but not sure if they want it. Let me check standard results.

In pion decay at rest, the muon kinetic energy is given by [(m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi)] which is the same as we derived. Let me compute that:

(m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2

Which is (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 * 245.3

Compute 33.9 * 245.3:

First, 30 * 245.3 = 7359

3.9 * 245.3 = 956.67

Total: 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67

Then divide by (2 * 139.6) = 279.2

So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67

So 30 - (8376 - 8315.67)/279.2 ≈ 30 - 60.33 / 279.2 ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784

Wait, but that gives 29.784 MeV. Wait, but that contradicts the previous result. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the formula [(m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi)] is actually the total energy of the neutrino, not the muon's KE.

Wait, let me check:

From energy conservation:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c²

From momentum conservation:

|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p

For neutrino, E_nu = p c

For muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c²

Let’s let x = p c, then:

sqrt(x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = m_pi c²

Let’s subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = m_pi c² - x

Square both sides:

x² + (m_mu c²)^2 = (m_pi c² - x)^2

Expand the right side:

(m_pi c²)^2 - 2 m_pi c² x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(m_mu c²)^2 = (m_pi c²)^2 - 2 m_pi c² x

Rearrange:

2 m_pi c² x = (m_pi c²)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2

So,

x = [ (m_pi c²)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 ] / (2 m_pi c² )

But x is p c, so:

p c = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) c^4 ] / (2 m_pi c² ) = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) / (2 m_pi) ] c²

Therefore, E_nu = p c = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) / (2 m_pi) ] c²

Which is the same as:

E_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) / (2 m_pi )

In units where c=1, it's just (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )

So, plugging in the numbers:

(139.6² - 105.7²)/(2*139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/279.2 = (8315.67)/279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV

So the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.78 MeV, which is all kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Then the muon's kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy:

E_mu = m_pi c² - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV

Wait, but the rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV, which matches the previous result.

So, the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.78 MeV.

But the question says "Find KE of product particles". So both? But maybe the question expects just the muon's KE, since the neutrino's is hard to detect. But let me check standard problems. Typically, in pion decay at rest, the muon's kinetic energy is the value calculated here, around 4 MeV, and the neutrino gets the majority of the energy. So perhaps the answer is 4.12 MeV for the muon. But the problem statement says "product particles", plural, so maybe both? But the rest mass of the neutrino is negligible, so its KE is equal to its total energy, which is about 29.78 MeV.

But the problem might be expecting the answer in a specific way. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler formula. The kinetic energy of the muon in pion rest frame is given by:

K_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 m_pi )

Wait, but that was our initial formula. Wait, but when I calculated (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2*139.6) = 33.9² / 279.2 ≈ 4.12 MeV, which is correct.

Alternatively, let me check online for similar problems. For example, a common problem is: a pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon. The answer is (m_pi - m_mu)^2/(2 m_pi), which is about 4.12 MeV. So given that, and since the problem here says "product particles", but only provides the rest masses for the pion and muon, and not the neutrino, it's likely expecting just the muon's KE. 

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV. So I will go with that as the answer.

**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}.

But since the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, both the muon and the neutrino, but the neutrino\'s KE is equal to its total energy, which is 29.784 MeV.

But the problem might be expecting just the muon\'s KE. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nIt specifies the rest mass of the pion and the muon, but not the neutrino, which is negligible.

But the problem says "product particles", so both. However, the way the question is phrased, maybe they want the sum? But that\'s not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the muon. Let me check standard decay problems. For example, in the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, the muon\'s kinetic energy is given by the formula we derived, around 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino\'s energy is the rest energy of the pion minus the muon\'s rest energy and kinetic energy, which is about 29.78 MeV. But since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy. So the answer would be both. However, the problem might expect just the muon\'s KE.

Alternatively, check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a specific unit or rounded to a certain decimal. Let me compute 33.9 squared divided by 279.2:\n\n33.9 squared: 33*33=1089, 0.9*33=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81, so (33 + 0.9)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9² = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21.\n\nDivide by 279.2: 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV.\n\nSo approximately 4.12 MeV. The neutrino\'s energy is 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV.\n\nBut since the problem mentions "product particles", and the neutrino is a product, but maybe the answer is just the muon\'s KE. Alternatively, the total KE. But total KE would be 4.116 + 29.784 ≈ 33.9 MeV, which is equal to the pion\'s rest mass minus the muon\'s rest mass (139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9). But that\'s the total energy given to the products, which is the Q-value of the reaction. But KE is the total energy minus rest masses. Wait, no. The pion\'s rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon\'s rest energy is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has no rest mass. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 105.7 MeV. Therefore, the Q-value is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy shared between the products. But since the neutrino is massless, its KE is its total energy, which is 33.9 MeV - K_μ. But according to the earlier calculation, K_μ is 4.116 MeV, so the neutrino\'s KE is 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV. Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the products is 4.116 + 29.784 = 33.9 MeV, which matches the Q-value. But the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, which would be both. However, in many cases, especially in exams, when they ask for the KE in pion decay, they expect the muon\'s KE. But since the problem specifies "product particles", perhaps both. But the answer format here is a single box, so maybe they want the sum. But the sum is 33.9 MeV, which is the Q-value. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo and wants the KE of the muon. Given that, the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. But let me check with exact calculation.\n\nUsing exact values:\n\nm_π = 139.6 MeV/c²\n\nm_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\nK_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2m_π) = (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2*139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2\n\n33.9^2 = 33.9*33.9:\n\n33*33 = 1089\n\n33*0.9 = 29.7\n\n0.9*33 = 29.7\n\n0.9*0.9 = 0.81\n\nSo, 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21\n\nThen, 1149.21 / 279.2 = Let\'s compute this division:\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8\n\n1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41\n\nSo 4 + 32.41/279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116 MeV.\n\nSo approximately 4.12 MeV. Therefore, the muon\'s kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino\'s kinetic energy is about 29.78 MeV. But since the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, and there are two products, the answer should include both. However, given the way the question is presented, maybe only the muon\'s KE is expected. But to be thorough, perhaps both. However, in the context of the problem, since the neutrino\'s KE is its total energy, and the question might be expecting the KE of the massive particle, which is the muon. Given that, the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. But to confirm, let\'s see standard examples. For example, in the decay of a pion at rest, the muon\'s kinetic energy is indeed given by that formula, and the neutrino carries away the remaining energy. So the answer is 4.12 MeV for the muon. Therefore, the final answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. Rounding to two decimal places, 4.12 MeV, or maybe one decimal, 4.1 MeV. Let me check the exact value:\n\n33.9^2 = 1149.21\n\n1149.21 / 279.2 = 4.116 MeV.\n\nSo, 4.116 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. Depending on significant figures, the given masses have four significant figures (139.6 and 105.7), so the result should have three, so 4.12 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino\'s kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV. But since the problem says "product particles", and the answer requires boxing, perhaps both. But the problem might expect only the muon\'s KE. Given the standard treatment, I think the answer expected is the muon\'s KE, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. So I will box that.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is \\boxed{4.12 \\text{ MeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444436, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3898, prompt_tokens=967, total_tokens=4865, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν), we start by using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively, while the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Therefore, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite.

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( m_{\pi}c^2 \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy.

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:
   For the muon, the total energy \( E_{\mu} \) is given by:
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_{\mu}c^2)^2
   \]
   where \( p \) is the momentum of the muon (and neutrino).

4. **Energy Conservation Equation**:
   The total energy after decay is:
   \[
   m_{\pi}c^2 = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   Since the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic and equals its momentum times the speed of light, \( E_{\nu} = p c \).

5. **Solving for Kinetic Energy**:
   Using the conservation equations and the energy-momentum relation, we derive the kinetic energy of the muon \( K_{\mu} \):
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{(m_{\pi} - m_{\mu})^2}{2m_{\pi}} c^2
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{(139.6 \, \text{MeV} - 105.7 \, \text{MeV})^2}{2 \times 139.6 \, \text{MeV}}
   \]
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{(33.9 \, \text{MeV})^2}{279.2 \, \text{MeV}}
   \]
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{1149.21 \, \text{MeV}^2}{279.2 \, \text{MeV}} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}. The neutrino's kinetic energy, which is its total energy, is approximately 29.78 MeV, but the problem specifically asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles, and the primary answer expected is the muon's kinetic energy.

The neutrino's energy would be the remaining energy, which is m_πc² - m_μc² - K_μ = 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV, but since the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is essentially its total energy (29.784 MeV), but the question might only be asking for the muon's KE. However, the problem states "KE of product particles," which includes both. But since neutrinos have negligible rest mass, their KE is their total energy. However, in the context of particle physics, when they say "kinetic energy," for the neutrino, since m=0, KE = total energy. But the problem might be expecting only the muon's KE. Wait, let me check the problem again.

The problem says: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu". So both the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's KE is its total energy, which is 29.784 MeV, and the muon's KE is 4.116 MeV. But maybe the question is only asking for the muon's KE? Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

It says "product particles", which are mu+ and nu. So both. But the answer might need to specify both. However, in typical problems like this, sometimes they only ask for the charged particle's KE, but the problem says "product particles", plural. So perhaps both. But the way the problem is phrased, maybe the answer is the sum? But no, they are separate. Let me check standard pion decay.

In pion decay at rest, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. The muon's kinetic energy is given by the formula K_μ = ((m_π² - m_μ²)/(2m_π)) - m_μ. Wait, no. Wait, let's re-express the earlier result.

Wait, the formula I derived was K_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2/(2m_π). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, the formula is K_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2/(2m_π). Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, in the equation:

K_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)^2/(2m_πc²)

But since the units are in MeV, and c² is factored into the masses (i.e., the masses are given in MeV/c²), then when we write m_πc², that's 139.6 MeV. So substituting:

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)^2/(2*139.6) = (33.9)^2/(279.2) ≈ 1149.21/279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV. But since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so 29.784 MeV.

But the problem says "Find KE of product particles". So both the muon and the neutrino. However, in some contexts, people might refer to the neutrino's energy as just energy, but since it's massless, KE is the same as total energy. So the answer would be both 4.116 MeV and 29.784 MeV. But the problem might expect only the muon's KE. Let me check standard textbook problems. For example, in the decay of a pion at rest, the muon's kinetic energy is given by that formula. The neutrino's energy is the remaining energy. So perhaps the answer is the muon's KE, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. But let me verify the calculation again.

Alternatively, using energy and momentum conservation:

Total energy: E_π = m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν

Total momentum: 0 = p_μ + p_ν => |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p

For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²

For the neutrino: E_ν = pc

So substituting E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ into E_ν = pc:

pc = m_πc² - E_μ

Then, substitute into E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²:

E_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)^2 + (m_μc²)^2

Expanding the right side:

E_μ² = m_π²c^4 - 2m_πc²E_μ + E_μ² + m_μ²c^4

Cancel E_μ² from both sides:

0 = m_π²c^4 - 2m_πc²E_μ + m_μ²c^4

Rearranging:

2m_πc²E_μ = m_π²c^4 + m_μ²c^4

Divide both sides by 2m_πc²:

E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2m_π) * c^4 / c² = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2m_π) c²

But E_μ is the total energy of the muon, which is m_μc² + K_μ. Therefore:

m_μc² + K_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2m_π) c²

Multiply both sides by 2m_π:

2m_πm_μc² + 2m_πK_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)c²

Subtract 2m_πm_μc² from both sides:

2m_πK_μ = (m_π² + m_μ² - 2m_πm_μ)c²

Factor the right side:

2m_πK_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2 c²

Therefore:

K_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2 c² / (2m_π)

Since the masses are given in MeV/c², substituting:

K_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2*139.6) MeV

Which is the same as before: 33.9² / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV. But since the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, both the muon and the neutrino, but the neutrino's KE is equal to its total energy, which is 29.784 MeV. However, in some contexts, especially if the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, then its kinetic energy is indeed its total energy. So the answer would be both values. But the problem might be expecting just the muon's KE. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

It specifies the rest mass of the pion and the muon, but not the neutrino, which is negligible. The product particles are mu+ and nu, so both. Therefore, the answer should include both kinetic energies. However, in many textbooks, when they ask for the kinetic energy in pion decay, they refer to the muon's kinetic energy, as the neutrino's is harder to measure. But the problem says "product particles", so both. However, the way the question is phrased, maybe they want the sum? But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the muon. Let me check standard decay problems. For example, in the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, the muon's kinetic energy is given by the formula we derived, around 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is the rest energy of the pion minus the muon's rest energy and kinetic energy, which is about 29.78 MeV.

But given that it says "product particles", plural, perhaps both. But the problem might not have enough space for two answers, but the way it's asked, maybe they want the KE of the muon. Alternatively, check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a specific unit or rounded to a certain decimal. Let me compute 33.9 squared divided by 279.2:

33.9 squared: 33*33=1089, 0.9*33=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81, so (33 + 0.9)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9² = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21.

Divide by 279.2: 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

So approximately 4.12 MeV. The neutrino's energy is 139.6 - 105.7 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV.

But since the problem mentions "product particles", and the neutrino is a product, but maybe the answer is just the muon's KE. Alternatively, the total KE. But total KE would be 4.116 + 29.784 ≈ 33.9 MeV, which is equal to the pion's rest mass minus the muon's rest mass (139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9). But that's the total energy given to the products, which is the Q-value of the reaction. But KE is the total energy minus rest masses. Wait, no. The pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has no rest mass. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 105.7 MeV. Therefore, the Q-value is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy shared between the products. But since the neutrino is massless, its KE is its total energy, which is 33.9 MeV - K_μ. But according to the earlier calculation, K_μ is 4.116 MeV, so the neutrino's KE is 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV. Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the products is 4.116 + 29.784 = 33.9 MeV, which matches the Q-value. But the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, which would be both. However, in many cases, especially in exams, when they ask for the KE in pion decay, they expect the muon's KE. But since the problem specifies "product particles", perhaps both. But the answer format here is a single box, so maybe they want the sum. But the sum is 33.9 MeV, which is the Q-value. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo and wants the KE of the muon. Given that, the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. But let me check with exact calculation.

Using exact values:

m_π = 139.6 MeV/c²

m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²

K_μ = (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2m_π) = (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2*139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2

33.9^2 = 33.9*33.9:

33*33 = 1089

33*0.9 = 29.7

0.9*33 = 29.7

0.9*0.9 = 0.81

So, 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21

Then, 1149.21 / 279.2 = Let's compute this division:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

So 4 + 32.41/279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

So approximately 4.12 MeV. Therefore, the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is about 29.78 MeV. But since the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, and there are two products, the answer should include both. However, given the way the question is presented, maybe only the muon's KE is expected. But to be thorough, perhaps both. However, in the context of the problem, since the neutrino's KE is its total energy, and the question might be expecting the KE of the massive particle, which is the muon. Given that, the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. But to confirm, let's see standard examples. For example, in the decay of a pion at rest, the muon's kinetic energy is indeed given by that formula, and the neutrino carries away the remaining energy. So the answer is 4.12 MeV for the muon. Therefore, the final answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. Rounding to two decimal places, 4.12 MeV, or maybe one decimal, 4.1 MeV. Let me check the exact value:

33.9^2 = 1149.21

1149.21 / 279.2 = 4.116 MeV.

So, 4.116 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. Depending on significant figures, the given masses have four significant figures (139.6 and 105.7), so the result should have three, so 4.12 MeV.

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV. But since the problem says "product particles", and the answer requires boxing, perhaps both. But the problem might expect only the muon's KE. Given the standard treatment, I think the answer expected is the muon's KE, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. So I will box that.


**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}.

Squared is 33.9 * 33.9. Let me compute that:\n\n33 * 33 = 1089, 0.9 * 33 = 29.7, 33 * 0.9 = 29.7, 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. So total is 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21. Correct.\n\nDivide by 2 * 139.6 = 279.2. 1149.21 / 279.2. Let\'s compute:\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. So 4 + 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116. So yes, approximately 4.116 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if the formula is correct. The formula for kinetic energy in two-body decay when one particle is massless. The standard formula for the kinetic energy of the massive particle is K = (Δm)^2 / (2 m_π), where Δm is the mass difference. So, (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, using energy and momentum conservation. Let me check with another approach.\n\nTotal energy of pion: E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) and E_nu = p c.\n\nSo, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.\n\nLet’s set x = p c. Then:\n\nsqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.\n\nLet’s subtract x from both sides:\n\nsqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2 = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x + x².\n\nCancel x²:\n\n105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x.\n\nSolve for x:\n\n2 * 139.6 x = 139.6² - 105.7².\n\nx = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6).\n\nUsing difference of squares: (a² - b²) = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nSo, x = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) / (2 * 139.6).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(33.9)(245.3) = 33.9 * 245.3. Let\'s compute:\n\n33 * 245.3 = 33 * 200 + 33 * 45.3 = 6600 + 1494.9 = 8094.9\n\n0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77\n\nTotal: 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67\n\nDenominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2\n\nx = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.\n\nSo, x = p c = 29.78 MeV. Then, the neutrino\'s energy is 29.78 MeV.\n\nThe muon\'s energy is E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let\'s compute:\n\n29.78² ≈ 886.8, 105.7² ≈ 11172.5. Sum ≈ 886.8 + 11172.5 ≈ 12059.3. Square root of 12059.3 ≈ 109.8 MeV.\n\nSo, E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV. The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 ≈ 4.1 MeV. Which matches the previous result. So, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.1 MeV. The neutrino\'s kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV, but since its rest mass is zero, all its energy is kinetic. So, the neutrino\'s KE is 29.78 MeV. But the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So, both the muon and the neutrino. But in the problem statement, it\'s written as Pi+ → mu+ + nu. The neutrino here is actually a muon neutrino, but regardless, the KE of the products would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino. However, the problem might be asking for the KE of the muon only, since the neutrino\'s KE is tricky (as it\'s massless, KE = total energy). But let\'s check the problem statement again.\n\n"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nSo, the product particles are mu+ and nu. The problem says "Find KE of product particles", so both. But in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, one massive and one massless, the massless one carries away energy, and the massive one has KE. But since the neutrino is (nearly) massless, its KE is equal to its total energy. So, the KE of the products would be the sum of the muon\'s KE and the neutrino\'s KE. But in the problem, maybe they just want the KE of the muon? Let me check.\n\nBut the problem says "product particles", plural. So, perhaps both. But in the problem statement, the rest mass of the neutrino is not given, so perhaps they expect us to assume it\'s zero, and thus the neutrino\'s KE is equal to its energy. So, the total KE would be K_mu + K_nu = 4.1 + 29.78 ≈ 33.88 MeV. But the total energy released is the rest mass difference, which is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So, that\'s the Q value of the reaction. The total kinetic energy should be equal to the Q value, which is 33.9 MeV. So, 4.1 + 29.78 ≈ 33.88, which is approximately 33.9, considering rounding. So, that\'s correct.\n\nBut the problem might be asking for the KE of each product. If so, then the muon\'s KE is approximately 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino\'s KE is approximately 29.8 MeV. But the problem says "Find KE of product particles". If it\'s asking for both, then both. But maybe the question is in a context where only the muon\'s KE is considered, as the neutrino\'s KE is not typically measured. But the problem statement doesn\'t specify. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nIt says "product particles", which are mu+ and nu. So, both. But since the rest mass of the neutrino is not given, we can assume it\'s zero, so its KE is equal to its energy. Therefore, the answer would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino, which are 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. However, in many textbooks, when dealing with pion decay, the kinetic energy of the muon is the value calculated here, and the neutrino\'s energy is just the remaining energy. But since the problem says "KE of product particles", plural, perhaps we need to state both. But let me check standard problems. For example, in pion decay at rest, the muon gets a kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino takes away the rest. So, maybe the question is expecting just the muon\'s KE. But the problem statement is ambiguous. However, given that the rest mass of the neutrino is not provided, and in high energy physics, neutrinos are treated as massless in such calculations, so their KE is their total energy. Therefore, the answer is two values. But the problem might be expecting the KE of the muon only, as the neutrino\'s KE is harder to detect. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as "Find KE of product particles", which could be interpreted as the sum. But the sum is the Q value, which is 33.9 MeV. But that\'s just the total energy released. However, in reality, the total kinetic energy is the sum of both particles\' KE. Since the pion was at rest, all the energy goes into the rest mass of the muon and the kinetic energies. So, m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu. Therefore, K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV, which is the total KE. But the problem might be asking for the individual KEs. If so, then 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV. But since the problem mentions "product particles" without specifying, perhaps both. But in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the answer is the KE of the muon, which is 4.1 MeV. However, in the calculation above, we found that the muon\'s KE is approximately 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino\'s energy is approximately 29.8 MeV. But since the problem gives the rest mass of the pion and the muon, but not the neutrino, perhaps the answer is just the muon\'s KE. Let me check standard pion decay problems. For example, in standard textbooks, the pion decay at rest results in the muon having a kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV. So, that\'s the answer they are looking for. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 MeV. But let me check the exact value.\n\nUsing exact calculation:\n\nK_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 m_pi) * c²\n\nSo, (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2\n\n33.9 squared is 33.9 * 33.9. Let\'s compute 34 * 34 = 1156, subtract 0.1*34 + 0.1*34 - 0.1^2 = 3.4 + 3.4 - 0.01 = 6.8 - 0.01 = 6.79. So, 1156 - 6.79 = 1149.21. Then, 1149.21 / 279.2. Let\'s divide 1149.21 by 279.2.\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116. So total is 4.116. So, approximately 4.116 MeV. Rounding to two decimal places, 4.12 MeV. But maybe to three significant figures, since the given masses are to one decimal place. The masses are 139.6 and 105.7, which are four significant figures each. The difference is 33.9, three significant figures. Then squared is three significant figures, divided by 139.6 (four sig figs), so the result should have three significant figures. 4.116 ≈ 4.12 MeV. But perhaps the answer is expected in a precise value. Alternatively, maybe an exact fraction.\n\nAlternatively, using exact computation:\n\n(33.9)^2 = 33.9 * 33.9. Let\'s compute 30*33.9 = 1017, 3.9*33.9 = 132.21. Total is 1017 + 132.21 = 1149.21. Then, 1149.21 / 279.2. Let\'s compute this division.\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8\n\n1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41\n\n32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.1161\n\nSo total is 4.1161 MeV. So, approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nBut in some textbooks, the exact value is 4.1 MeV. For example, commonly, the muon kinetic energy in pion decay is about 4.1 MeV. So, depending on the required precision, 4.1 MeV or 4.12 MeV. Since the given data is in one decimal place (139.6 and 105.7), the answer should be in one decimal place. So, 4.1 MeV. But let\'s check:\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n33.9 squared is 1149.21\n\n1149.21 divided by 279.2 (which is 2*139.6) is 4.116...\n\nSo, 4.116 MeV. If we take one decimal place, it\'s 4.1 MeV. If two decimal places, 4.12 MeV. But given the original data has one decimal place, 4.1 MeV is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer without rounding, so 4.12 MeV. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s use exact fractions. Let me express the masses as 1396/10 and 1057/10.\n\nSo, m_pi = 1396/10 MeV/c², m_mu = 1057/10 MeV/c².\n\nThen, K_mu = ( (1396/10 - 1057/10 )^2 ) / (2 * 1396/10 )\n\n= ( (339/10)^2 ) / (2792/10 )\n\n= (114921/100) / (2792/10 )\n\n= (114921/100) * (10/2792)\n\n= 114921 / 27920\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 11492.1 / 2792\n\nApproximately, 11492.1 ÷ 2792 ≈ 4.116. So, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the exact value is approximately 4.116 MeV. Depending on the required precision, but since the problem gives masses to one decimal place, the answer should be to one decimal place: 4.1 MeV.\n\nBut in particle physics, this value is known to be approximately 4.1 MeV. So, the answer is 4.1 MeV. However, to be precise, let\'s use the exact calculation:\n\n33.9^2 / (2*139.6) = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV. So, 4.12 MeV when rounded to three significant figures. But the given data has four significant figures (139.6 and 105.7), so maybe we can keep two decimal places. Wait, 139.6 is four significant figures, 105.7 is four as well. The difference 33.9 is three significant figures. Then squared is three, divided by 139.6 (four), so the result is three significant figures. 4.116 is four, but since the numerator has three, the result should be three: 4.12 MeV. Hmm, but 33.9 is three significant figures, so (33.9)^2 is three, and dividing by 139.6 (four) gives three. So, 4.12 MeV with three significant figures.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in a box, so likely 4.1 MeV or 4.12 MeV. Let me check with exact decimals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be written as (m_pi - m_mu)^2/(2 m_pi) which is an exact expression. But plugging in the numbers gives approximately 4.1 MeV. Given that, I think the answer is 4.1 MeV. However, to confirm, let me refer to a standard pion decay problem. For example, according to the textbook "Introduction to Elementary Particles" by Griffiths, the kinetic energy of the muon in pion decay at rest is indeed approximately 4.1 MeV. So, the answer is 4.1 MeV.\n\nBut just to ensure, let\'s recast the units properly. All masses are given in MeV/c². So, when we calculate K_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2/(2 m_pi), the units would be (MeV/c²)^2 / (MeV/c²) = MeV. So, the units work out. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is \\boxed{4.1 \\text{ MeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444604, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4350, prompt_tokens=1283, total_tokens=5633, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay \(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\) where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses of the pion and muon are 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV respectively, and the neutrino's mass is negligible.

1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The pion is initially stationary, so the total momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta: \(p_\mu = p_\nu = p\).

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion: \(E_{\text{initial}} = m_\pi c^2 = 139.6 \text{ MeV}\).
   - The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino: \(E_{\text{final}} = E_\mu + E_\nu\).

3. **Energy of the Muon**:
   - The energy of the muon is \(E_\mu = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2}\).
   - The kinetic energy of the muon is \(K_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu c^2\).

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:
   - The energy of the neutrino is \(E_\nu = p c\) (since its mass is negligible).

5. **Solving for Momentum**:
   - Using energy conservation: \(m_\pi c^2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2} + p c\).
   - Let \(x = p c\), then solve the equation: \(\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6\).
   - Solving this gives \(x = \frac{(139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7)}{2 \times 139.6}\).

6. **Calculating Kinetic Energy**:
   - The kinetic energy of the muon is found using the formula: \(K_\mu = \frac{(m_\pi - m_\mu)^2}{2 m_\pi}\).
   - Substituting the values: \(K_\mu = \frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6}\).

After performing the calculations, the kinetic energy of the muon is found to be approximately 4.1 MeV. The neutrino's kinetic energy is the remaining energy, but since the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles and the neutrino's energy is typically not measured, the answer focuses on the muon.

\[
\boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}

Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 139.6 - 105.7 is 33.9. Squared is 33.9 * 33.9. Let me compute that:

33 * 33 = 1089, 0.9 * 33 = 29.7, 33 * 0.9 = 29.7, 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. So total is 1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 + 0.81 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21. Correct.

Divide by 2 * 139.6 = 279.2. 1149.21 / 279.2. Let's compute:

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. So 4 + 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 4 + 0.116 ≈ 4.116. So yes, approximately 4.116 MeV.

But let me check if the formula is correct. The formula for kinetic energy in two-body decay when one particle is massless. The standard formula for the kinetic energy of the massive particle is K = (Δm)^2 / (2 m_π), where Δm is the mass difference. So, (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV. That seems right.

Alternatively, using energy and momentum conservation. Let me check with another approach.

Total energy of pion: E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) and E_nu = p c.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Let’s set x = p c. Then:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Let’s subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Square both sides:

x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2 = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x + x².

Cancel x²:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x.

Solve for x:

2 * 139.6 x = 139.6² - 105.7².

x = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6).

Using difference of squares: (a² - b²) = (a - b)(a + b).

So, x = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) / (2 * 139.6).

Compute numerator:

(33.9)(245.3) = 33.9 * 245.3. Let's compute:

33 * 245.3 = 33 * 200 + 33 * 45.3 = 6600 + 1494.9 = 8094.9

0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77

Total: 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So, x = p c = 29.78 MeV. Then, the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute:

29.78² ≈ 886.8, 105.7² ≈ 11172.5. Sum ≈ 886.8 + 11172.5 ≈ 12059.3. Square root of 12059.3 ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So, E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV. The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 ≈ 4.1 MeV. Which matches the previous result. So, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.1 MeV. The neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV, but since its rest mass is zero, all its energy is kinetic. So, the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV. But the question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So, both the muon and the neutrino. But in the problem statement, it's written as Pi+ → mu+ + nu. The neutrino here is actually a muon neutrino, but regardless, the KE of the products would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino. However, the problem might be asking for the KE of the muon only, since the neutrino's KE is tricky (as it's massless, KE = total energy). But let's check the problem statement again.

"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

So, the product particles are mu+ and nu. The problem says "Find KE of product particles", so both. But in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, one massive and one massless, the massless one carries away energy, and the massive one has KE. But since the neutrino is (nearly) massless, its KE is equal to its total energy. So, the KE of the products would be the sum of the muon's KE and the neutrino's KE. But in the problem, maybe they just want the KE of the muon? Let me check.

But the problem says "product particles", plural. So, perhaps both. But in the problem statement, the rest mass of the neutrino is not given, so perhaps they expect us to assume it's zero, and thus the neutrino's KE is equal to its energy. So, the total KE would be K_mu + K_nu = 4.1 + 29.78 ≈ 33.88 MeV. But the total energy released is the rest mass difference, which is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So, that's the Q value of the reaction. The total kinetic energy should be equal to the Q value, which is 33.9 MeV. So, 4.1 + 29.78 ≈ 33.88, which is approximately 33.9, considering rounding. So, that's correct.

But the problem might be asking for the KE of each product. If so, then the muon's KE is approximately 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.8 MeV. But the problem says "Find KE of product particles". If it's asking for both, then both. But maybe the question is in a context where only the muon's KE is considered, as the neutrino's KE is not typically measured. But the problem statement doesn't specify. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

It says "product particles", which are mu+ and nu. So, both. But since the rest mass of the neutrino is not given, we can assume it's zero, so its KE is equal to its energy. Therefore, the answer would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino, which are 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. However, in many textbooks, when dealing with pion decay, the kinetic energy of the muon is the value calculated here, and the neutrino's energy is just the remaining energy. But since the problem says "KE of product particles", plural, perhaps we need to state both. But let me check standard problems. For example, in pion decay at rest, the muon gets a kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino takes away the rest. So, maybe the question is expecting just the muon's KE. But the problem statement is ambiguous. However, given that the rest mass of the neutrino is not provided, and in high energy physics, neutrinos are treated as massless in such calculations, so their KE is their total energy. Therefore, the answer is two values. But the problem might be expecting the KE of the muon only, as the neutrino's KE is harder to detect. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as "Find KE of product particles", which could be interpreted as the sum. But the sum is the Q value, which is 33.9 MeV. But that's just the total energy released. However, in reality, the total kinetic energy is the sum of both particles' KE. Since the pion was at rest, all the energy goes into the rest mass of the muon and the kinetic energies. So, m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu. Therefore, K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV, which is the total KE. But the problem might be asking for the individual KEs. If so, then 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV. But since the problem mentions "product particles" without specifying, perhaps both. But in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the answer is the KE of the muon, which is 4.1 MeV. However, in the calculation above, we found that the muon's KE is approximately 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.8 MeV. But since the problem gives the rest mass of the pion and the muon, but not the neutrino, perhaps the answer is just the muon's KE. Let me check standard pion decay problems. For example, in standard textbooks, the pion decay at rest results in the muon having a kinetic energy of about 4.1 MeV. So, that's the answer they are looking for. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 MeV. But let me check the exact value.

Using exact calculation:

K_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 m_pi) * c²

So, (139.6 - 105.7)^2 / (2 * 139.6) = (33.9)^2 / 279.2

33.9 squared is 33.9 * 33.9. Let's compute 34 * 34 = 1156, subtract 0.1*34 + 0.1*34 - 0.1^2 = 3.4 + 3.4 - 0.01 = 6.8 - 0.01 = 6.79. So, 1156 - 6.79 = 1149.21. Then, 1149.21 / 279.2. Let's divide 1149.21 by 279.2.

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116. So total is 4.116. So, approximately 4.116 MeV. Rounding to two decimal places, 4.12 MeV. But maybe to three significant figures, since the given masses are to one decimal place. The masses are 139.6 and 105.7, which are four significant figures each. The difference is 33.9, three significant figures. Then squared is three significant figures, divided by 139.6 (four sig figs), so the result should have three significant figures. 4.116 ≈ 4.12 MeV. But perhaps the answer is expected in a precise value. Alternatively, maybe an exact fraction.

Alternatively, using exact computation:

(33.9)^2 = 33.9 * 33.9. Let's compute 30*33.9 = 1017, 3.9*33.9 = 132.21. Total is 1017 + 132.21 = 1149.21. Then, 1149.21 / 279.2. Let's compute this division.

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8

1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.1161

So total is 4.1161 MeV. So, approximately 4.12 MeV.

But in some textbooks, the exact value is 4.1 MeV. For example, commonly, the muon kinetic energy in pion decay is about 4.1 MeV. So, depending on the required precision, 4.1 MeV or 4.12 MeV. Since the given data is in one decimal place (139.6 and 105.7), the answer should be in one decimal place. So, 4.1 MeV. But let's check:

139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9

33.9 squared is 1149.21

1149.21 divided by 279.2 (which is 2*139.6) is 4.116...

So, 4.116 MeV. If we take one decimal place, it's 4.1 MeV. If two decimal places, 4.12 MeV. But given the original data has one decimal place, 4.1 MeV is appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer without rounding, so 4.12 MeV. But I need to check.

Alternatively, let's use exact fractions. Let me express the masses as 1396/10 and 1057/10.

So, m_pi = 1396/10 MeV/c², m_mu = 1057/10 MeV/c².

Then, K_mu = ( (1396/10 - 1057/10 )^2 ) / (2 * 1396/10 )

= ( (339/10)^2 ) / (2792/10 )

= (114921/100) / (2792/10 )

= (114921/100) * (10/2792)

= 114921 / 27920

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 11492.1 / 2792

Approximately, 11492.1 ÷ 2792 ≈ 4.116. So, same as before.

Therefore, the exact value is approximately 4.116 MeV. Depending on the required precision, but since the problem gives masses to one decimal place, the answer should be to one decimal place: 4.1 MeV.

But in particle physics, this value is known to be approximately 4.1 MeV. So, the answer is 4.1 MeV. However, to be precise, let's use the exact calculation:

33.9^2 / (2*139.6) = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV. So, 4.12 MeV when rounded to three significant figures. But the given data has four significant figures (139.6 and 105.7), so maybe we can keep two decimal places. Wait, 139.6 is four significant figures, 105.7 is four as well. The difference 33.9 is three significant figures. Then squared is three, divided by 139.6 (four), so the result is three significant figures. 4.116 is four, but since the numerator has three, the result should be three: 4.12 MeV. Hmm, but 33.9 is three significant figures, so (33.9)^2 is three, and dividing by 139.6 (four) gives three. So, 4.12 MeV with three significant figures.

But the problem might expect the answer in a box, so likely 4.1 MeV or 4.12 MeV. Let me check with exact decimals.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be written as (m_pi - m_mu)^2/(2 m_pi) which is an exact expression. But plugging in the numbers gives approximately 4.1 MeV. Given that, I think the answer is 4.1 MeV. However, to confirm, let me refer to a standard pion decay problem. For example, according to the textbook "Introduction to Elementary Particles" by Griffiths, the kinetic energy of the muon in pion decay at rest is indeed approximately 4.1 MeV. So, the answer is 4.1 MeV.

But just to ensure, let's recast the units properly. All masses are given in MeV/c². So, when we calculate K_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2/(2 m_pi), the units would be (MeV/c²)^2 / (MeV/c²) = MeV. So, the units work out. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 MeV.

**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}.
