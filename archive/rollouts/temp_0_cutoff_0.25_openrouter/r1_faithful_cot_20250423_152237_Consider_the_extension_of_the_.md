# Original Question

Consider the extension of the Standard Model given by the following Lagrangian

\mathcal{L}\subset i\bar{N}_{R}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}N_{R}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}+\left|D^{\mu}S\right|^{2}-\frac{y_{i}}{2}\phi\bar{N}_{iR}^{c}N_{iR}^{c}-g_{i\alpha}\bar{N}_{iR}L_{\alpha}S-V\left(\phi,S,H\right)
with singlet fermions,$N{iR}\sim\left(1,1,0\right)$, scalar-doublet $S\sim\left(1,2,1\right)$, and singlet scalar $\phi\sim\left(1,1,0\right)$. We give $\left\langle \phi\right\rangle ^{2}=\left(x^{2}+\upsilon^{2}\right)$, where $\left\langle \phi\right\rangle =x$ and $\left\langle h\right\rangle =v$.

What is the approximation of the mass of the pseudo-Goldostone boson $H_{2}$ through radiative corrections?

The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) arises through radiative corrections primarily from loops involving the singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \), which couple to both the singlet scalar \( \phi \) and the scalar doublet \( S \). The dominant contribution comes from the Yukawa interactions \( y_i \phi \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c \) and \( g_{i\alpha} \bar{N}_{iR} L_\alpha S \), where the Majorana mass \( M_i = y_i x \) and the electroweak scale \( v \) set the relevant scales. The one-loop correction generates a mass term proportional to the product of these couplings and the vacuum expectation values (VEVs), suppressed by the loop factor \( 1/16\pi^2 \).

**Approximation of the mass of \( H_2 \):**
\[
m_{H_2} \sim \frac{y g v}{4\pi}
\]
where \( y \) and \( g \) are typical Yukawa couplings, and \( v \) is the Higgs VEV. This result reflects the interplay between the symmetry-breaking scales and quantum corrections, characteristic of pseudo-Goldstone boson masses in such extensions of the Standard Model.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ in this model. Let me start by recalling what the question is about. The Lagrangian given includes some singlet fermions N_R, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ. The potential V(φ, S, H) isn't specified, but the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If ⟨φ⟩ is x, then ⟨φ⟩² should just be x². But the problem states ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Maybe that's a typo or maybe h is the Higgs field? Since the Higgs usually has a VEV v, so maybe ⟨H⟩ = v, and ⟨φ⟩ = x, and the total is x² + v². Hmm, perhaps the potential is such that when both φ and H get VEVs, their squares add up. But I need to be careful here.

First, let's parse the fields and their representations. The fields are:

- N_{iR}: right-handed singlet fermions, transforming as (1,1,0) under the SM gauge group. So they are singlets under SU(3), SU(2), and U(1). So they don't interact via the strong or electroweak force, except possibly through the terms given in the Lagrangian.

- S: a scalar doublet, (1,2,1). So it's an SU(2) doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs doublet H. So S would have components like (S⁺, S⁰) maybe. Its charge is 1, so the upper component would have hypercharge 1/2 + 1 = 3/2? Wait, hypercharge for doublets: the hypercharge Y is such that Q = T₃ + Y/2. For the Higgs doublet H, which is (1,2,1), the hypercharge is 1. So the upper component (charged) has T₃ = 1/2, so Q = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is H⁺, and the lower component is H⁰ with T₃ = -1/2, Q = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0. Similarly, S is (1,2,1), so same as the Higgs. So S would be a doublet with components S⁺ and S⁰. But since S is a scalar, maybe it's a new scalar doublet, different from the Higgs.

- φ: a singlet scalar, (1,1,0), so no charge under any SM group.

The Lagrangian terms are:

1. iN̄_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R: kinetic term for the singlet fermions.

2. (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2: kinetic term for the singlet scalar φ.

3. |D^μ S|²: kinetic term for the scalar doublet S, with covariant derivative D_μ, which would include the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields.

4. -(y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c: Yukawa coupling between φ and the charge-conjugated right-handed neutrinos. Since N_R is a singlet, the charge conjugate N_R^c would also be a singlet. The term is a Majorana mass term for the N_R when φ gets a VEV.

5. -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S: Another Yukawa term, coupling N_R to the lepton doublet L_α and the scalar S. This is similar to the usual Yukawa coupling in the type-I seesaw, but here the Higgs is replaced by S. When S gets a VEV, this would generate a Dirac mass term between the N_R and the left-handed neutrinos.

6. The potential V(φ, S, H): which includes the interactions between φ, S, and the Higgs H. Since the VEVs are given for φ and H, but S is another scalar doublet, I need to think about how they interact.

The VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Wait, but ⟨h⟩ is the VEV of the Higgs H, which is (1,2,1), so its VEV is in the neutral component. So H has a VEV v, and φ has a VEV x. The sum of their squares is x² + v². But why is that written as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v²? That would imply that ⟨φ⟩² is not just x² but x² + v². That seems contradictory unless there's a relation between the VEVs. Maybe the potential is such that the combination x² + v² is fixed? For example, maybe the potential has a term like (|φ|² + |H|² - Λ²)², leading to a VEV where |φ|² + |H|² = Λ². Then x² + v² = Λ². But the problem states ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which would mean that x² = x² + v², implying v = 0, which can't be. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check again.

The problem says: "We give ⟨φ⟩² = (x² + v²), where ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v." So ⟨φ⟩ is x, so ⟨φ⟩² is x², but they write ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². That can't be unless v = 0, but ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the Higgs VEV, which is 246 GeV. So this must be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be ⟨S⟩² + ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v²? Or maybe ⟨S⟩ and ⟨φ⟩ have VEVs such that their squares add up to x² + v². Wait, but S is a doublet, so its VEV would be a SU(2) VEV. If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, then its neutral component would have hypercharge Y = 1, so the neutral component would have charge Q = T₃ + Y/2 = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0. So S can have a VEV in its neutral component. But if S gets a VEV, that would contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking. However, the problem mentions ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the usual Higgs VEV. So perhaps S does not get a VEV, and only φ and H (the Higgs) get VEVs. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². That still doesn't make sense unless x² + v² is the total, but ⟨φ⟩ is x, so ⟨φ⟩² is x². Therefore, maybe it's a typo, and they meant that the sum of the squares of the VEVs is x² + v². But the way it's written is confusing. Maybe the potential is such that when you expand around the VEVs, the combination x² + v² appears. Alternatively, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and H, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone boson when the symmetry is broken.

But moving on. The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. So H₂ is one of the scalar bosons in the model. Since we have multiple scalars: φ (singlet), S (doublet), and the standard Higgs H (doublet). Wait, the problem mentions the potential V(φ, S, H), so H is the standard Higgs doublet. So the scalar sector includes φ, S, and H. The VEVs are for φ and H, but S might not get a VEV? Or does it? If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, it can get a VEV, but that would break the electroweak symmetry. However, the standard Higgs H already does that with VEV v. If S also gets a VEV, that would lead to additional Goldstone bosons, but since the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone, maybe there's a combination of the scalars that forms a Goldstone boson which gets a mass from radiative corrections.

But first, let's recall that Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. If a global symmetry is broken, you get massless Goldstone bosons. If a gauge symmetry is broken, the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the gauge bosons. However, if the symmetry is approximate, or if the potential has terms that explicitly break the symmetry, the Goldstone bosons can get a small mass, becoming pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

In this model, the scalar potential V(φ, S, H) is not specified, but we can assume that there are terms that mix these fields. The singlet φ has a VEV x, and the Higgs H has a VEV v. The scalar S is another doublet, but if it doesn't get a VEV, then its components would be physical scalars. However, if S does get a VEV, that complicates things. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S does not get a VEV. Alternatively, maybe S does get a VEV, but the problem is focusing on the combination of φ and H.

Wait, but the Yukawa terms involve S: the term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. If S doesn't get a VEV, then this term would not generate a Dirac mass for the neutrinos. But in the type-I seesaw, you have the Higgs VEV giving a Dirac mass. Here, if S doesn't get a VEV, then this term would not contribute to the neutrino mass at tree level. However, maybe S does get a VEV. Let me think.

If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, and the potential allows it to get a VEV, then ⟨S⟩ would be a new VEV contributing to electroweak symmetry breaking. However, the problem mentions ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the standard Higgs VEV. If both H and S get VEVs, that would lead to two sources of electroweak symmetry breaking. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S does not get a VEV. Alternatively, maybe S does get a VEV, but it's not mentioned. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the VEV of S is zero, and the Yukawa term -g N̄ L S is responsible for generating neutrino masses when S is in the loop, but that's more like a radiative seesaw. But the problem mentions the VEVs of φ and H, so let's focus on those.

The singlet φ has a Yukawa coupling with the right-handed neutrinos N_R, giving them Majorana masses when φ gets a VEV: (y_i / 2) x N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. So the Majorana mass for N_R is M_i = y_i x.

The other Yukawa term couples N_R to the lepton doublet L_α and the scalar S. If S does not get a VEV, this term doesn't contribute to the neutrino mass at tree level. However, if S does get a VEV, say ⟨S⟩ = u, then this term would generate a Dirac mass term g_{iα} u N̄_{iR} L_α, leading to a seesaw mechanism with M_i and the Dirac mass. But if S doesn't get a VEV, then maybe the neutrino masses are generated radiatively, through loops involving S. But the problem is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂, not the neutrinos.

Now, the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Goldstone bosons come from the breaking of global symmetries. If the scalar potential has a symmetry that is spontaneously broken, the Goldstone boson appears. However, if the symmetry is explicitly broken (e.g., by terms in the potential or through quantum effects), the Goldstone boson gets a mass and becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential breaks the electroweak symmetry, and the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z. In this model, we have additional scalars φ and S. The singlet φ's VEV x breaks any global symmetry associated with φ. If there's a U(1) symmetry under which φ is charged, breaking it would give a Goldstone boson. However, the problem states that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson, so its mass comes from radiative corrections.

Wait, the scalar φ is a singlet, so if it's complex, its phase would be a Goldstone boson. But the problem says φ is a singlet scalar, but doesn't specify if it's real or complex. The kinetic term is (1/2)(∂μφ)^2, which suggests that φ is a real scalar, because for a complex scalar, the kinetic term would be |∂μφ|² = (∂μφ†)(∂μφ). So if the kinetic term is (1/2)(∂μφ)^2, φ is real. Therefore, φ is a real singlet scalar. Then, when it gets a VEV x, there's no Goldstone boson because a real scalar can't have a continuous symmetry (like U(1)) acting on it. The Goldstone boson comes from the breaking of a continuous symmetry. If φ is real, and the potential has a Z₂ symmetry φ → -φ, then breaking that symmetry would give a massive scalar, not a Goldstone. So maybe the pseudo-Goldstone comes from another part of the scalar sector.

The other scalars are S and H. H is the standard Higgs doublet, which gets a VEV v. S is another doublet. If S does not get a VEV, then the only Goldstone bosons are the ones from H, which are eaten by W and Z. If S also gets a VEV, there would be additional Goldstone bosons, but they would also be eaten if the symmetry is gauged. However, the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone, so it's likely a mixture of the scalars from φ and H or S.

Alternatively, maybe there's an approximate global symmetry in the potential V(φ, S, H) that's spontaneously broken, leading to a Goldstone boson, which gets a small mass from radiative corrections. For example, if the potential has an approximate SO(2) symmetry mixing φ and H, then the breaking would lead to a Goldstone, which becomes a pseudo-Goldstone due to explicit symmetry breaking terms.

But to get a pseudo-Goldstone boson mass through radiative corrections, we can think of the Coleman-Weinberg potential. If the classical potential has a flat direction (massless mode), quantum corrections can generate a mass. Alternatively, if the symmetry is broken radiatively, the pseudo-Goldstone gets a mass from loops.

Alternatively, in the scalar potential, there might be terms that explicitly break the global symmetry, but are small. For example, if the potential has a term that breaks the symmetry, but is of higher order, then the Goldstone boson gets a mass proportional to the symmetry breaking parameter.

But given that the question is about the mass through radiative corrections, it's likely that the pseudo-Goldstone mass is generated at loop level, even if the classical potential has an exact symmetry. For example, in the case of the axion, the potential is generated non-perturbatively, but here it's through radiative corrections.

Let me try to outline the steps needed:

1. Identify the scalar fields and their VEVs. φ has VEV x, H has VEV v, and S may or may not have a VEV. The problem states ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which is confusing, but perhaps it's a way to parameterize the VEVs such that x and v are related. Maybe the potential is minimized when x² + v² = constant, leading to a flat direction. If the potential has a term like λ(φ² + |H|² - Λ²)², then the VEVs satisfy φ² + |H|² = Λ². In that case, there's a flat direction: any combination of x and v that satisfies x² + v² = Λ². This would lead to a massless mode (Goldstone boson) corresponding to the angular direction in the φ-H plane. However, if there are other terms in the potential that break this SO(2) symmetry, the Goldstone would get a mass. Alternatively, quantum corrections could generate a potential for the Goldstone, giving it a mass.

2. The pseudo-Goldstone H₂ would correspond to the angular direction, i.e., the phase between φ and H. But since φ is a real field and H is complex, maybe the Goldstone is a mixture of the imaginary part of H and φ? Wait, φ is real, so it doesn't have a phase. H is a complex doublet, but after symmetry breaking, the Higgs has a VEV in the real component. The Goldstone bosons from H are the components that are eaten by W and Z. If there's a mixing between φ and H, perhaps there's an additional Goldstone from a global symmetry that's a combination of shifts in φ and phase rotations of H. But since φ is real, it's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and H, such as μ φ |H|². If the potential is V = λ_φ (φ² - x²)^2 + λ_H (|H|² - v²)^2 + μ φ |H|², then the minimization would lead to relations between x and v. But if μ is small, then the potential has approximate separate symmetries for φ and H, and the mixing term breaks the symmetry, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone.

But I need to think about the specific model given. The potential V(φ, S, H) is not specified, so I have to make assumptions based on the fields and symmetries.

The fields are:

- φ: real singlet scalar.

- S: complex doublet scalar.

- H: complex doublet scalar (the Higgs).

The Yukawa terms suggest that φ couples to N_R, and S couples to N_R and leptons. The potential V(φ, S, H) could include terms like φ², |H|², |S|², and interactions between them. For example:

V = λ_φ (φ² - x²)^2 + λ_H (|H|² - v²)^2 + λ_S |S|^4 + μ φ |H|² + κ φ |S|² + η |H|² |S|² + ... 

But without knowing the exact form, it's hard to say. However, the problem mentions that ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which might suggest that the potential enforces this relation. For example, if the potential has a term like (φ² + |H|² - Λ²)^2, then the VEVs would satisfy φ² + |H|² = Λ². In that case, there's a flat direction: the combination φ² + |H|² is fixed, but the ratio of φ to H can vary. However, such a potential would have an SO(2) symmetry rotating φ and H into each other, leading to a Goldstone boson when the symmetry is spontaneously broken. But φ is a real field and H is complex, so the symmetry might be different.

Wait, if φ is real and H is a complex doublet, the symmetry would need to mix a real field with a complex one. That's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the potential has a term that couples φ to the real part of H. For example, if H is written as H = (0, (v + h)/√2), then the real component h is the Higgs boson. If φ is also real, then a term like μ φ h would mix them. The potential could have terms that lead to a mass matrix mixing φ and h, and the pseudo-Goldstone is the light eigenstate.

But the problem states that H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone boson. In the Standard Model, after eating the Goldstones, the Higgs is the remaining scalar. If we have another scalar φ mixing with the Higgs, there would be two mass eigenstates: H₁ (the Higgs-like) and H₂ (the φ-like), or vice versa. If the mixing is such that one of them is light due to an approximate symmetry, then H₂ could be the pseudo-Goldstone.

Alternatively, if the potential has an approximate shift symmetry for φ, broken by some terms, then φ would be a pseudo-Goldstone boson. But φ is a singlet, so a shift symmetry φ → φ + c could be possible. If the potential has terms that break this symmetry, φ would get a mass. For example, if the potential is V = λ (φ² - x²)^2, then expanding around φ = x gives a mass term for the fluctuation, but if there are terms like μ φ |H|², this breaks the shift symmetry and could give a mass to the pseudo-Goldstone.

But I need to connect this to radiative corrections. The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone is generated through loops. For example, in the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, if the classical potential is flat in some direction, quantum corrections generate a potential that gives a mass to the Goldstone.

Alternatively, if there's a symmetry that's broken only by quantum effects (anomaly), the pseudo-Goldstone gets a mass. But that's more like the axion.

Alternatively, consider that the tree-level potential has an exact symmetry, but loop corrections (radiative corrections) break it, generating a mass for the Goldstone. For example, in the Standard Model, if you have a Higgs field with a classical flat potential, quantum corrections from top quark loops generate the Mexican hat potential. But here, maybe the pseudo-Goldstone direction is flat at tree level, and loops generate the curvature, hence the mass.

To proceed, let's assume that the potential has a flat direction at tree level, corresponding to the pseudo-Goldstone, and the mass is generated by loops. The question is which fields contribute to the loops. The Yukawa couplings given are between φ and N_R, and between N_R, L_α, and S.

The fermions N_R have Majorana masses from φ's VEV, and they also couple to S and the lepton doublets. If S does not get a VEV, the coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would allow N_R to interact with S and the leptons. These interactions could generate loops that contribute to the potential of the pseudo-Goldstone.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture of φ and the Higgs, then loops involving the top quark (which couples to the Higgs) and the N_R (which couples to φ) would generate a potential.

But to get the mass of H₂, we need to compute the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The Coleman-Weinberg potential at one-loop is given by:

V_eff = V_tree + (1/64π²) [ m_B^4 (ln(m_B² / Λ²) - c) - m_F^4 (ln(m_F² / Λ²) - c) ]

where m_B and m_F are the boson and fermion masses, and Λ is the renormalization scale. The dominant contributions come from the heaviest particles. In this model, the heavy particles would be the singlet fermions N_R and the scalars S and φ.

But the pseudo-Goldstone's mass would come from the curvature of the effective potential in its direction. If at tree level the potential is flat (massless), then the one-loop correction would generate a mass.

Assuming that H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone from a U(1) symmetry broken by the VEVs of φ and H, the mass would be generated by loops of the particles that couple to both φ and H. The singlet fermions N_R couple to φ via the Majorana term and to S and the lepton doublets via the other Yukawa. If S couples to the Higgs H through the potential, then there might be a connection.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is in the S scalar doublet, but S doesn't get a VEV, then its components would have masses, but if there's a mixing with φ or H, maybe one component is light.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to simplify. The key points are:

- The model has scalars φ, S, and H.

- The VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨H⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨H⟩² = x² + v² (assuming that was the intended relation).

- The pseudo-Goldstone H₂ gets its mass through radiative corrections.

Possible scenario:

The potential has a flat direction at tree level, corresponding to a Goldstone boson. Quantum corrections (loops) generate a mass for this boson, making it a pseudo-Goldstone.

The dominant contributions to the mass would come from the particles that couple to the fields involved in the flat direction. If the flat direction involves φ and H, then loops of particles coupling to both φ and H would contribute. The singlet fermions N_R couple to φ, and via S to the lepton doublets (which couple to H). But S's role is unclear.

Alternatively, the Yukawa coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S connects N_R, leptons, and S. If S has a coupling to H in the potential, like a quartic term |S|² |H|², then loops involving N_R, S, and H could generate a potential for the pseudo-Goldstone.

But to estimate the mass, we can use dimensional analysis. The pseudo-Goldstone mass squared would be proportional to the loop factor (1/16π²) times some coupling squared times the relevant energy scale squared (like the VEVs).

For example, if the mass is generated by a loop of N_R particles, which have a mass M_i = y_i x, and they interact with the pseudo-Goldstone via a coupling of order y_i, then the mass squared would be something like (y_i^2 / 16π²) M_i^2. But this would be (y_i^4 x²)/(16π²). However, this depends on the specific couplings.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is part of the Higgs field, then top quark loops would contribute. The top Yukawa coupling is large, so it could generate a significant contribution. But in this model, the pseudo-Goldstone might be a mixture of φ and H, so both top loops and N_R loops could contribute.

But the problem mentions radiative corrections, and the answer is likely to involve the couplings y_i and g_{iα}, and the VEVs x and v.

Wait, the term (y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c gives a Majorana mass M_i = y_i x. The term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would, if S gets a VEV, give a Dirac mass term g_{iα} ⟨S⟩ N̄_{iR} ν_{Lα}, leading to a seesaw mass matrix. But if S doesn't get a VEV, this term might contribute to a radiative neutrino mass via a loop with S and N_R.

But again, focusing on the pseudo-Goldstone mass. Suppose that the potential has a term that mixes φ and H, like μ φ |H|². At tree level, this would give a mass term mixing the Higgs and φ. The mass matrix would be:

For the scalars h (Higgs) and φ:

m² matrix:

[ [ 2λ_H v², μ v ]

  [ μ v, 2λ_φ x² ] ]

The eigenvalues would be the masses of the two scalars. If μ is small, the mixing is small, and the lighter scalar (pseudo-Goldstone) would have a mass squared of order μ v. But if μ is zero at tree level, then the mass comes from loops.

If μ is generated radiatively, through loops involving the couplings y_i and g_{iα}, then the pseudo-Goldstone mass would be generated at loop level.

Alternatively, if the potential has a classical flat direction (μ=0), then the Coleman-Weinberg potential would generate a mass. The one-loop correction would depend on the particles in the loop.

Assuming the flat direction is in the φ-H plane, the effective potential would receive contributions from particles that couple to both φ and H. The top quark couples to H, and the N_R couples to φ. If there's a loop diagram that connects H and φ via N_R and S, that could generate an effective coupling between H and φ.

For example, a loop with N_R, S, and L_α could connect φ (through N_R's Majorana mass) and H (through S's coupling to H in the potential). If S has a quartic coupling to H, like η |S|² |H|², then in the loop, you could have N_R exchanging S and H, leading to an effective μ term.

The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone would then be something like:

m_{H₂}² ≈ (y_i g_{iα}^2 η v x)/(16π²) * log(...)

But this is very hand-wavy. To compute it properly, we'd need to calculate the loop diagram.

Alternatively, using the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the mass generated would be:

m² ≈ (1/16π²) * (couplings)^2 * (VEVs)^2

For example, if the loop involves the Yukawa couplings y and g, and the VEVs x and v, then:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y g^2 v x)/(16π²)

But I need to check the dimensions. The mass squared would have dimension 2, so couplings and VEVs need to combine to give that.

Alternatively, if the effective quartic coupling generated is λ ≈ (y^2 g^2)/(16π²), then the mass would be m ≈ sqrt(λ) v, but this is too vague.

Another approach: in models with pseudo-Goldstone bosons (like theaxion), the mass is generated by instanton effects, but here it's radiative corrections. In the "Scotogenic model" (which involves singlet fermions and a scalar), neutrino masses are generated radiatively, and the dark matter candidate is the lightest singlet fermion. But this model seems similar, with S being a scalar doublet.

In the Scotogenic model, the neutrino mass is generated at one-loop with N_R and the inert doublet η (which is similar to S here). The mass is m_ν ≈ (g^2 y v)/(16π² M), where M is the N_R mass. But here, if we're to find the pseudo-Goldstone mass, perhaps a similar loop contributes.

But the pseudo-Goldstone mass would involve the same couplings. Suppose the mass is generated by a loop of N_R and S. The coupling g connects N_R to S and leptons, and the coupling y connects φ to N_R. The VEV of φ gives N_R a mass M = y x, and the VEV of H is v. The loop would involve S, N_R, and possibly H.

If the potential has a term like λ_S φ² |S|², then the mass of S is related to φ's VEV. When φ gets a VEV x, S gets a mass squared μ_S² + λ_S x². If μ_S² is negative, then S could get a VEV, but assuming it's positive, S remains inert.

The pseudo-Goldstone H₂ could be a component of S, but since S is a doublet, its neutral component would have a mass. However, if there's a mixing between S and H or φ, maybe one state is lighter.

Alternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone comes from the CP-odd component of S. If S is complex, its neutral component has a real and imaginary part. If the potential has a global U(1) symmetry that's broken by terms in the potential, the imaginary part could be a pseudo-Goldstone.

But this is getting too speculative. Let's try to recall that in models with multiple scalars, pseudo-Goldstone bosons can arise from approximate symmetries. Their masses are typically loop-generated and proportional to the symmetry-breaking couplings.

In this problem, since the pseudo-Goldstone mass is due to radiative corrections, and the model includes singlet fermions N_R with couplings to φ and S, the likely candidates for the loop contributions are the N_R and S loops.

The mass of H₂ would then be something like:

m_{H₂}² ≈ (y_i^2 g_{iα}^2 v^2)/(16π²)

or similar, depending on the couplings and VEVs.

But to get the exact expression, we need to consider the specific interactions. The Yukawa terms are:

- (y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c

- g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S

The potential V(φ, S, H) likely includes a term like λ |H|² |S|², which allows H and S to interact. If we consider a loop where N_R runs in the loop with S and H, this could generate an effective interaction between φ and H, leading to a mass term for the pseudo-Goldstone.

Alternatively, the loop would generate a term like φ |H|², which breaks the would-be Goldstone symmetry and gives mass to H₂.

The one-loop diagram would be a triangle diagram with N_R in the loop, coupling to φ via the Majorana coupling y_i, and to H and S via the g_{iα} coupling. But to connect H and φ, there needs to be a coupling between S and H in the potential, say λ |S|² |H|².

The diagram would look like: φ couples to N_R via y_i, N_R couples to S and L_α via g_{iα}, and S couples to H via λ. But L_α are leptons, which might not couple directly to H, unless through the standard Yukawa. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, consider that the effective φ-H interaction is generated through a loop with N_R, S, and the Higgs. The coupling g connects N_R to S and L, and the Higgs couples to L through the standard Yukawa. But this might not close the loop.

Alternatively, if S mixes with the Higgs H through a term in the potential like μ S† H, then in the loop, N_R couples to S and H via mixing. But this is speculative.

Given the time constraints, I think the answer is expected to be something like m_{H₂}² ≈ (y^2 g^2 v^2)/(16π²) or involving the Majorana mass M = y x and the Dirac mass from g v, leading to m_{H₂} ~ (g^2 v^2)/(16π² M). But I need to check dimensions.

The mass squared should have dimensions of [mass]^2. Let's see:

If y is dimensionless, g is dimensionless, v is a mass, and x is a mass.

If the mass is m ~ (y g^2 v x)/(16π²), then m² ~ (y² g^4 v² x²)/(256π^4), which is dimensionally correct. But this seems too high.

Alternatively, if the loop contributes a term like (g^4 v^2)/(16π² y x), then m ~ (g^2 v)/(4π sqrt(y x)), but this is just guessing.

Alternatively, consider that the pseudo-Goldstone gets a mass from a loop of N_R particles. The N_R has mass M = y x. The coupling of H₂ to N_R would be through the Yukawa term y φ N N, so when φ is expanded around its VEV as φ = x + h₂, the coupling is y h₂ N N. Thus, the interaction term is (y/2) h₂ N N.

The one-loop correction to the h₂ mass would come from a loop of N_R particles. The diagram is a loop of N_R with two h₂ insertions. However, since h₂ is a real scalar, the loop would have two vertices of h₂ N N, each proportional to y. The loop integral would give a contribution to the h₂ mass squared.

The formula for a scalar mass from a fermion loop is:

Δm² ≈ (y^2 M^2)/(16π²) * (some factor)

Since M = y x, this becomes Δm² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16π²). So m_{H₂} ≈ (y² x)/(4π).

But this assumes that the entire mass comes from this loop. However, if h₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass should be much smaller. Wait, but if the tree-level mass is zero (Goldstone), and this loop generates the mass, then this would be the result. However, in reality, the Goldstone direction might be a combination of fields, so the coupling y would be an effective coupling.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture of φ and the Higgs, then the coupling y would be multiplied by a mixing angle. For example, if the mixing angle is θ ≈ v/x, then the effective coupling is y θ, leading to m_{H₂}² ≈ (y² θ² x²)/(16π²) = (y² v²)/(16π²).

But this is getting too model-dependent without knowing the exact potential.

Given the information in the problem, and the fact that it's an exam-style question, the expected answer is likely related to the seesaw mechanism or the radiative corrections from the N_R loops. A common formula for the pseudo-Goldstone mass in such models is:

m_{H₂}² ≈ (y^2 v^2)/(16π²)

or similar. But considering that the VEVs are x and v, and the relation ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨H⟩² = x² + v², which might imply that x and v are related to a common scale Λ, the mass could be something like (y^2 g^2 v x)/(16π² Λ), but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, if the potential has a term like λ φ² |H|², then at one-loop, the correction to the mass would be proportional to λ times the loop factor. But λ could be related to the Yukawa couplings.

Given the ambiguity, I'll hazard a guess that the mass is generated by loops of N_R with couplings y and g, leading to:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y g v)/(4π)

But to check dimensions: y is dimensionless, g is dimensionless, v is mass, so m has dimension mass. This works. Alternatively, if there's a logarithm or a factor of x, but given the information, this might be the expected answer.

Alternatively, if the mass is m_{H₂}² ≈ (y^2 g^2 v^2)/(16π²), then m_{H₂} ≈ (y g v)/(4π).

Given that this is a common form for radiative corrections, I think this is the answer they're looking for.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ in this model. Let me start by recalling what the question is about. The Lagrangian given includes some singlet fermions N_R, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ. The potential V(φ, S, H) isn't specified, but the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If ⟨φ⟩ is x, then ⟨φ⟩² should just be x². But the problem states ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Maybe that's a typo or maybe h is the Higgs field? Since the Higgs usually has a VEV v, so maybe ⟨H⟩ = v, and ⟨φ⟩ = x, and the total is x² + v². Hmm, perhaps the potential is such that when both φ and H get VEVs, their squares add up. But I need to be careful here.

First, let's parse the fields and their representations. The fields are:

- N_{iR}: right-handed singlet fermions, transforming as (1,1,0) under the SM gauge group. So they are singlets under SU(3), SU(2), and U(1). So they don't interact via the strong or electroweak force, except possibly through the terms given in the Lagrangian.

- S: a scalar doublet, (1,2,1). So it's an SU(2) doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs doublet H. So S would have components like (S⁺, S⁰) maybe. Its charge is 1, so the upper component would have hypercharge 1/2 + 1 = 3/2? Wait, hypercharge for doublets: the hypercharge Y is such that Q = T₃ + Y/2. For the Higgs doublet H, which is (1,2,1), the hypercharge is 1. So the upper component (charged) has T₃ = 1/2, so Q = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is H⁺, and the lower component is H⁰ with T₃ = -1/2, Q = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0. Similarly, S is (1,2,1), so same as the Higgs. So S would be a doublet with components S⁺ and S⁰. But since S is a scalar, maybe it's a new scalar doublet, different from the Higgs.

- φ: a singlet scalar, (1,1,0), so no charge under any SM group.

The Lagrangian terms are:

1. iN̄_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R: kinetic term for the singlet fermions.

2. (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2: kinetic term for the singlet scalar φ.

3. |D^μ S|²: kinetic term for the scalar doublet S, with covariant derivative D_μ, which would include the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields.

4. -(y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c: Yukawa coupling between φ and the charge-conjugated right-handed neutrinos. Since N_R is a singlet, the charge conjugate N_R^c would also be a singlet. The term is a Majorana mass term for the N_R when φ gets a VEV.

5. -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S: Another Yukawa term, coupling N_R to the lepton doublet L_α and the scalar S. This is similar to the usual Yukawa coupling in the type-I seesaw, but here the Higgs is replaced by S. When S gets a VEV, this would generate a Dirac mass term between the N_R and the left-handed neutrinos.

6. The potential V(φ, S, H): which includes the interactions between φ, S, and the Higgs H. Since the VEVs are given for φ and H, but S is another scalar doublet, I need to think about how they interact.

The VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². Wait, but ⟨h⟩ is the VEV of the Higgs H, which is (1,2,1), so its VEV is in the neutral component. So H has a VEV v, and φ has a VEV x. The sum of their squares is x² + v². But why is that written as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v²? That would imply that ⟨φ⟩² is not just x² but x² + v². That seems contradictory unless there's a relation between the VEVs. Maybe the potential is such that the combination x² + v² is fixed? For example, maybe the potential has a term like (|φ|² + |H|² - Λ²)², leading to a VEV where |φ|² + |H|² = Λ². Then x² + v² = Λ². But the problem states ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which would mean that x² = x² + v², implying v = 0, which can't be. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check again.

The problem says: "We give ⟨φ⟩² = (x² + v²), where ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v." So ⟨φ⟩ is x, so ⟨φ⟩² is x², but they write ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². That can't be unless v = 0, but ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the Higgs VEV, which is 246 GeV. So this must be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be ⟨S⟩² + ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v²? Or maybe ⟨S⟩ and ⟨φ⟩ have VEVs such that their squares add up to x² + v². Wait, but S is a doublet, so its VEV would be a SU(2) VEV. If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, then its neutral component would have hypercharge Y = 1, so the neutral component would have charge Q = T₃ + Y/2 = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0. So S can have a VEV in its neutral component. But if S gets a VEV, that would contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking. However, the problem mentions ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the usual Higgs VEV. So perhaps S does not get a VEV, and only φ and H (the Higgs) get VEVs. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². That still doesn't make sense unless x² + v² is the total, but ⟨φ⟩ is x, so ⟨φ⟩² is x². Therefore, maybe it's a typo, and they meant that the sum of the squares of the VEVs is x² + v². But the way it's written is confusing. Maybe the potential is such that when you expand around the VEVs, the combination x² + v² appears. Alternatively, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and H, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone boson when the symmetry is broken.

But moving on. The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. So H₂ is one of the scalar bosons in the model. Since we have multiple scalars: φ (singlet), S (doublet), and the standard Higgs H (doublet). Wait, the problem mentions the potential V(φ, S, H), so H is the standard Higgs doublet. So the scalar sector includes φ, S, and H. The VEVs are for φ and H, but S might not get a VEV? Or does it? If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, it can get a VEV, but that would break the electroweak symmetry. However, the standard Higgs H already does that with VEV v. If S also gets a VEV, that would lead to additional Goldstone bosons, but since the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone, maybe there's a combination of the scalars that forms a Goldstone boson which gets a mass from radiative corrections.

But first, let's recall that Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. If a global symmetry is broken, you get massless Goldstone bosons. If a gauge symmetry is broken, the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the gauge bosons. However, if the symmetry is approximate, or if the potential has terms that explicitly break the symmetry, the Goldstone bosons can get a small mass, becoming pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

In this model, the scalar potential V(φ, S, H) is not specified, but we can assume that there are terms that mix these fields. The singlet φ has a VEV x, and the Higgs H has a VEV v. The scalar S is another doublet, but if it doesn't get a VEV, then its components would be physical scalars. However, if S does get a VEV, that complicates things. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S does not get a VEV. Alternatively, maybe S does get a VEV, but the problem is focusing on the combination of φ and H.

Wait, but the Yukawa terms involve S: the term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. If S doesn't get a VEV, then this term would not generate a Dirac mass for the neutrinos. But in the type-I seesaw, you have the Higgs VEV giving a Dirac mass. Here, if S doesn't get a VEV, then this term would not contribute to the neutrino mass at tree level. However, maybe S does get a VEV. Let me think.

If S is a doublet with hypercharge 1, and the potential allows it to get a VEV, then ⟨S⟩ would be a new VEV contributing to electroweak symmetry breaking. However, the problem mentions ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the standard Higgs VEV. If both H and S get VEVs, that would lead to two sources of electroweak symmetry breaking. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S does not get a VEV. Alternatively, maybe S does get a VEV, but it's not mentioned. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the VEV of S is zero, and the Yukawa term -g N̄ L S is responsible for generating neutrino masses when S is in the loop, but that's more like a radiative seesaw. But t

I need to determine the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ in this model. The Lagrangian includes singlet fermions N_R, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are specified as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². This relation seems confusing since if ⟨φ⟩ = x, then ⟨φ⟩² should be x². Perhaps there's a typo or maybe h represents the Higgs field. Since the Higgs typically has a VEV v, possibly ⟨H⟩ = v and ⟨φ⟩ = x, with their squared values summing to x² + v². The potential might be structured such that when both fields acquire VEVs, their squares add up, but I should be cautious with this interpretation.

Let me analyze the fields and their representations:

- N_{iR}: right-handed singlet fermions, transforming as (1,1,0) under the SM gauge group. They're singlets under SU(3), SU(2), and U(1), so they don't interact via strong or electroweak forces except through the specific terms in the Lagrangian.

- S: a scalar doublet, (1,2,1). It's an SU(2) doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs doublet H. S would have components like (S⁺, S⁰). For such doublets, the hypercharge Y relates to charge as Q = T₃ + Y/2. With hypercharge 1, the upper component has T₃ = 1/2, so Q = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, making it S⁺, while the lower component has T₃ = -1/2, Q = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0, making it S⁰.

- φ: a singlet scalar, (1,1,0), carrying no charge under any SM group.

The Lagrangian terms include:

1. iN̄_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R: kinetic term for the singlet fermions.

2. (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2: kinetic term for the singlet scalar φ.

3. |D^μ S|²: kinetic term for the scalar doublet S, with covariant derivative D_μ, incorporating SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields.

4. -(y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c: Yukawa coupling between φ and charge-conjugated right-handed neutrinos. This forms a Majorana mass term for N_R when φ gets a VEV.

5. -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S: Yukawa term coupling N_R to the lepton doublet L_α and scalar S. Similar to the type-I seesaw coupling, but with S replacing the Higgs. If S acquires a VEV, this would generate a Dirac mass term between N_R and left-handed neutrinos.

6. V(φ, S, H): the potential governing interactions between φ, S, and Higgs H.

The VEVs are given as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². This creates a contradiction since ⟨φ⟩² should equal x². Perhaps there's a relation between the VEVs where x² + v² is fixed, maybe through a potential term like (|φ|² + |H|² - Λ²)², leading to |φ|² + |H|² = Λ². But stating ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v² would imply v = 0, which can't be true since ⟨h⟩ = v represents the non-zero Higgs VEV of 246 GeV.

The question concerns the mass of pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. With multiple scalars (φ, S, H), H₂ must be one of the resulting physical states. Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking - massless for broken global symmetries and eaten by gauge bosons for broken gauge symmetries. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons occur when symmetries are approximate or explicitly broken, giving these particles small masses.

Although the scalar potential isn't specified, we can assume mixing terms exist between the fields. If S doesn't acquire a VEV, its components would be physical scalars. If it does get a VEV, this would contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking alongside the Higgs VEV v. The Yukawa term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would generate neutrino Dirac masses only if S gets a VEV; otherwise, it might contribute to neutrino masses through loop effects in a radiative seesaw mechanism.

I need to determine the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ in this model. Let me begin by recalling what the question is about. The Lagrangian presented includes some singlet fermions N_R, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ.

First, let's parse the fields and their representations:

- N_{iR}: right-handed singlet fermions, transforming as (1,1,0) under the SM gauge group. They are singlets under SU(3), SU(2), and U(1), meaning they don't interact via the strong or electroweak force, except possibly through the Lagrangian terms.

- S: a scalar doublet, represented as (1,2,1). It's an SU(2) doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs doublet H. Thus, S would have components like (S⁺, S⁰). Since S is a scalar, it might be a new scalar doublet distinct from the Higgs.

- φ: a singlet scalar, (1,1,0), with no charge under any SM group.

The Lagrangian terms are:

1. iN̄_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R: kinetic term for the singlet fermions.

2. (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2: kinetic term for the singlet scalar φ.

3. |D^μ S|²: kinetic term for the scalar doublet S, with covariant derivative D_μ, including the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields.

4. -(y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c: Yukawa coupling between φ and the charge-conjugated right-handed neutrinos, acting as a Majorana mass term for N_R when φ acquires a VEV.

5. -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S: Another Yukawa term, coupling N_R to the lepton doublet L_α and the scalar S, similar to the usual Yukawa coupling in a type-I seesaw. When S acquires a VEV, this forms a Dirac mass term between the N_R and the left-handed neutrinos.

6. The potential V(φ, S, H): which includes interactions between φ, S, and the Higgs H. Given the VEVs for φ and H, I need to consider how S interacts with them.

The VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, with ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². But ⟨h⟩ is the VEV of the Higgs H, which should be in the neutral component. Therefore, H has a VEV v, and φ has a VEV x. The sum of these squares is x² + v². So, ⟨φ⟩² being x² contradicts ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v² unless there's a relation between the VEVs. Perhaps the potential is such that the combination x² + v² is fixed. For example, a potential term like (|φ|² + |H|² - Λ²)² could lead to a VEV where |φ|² + |H|² = Λ². Thus, x² + v² = Λ². However, the statement ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v² implies contradictions unless v = 0, which is illogical since a typical Higgs VEV is about 246 GeV. This seems an error unless rephrased as the squares of the VEVs adding up to x² + v².

Moving beyond this, the question concerns the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ via radiative corrections. H₂ represents one of the scalar bosons in the model. There are multiple scalars: φ (a singlet), S (a doublet), and the standard Higgs H (a doublet). The problem involves the potential V(φ, S, H), which classifies H as the standard Higgs doublet, with φ, S, and H forming the scalar sector. The VEVs pertain to φ and H, whereas S may not possess a VEV. Alternatively, S might acquire a VEV, complicating the structure.

Goldstone bosons stem from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Massless Goldstone bosons appear if a global symmetry is broken, whereas broken gauge symmetry causes the Goldstone bosons to be absorbed by gauge bosons. However, a small mass can be assigned to Goldstone bosons if the symmetry is approximate or if terms in the potential explicitly break the symmetry, forming pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

In this model, without specification of V(φ, S, H), we can presume mixing terms among these fields. With φ's VEV x and H's VEV v, and S as another doublet, if it lacks a VEV, its components are physical scalars. Alternatively, if S holds a VEV, complexities arise. Yet, with ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, S might not have a VEV, or focus remains on φ and H.

The Yukawa terms involve S: the term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. Without a VEV for S, this term won't generate a Dirac mass for neutrinos. Nevertheless, in type-I seesaw, we leverage the Higgs VEV for Dirac mass generation. If S doesn’t get a VEV, it doesn’t contribute to tree-level neutrino mass, though it may be involved in the mass mechanism once S enters a radiative loop.

Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the scalar fields are φ (singlet), H (doublet, VEV v), and S (doublet, no VEV). The singlet φ has a VEV x. The potential V(φ, S, H) would then include terms like μ²_φ φ² + λ_φ φ^4, μ²_H |H|² + λ_H |H|^4, μ²_S |S|² + λ_S |S|^4, and cross terms like λ_{φH} φ² |H|², λ_{φS} φ² |S|², λ_{HS} |H|² |S|², etc. If S doesn't get a VEV, then the minimum of the potential is at ⟨H⟩ = v, ⟨φ⟩ = x, and ⟨S⟩ = 0. Then, the mass terms for the scalars would come from the second derivatives of the potential.\n\nBut the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Goldstone bosons come from the breaking of global symmetries. If the potential has an approximate symmetry that is spontaneously broken, the pseudo-Goldstone boson gets a small mass from explicit symmetry breaking terms. Alternatively, if the symmetry is exact at tree level but broken radiatively (by quantum corrections), then the Goldstone boson remains massless at tree level but gets a mass from loops.\n\nIn the Standard Model, the Higgs potential has an SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y symmetry, which is spontaneously broken, giving mass to the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs boson is the remaining scalar. If there are additional scalars, like φ and S here, their interactions can lead to additional Goldstone bosons if there are additional symmetries.\n\nThe singlet φ is a real scalar (assuming it's real; the notation (1,1,0) suggests it's a real singlet). If φ is complex, then it's a complex scalar, but the notation (1,1,0) usually refers to real singlets. Wait, the kinetic term for φ is (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is the standard kinetic term for a real scalar. So φ is a real scalar. Therefore, when it gets a VEV x, it has a single degree of freedom, and there's no Goldstone boson associated with it because it's a real field. The Higgs H is a complex doublet, so when it gets a VEV, three of its four degrees of freedom become the longitudinal components of the W and Z bosons, leaving one physical Higgs boson. The scalar S is a complex doublet, so it has four degrees of freedom. If S does not get a VEV, then all four components are physical scalars. If S is inert (no VEV), then its components would be charged scalars and a neutral scalar. But if S does get a VEV, then some components are eaten by the gauge bosons. But the problem states that ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S is inert.\n\nBut the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. If there's a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, leading to a Goldstone boson, which then gets a mass from radiative corrections, that would be H₂. For example, if the potential has a global symmetry that's broken by the VEVs of φ and H, then the Goldstone boson would be a combination of the phases of φ and H. But φ is a real field, so it doesn't have a phase. H is a complex doublet, but its VEV is real (assuming CP conservation), so the Goldstone bosons are the three from the SU(2) breaking. Wait, but H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, so maybe it's part of a larger symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the potential has an approximate U(1) symmetry that's broken by the VEV of φ, leading to a Goldstone boson. But φ is real, so a U(1) symmetry acting on φ would require it to be complex. Hmm. Alternatively, if there's a symmetry that mixes φ and H, but since φ is a singlet and H is a doublet, that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs H, such as a term like φ |H|². If the potential is V ⊃ λ φ |H|², then when φ gets a VEV x, this contributes to the mass term for H. But if there's a symmetry that's broken by both φ and H, maybe there's a Goldstone boson. For example, consider a global symmetry under which φ shifts and H transforms in some way. But φ is a real scalar, so a shift symmetry φ → φ + a would be a possible global symmetry. If the potential has terms that break this symmetry, then the Goldstone boson would be the fluctuation of φ. But if the symmetry is only broken by terms that are small, then φ would be a pseudo-Goldstone boson. However, in the given Lagrangian, the potential isn't specified, so it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pseudo-Goldstone boson comes from the S field. If S is a complex doublet and there's a global symmetry acting on S, but since S is charged under the gauge group, any global symmetry would have to commute with the gauge symmetry. If the potential for S has an approximate global symmetry that's broken by the Yukawa couplings or other terms, then the pseudo-Goldstone boson could be a component of S. But the problem states H₂, which might suggest it's part of the Higgs sector.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the model has two scalar singlets: φ and the Higgs H (which is a doublet). Wait, no, φ is a singlet, H is a doublet, and S is another doublet. The potential V(φ, S, H) could have terms that mix these fields. For example, a term like φ² |H|² or φ |S|². If there's a symmetry that's broken when φ and H get VEVs, the pseudo-Goldstone could be a mixture of the Higgs and φ.\n\nBut I need to think about the mass generation. The question is about the mass of H₂ through radiative corrections. That suggests that at tree level, H₂ is massless (a Goldstone boson), but loop corrections give it a small mass. So the tree-level potential must have a flat direction, which is lifted by quantum effects.\n\nFor example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs potential is V = -μ² |H|² + λ |H|^4. The minimum is at ⟨H⟩ = v = μ²/(2λ), and the Higgs mass is sqrt(2μ²). If there's an additional scalar φ with a potential that's classically scale-invariant, then the potential might have a flat direction. But with interactions, quantum corrections can generate a mass.\n\nAlternatively, consider a model where the potential has a term that breaks a symmetry softly, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone is then related to the symmetry-breaking parameters.\n\nBut given the information in the problem, we have to make some assumptions. The key terms in the Lagrangian are the Yukawa couplings y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR and g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. The first term gives Majorana masses to the N_iR when φ gets a VEV x: m_Ni = y_i x. The second term, when S gets a VEV (if it does), would give a Dirac mass between N_iR and the left-handed neutrinos L_α. But if S doesn't get a VEV, this term would not contribute at tree level. However, maybe S couples to the Higgs H through the potential, leading to a mixing between S and H, which could induce a VEV for S. But the problem states ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S doesn't get a VEV.\n\nAssuming S is inert (no VEV), then the neutrino masses would have to come from a different mechanism. The term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would allow for a one-loop diagram where S and φ are in the loop, generating a neutrino mass. This is similar to the scotogenic model, where dark matter candidates (here, maybe the N_R or S) are in the loop. In such models, the neutrino mass is generated at one loop, and the lightest particle in the loop is a dark matter candidate.\n\nBut the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass. If H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson from the φ and H sector, then its mass would come from radiative corrections. Suppose there's a global symmetry that's broken by the VEVs of φ and H. For example, a U(1) symmetry under which φ and H transform. If this symmetry is explicitly broken by some terms in the potential, the Goldstone boson becomes massive. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only broken radiatively (anomalously), then the mass is generated through loops.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the potential has a flat direction at tree level, which is lifted by quantum corrections. For example, if the tree-level potential is such that the combination x² + v² is fixed, but the individual VEVs x and v can vary along this flat direction. The pseudo-Goldstone boson corresponds to the angular direction in this potential, and its mass comes from the curvature induced by quantum corrections.\n\nIn such a case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson can be estimated using the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates effective potentials for the scalar fields through loop corrections. If the tree-level potential has a flat direction, the one-loop corrections can generate a mass for the pseudo-Goldstone boson.\n\nThe Coleman-Weinberg potential for a scalar field is given by:\n\nV_eff = V_tree + (1/64π²) [m_S^4 (ln(m_S² / Λ²) - c) + ... ]\n\nwhere m_S are the field-dependent masses of the particles in the loop, Λ is the renormalization scale, and c is a constant. The dominant contributions come from the heaviest particles, which in this model would be the singlet fermions N_iR and possibly the scalars S and φ.\n\nThe pseudo-Goldstone boson corresponds to a direction in field space that is flat at tree level. The one-loop correction would then generate a potential along this direction, leading to a mass term.\n\nTo compute the mass, we need to identify the flat direction and calculate the loop corrections. Let's assume that the tree-level potential has a flat direction where x² + v² = constant. The pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is the angular mode in the (φ, H) plane. The radial mode is massive, while the angular mode is massless at tree level but gets a mass from loops.\n\nThe dominant contribution to the mass would come from the particles that couple to both φ and H. In this model, the singlet fermions N_iR couple to φ via the Yukawa term y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR, and they also couple to S and the lepton doublet L via g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. However, if S does not get a VEV, the coupling to L might not contribute directly. Alternatively, if S mixes with the Higgs H through the potential, there could be an effective coupling.\n\nBut let's focus on the Yukawa coupling y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR. When φ gets a VEV x, the N_iR get Majorana masses m_Ni = y_i x. These heavy fermions will contribute to the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The one-loop correction from the fermions would be:\n\nΔV ≈ (1/64π²) [ m_N^4 (ln(m_N² / Λ²) - c) ]\n\nBut since m_N = y_i x, and x is part of the flat direction x² + v² = constant, the potential would depend on x, and thus on the pseudo-Goldstone direction.\n\nHowever, to compute the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone, we need to expand the effective potential around the VEV and find the curvature in the angular direction. The mass squared would be the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to the Goldstone field.\n\nLet me parametrize the flat direction as φ = x, H = v, with x² + v² = Λ². The Goldstone boson corresponds to a rotation between φ and H. Let’s define the Goldstone field θ such that:\n\nφ = Λ sinθ\n\nH = Λ cosθ\n\nBut H is a doublet, so actually, the Higgs VEV is in the neutral component. Let me instead consider that the flat direction is in the singlet φ and the neutral component of the Higgs H. Let’s write φ = x and H = (0, v)^T /√2, with x² + v² = Λ². The pseudo-Goldstone boson would be the phase that rotates between φ and H, but since φ is real, this is not straightforward. Wait, φ is a real field, so it doesn't have a phase. The Higgs H is complex, but its VEV is real. The Goldstone bosons from the Higgs are the three that are eaten by the W and Z. If there's an additional Goldstone boson from a global symmetry, it has to come from a different sector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs, such as λ φ² |H|². If the potential is V = λ (φ² + |H|² - Λ²)², then the minimum is at φ² + |H|² = Λ², and the radial mode is massive, while the angular mode (the pseudo-Goldstone) is massless at tree level. However, quantum corrections would generate a mass for the angular mode.\n\nIn this case, the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ would correspond to the angular direction in φ and H. The mass would come from loops of particles that couple to both φ and H. In the given model, the singlet fermions N_iR couple to φ, and the Higgs H couples to the top quark, etc. But the dominant contribution might come from the N_iR loops because they have a direct coupling to φ.\n\nThe mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson can be estimated as:\n\nm_{H₂}^2 ≈ (y^4 x^2)/(16π² Λ²) * Λ^2\n\nWait, let's think. The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates a term proportional to y^4 x^4 ln(y x / Λ), but since x is part of the flat direction x² + v² = Λ², we can write x = Λ sinθ, v = Λ cosθ. The second derivative with respect to θ would give the mass. However, the exact calculation would require expanding the effective potential.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass from radiative corrections:\n\nm_{PG}^2 ≈ (N y^4 f²)/(16π²)\n\nwhere N is the number of fermion species, y is the Yukawa coupling, and f is the symmetry breaking scale (Λ in this case). This is similar to the pion mass in QCD, but here it's for a pseudo-Goldstone boson from a broken global symmetry.\n\nIn our case, the symmetry breaking scale is Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). The Yukawa coupling is y_i for each N_iR. Assuming all y_i are of the same order y, and there are N species of N_R, then:\n\nm_{H₂}^2 ≈ (N y^4 Λ²)/(16π²)\n\nBut Λ is the symmetry breaking scale, which is sqrt(x² + v²). However, the problem states that ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which as we discussed earlier seems contradictory unless there's a typo. If ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, then ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨h⟩² = x² + v². If the potential enforces this relation, then Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). But the problem says ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which would mean x² = x² + v² ⇒ v=0, which can't be. Therefore, I think there's a typo, and it should be ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨h⟩² = x² + v². Assuming that, then Λ = sqrt(x² + v²).\n\nTherefore, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ would be approximately:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 Λ)/(4π)\n\nThis comes from the general formula where the mass is generated by loops of particles with Yukawa coupling y, and the scale Λ. The factor 1/(4π) is typical for loop corrections.\n\nAlternatively, if the dominant contribution comes from the top quark loop, but in this model, the top quark couples to the Higgs H, not directly to φ. However, if there's a mixing between φ and H, the top loop could contribute. But given the Yukawa terms in the problem, the dominant contribution is likely from the N_iR loops.\n\nAssuming that the N_iR have large Yukawa couplings y_i, and Λ is the high scale, then:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 Λ)/(4π)\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of the parameters given. The problem mentions the VEVs x and v, so perhaps Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). If x and v are of the same order, then Λ ~ x ~ v. However, in seesaw models, x could be much larger than v. For example, if x is the high scale (e.g., 10^15 GeV) and v is the electroweak scale (246 GeV), then Λ ≈ x. But the problem doesn't specify, so we might have to keep it as Λ.\n\nBut the answer might need to be expressed in terms of x, v, and the couplings y_i and g_{iα}. However, since the question is about the approximation through radiative corrections, and the pseudo-Goldstone mass is generated at one loop, the formula would involve the Yukawa couplings and the symmetry breaking scale.\n\nAlternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone boson is part of the S field, which is a doublet, but S doesn't get a VEV, then its components would have masses from the potential. If there's an approximate custodial symmetry, the components of S could be degenerate, but radiative corrections could split them, making one a pseudo-Goldstone boson. However, the problem refers to H₂, which might be part of the Higgs sector.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem statement, I think the intended answer is that the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is generated at one loop through the Yukawa interactions with the singlet fermions N_iR. The mass can be approximated as:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 x)/(4π)\n\nwhere y is the Yukawa coupling of N_iR to φ, and x is the VEV of φ. This is similar to the pion mass in QCD, where the pion mass is proportional to the quark masses (which break the chiral symmetry), but here the symmetry breaking is from the Yukawa coupling and the VEV x.\n\nAlternatively, if the symmetry breaking scale is Λ = sqrt(x² + v²), then:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 Λ)/(4π)\n\nBut without more details on the potential, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem mentions radiative corrections and the Yukawa couplings to N_iR, the answer is likely proportional to y^2 x divided by (4π), possibly with a numerical factor.\n\nAnother approach: in the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the mass squared is the second derivative of the effective potential. For a real scalar field φ with a Yukawa coupling to fermions, the one-loop correction to the potential is:\n\nΔV ≈ (N_f y^4 φ^4)/(64π²) ln(y^2 φ^2 / Λ^2)\n\nwhere N_f is the number of fermion species. The mass term is the second derivative at the minimum φ = x:\n\nd²ΔV/dφ² ≈ (N_f y^4 x²)/(16π²)\n\nSo the mass squared would be:\n\nm_{H₂}^2 ≈ (N_f y^4 x²)/(16π²)\n\nBut this is the mass for the radial mode, not the pseudo-Goldstone. Wait, no. If the potential has a flat direction, the radial mode is the one with mass from the tree-level potential, and the pseudo-Goldstone is the angular mode. However, if the tree-level potential is flat, then the radial mode's mass also comes from the loop correction. But in our case, the pseudo-Goldstone is the angular mode, which would get a mass from the loop corrections that break the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential is V = λ (φ² + H² - Λ²)^2, then at tree level, the minimum is at φ² + H² = Λ². The radial mode is the combination φδφ + HδH, with mass ~ sqrt(λ) Λ. The angular mode (pseudo-Goldstone) is massless. However, if there are Yukawa couplings that break the symmetry, then at one loop, the effective potential generates a term that gives mass to the pseudo-Goldstone.\n\nFor example, if the fermions N_iR couple only to φ, then the Coleman-Weinberg potential would depend on φ, breaking the degeneracy in the angular direction. The second derivative in the angular direction would then give:\n\nm_{H₂}^2 ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16π² Λ²) * Λ^2 = y^4 x² / (16π²)\n\nBut this seems dimensionally incorrect. Wait, the mass squared should have dimensions of [mass]^2. If x is a mass dimension 1 (since φ is a scalar field with a VEV x), then y is dimensionless. So y^4 x² has dimension [mass]^2, which is correct. So m_{H₂} ≈ y² x / (4π).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is approximately (y² x)/(4π). This is a standard result for pseudo-Goldstone boson masses generated by radiative corrections from Yukawa couplings. The factor of 4π comes from the loop integral (1/(16π²)) and the derivative of the potential.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4π), where y_i is the Yukawa coupling of the singlet fermion N_iR to the scalar φ. Since the problem mentions multiple N_iR with couplings y_i, the dominant contribution would come from the largest y_i. However, if all y_i are similar, it would be a sum over the contributions. But for an approximation, we can write it as m_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 x)/(4π).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections is approximately (y² x)/(4π).\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447412, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5295, prompt_tokens=2612, total_tokens=7907, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) arises from radiative corrections, primarily due to loops involving the singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \) coupled to the scalar \( \phi \). The dominant contribution comes from the Yukawa interaction \( y_i \phi \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR} \), which generates a Majorana mass \( m_{N_i} = y_i x \) when \( \phi \) acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) \( x \). 

At one-loop level, the Coleman-Weinberg potential induces a mass term for \( H_2 \), corresponding to the pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with the symmetry broken by the VEVs of \( \phi \) and the Higgs \( H \). The mass is approximated by:

\[
m_{H_2} \approx \frac{y_i^2 x}{4\pi}
\]

where \( y_i \) is the Yukawa coupling and \( x \) is the VEV of \( \phi \). This result reflects the typical scale of radiative corrections from fermion loops, suppressed by the loop factor \( 1/(4\pi) \).

**Answer:**  
The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) through radiative corrections is approximately \(\boxed{\dfrac{y^2 x}{4\pi}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

the problem mentions the VEVs of φ and H, so maybe S doesn't get a VEV. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the scalar fields are φ (singlet), H (doublet, VEV v), and S (doublet, no VEV). The singlet φ has a VEV x. The potential V(φ, S, H) would then include terms like μ²_φ φ² + λ_φ φ^4, μ²_H |H|² + λ_H |H|^4, μ²_S |S|² + λ_S |S|^4, and cross terms like λ_{φH} φ² |H|², λ_{φS} φ² |S|², λ_{HS} |H|² |S|², etc. If S doesn't get a VEV, then the minimum of the potential is at ⟨H⟩ = v, ⟨φ⟩ = x, and ⟨S⟩ = 0. Then, the mass terms for the scalars would come from the second derivatives of the potential.

But the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Goldstone bosons come from the breaking of global symmetries. If the potential has an approximate symmetry that is spontaneously broken, the pseudo-Goldstone boson gets a small mass from explicit symmetry breaking terms. Alternatively, if the symmetry is exact at tree level but broken radiatively (by quantum corrections), then the Goldstone boson remains massless at tree level but gets a mass from loops.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential has an SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y symmetry, which is spontaneously broken, giving mass to the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs boson is the remaining scalar. If there are additional scalars, like φ and S here, their interactions can lead to additional Goldstone bosons if there are additional symmetries.

The singlet φ is a real scalar (assuming it's real; the notation (1,1,0) suggests it's a real singlet). If φ is complex, then it's a complex scalar, but the notation (1,1,0) usually refers to real singlets. Wait, the kinetic term for φ is (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is the standard kinetic term for a real scalar. So φ is a real scalar. Therefore, when it gets a VEV x, it has a single degree of freedom, and there's no Goldstone boson associated with it because it's a real field. The Higgs H is a complex doublet, so when it gets a VEV, three of its four degrees of freedom become the longitudinal components of the W and Z bosons, leaving one physical Higgs boson. The scalar S is a complex doublet, so it has four degrees of freedom. If S does not get a VEV, then all four components are physical scalars. If S is inert (no VEV), then its components would be charged scalars and a neutral scalar. But if S does get a VEV, then some components are eaten by the gauge bosons. But the problem states that ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S is inert.

But the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. If there's a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, leading to a Goldstone boson, which then gets a mass from radiative corrections, that would be H₂. For example, if the potential has a global symmetry that's broken by the VEVs of φ and H, then the Goldstone boson would be a combination of the phases of φ and H. But φ is a real field, so it doesn't have a phase. H is a complex doublet, but its VEV is real (assuming CP conservation), so the Goldstone bosons are the three from the SU(2) breaking. Wait, but H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, so maybe it's part of a larger symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the potential has an approximate U(1) symmetry that's broken by the VEV of φ, leading to a Goldstone boson. But φ is real, so a U(1) symmetry acting on φ would require it to be complex. Hmm. Alternatively, if there's a symmetry that mixes φ and H, but since φ is a singlet and H is a doublet, that's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs H, such as a term like φ |H|². If the potential is V ⊃ λ φ |H|², then when φ gets a VEV x, this contributes to the mass term for H. But if there's a symmetry that's broken by both φ and H, maybe there's a Goldstone boson. For example, consider a global symmetry under which φ shifts and H transforms in some way. But φ is a real scalar, so a shift symmetry φ → φ + a would be a possible global symmetry. If the potential has terms that break this symmetry, then the Goldstone boson would be the fluctuation of φ. But if the symmetry is only broken by terms that are small, then φ would be a pseudo-Goldstone boson. However, in the given Lagrangian, the potential isn't specified, so it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudo-Goldstone boson comes from the S field. If S is a complex doublet and there's a global symmetry acting on S, but since S is charged under the gauge group, any global symmetry would have to commute with the gauge symmetry. If the potential for S has an approximate global symmetry that's broken by the Yukawa couplings or other terms, then the pseudo-Goldstone boson could be a component of S. But the problem states H₂, which might suggest it's part of the Higgs sector.

Alternatively, considering that the model has two scalar singlets: φ and the Higgs H (which is a doublet). Wait, no, φ is a singlet, H is a doublet, and S is another doublet. The potential V(φ, S, H) could have terms that mix these fields. For example, a term like φ² |H|² or φ |S|². If there's a symmetry that's broken when φ and H get VEVs, the pseudo-Goldstone could be a mixture of the Higgs and φ.

But I need to think about the mass generation. The question is about the mass of H₂ through radiative corrections. That suggests that at tree level, H₂ is massless (a Goldstone boson), but loop corrections give it a small mass. So the tree-level potential must have a flat direction, which is lifted by quantum effects.

For example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs potential is V = -μ² |H|² + λ |H|^4. The minimum is at ⟨H⟩ = v = μ²/(2λ), and the Higgs mass is sqrt(2μ²). If there's an additional scalar φ with a potential that's classically scale-invariant, then the potential might have a flat direction. But with interactions, quantum corrections can generate a mass.

Alternatively, consider a model where the potential has a term that breaks a symmetry softly, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone is then related to the symmetry-breaking parameters.

But given the information in the problem, we have to make some assumptions. The key terms in the Lagrangian are the Yukawa couplings y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR and g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. The first term gives Majorana masses to the N_iR when φ gets a VEV x: m_Ni = y_i x. The second term, when S gets a VEV (if it does), would give a Dirac mass between N_iR and the left-handed neutrinos L_α. But if S doesn't get a VEV, this term would not contribute at tree level. However, maybe S couples to the Higgs H through the potential, leading to a mixing between S and H, which could induce a VEV for S. But the problem states ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S doesn't get a VEV.

Assuming S is inert (no VEV), then the neutrino masses would have to come from a different mechanism. The term -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would allow for a one-loop diagram where S and φ are in the loop, generating a neutrino mass. This is similar to the scotogenic model, where dark matter candidates (here, maybe the N_R or S) are in the loop. In such models, the neutrino mass is generated at one loop, and the lightest particle in the loop is a dark matter candidate.

But the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass. If H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson from the φ and H sector, then its mass would come from radiative corrections. Suppose there's a global symmetry that's broken by the VEVs of φ and H. For example, a U(1) symmetry under which φ and H transform. If this symmetry is explicitly broken by some terms in the potential, the Goldstone boson becomes massive. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only broken radiatively (anomalously), then the mass is generated through loops.

Alternatively, consider that the potential has a flat direction at tree level, which is lifted by quantum corrections. For example, if the tree-level potential is such that the combination x² + v² is fixed, but the individual VEVs x and v can vary along this flat direction. The pseudo-Goldstone boson corresponds to the angular direction in this potential, and its mass comes from the curvature induced by quantum corrections.

In such a case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson can be estimated using the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates effective potentials for the scalar fields through loop corrections. If the tree-level potential has a flat direction, the one-loop corrections can generate a mass for the pseudo-Goldstone boson.

The Coleman-Weinberg potential for a scalar field is given by:

V_eff = V_tree + (1/64π²) [m_S^4 (ln(m_S² / Λ²) - c) + ... ]

where m_S are the field-dependent masses of the particles in the loop, Λ is the renormalization scale, and c is a constant. The dominant contributions come from the heaviest particles, which in this model would be the singlet fermions N_iR and possibly the scalars S and φ.

The pseudo-Goldstone boson corresponds to a direction in field space that is flat at tree level. The one-loop correction would then generate a potential along this direction, leading to a mass term.

To compute the mass, we need to identify the flat direction and calculate the loop corrections. Let's assume that the tree-level potential has a flat direction where x² + v² = constant. The pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is the angular mode in the (φ, H) plane. The radial mode is massive, while the angular mode is massless at tree level but gets a mass from loops.

The dominant contribution to the mass would come from the particles that couple to both φ and H. In this model, the singlet fermions N_iR couple to φ via the Yukawa term y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR, and they also couple to S and the lepton doublet L via g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. However, if S does not get a VEV, the coupling to L might not contribute directly. Alternatively, if S mixes with the Higgs H through the potential, there could be an effective coupling.

But let's focus on the Yukawa coupling y_i φ N_iR^c N_iR. When φ gets a VEV x, the N_iR get Majorana masses m_Ni = y_i x. These heavy fermions will contribute to the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The one-loop correction from the fermions would be:

ΔV ≈ (1/64π²) [ m_N^4 (ln(m_N² / Λ²) - c) ]

But since m_N = y_i x, and x is part of the flat direction x² + v² = constant, the potential would depend on x, and thus on the pseudo-Goldstone direction.

However, to compute the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone, we need to expand the effective potential around the VEV and find the curvature in the angular direction. The mass squared would be the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to the Goldstone field.

Let me parametrize the flat direction as φ = x, H = v, with x² + v² = Λ². The Goldstone boson corresponds to a rotation between φ and H. Let’s define the Goldstone field θ such that:

φ = Λ sinθ

H = Λ cosθ

But H is a doublet, so actually, the Higgs VEV is in the neutral component. Let me instead consider that the flat direction is in the singlet φ and the neutral component of the Higgs H. Let’s write φ = x and H = (0, v)^T /√2, with x² + v² = Λ². The pseudo-Goldstone boson would be the phase that rotates between φ and H, but since φ is real, this is not straightforward. Wait, φ is a real field, so it doesn't have a phase. The Higgs H is complex, but its VEV is real. The Goldstone bosons from the Higgs are the three that are eaten by the W and Z. If there's an additional Goldstone boson from a global symmetry, it has to come from a different sector.

Alternatively, maybe the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs, such as λ φ² |H|². If the potential is V = λ (φ² + |H|² - Λ²)², then the minimum is at φ² + |H|² = Λ², and the radial mode is massive, while the angular mode (the pseudo-Goldstone) is massless at tree level. However, quantum corrections would generate a mass for the angular mode.

In this case, the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ would correspond to the angular direction in φ and H. The mass would come from loops of particles that couple to both φ and H. In the given model, the singlet fermions N_iR couple to φ, and the Higgs H couples to the top quark, etc. But the dominant contribution might come from the N_iR loops because they have a direct coupling to φ.

The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson can be estimated as:

m_{H₂}^2 ≈ (y^4 x^2)/(16π² Λ²) * Λ^2

Wait, let's think. The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates a term proportional to y^4 x^4 ln(y x / Λ), but since x is part of the flat direction x² + v² = Λ², we can write x = Λ sinθ, v = Λ cosθ. The second derivative with respect to θ would give the mass. However, the exact calculation would require expanding the effective potential.

Alternatively, using the formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass from radiative corrections:

m_{PG}^2 ≈ (N y^4 f²)/(16π²)

where N is the number of fermion species, y is the Yukawa coupling, and f is the symmetry breaking scale (Λ in this case). This is similar to the pion mass in QCD, but here it's for a pseudo-Goldstone boson from a broken global symmetry.

In our case, the symmetry breaking scale is Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). The Yukawa coupling is y_i for each N_iR. Assuming all y_i are of the same order y, and there are N species of N_R, then:

m_{H₂}^2 ≈ (N y^4 Λ²)/(16π²)

But Λ is the symmetry breaking scale, which is sqrt(x² + v²). However, the problem states that ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which as we discussed earlier seems contradictory unless there's a typo. If ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, then ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨h⟩² = x² + v². If the potential enforces this relation, then Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). But the problem says ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which would mean x² = x² + v² ⇒ v=0, which can't be. Therefore, I think there's a typo, and it should be ⟨φ⟩² + ⟨h⟩² = x² + v². Assuming that, then Λ = sqrt(x² + v²).

Therefore, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ would be approximately:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 Λ)/(4π)

This comes from the general formula where the mass is generated by loops of particles with Yukawa coupling y, and the scale Λ. The factor 1/(4π) is typical for loop corrections.

Alternatively, if the dominant contribution comes from the top quark loop, but in this model, the top quark couples to the Higgs H, not directly to φ. However, if there's a mixing between φ and H, the top loop could contribute. But given the Yukawa terms in the problem, the dominant contribution is likely from the N_iR loops.

Assuming that the N_iR have large Yukawa couplings y_i, and Λ is the high scale, then:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 Λ)/(4π)

But we need to express this in terms of the parameters given. The problem mentions the VEVs x and v, so perhaps Λ = sqrt(x² + v²). If x and v are of the same order, then Λ ~ x ~ v. However, in seesaw models, x could be much larger than v. For example, if x is the high scale (e.g., 10^15 GeV) and v is the electroweak scale (246 GeV), then Λ ≈ x. But the problem doesn't specify, so we might have to keep it as Λ.

But the answer might need to be expressed in terms of x, v, and the couplings y_i and g_{iα}. However, since the question is about the approximation through radiative corrections, and the pseudo-Goldstone mass is generated at one loop, the formula would involve the Yukawa couplings and the symmetry breaking scale.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone boson is part of the S field, which is a doublet, but S doesn't get a VEV, then its components would have masses from the potential. If there's an approximate custodial symmetry, the components of S could be degenerate, but radiative corrections could split them, making one a pseudo-Goldstone boson. However, the problem refers to H₂, which might be part of the Higgs sector.

Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, I think the intended answer is that the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is generated at one loop through the Yukawa interactions with the singlet fermions N_iR. The mass can be approximated as:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 x)/(4π)

where y is the Yukawa coupling of N_iR to φ, and x is the VEV of φ. This is similar to the pion mass in QCD, where the pion mass is proportional to the quark masses (which break the chiral symmetry), but here the symmetry breaking is from the Yukawa coupling and the VEV x.

Alternatively, if the symmetry breaking scale is Λ = sqrt(x² + v²), then:

m_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 Λ)/(4π)

But without more details on the potential, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem mentions radiative corrections and the Yukawa couplings to N_iR, the answer is likely proportional to y^2 x divided by (4π), possibly with a numerical factor.

Another approach: in the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the mass squared is the second derivative of the effective potential. For a real scalar field φ with a Yukawa coupling to fermions, the one-loop correction to the potential is:

ΔV ≈ (N_f y^4 φ^4)/(64π²) ln(y^2 φ^2 / Λ^2)

where N_f is the number of fermion species. The mass term is the second derivative at the minimum φ = x:

d²ΔV/dφ² ≈ (N_f y^4 x²)/(16π²)

So the mass squared would be:

m_{H₂}^2 ≈ (N_f y^4 x²)/(16π²)

But this is the mass for the radial mode, not the pseudo-Goldstone. Wait, no. If the potential has a flat direction, the radial mode is the one with mass from the tree-level potential, and the pseudo-Goldstone is the angular mode. However, if the tree-level potential is flat, then the radial mode's mass also comes from the loop correction. But in our case, the pseudo-Goldstone is the angular mode, which would get a mass from the loop corrections that break the symmetry.

Alternatively, if the potential is V = λ (φ² + H² - Λ²)^2, then at tree level, the minimum is at φ² + H² = Λ². The radial mode is the combination φδφ + HδH, with mass ~ sqrt(λ) Λ. The angular mode (pseudo-Goldstone) is massless. However, if there are Yukawa couplings that break the symmetry, then at one loop, the effective potential generates a term that gives mass to the pseudo-Goldstone.

For example, if the fermions N_iR couple only to φ, then the Coleman-Weinberg potential would depend on φ, breaking the degeneracy in the angular direction. The second derivative in the angular direction would then give:

m_{H₂}^2 ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16π² Λ²) * Λ^2 = y^4 x² / (16π²)

But this seems dimensionally incorrect. Wait, the mass squared should have dimensions of [mass]^2. If x is a mass dimension 1 (since φ is a scalar field with a VEV x), then y is dimensionless. So y^4 x² has dimension [mass]^2, which is correct. So m_{H₂} ≈ y² x / (4π).

Yes, that makes sense. So the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is approximately (y² x)/(4π). This is a standard result for pseudo-Goldstone boson masses generated by radiative corrections from Yukawa couplings. The factor of 4π comes from the loop integral (1/(16π²)) and the derivative of the potential.

Therefore, the answer should be m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4π), where y_i is the Yukawa coupling of the singlet fermion N_iR to the scalar φ. Since the problem mentions multiple N_iR with couplings y_i, the dominant contribution would come from the largest y_i. However, if all y_i are similar, it would be a sum over the contributions. But for an approximation, we can write it as m_{H₂} ≈ (y^2 x)/(4π).

So, putting it all together, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections is approximately (y² x)/(4π).

The Majorana mass is (y_i x)/2. The presence of both x and v suggests a connection between the scales of the singlet and the Higgs. The potential V(φ, S, H) would determine the VEVs and the scalar mass spectrum. If the potential has a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, leading to Goldstone bosons, but explicit breaking terms (maybe from loop corrections) would give them mass.\n\nH₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. To compute its mass, we need to consider the symmetry breaking structure. Suppose the potential has a U(1) symmetry under which φ and S transform. If this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the VEVs, a Goldstone boson appears. However, if the symmetry is explicitly broken (e.g., by terms in the potential or via quantum corrections), the Goldstone becomes a pseudo-Goldstone with a small mass.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has multiple scalars with a flat direction (i.e., a direction in field space where the potential doesn't increase), the corresponding scalar would be massless at tree level. Radiative corrections can lift this flat direction, generating a mass. This is similar to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.\n\nAssuming that H₂ is such a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass would come from loop corrections. The leading contribution would be at one-loop level. The Coleman-Weinberg potential is given by:\n\nV_eff ≈ (λ/4)φ^4 + (loop corrections)\n\nBut in this case, the potential might have a flat direction at tree level, and the one-loop corrections generate a mass. The mass squared would be proportional to the coupling constants squared times the loop factor (1/(16π²)).\n\nLooking at the interactions in the Lagrangian, the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα} could contribute to the effective potential. The fermion loops (from N_R) and scalar loops (from S and φ) would generate corrections.\n\nFor a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the mass is typically of the order m ~ (loop factor) * (symmetry breaking scale). The loop factor is ~ (coupling)^2/(16π²). If the symmetry breaking is due to couplings y_i or g_{iα}, then m_{H₂}² ~ (y^2 or g^2) * (VEV)^2 / (16π²).\n\nBut which couplings contribute? The Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c would, when φ gets a VEV x, generate a Majorana mass M_i = y_i x. The coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would, if S gets a VEV, generate a Dirac mass term for neutrinos. However, if S doesn't get a VEV, this term would mediate interactions between N_R, leptons, and the S scalar.\n\nAssuming S does not get a VEV (since the VEVs are given for φ and h), then the neutrino masses would need to be generated via a different mechanism, perhaps a radiative seesaw where S and φ loops generate the masses. But the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone mass.\n\nIf H₂ is a component of the φ field, then its mass would come from the potential. If φ is a real scalar, then its fluctuations around the VEV x would be the physical scalar. However, if φ is complex, the phase component could be a Goldstone. But in the given Lagrangian, φ is written as a real scalar because the kinetic term is (1/2)(∂φ)^2, which is typical for a real scalar. So φ is real, so no Goldstone from φ. Then, the pseudo-Goldstone must come from another field.\n\nLooking at the scalar doublet S. The S doublet has components S⁺ and S⁰. If S doesn't get a VEV, then the components remain as physical scalars. However, if S does get a VEV, then similar to the Higgs, three of its components are eaten by the W and Z bosons. But the problem states that ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the Higgs VEV, so S might not get a VEV. Wait, but the VEVs are given as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. So S does not get a VEV. Then, the components of S are physical scalars. But then, how does the potential look?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix these fields. For example, terms like φ²|H|², φ²|S|², |H|²|S|², etc. If there is a mixing between the singlet φ and the Higgs H, then the physical scalars would be mixtures of these fields. If the potential has a symmetry that's broken by the VEVs, leading to a Goldstone, but explicit breaking terms (from the other couplings) give it a mass.\n\nAlternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone could be a mixture of the CP-odd components of the Higgs and S. But since S is a doublet, if it doesn't get a VEV, its CP-odd component would remain as a physical scalar. However, if there's a term in the potential that breaks a global symmetry, like a U(1), then the associated Goldstone could get a mass from loops.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the Majorana mass term for N_R breaks the lepton number. If the scalar potential has a U(1) symmetry under which φ and S transform, but the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα} break this symmetry, then the pseudo-Goldstone boson (associated with the U(1) breaking) would get a mass from loops involving these couplings.\n\nSuppose there's a global U(1) symmetry under which φ → e^{iθ}φ and S → e^{-iθ}S, making the Yukawa terms invariant. The term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c would require φ to carry charge +2 under this U(1), and the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would require S to carry charge -1 (since N_R would need to carry charge +1 to balance the term: N̄_R has charge -1, L_α is neutral under the global U(1), S has charge -1, so total charge -1 -1 = -2, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe the U(1) charges need to be assigned differently.\n\nAlternatively, if φ is real, as per the kinetic term, then it can't carry a U(1) charge. Hmm, this complicates things. If φ is real, then the term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c is allowed only if N_R is a Majorana fermion, which they are, since they are singlet under the gauge group. But Majorana masses don't require a complex scalar. However, the Yukawa term for g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S requires S to have a charge that cancels the charges from N_R and L_α. Since L_α is a lepton doublet with lepton number +1, and N_R is a singlet with lepton number +1 (assuming lepton number symmetry), then S would need to have lepton number 0 to make the term lepton-number conserving. But if the Majorana mass term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks lepton number by two units, then the global symmetry here is lepton number. The spontaneous breaking of lepton number by φ's VEV would produce a Majoron, a Goldstone boson associated with lepton number breaking. However, in the Standard Model, with Majorana neutrino masses, the Majoron is a singlet scalar, but here φ is a real singlet, so its phase can't be the Majoron. Wait, φ is real, so it doesn't have a phase degree of freedom. Therefore, the Majoron cannot come from φ. Then, perhaps the Majoron comes from another complex scalar. But S is a doublet, and if it doesn't get a VEV, its phase components are still there. Wait, S is a complex doublet, so it has four degrees of freedom. If S doesn't get a VEV, then all four components remain. The Higgs H, which is another doublet, does get a VEV, breaking the electroweak symmetry. The S field's neutral component could mix with H, but since S doesn't get a VEV, maybe not. Alternatively, if the potential includes terms that mix S and H, even without VEVs, but that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pseudo-Goldstone is from the S field. If S is a complex doublet, it has a U(1) symmetry acting on it. If the potential has a symmetry that's broken by couplings in the Lagrangian, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone. But without knowing the exact potential, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the potential V(φ, S, H), I need to make reasonable assumptions. Let's suppose that the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs H, such that when φ and H get VEVs, there's a remaining Goldstone boson. However, since φ is real, the mixing would be in the real components. The Higgs field H has a real component after symmetry breaking, so maybe the CP-even scalars mix. The mass matrix for the CP-even scalars (Higgs and φ) would have off-diagonal terms from the potential. The physical scalars would be mixtures, and if there's an approximate symmetry, one of them could be a pseudo-Goldstone.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a term like λ (|H|² + φ² - v² - x²)^2, which is minimized when |H|² + φ² = v² + x². If originally there was an SO(2) symmetry rotating H and φ, but the VEVs break this symmetry, leading to a Goldstone boson. However, since H is a doublet and φ is a singlet, the symmetry isn't straightforward. Maybe a different symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the potential V(φ, S, H) includes a term like μ φ |S|². If φ gets a VEV x, this would contribute to the mass term of S. If there's a global symmetry under which S is charged, the VEV of φ breaks this symmetry, leading to a Goldstone boson in the S sector. However, S is a doublet, so its Goldstone would be a triplet, but the gauge symmetry would eat some components. Wait, S is a doublet with hypercharge 1. If S doesn't get a VEV, its components are not eaten. If there's a global symmetry acting on S, like a U(1), then the Goldstone would be the phase of S. But S is a doublet, so the phase is part of its components. However, the global U(1) would act on S as S → e^{iθ} S. The associated Goldstone would be the phase of S, but since S is a doublet, this would be a complex field. However, the components of S are charged under the electroweak gauge group, so the Goldstone boson from the global U(1) would mix with the electroweak Goldstones. But since the electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs VEV, the global U(1) Goldstone could remain as a physical pseudo-Goldstone if the symmetry is only approximate.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative without knowing the exact potential. The problem states that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson whose mass comes from radiative corrections. The standard way this happens is via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, where the potential is flat at tree level, and the mass is generated at one loop.\n\nAssuming that the tree-level potential has a flat direction, the one-loop correction gives a mass to the pseudo-Goldstone. The mass squared would be proportional to the coupling constants squared times the logarithm of the VEV over the renormalization scale, but often approximated as m² ~ (coupling² * VEV²)/(16π²).\n\nIn this model, the couplings that could contribute are the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα}, as well as scalar quartic couplings. The dominant contribution would come from the largest couplings. If the pseudo-Goldstone is in the φ sector, then the Yukawa coupling y_i would contribute. If it's in the S sector, then the couplings g_{iα} would contribute.\n\nSuppose H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone from the S field. Since S is a doublet, after electroweak symmetry breaking, the components of S would mix with the Higgs. However, if S doesn't get a VEV, its neutral component could be a scalar that mixes with the Higgs. The mass of H₂ would then receive corrections from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings, which connect S to the leptons and N_R.\n\nAlternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture of φ and the Higgs, the loops would involve the y_i couplings. However, φ is a real singlet, so its Yukawa coupling to N_R is Majorana-like. The one-loop correction to the φ mass would come from a loop of N_R particles. The Coleman-Weinberg potential for φ would generate a mass term if the tree-level potential is flat.\n\nFor a real scalar φ with a Yukawa coupling to fermions, the one-loop effective potential is:\n\nV_eff ≈ V_tree + (M^4 / (64π²)) (ln(M² / μ²) - c)\n\nwhere M is the fermion mass, which is y x for N_R. If the tree-level potential for φ is flat (e.g., V_tree = 0), then the one-loop contribution would generate a potential. However, the curvature of the potential at the minimum gives the mass squared:\n\nm² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16π²)\n\nBut this is if the tree-level potential is zero. However, in reality, the tree-level potential for φ would have a term like (1/2)m_φ² φ² + λ_φ φ^4. If the mass term is zero (or negligible) at tree level, then the dominant contribution comes from the loop, leading to a mass m_φ ~ (y x)/(4π). But this is for a scalar that gets its mass entirely from radiative corrections.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a quartic term λ_φ φ^4, the mass would be m_φ = sqrt(2 λ_φ) x. But if λ_φ is very small, the radiative corrections from the Yukawa coupling would dominate.\n\nGiven that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass should be much smaller than the other scalars, coming from loop effects. If the symmetry breaking is such that H₂ is massless at tree level, then the mass comes from loops. The leading contribution would be from the largest coupling in the theory that breaks the symmetry. In this case, the couplings y_i (Majorana) and g_{iα} (Dirac-like).\n\nAssuming the pseudo-Goldstone is in the φ sector, and the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i, then the mass would be m_{H₂} ~ (y_i^2 x)/(16π²). But this is a rough estimate. Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture, the mass could involve both y and g couplings.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the potential V(φ, S, H) includes a term like λ φ H† S. If such a term exists, when φ and H get VEVs, it would induce a tadpole for S, potentially giving it a VEV. But the problem states that the VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S doesn't get a VEV. However, if there's a mixing term, the mass matrix for the scalars would be non-diagonal, leading to physical states that are mixtures.\n\nBut without the explicit potential, it's challenging. However, the question specifically mentions radiative corrections, so the mass must come from loops. The pseudo-Goldstone mass is typically generated at loop level due to explicit symmetry breaking. In the context of the seesaw mechanism, sometimes the Majoron (Goldstone of lepton number breaking) gets a mass from loops if lepton number is explicitly broken. But in this model, lepton number is broken by the Majorana mass term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If φ is real, there's no phase degree of freedom, so no Majoron. Therefore, the pseudo-Goldstone must come from another sector.\n\nPerhaps the scalar potential has an approximate symmetry. For example, if there's a U(1) symmetry under which S and φ transform, but it's explicitly broken by terms in the potential, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone. The mass would then be generated by loops involving the couplings that break the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the tree-level potential has a flat direction, and the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential lifts this flatness. For example, if the potential is V = λ_S |S|^4 + λ_φ φ^4 + λ_HS |H|^2 |S|^2 + λ_Hφ |H|^2 φ^2 + ..., and if for certain values of the couplings, there's a flat direction, then the one-loop correction would generate a mass.\n\nBut to get a pseudo-Goldstone, the symmetry must be approximate. Suppose there's a shift symmetry for φ, broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i. Then, the radiative corrections from the y_i coupling would generate a mass for φ. The mass squared would be proportional to y_i^2 x^2 / (16π²). Since H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone, which in this case would be φ itself if it's the only scalar, but φ is real. Alternatively, if H₂ is a component of S.\n\nAlternatively, if S is complex and has a U(1) symmetry that's broken by the coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S, then the pseudo-Goldstone from S would get a mass from loops involving g_{iα}. The mass would be m_{H₂} ~ (g^2 v)/(16π²), where v is the electroweak scale. But this is similar to the Higgs mass in the minimal Standard Model from Coleman-Weinberg, but here applied to the S scalar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the S field doesn't get a VEV, its mass is at tree level from the potential terms. If there's a term μ_S^2 |S|^2, then the mass is μ_S. But if μ_S is zero due to a symmetry, then the mass comes from loops. For example, if S couples to N_R and leptons via g_{iα}, then a loop of N_R and leptons would generate a mass for S. The self-energy diagram for S would have a loop with N_R and L_α. The mass squared would be ~ g^2 Λ^2/(16π²), where Λ is the cutoff, but if the theory is renormalizable, the loop would depend on the masses of the particles in the loop. If N_R has a mass M = y x, then the mass squared of S would be ~ (g^2 M^2)/(16π²) ln(M^2/μ^2). If M is large (heavy N_R), this could give a significant mass to S.\n\nBut the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone H₂. If H₂ is a component of S, then its mass would be generated by such loops. For example, the neutral component of S could have a mass squared ~ (g^2 y^2 x^2)/(16π²). But this is a rough estimate.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a term that breaks the global symmetry explicitly, like a mass term for S, then the pseudo-Goldstone mass would be related to that breaking. But without knowing the potential, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the information, the most plausible answer is that the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is generated at one-loop level through the Yukawa couplings g_{iα} and y_i. The dominant contribution would come from the heaviest particles in the loop, which are the singlet fermions N_{iR} with masses y_i x. The mass squared would be proportional to (g^2 y^2 x²)/(16π²), but the exact expression depends on the specific couplings and group factors.\n\nIn similar models, the pseudo-Goldstone mass from radiative corrections often scales as m_{H₂} ≈ (g y x)/(4π). However, without the exact form of the potential and the specific couplings, this is an approximation. Considering that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass should be suppressed by a loop factor compared to the symmetry breaking scale. If the symmetry breaking scale is x, then m_{H₂} ~ (loop factor) * x, where the loop factor is ~ y^2/(16π²) or g^2/(16π²).\n\nAlternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a singlet scalar mixed with the Higgs, its mass could be generated via loops involving top quarks or other heavy particles. But in this model, the relevant heavy particles are the N_R fermions. Their Yukawa couplings to φ and S would contribute to the scalar potential.\n\nGiven the terms in the Lagrangian, the Yukawa interaction -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would, in the loop, connect S to the leptons and N_R. If N_R is heavy, with mass y x, the loop would generate a quartic coupling for S or a mass term. The self-energy correction to S would be:\n\nΣ ≈ (g^2 / (16π²)) (y x)^2 log((y x)^2 / μ^2)\n\nThus, the mass squared of S (and hence H₂ if it's a component of S) would be of order g² y² x² / (16π²).\n\nIf H₂ is the lightest scalar from S, its mass would be approximately:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ (g y x) / (4π)\n\nThis is a common estimate in such radiative symmetry breaking scenarios. Therefore, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections is approximately proportional to (g y x)/(4π). To express it more precisely, considering possible factors from loop integrals and group theory factors (which are O(1)), the answer is often written as:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ \\frac{y g x}{16\\pi²} \\sqrt{\\lambda} \n\nBut without knowing the exact potential, the simplest approximation is m_{H₂} ~ (y g x)/(16π²). However, considering that the loop factor is typically 1/(16π²), but the mass squared would be proportional to that, so:\n\nm_{H₂}² ≈ (y² g² x²)/(16π²)\n\nThus, m_{H₂} ≈ (y g x)/(4π)\n\nBut I need to check the exact dependence. In the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the mass squared from a Yukawa coupling is:\n\nm² ≈ (N y²)/(16π²) v²\n\nwhere N is the number of degrees of freedom. For a Yukawa coupling to fermions, N is the number of fermion species times a factor (like 1/2 for Majorana).

To determine the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) through radiative corrections in the given extension of the Standard Model, we analyze the interactions and symmetry breaking structure. The model includes singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \), a scalar doublet \( S \), and a singlet scalar \( \phi \). The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are \( \langle \phi \rangle = x \) and \( \langle H \rangle = v \), with \( \langle \phi \rangle^2 = x^2 + v^2 \).

Key interactions include:
1. Majorana mass term for \( N_{iR} \) via \( y_i \phi \overline{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR} \).
2. Yukawa coupling \( g_{i\alpha} \overline{N}_{iR} L_\alpha S \).

The pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, with its mass generated radiatively due to explicit symmetry breaking in the loop corrections. The dominant contribution comes from loops involving the Yukawa couplings \( y_i \) and \( g_{i\alpha} \), which connect the singlet fermions \( N_{iR} \), lepton doublets \( L_\alpha \), and the scalar \( S \).

The mass of \( H_2 \) is estimated using the Coleman-Weinberg potential, where the one-loop correction generates a mass term proportional to the product of the couplings \( y \) and \( g \), the VEV \( x \), and suppressed by a loop factor \( 1/(4\pi) \). The resulting mass is:

\[
\boxed{m_{H_{2}} \approx \frac{g y x}{4\pi}}
\]

The singlet scalar φ's VEV x gives Majorana masses to N_R via the term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. The Majorana mass is (y_i x)/2. The presence of both x and v suggests a connection between the scales of the singlet and the Higgs. The potential V(φ, S, H) would determine the VEVs and the scalar mass spectrum. If the potential has a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, leading to Goldstone bosons, but explicit breaking terms (maybe from loop corrections) would give them mass.

H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. To compute its mass, we need to consider the symmetry breaking structure. Suppose the potential has a U(1) symmetry under which φ and S transform. If this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the VEVs, a Goldstone boson appears. However, if the symmetry is explicitly broken (e.g., by terms in the potential or via quantum corrections), the Goldstone becomes a pseudo-Goldstone with a small mass.

Alternatively, if the potential has multiple scalars with a flat direction (i.e., a direction in field space where the potential doesn't increase), the corresponding scalar would be massless at tree level. Radiative corrections can lift this flat direction, generating a mass. This is similar to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.

Assuming that H₂ is such a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass would come from loop corrections. The leading contribution would be at one-loop level. The Coleman-Weinberg potential is given by:

V_eff ≈ (λ/4)φ^4 + (loop corrections)

But in this case, the potential might have a flat direction at tree level, and the one-loop corrections generate a mass. The mass squared would be proportional to the coupling constants squared times the loop factor (1/(16π²)).

Looking at the interactions in the Lagrangian, the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα} could contribute to the effective potential. The fermion loops (from N_R) and scalar loops (from S and φ) would generate corrections.

For a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the mass is typically of the order m ~ (loop factor) * (symmetry breaking scale). The loop factor is ~ (coupling)^2/(16π²). If the symmetry breaking is due to couplings y_i or g_{iα}, then m_{H₂}² ~ (y^2 or g^2) * (VEV)^2 / (16π²).

But which couplings contribute? The Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c would, when φ gets a VEV x, generate a Majorana mass M_i = y_i x. The coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would, if S gets a VEV, generate a Dirac mass term for neutrinos. However, if S doesn't get a VEV, this term would mediate interactions between N_R, leptons, and the S scalar.

Assuming S does not get a VEV (since the VEVs are given for φ and h), then the neutrino masses would need to be generated via a different mechanism, perhaps a radiative seesaw where S and φ loops generate the masses. But the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone mass.

If H₂ is a component of the φ field, then its mass would come from the potential. If φ is a real scalar, then its fluctuations around the VEV x would be the physical scalar. However, if φ is complex, the phase component could be a Goldstone. But in the given Lagrangian, φ is written as a real scalar because the kinetic term is (1/2)(∂φ)^2, which is typical for a real scalar. So φ is real, so no Goldstone from φ. Then, the pseudo-Goldstone must come from another field.

Looking at the scalar doublet S. The S doublet has components S⁺ and S⁰. If S doesn't get a VEV, then the components remain as physical scalars. However, if S does get a VEV, then similar to the Higgs, three of its components are eaten by the W and Z bosons. But the problem states that ⟨h⟩ = v, which is the Higgs VEV, so S might not get a VEV. Wait, but the VEVs are given as ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. So S does not get a VEV. Then, the components of S are physical scalars. But then, how does the potential look?

Alternatively, maybe the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix these fields. For example, terms like φ²|H|², φ²|S|², |H|²|S|², etc. If there is a mixing between the singlet φ and the Higgs H, then the physical scalars would be mixtures of these fields. If the potential has a symmetry that's broken by the VEVs, leading to a Goldstone, but explicit breaking terms (from the other couplings) give it a mass.

Alternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone could be a mixture of the CP-odd components of the Higgs and S. But since S is a doublet, if it doesn't get a VEV, its CP-odd component would remain as a physical scalar. However, if there's a term in the potential that breaks a global symmetry, like a U(1), then the associated Goldstone could get a mass from loops.

Alternatively, consider that the Majorana mass term for N_R breaks the lepton number. If the scalar potential has a U(1) symmetry under which φ and S transform, but the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα} break this symmetry, then the pseudo-Goldstone boson (associated with the U(1) breaking) would get a mass from loops involving these couplings.

Suppose there's a global U(1) symmetry under which φ → e^{iθ}φ and S → e^{-iθ}S, making the Yukawa terms invariant. The term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c would require φ to carry charge +2 under this U(1), and the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would require S to carry charge -1 (since N_R would need to carry charge +1 to balance the term: N̄_R has charge -1, L_α is neutral under the global U(1), S has charge -1, so total charge -1 -1 = -2, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe the U(1) charges need to be assigned differently.

Alternatively, if φ is real, as per the kinetic term, then it can't carry a U(1) charge. Hmm, this complicates things. If φ is real, then the term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c is allowed only if N_R is a Majorana fermion, which they are, since they are singlet under the gauge group. But Majorana masses don't require a complex scalar. However, the Yukawa term for g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S requires S to have a charge that cancels the charges from N_R and L_α. Since L_α is a lepton doublet with lepton number +1, and N_R is a singlet with lepton number +1 (assuming lepton number symmetry), then S would need to have lepton number 0 to make the term lepton-number conserving. But if the Majorana mass term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks lepton number by two units, then the global symmetry here is lepton number. The spontaneous breaking of lepton number by φ's VEV would produce a Majoron, a Goldstone boson associated with lepton number breaking. However, in the Standard Model, with Majorana neutrino masses, the Majoron is a singlet scalar, but here φ is a real singlet, so its phase can't be the Majoron. Wait, φ is real, so it doesn't have a phase degree of freedom. Therefore, the Majoron cannot come from φ. Then, perhaps the Majoron comes from another complex scalar. But S is a doublet, and if it doesn't get a VEV, its phase components are still there. Wait, S is a complex doublet, so it has four degrees of freedom. If S doesn't get a VEV, then all four components remain. The Higgs H, which is another doublet, does get a VEV, breaking the electroweak symmetry. The S field's neutral component could mix with H, but since S doesn't get a VEV, maybe not. Alternatively, if the potential includes terms that mix S and H, even without VEVs, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudo-Goldstone is from the S field. If S is a complex doublet, it has a U(1) symmetry acting on it. If the potential has a symmetry that's broken by couplings in the Lagrangian, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone. But without knowing the exact potential, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity in the potential V(φ, S, H), I need to make reasonable assumptions. Let's suppose that the potential has a term that mixes φ and the Higgs H, such that when φ and H get VEVs, there's a remaining Goldstone boson. However, since φ is real, the mixing would be in the real components. The Higgs field H has a real component after symmetry breaking, so maybe the CP-even scalars mix. The mass matrix for the CP-even scalars (Higgs and φ) would have off-diagonal terms from the potential. The physical scalars would be mixtures, and if there's an approximate symmetry, one of them could be a pseudo-Goldstone.

Alternatively, if the potential has a term like λ (|H|² + φ² - v² - x²)^2, which is minimized when |H|² + φ² = v² + x². If originally there was an SO(2) symmetry rotating H and φ, but the VEVs break this symmetry, leading to a Goldstone boson. However, since H is a doublet and φ is a singlet, the symmetry isn't straightforward. Maybe a different symmetry.

Alternatively, consider that the potential V(φ, S, H) includes a term like μ φ |S|². If φ gets a VEV x, this would contribute to the mass term of S. If there's a global symmetry under which S is charged, the VEV of φ breaks this symmetry, leading to a Goldstone boson in the S sector. However, S is a doublet, so its Goldstone would be a triplet, but the gauge symmetry would eat some components. Wait, S is a doublet with hypercharge 1. If S doesn't get a VEV, its components are not eaten. If there's a global symmetry acting on S, like a U(1), then the Goldstone would be the phase of S. But S is a doublet, so the phase is part of its components. However, the global U(1) would act on S as S → e^{iθ} S. The associated Goldstone would be the phase of S, but since S is a doublet, this would be a complex field. However, the components of S are charged under the electroweak gauge group, so the Goldstone boson from the global U(1) would mix with the electroweak Goldstones. But since the electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs VEV, the global U(1) Goldstone could remain as a physical pseudo-Goldstone if the symmetry is only approximate.

But this is getting too speculative without knowing the exact potential. The problem states that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone boson whose mass comes from radiative corrections. The standard way this happens is via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, where the potential is flat at tree level, and the mass is generated at one loop.

Assuming that the tree-level potential has a flat direction, the one-loop correction gives a mass to the pseudo-Goldstone. The mass squared would be proportional to the coupling constants squared times the logarithm of the VEV over the renormalization scale, but often approximated as m² ~ (coupling² * VEV²)/(16π²).

In this model, the couplings that could contribute are the Yukawa couplings y_i and g_{iα}, as well as scalar quartic couplings. The dominant contribution would come from the largest couplings. If the pseudo-Goldstone is in the φ sector, then the Yukawa coupling y_i would contribute. If it's in the S sector, then the couplings g_{iα} would contribute.

Suppose H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone from the S field. Since S is a doublet, after electroweak symmetry breaking, the components of S would mix with the Higgs. However, if S doesn't get a VEV, its neutral component could be a scalar that mixes with the Higgs. The mass of H₂ would then receive corrections from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings, which connect S to the leptons and N_R.

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture of φ and the Higgs, the loops would involve the y_i couplings. However, φ is a real singlet, so its Yukawa coupling to N_R is Majorana-like. The one-loop correction to the φ mass would come from a loop of N_R particles. The Coleman-Weinberg potential for φ would generate a mass term if the tree-level potential is flat.

For a real scalar φ with a Yukawa coupling to fermions, the one-loop effective potential is:

V_eff ≈ V_tree + (M^4 / (64π²)) (ln(M² / μ²) - c)

where M is the fermion mass, which is y x for N_R. If the tree-level potential for φ is flat (e.g., V_tree = 0), then the one-loop contribution would generate a potential. However, the curvature of the potential at the minimum gives the mass squared:

m² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16π²)

But this is if the tree-level potential is zero. However, in reality, the tree-level potential for φ would have a term like (1/2)m_φ² φ² + λ_φ φ^4. If the mass term is zero (or negligible) at tree level, then the dominant contribution comes from the loop, leading to a mass m_φ ~ (y x)/(4π). But this is for a scalar that gets its mass entirely from radiative corrections.

Alternatively, if the potential has a quartic term λ_φ φ^4, the mass would be m_φ = sqrt(2 λ_φ) x. But if λ_φ is very small, the radiative corrections from the Yukawa coupling would dominate.

Given that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass should be much smaller than the other scalars, coming from loop effects. If the symmetry breaking is such that H₂ is massless at tree level, then the mass comes from loops. The leading contribution would be from the largest coupling in the theory that breaks the symmetry. In this case, the couplings y_i (Majorana) and g_{iα} (Dirac-like).

Assuming the pseudo-Goldstone is in the φ sector, and the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i, then the mass would be m_{H₂} ~ (y_i^2 x)/(16π²). But this is a rough estimate. Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a mixture, the mass could involve both y and g couplings.

Alternatively, consider that the potential V(φ, S, H) includes a term like λ φ H† S. If such a term exists, when φ and H get VEVs, it would induce a tadpole for S, potentially giving it a VEV. But the problem states that the VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v, so maybe S doesn't get a VEV. However, if there's a mixing term, the mass matrix for the scalars would be non-diagonal, leading to physical states that are mixtures.

But without the explicit potential, it's challenging. However, the question specifically mentions radiative corrections, so the mass must come from loops. The pseudo-Goldstone mass is typically generated at loop level due to explicit symmetry breaking. In the context of the seesaw mechanism, sometimes the Majoron (Goldstone of lepton number breaking) gets a mass from loops if lepton number is explicitly broken. But in this model, lepton number is broken by the Majorana mass term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If φ is real, there's no phase degree of freedom, so no Majoron. Therefore, the pseudo-Goldstone must come from another sector.

Perhaps the scalar potential has an approximate symmetry. For example, if there's a U(1) symmetry under which S and φ transform, but it's explicitly broken by terms in the potential, leading to a pseudo-Goldstone. The mass would then be generated by loops involving the couplings that break the symmetry.

Alternatively, consider that the tree-level potential has a flat direction, and the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential lifts this flatness. For example, if the potential is V = λ_S |S|^4 + λ_φ φ^4 + λ_HS |H|^2 |S|^2 + λ_Hφ |H|^2 φ^2 + ..., and if for certain values of the couplings, there's a flat direction, then the one-loop correction would generate a mass.

But to get a pseudo-Goldstone, the symmetry must be approximate. Suppose there's a shift symmetry for φ, broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i. Then, the radiative corrections from the y_i coupling would generate a mass for φ. The mass squared would be proportional to y_i^2 x^2 / (16π²). Since H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone, which in this case would be φ itself if it's the only scalar, but φ is real. Alternatively, if H₂ is a component of S.

Alternatively, if S is complex and has a U(1) symmetry that's broken by the coupling g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S, then the pseudo-Goldstone from S would get a mass from loops involving g_{iα}. The mass would be m_{H₂} ~ (g^2 v)/(16π²), where v is the electroweak scale. But this is similar to the Higgs mass in the minimal Standard Model from Coleman-Weinberg, but here applied to the S scalar.

Alternatively, considering that the S field doesn't get a VEV, its mass is at tree level from the potential terms. If there's a term μ_S^2 |S|^2, then the mass is μ_S. But if μ_S is zero due to a symmetry, then the mass comes from loops. For example, if S couples to N_R and leptons via g_{iα}, then a loop of N_R and leptons would generate a mass for S. The self-energy diagram for S would have a loop with N_R and L_α. The mass squared would be ~ g^2 Λ^2/(16π²), where Λ is the cutoff, but if the theory is renormalizable, the loop would depend on the masses of the particles in the loop. If N_R has a mass M = y x, then the mass squared of S would be ~ (g^2 M^2)/(16π²) ln(M^2/μ^2). If M is large (heavy N_R), this could give a significant mass to S.

But the question is about the pseudo-Goldstone H₂. If H₂ is a component of S, then its mass would be generated by such loops. For example, the neutral component of S could have a mass squared ~ (g^2 y^2 x^2)/(16π²). But this is a rough estimate.

Alternatively, if the potential has a term that breaks the global symmetry explicitly, like a mass term for S, then the pseudo-Goldstone mass would be related to that breaking. But without knowing the potential, it's hard to say.

Given the information, the most plausible answer is that the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is generated at one-loop level through the Yukawa couplings g_{iα} and y_i. The dominant contribution would come from the heaviest particles in the loop, which are the singlet fermions N_{iR} with masses y_i x. The mass squared would be proportional to (g^2 y^2 x²)/(16π²), but the exact expression depends on the specific couplings and group factors.

In similar models, the pseudo-Goldstone mass from radiative corrections often scales as m_{H₂} ≈ (g y x)/(4π). However, without the exact form of the potential and the specific couplings, this is an approximation. Considering that H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass should be suppressed by a loop factor compared to the symmetry breaking scale. If the symmetry breaking scale is x, then m_{H₂} ~ (loop factor) * x, where the loop factor is ~ y^2/(16π²) or g^2/(16π²).

Alternatively, if the pseudo-Goldstone is a singlet scalar mixed with the Higgs, its mass could be generated via loops involving top quarks or other heavy particles. But in this model, the relevant heavy particles are the N_R fermions. Their Yukawa couplings to φ and S would contribute to the scalar potential.

Given the terms in the Lagrangian, the Yukawa interaction -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S would, in the loop, connect S to the leptons and N_R. If N_R is heavy, with mass y x, the loop would generate a quartic coupling for S or a mass term. The self-energy correction to S would be:

Σ ≈ (g^2 / (16π²)) (y x)^2 log((y x)^2 / μ^2)

Thus, the mass squared of S (and hence H₂ if it's a component of S) would be of order g² y² x² / (16π²).

If H₂ is the lightest scalar from S, its mass would be approximately:

m_{H₂} ≈ (g y x) / (4π)

This is a common estimate in such radiative symmetry breaking scenarios. Therefore, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections is approximately proportional to (g y x)/(4π). To express it more precisely, considering possible factors from loop integrals and group theory factors (which are O(1)), the answer is often written as:

m_{H₂} ≈ \frac{y g x}{16\pi²} \sqrt{\lambda} 

But without knowing the exact potential, the simplest approximation is m_{H₂} ~ (y g x)/(16π²). However, considering that the loop factor is typically 1/(16π²), but the mass squared would be proportional to that, so:

m_{H₂}² ≈ (y² g² x²)/(16π²)

Thus, m_{H₂} ≈ (y g x)/(4π)

But I need to check the exact dependence. In the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the mass squared from a Yukawa coupling is:

m² ≈ (N y²)/(16π²) v²

where N is the number of degrees of freedom. For a Yukawa coupling to fermions, N is the number of fermion species times a factor (like 1/2 for Majorana). In this case, if the loop is a fermion loop (N_R and L_α), then the contribution would be:

Σ ≈ (g^2 y^2 x²)/(16π²) * log(...)

Assuming the log is O(1), then m_{H₂} ≈ (g y x)/(4π)

But since H₂ is a pseudo-Goldstone, maybe the mass is further suppressed. Alternatively, if the symmetry is broken at tree level, but the mass is zero at tree level and generated at loop, then m_{H₂} would be as above.

Given the ambiguity, the standard approximation for a pseudo-Goldstone mass from radiative corrections is m ~ (coupling * symmetry breaking scale)/(4π). Here, the symmetry breaking scale is x, and the coupling is a combination of y and g. Therefore, the answer is likely:

m_{H₂} ≈ \frac{y g x}{16\pi^2}

But I need to confirm the factors. For a scalar mass generated at one loop, the correction is:

Δm² ≈ \frac{y^2 g^2 x^2}{16\pi^2}

So m ≈ \frac{y g x}{4\pi}

But since the question asks for the approximation through radiative corrections, and given that in such models the pseudo-Goldstone mass is often quoted as being of the order of the loop factor times the symmetry breaking scale, the answer is probably:

m_{H₂} \approx \frac{y g x}{16\pi^2}

But I'm not entirely sure about the numerical factor. However, in the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the effective potential for a scalar coupled to fermions with coupling y is:

V_eff ≈ \frac{y^4}{64\pi^2} \phi^4 \ln\left(\frac{\phi^2}{M^2}\right)

The mass squared is the second derivative at the minimum, which would be of order y^4 x² / (16π²). But this is for a quartic coupling generated radiatively. In our case, if the pseudo-Goldstone's mass comes from a combination of y and g couplings, the mass squared would be proportional to y² g² x² / (16π²), leading to m_{H₂} ≈ y g x / (4π).

Alternatively, if the mass is generated by a loop with N_R and L_α, the contribution would be:

m_{H₂}^2 ≈ \frac{g^2 y^2 x^2}{16\pi^2}

Thus, m_{H₂} ≈ \frac{g y x}{4\pi}

This seems more plausible, as the loop involves two Yukawa vertices (g and y), leading to a product of couplings. Therefore, the mass is approximately (g y x)/(4π). However, the exact coefficient might differ by a factor, but in the absence of specific model details, this is a standard estimate.

Therefore, the approximate mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections is:

m_{H₂} ≈ \frac{g y x}{4\pi}

But to match possible answer conventions, sometimes it's written with a 16π² denominator. However, considering that each loop brings a factor of 1/(16π²), and the mass squared would have one loop factor, so m² ~ (g² y² x²)/(16π²), hence m ~ (g y x)/(4π). Yes, that's correct.

So the final answer is:

\boxed{m_{H_{2}} \approx \frac{g y x}{4\pi}}

For example, if the potential has an approximate symmetry that\'s broken by some terms, the Goldstone boson gets a small mass from loop corrections.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a flat direction at tree level, quantum corrections (radiative corrections) can generate a mass for the would-be Goldstone boson. This is similar to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, where the effective potential at one-loop lifts the flat direction, giving a mass to the scalar.\n\nBut the problem states that the mass of H₂ is generated through radiative corrections. So, perhaps at tree level, H₂ is massless (a Goldstone boson), but loop effects generate a mass. The question is to compute this mass.\n\nTo proceed, I need to identify the Goldstone boson in the scalar sector. The scalar fields are:\n\n- The Higgs doublet H, which after symmetry breaking, has a neutral component that gives the Higgs boson and three Goldstone bosons eaten by the W and Z.\n\n- The scalar doublet S, which, if it doesn\'t get a VEV, has four real scalar fields. If it\'s a doublet with hypercharge 1, its components are S⁺, S⁰, where S⁰ is a complex field. So, S has four degrees of freedom.\n\n- The singlet scalar φ, which is a real scalar (since it\'s a singlet, and assuming it\'s real; but if it\'s complex, then two degrees of freedom. The problem says "singlet scalar", so likely real. But the term (∂μ φ)^2 is written as (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is standard for a real scalar. So φ is a real scalar, with one degree of freedom. Its VEV is x, so after symmetry breaking, φ = x + η, where η is the fluctuation. The mass term for η would be from the potential.\n\nBut the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. If the potential has a symmetry that\'s spontaneously broken, leading to a Goldstone, which then gets a mass from loops. For example, if there\'s a U(1) symmetry under which φ shifts, then η would be the Goldstone. But if the symmetry is explicitly broken, η becomes a pseudo-Goldstone. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only approximate, then the mass is generated at loop level.\n\nAlternatively, the mixing between φ and H through the potential could lead to a pseudo-Goldstone. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix φ and H. For example, a term like λ (H† H - v²)² + μ φ² (H† H) + ... If there\'s a term that mixes φ and H, then when H and φ get VEVs, their fluctuations mix. However, the Goldstone bosons from the Higgs are eaten by the W and Z. The singlet φ\'s fluctuation η is a real scalar, so it can\'t be a Goldstone unless there\'s a shift symmetry. If the potential for φ is such that it\'s flat (no mass term), then η is a Goldstone. But if the potential has a term that breaks the shift symmetry, η gets a mass. If the breaking is small, η is a pseudo-Goldstone.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a term like (φ² + H† H - Λ²)^2, then the VEVs satisfy φ² + H† H = Λ². The fluctuations orthogonal to the VEV direction would be a pseudo-Goldstone. For example, if we write φ = x + η and H = v + h, then the combination x η + v h is the massive mode, and the orthogonal combination (v η - x h) is the Goldstone. But if the potential is exactly (φ² + H† H - Λ²)^2, then the Goldstone would be massless. However, if there are other terms in the potential that break the symmetry, the Goldstone gets a mass. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only approximate, then the Goldstone becomes a pseudo-Goldstone with mass generated by the explicit breaking terms.\n\nBut the problem states that the mass is generated through radiative corrections. So perhaps at tree level, the potential has an accidental symmetry that makes H₂ massless, and loops break this symmetry, generating a mass. For example, in the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the symmetry breaking is generated radiatively. But here, maybe the tree-level potential has a flat direction, and loop corrections lift it.\n\nAlternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone could be part of the S doublet. If S doesn\'t get a VEV, its components are physical scalars. If there\'s a global symmetry acting on S, then the components could be Goldstone bosons. But since S is a doublet under SU(2), which is a gauge symmetry, the Goldstone bosons would be eaten by the W and Z. However, if S is a complex doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs, but with a different VEV. Wait, but the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. If S doesn\'t get a VEV, then its components are just scalars. But if S does get a VEV, then the Goldstone bosons would be eaten. But the problem doesn\'t mention S getting a VEV, so perhaps S is inert. Then, the components of S are inert scalars, and the pseudo-Gstone boson H₂ is among them. But then, why would they be pseudo-Goldstone? Unless there\'s an approximate symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone comes from the φ and H mixing. Let\'s consider that. Suppose the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix φ and H. For example, a term like λ φ² H† H. Then, when φ and H get VEVs, their fluctuations mix. The mass matrix would have off-diagonal terms. The physical scalars would be mixtures of η (from φ) and h (from H). The mass eigenstates would be combinations of these. If there\'s an approximate symmetry, like a U(1) under which φ and H rotate into each other, then the pseudo-Goldstone would be the combination that\'s light. But how does this relate to radiative corrections?\n\nAlternatively, the potential has a term that breaks the symmetry explicitly at loop level. For example, if the tree-level potential respects a symmetry that\'s broken by quantum corrections, then the Goldstone boson gets a mass from loops.\n\nAlternatively, the Yukawa couplings in the Lagrangian break the symmetry. For example, the Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks a possible shift symmetry of φ, since φ appears linearly. If φ had a shift symmetry φ → φ + c, then the Yukawa term would break it, generating a mass for the pseudo-Goldstone boson through loops involving the N_R fields.\n\nLet me explore this possibility. Suppose φ is a Goldstone boson of a global U(1) symmetry at tree level. The Yukawa coupling y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c explicitly breaks this symmetry because φ is not invariant under the U(1) (it shifts), and the N_R are charged under the U(1). If the U(1) is explicitly broken by this Yukawa term, then the Goldstone boson (η, the fluctuation of φ) becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson, acquiring a mass from loops. The mass would be generated at loop level via diagrams involving the N_R loops.\n\nSimilarly, the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S could also contribute if S is charged under the U(1), but if S is neutral, then this term might preserve the symmetry. But if φ is the only field charged under the U(1), then the Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks the symmetry, leading to a mass for η.\n\nIn this case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson (η, which is H₂?) would be generated at one loop. The calculation would involve a loop of N_R particles with the Yukawa coupling y_i. The mass squared would be proportional to y_i² Λ² / (16π²), where Λ is some scale, but since the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa term, the mass might be related to the VEV x and the coupling y_i.\n\nAlternatively, the Coleman-Weinberg potential could generate a mass for φ. If the tree-level potential for φ is zero (or flat), then the one-loop correction would generate an effective potential, leading to a mass. The Coleman-Weinberg potential is given by:\n\nV_eff ≈ (λ_eff/4) φ^4 + ... \n\nBut if the tree-level potential is zero, the one-loop potential would be something like (y^4 φ^4)/(64 π²) log(φ^2 / μ^2), leading to a mass when the minimum is chosen. However, in this case, the mass would be of order y^2 x / (16 π²), where x is the VEV.\n\nBut the problem states that the mass is generated through radiative corrections. So perhaps the tree-level mass is zero (Goldstone), and the loop corrections give a small mass. The dominant contribution would come from the Yukawa couplings to N_R, since they are the ones that explicitly break the symmetry.\n\nThe general formula for the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson from radiative corrections (due to explicit symmetry breaking) is m² ≈ (g^2 Λ^2)/(16 π²), where g is the coupling that breaks the symmetry and Λ is the cutoff scale. But in this case, the symmetry breaking is due to the Yukawa coupling y_i, and the cutoff could be related to the VEV x.\n\nAlternatively, the mass can be estimated by computing the loop diagram where the pseudo-Goldstone (η) couples to the N_R via the Yukawa term, leading to a loop correction to the η mass. The Yukawa term is (y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. Expanding φ around its VEV: φ = x + η. The interaction term becomes (y_i / 2) x N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c + (y_i / 2) η N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. The first term is the Majorana mass for N_R: M_i = y_i x / 2. The second term is the coupling between η and N_R.\n\nThe one-loop correction to the η mass comes from a loop of N_R particles. Since η is a real scalar, the diagram is a loop of two N_R propagators with two insertions of the Yukawa coupling. The amplitude is proportional to y_i² times the loop integral. The mass squared correction would be:\n\nδm² ≈ (y_i² / (16 π²)) M_i²\n\nBut M_i = y_i x / 2, so substituting:\n\nδm² ≈ (y_i² / (16 π²)) (y_i² x² / 4) ) = (y_i^4 x²) / (64 π²)\n\nBut this seems too small. Alternatively, if the loop is a fermion loop with two vertices, each proportional to y_i, and the loop momentum integral would give a term proportional to M_i². The general formula for a scalar mass correction from a fermion loop is:\n\nδm² ≈ (N_f y^2)/(16 π²) Λ^2\n\nwhere Λ is the cutoff. But in a renormalizable theory, the loop integral would be logarithmic, but if we use dimensional regularization, the mass correction would be proportional to y^2 M_i^2. Wait, let\'s recall the formula for the self-energy.\n\nThe self-energy diagram for η would be a loop with two Yukawa couplings (each y_i/2) and a fermion loop. The amplitude is:\n\niΣ ≈ (y_i^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k / (2π)^4 Tr[ (i(k̸ + M_i)) / (k² - M_i² + iε) ) * (i(k̸ + M_i)) / (k² - M_i² + iε) ) ]\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, the self-energy at zero momentum transfer for a scalar coupling to fermions with coupling g is given by:\n\nΣ ≈ (g^2 / (16 π²)) [ Λ^2 - 2 M_i^2 log(Λ^2 / M_i^2) + ... ]\n\nBut if we use a cutoff Λ, the quadratic divergence is Λ^2. However, in the case where the theory is renormalizable, the quadratic divergence is absorbed into the counterterms. But if the tree-level mass is zero (as for a Goldstone), the radiative correction would give a mass term. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs mass receives quadratic corrections, but here, if η is a Goldstone boson at tree level, its mass is protected by the shift symmetry. The explicit breaking of the shift symmetry by the Yukawa coupling would generate a mass at loop level.\n\nBut in the case of a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the mass is typically proportional to the symmetry-breaking parameter. Here, the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i. The mass should be proportional to y_i times some scale. However, the actual calculation would involve loops.\n\nAlternatively, the mass can be estimated using the Coleman-Weinberg potential. If the tree-level potential for φ is flat (no mass term), then the one-loop correction would generate an effective potential. The Coleman-Weinberg potential for a real scalar coupled to fermions is:\n\nV_eff = V_tree + (1/(64 π²)) [ M^4 (ln(M^2 / μ^2) - c) ]\n\nwhere M is the mass of the fermion, which depends on φ: M(φ) = y φ / 2. Then,\n\nV_eff ≈ (y^4 φ^4)/(256 π²) (ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c)\n\nThe minimum of the potential would be at some φ = x, and the curvature at that point gives the mass. Taking the second derivative:\n\nm² = d²V_eff/dφ² |_{φ=x}\n\nAssuming that the minimum is determined by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, but in our case, the VEV x is given, so perhaps we can compute the mass as the second derivative of the one-loop potential.\n\nLet’s compute this. Let’s denote M(φ) = (y φ)/2. The one-loop contribution from the fermion loop is:\n\nΔV = - (N_f / (64 π²)) M(φ)^4 [ ln(M(φ)^2 / μ^2) - c ]\n\nBut for a real scalar field interacting with Majorana fermions, the number of degrees of freedom is different. For a Majorana fermion, the loop contribution is 1/2 that of a Dirac fermion. Since each N_iR is a Majorana fermion (because of the Majorana mass term), the contribution per fermion would be (1/2) times the Dirac case. Assuming N_f species of N_R, each with coupling y_i, the total contribution would be:\n\nΔV = - (1/(64 π²)) Σ_i [ (y_i^4 φ^4 / 16) (ln(y_i^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c) ]\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let\'s simplify by considering one generation, N=1, and y_i = y. Then,\n\nΔV ≈ - (1/(64 π²)) * (y^4 φ^4 / 16) [ ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c ]\n\nThe first derivative dV/dφ would set the minimum. However, if the tree-level potential has a term that fixes the VEV x, then the one-loop correction would contribute to the mass. Suppose the tree-level potential is V_tree = λ (φ² - x²)^2. Then, the VEV is x, and the mass at tree level is m_tree² = 8 λ x². But if λ is zero (flat direction), then the entire potential comes from the loop, and the VEV is determined by the log terms. However, the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x, so perhaps the tree-level potential is responsible for the VEV, and the loop gives a small correction to the mass.\n\nAlternatively, if the tree-level potential for φ is zero, and the VEV is generated radiatively via Coleman-Weinberg. But the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x, so maybe we can take x as given and compute the curvature at φ = x from the loop.\n\nAssuming that the tree-level potential is such that φ has a VEV x, but the mass at tree level is zero (Goldstone), then the one-loop correction would generate the mass. The second derivative of ΔV at φ = x would be:\n\nd²ΔV/dφ² = (d²/dφ²) [ - (y^4 φ^4)/(1024 π²) (ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c) ]\n\nThis derivative would involve terms proportional to y^4 x² / (16 π²). Let\'s compute it step by step.\n\nLet’s define f(φ) = φ^4 [ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c]\n\nFirst derivative f’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [ln(...) - c] + φ^4 * (2 / φ) * (1 / (y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2))) * (y^2 φ / (2 μ^2)) )\n\nWait, maybe it\'s better to use logarithmic differentiation. Let’s set t = y φ / (2 μ), so φ = 2 μ t / y. Then, ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) = ln(t²) = 2 ln t. So,\n\nf(φ) = φ^4 [2 ln t - c] = φ^4 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c]\n\nBut this might not help. Let\'s compute f’(φ):\n\nf’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c] + φ^4 * 2 * (1/(y φ / (2 μ))) * (y / (2 μ))\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nφ^4 * 2 * (2 μ)/(y φ) * (y / (2 μ)) ) = φ^4 * 2 * (1/φ) ) = 2 φ^3\n\nSo,\n\nf’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c] + 2 φ^3 = φ^3 [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2]\n\nSecond derivative f\'\'(φ):\n\nf\'\'(φ) = 3 φ^2 [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2] + φ^3 [8 / φ * (y / (2 μ)) * (2 μ)/y ) ]\n\nWait, differentiating the term inside the brackets:\n\nd/dφ [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2] = 8 * (1/φ)\n\nSo,\n\nf\'\'(φ) = 3 φ^2 [8 ln(...) -4c +2] + φ^3 * 8 / φ\n\n= 3 φ^2 [8 ln(...) -4c +2] + 8 φ^2\n\n= φ^2 [24 ln(...) -12 c +6 +8]\n\n= φ^2 [24 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) -12 c +14]\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of ΔV is:\n\nd²ΔV/dφ² = - (y^4)/(1024 π²) * [24 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) -12 c +14]\n\nEvaluated at φ = x, this gives:\n\nm² ≈ - (y^4)/(1024 π²) * [24 ln(y x / (2 μ)) -12 c +14 ] * x²\n\nBut this expression is quite complicated. However, in an approximation, the dominant term is the logarithmic term. If we assume that the logarithm is of order 1, then:\n\nm² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(128 π²)\n\nBut the coefficient might differ based on the exact calculation. However, typically, the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson from a fermion loop would be of the order:\n\nm_{H₂}² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16 π²)\n\nBut with a numerical factor. For example, in the case of the pion in QCD, the mass is related to the quark masses via m_π² ≈ B m_q, but here it\'s a loop effect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Majorana mass M = y x / 2, and the loop correction would be proportional to M² times a factor. The self-energy diagram for the scalar η (H₂) would have a loop with two Majorana fermions. The contribution to the mass squared would be:\n\nδm² ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) = (y^2 (y² x² /4))/(16 π²) = y^4 x²/(64 π²)\n\nSo, m_{H₂} ≈ (y² x)/(8 π)\n\nBut this is a rough estimate. The exact coefficient depends on the loop calculation. For a real scalar coupled to Majorana fermions with coupling y/2, the self-energy at zero momentum is:\n\nΣ ≈ (y^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 Tr[ (k̸ + M) (k̸ + M) ] / (k² - M² + iε)^2\n\nThe trace Tr[ (k̸ + M)(k̸ + M) ] = Tr[ k̸ k̸ + 2 M k̸ + M² ] = 4 k² + 4 M², since Tr(k̸ k̸) = 4 k² and Tr(M^2) = 4 M². The integral becomes:\n\nΣ ≈ (y^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 [4(k² + M²)] / (k² - M² + iε)^2\n\n= y^2 ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 [ (k² + M²) ] / (k² - M² + iε)^2\n\nThis integral can be evaluated in dimensional regularization. In 4 - 2ε dimensions, the integral becomes:\n\nΣ ≈ y^2 (i/(16 π²)) [ M² (1/ε + finite) ]\n\nBut the divergent part is absorbed by counterterms. The finite part would give:\n\nΣ ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) * (something)\n\nAssuming minimal subtraction, the renormalized mass would receive a contribution:\n\nδm² ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) * (1)\n\nBut M = y x / 2, so:\n\nδm² ≈ (y^2 (y² x² /4 )) / (16 π²) = y^4 x² / (64 π²)\n\nThus, m_{H₂} ≈ y² x / (8 π)\n\nBut this is a rough estimate. The precise coefficient might differ by a factor, but the order of magnitude is set by y² x divided by 8 π.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions H₂ as the pseudo-Goldstone boson, which could be a mixture of fields. If H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone from the φ and H mixing, then the mass might involve both the Higgs VEV v and the singlet VEV x. For example, if the potential has a term like λ φ H† H, then the mixing between φ and H would lead to two scalars: one heavy and one light. The light one could be the pseudo-Goldstone. However, the mass from such a tree-level term would be tree-level, not radiative.\n\nBut the question specifies radiative corrections. Therefore, the dominant contribution must come from loops. Given the Yukawa couplings in the theory, the loops involving the right-handed neutrinos N_R would contribute to the mass of H₂.\n\nAnother possibility is that the pseudo-Goldstone H₂ is part of the scalar doublet S. If S doesn\'t get a VEV, its components are physical scalars. The components of S are a charged scalar S⁺ and a neutral complex scalar S⁰. The neutral scalar can be written as S⁰ = (s + i a)/√2, where s and a are real scalars. If there\'s a global U(1) symmetry under which S → e^{iθ} S, then the field a would be the Goldstone boson. However, the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S breaks this symmetry explicitly, as S appears linearly. Therefore, a becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson, acquiring a mass from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings.\n\nIn this case, the mass of a (which could be H₂) would be generated by loops of N_R and leptons L_α. The coupling g_{iα} connects N_R, L_α, and S. If S has a component a that\'s a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass would come from a loop with N_R and L_α.\n\nThe self-energy diagram for a would involve a loop with N_R and L_α. The interaction term is -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. Expanding S around its VEV (which is zero), the interaction term is -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α (s + i a)/√2. The coupling to a is -i g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α a / √2.\n\nThe mass of a comes from a loop with N_R and L_α running in the loop. However, L_α are SU(2) doublets with their own masses from the Higgs VEV. But if we\'re considering the neutral component of L_α, which would be the neutrino, which is massless in the Standard Model but gets a mass via the seesaw mechanism here.\n\nBut in this model, the neutrino masses come from the terms g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S and y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If S doesn\'t get a VEV, the Dirac mass term comes from a different source. Wait, no—if S doesn\'t get a VEV, then the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S doesn\'t generate a Dirac mass. Instead, the Dirac mass would come from the Higgs H, but in the given Lagrangian, the only Yukawa coupling involving H is not shown. The given Lagrangian includes the term with S, not H. So perhaps the neutrinos get their masses via a radiative correction, with S and φ involved.\n\nAlternatively, if S does get a VEV, but the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. If S also gets a VEV, then the model has more scalars getting VEVs, but the problem doesn\'t mention that. So perhaps S is inert, not getting a VEV, and the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S is a Yukawa interaction that allows for neutrino masses via a loop.\n\nIn any case, if the pseudo-Goldstone H₂ is the component a from S⁰, then its mass would come from a loop involving g_{iα} couplings. The mass would be generated at one loop, with the loop containing N_R and L_α. However, L_α are Standard Model leptons, which are SU(2) doublets. The neutral component would be the neutrino, which is massless at tree level but gets a mass via the seesaw. However, in this model, the right-handed neutrinos N_R have Majorana masses from φ\'s VEV, and the Dirac masses could come from S\'s VEV or via loops.\n\nBut if S doesn\'t get a VEV, the Dirac mass term is absent at tree level, but can be generated at one loop via the interaction g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S and the scalar potential coupling S with H and φ. This is similar to the Zee model, where a loop generates neutrino masses.\n\nIn such a case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson a (from S) would also be generated via loops. The coupling g_{iα} would contribute to the a mass through a loop with N_R and L_α. The self-energy diagram would involve a loop with N_R and L_α propagators, with two insertions of the g_{iα} coupling and two insertions of the a field.\n\nHowever, calculating this would require knowing the masses of the internal particles. The N_R have Majorana masses M_i = y_i x / 2, and the charged leptons have masses m_α = y_α v / √2 (from the Higgs). The neutrino masses would be a combination of the seesaw and loop contributions.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. The problem asks for an approximation of the mass of H₂ through radiative corrections. Given the information, the two possible candidates for H₂ are the fluctuation of φ (η) or the pseudo-Goldstone from S (a). Given that the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, and the fields involved, it\'s more likely that H₂ is the component of S that becomes a pseudo-Goldstone due to the explicit breaking of a global symmetry by the g_{iα} couplings.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential V(φ, S, H) has a term that mixes S and H, such as μ S† H φ + h.c., this could lead to a pseudo-Goldstone when the symmetries are broken. But without the explicit form of V, it\'s hard to say.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the Yukawa terms, the dominant radiative correction to H₂\'s mass likely comes from the coupling y_i in the term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If H₂ is the fluctuation of φ, then its mass is generated by loops of N_R. The mass would be of order m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π), as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if H₂ is from the S doublet, the mass would be generated by loops involving g_{iα} and possibly y_i. For example, a two-loop diagram might contribute, but that\'s more suppressed. However, the problem states "radiative corrections," which usually means one-loop.\n\nGiven the information, I think the intended answer is that the mass of H₂ is generated at one loop via the Yukawa coupling y_i, leading to a mass of order m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π). However, to get the precise expression, let\'s recall the general formula for the Coleman-Weinberg potential.\n\nThe effective potential for a real scalar φ at one-loop is:\n\nV_eff(φ) = V_tree(φ) + (1/(64 π²)) [ M_B^4 (ln(M_B^2 / μ²) - c) - M_F^4 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) ]\n\nwhere M_B and M_F are the boson and fermion masses, respectively. In our case, the fermion mass is M_F = y φ / 2. Assuming the tree-level potential is such that V_tree(φ) = 0 (or has a minimum at φ = x due to other terms), the dominant contribution to the mass comes from the fermion loop.\n\nThe mass squared is the second derivative of V_eff at φ = x:\n\nm² = (d²V_eff/dφ²)|_{φ=x} ≈ (1/(64 π²)) * d²/dφ² [ - M_F^4 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) ]\n\n= (1/(64 π²)) * [ -12 y^2 M_F^2 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) - 4 y^2 M_F^2 ]\n\nSubstituting M_F = y x / 2:\n\nm² ≈ (1/(64 π²)) [ -12 y^2 (y^2 x² /4) (ln(...) - c) - 4 y^2 (y^2 x² /4) ]\n\nAssuming the logarithmic term is of order 1, the dominant term is:\n\nm² ≈ (1/(64 π²)) [ -3 y^4 x² (ln(...) - c) - y^4 x² ]\n\nThe coefficient is negative, but the mass squared should be positive. This might indicate a mistake in the sign. The fermion contribution to the effective potential has a negative sign, so the potential is lowered by fermion loops. However, the curvature (second derivative) would depend on the specifics. Alternatively, taking the absolute value, the mass squared is approximately:\n\nm² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16 π²)\n\nThus, the mass is m_{H₂} ≈ (y² x)/(4 π)\n\nBut this is a factor of 2 difference from the previous estimate. The exact coefficient might require a precise calculation, but given the options, the standard result for a pseudo-Goldstone mass from fermion loops is often quoted as m ≈ (g^2 f)/(16 π²), where f is the decay constant (VEV). In this case, f = x, and g = y, so m ≈ (y^2 x)/(16 π²). However, this seems too small. Alternatively, if the cutoff is at the scale x, then m ≈ (y^2 x)/(16 π²) * Λ, but without knowing Λ, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the mass is generated at one loop, the natural estimate is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) * something. But I need to reconcile the different factors.\n\nWait, let\'s recall the pion mass in QCD. The pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson, and its mass is given by m_π² ≈ B m_q, where B is a constant and m_q is the quark mass. Here, the explicit breaking comes from the Yukawa coupling y_i, which is analogous to the quark mass. The scale f is the decay constant, analogous to x. So, perhaps m_{H₂}² ≈ y_i x * (something). But in the case of the pion, it\'s a tree-level effect from the quark mass. Here, the breaking is radiative, so the mass squared would be a loop factor times y_i^2 x².\n\nThe loop factor is typically (y_i^2)/(16 π²), so m_{H₂}² ≈ (y_i^2)/(16 π²) x², leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i x)/(4 π). This seems plausible.\n\nGiven the confusion in the problem statement about ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which might imply that x and v are related, but since the question is about the approximation, the answer is likely m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i x)/(4 π) or similar. However, different sources might have different coefficients. For example, in some models, the pseudo-Goldstone mass is m ≈ (y^2 v)/(16 π²), but here v is replaced by x.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential has a quartic coupling λ at tree level, the mass would be m ≈ sqrt(λ) x, but if λ is generated radiatively, then λ ≈ y^4/(16 π²), leading to m ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).\n\nGiven that, the most reasonable approximation is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) * something. But without the exact potential, it\'s hard to be precise. However, considering the problem asks for an approximation through radiative corrections, the answer is likely:\n\nm_{H₂} ≈ \\frac{y_i^2 x}{16 \\pi^2}\n\nBut this seems small. Alternatively, if it\'s a one-loop factor without the 16 π², but given that radiative corrections are typically suppressed by 16 π², the mass squared would be y^4 x²/(16 π²), so the mass is y² x/(4 π).\n\nGiven the options, I think the answer is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²), but I need to check standard results.\n\nWait, in the case of the Inflaton mass from Coleman-Weinberg, the mass is m ≈ (λ^{1/2} v), where λ is the quartic coupling. If λ is generated radiatively as λ ≈ (y^4)/(16 π²), then m ≈ y^2 v/(4 π). Similarly, here, if the quartic coupling for φ is generated via loops of N_R, then the mass would be m_{H₂} ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates a quartic coupling, leading to a mass. If the effective quartic coupling is λ ≈ (y^4 \\ln(...))/(16 π²), then the mass is m ≈ sqrt(λ) x ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).\n\nGiven that, the answer is likely m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) multiplied by a logarithmic factor, but since the problem asks for an approximation, the logarithmic factor can be considered O(1), so m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x / (16 π²). However, this seems dimensionally inconsistent. Wait, y_i is dimensionless, x is a mass scale, so y_i^2 x has dimensions of mass. Wait, no: y_i is dimensionless, x is a mass, so y_i^2 x is mass. But 16 π² is dimensionless. So m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²). But this would be a very small mass if x is large. Alternatively, if the mass is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4 π), which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Majorana fermion loop: each loop contributes a factor of y_i^2/(16 π²) times M_i^2, where M_i = y_i x / 2. So the mass squared is δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(64 π²), so m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π).\n\nGiven the different possibilities, but considering that the user asks for an approximation, the most likely answer is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²), but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, in the original question, the potential V(φ, S, H) is not specified, so maybe the mass comes from the Coleman-Weinberg potential generated by the scalar interactions. If the scalar potential includes a term like λ_S |S|^4, then the quartic coupling λ_S would receive radiative corrections from the g_{iα} couplings. The mass of the components of S would then be m_S ≈ sqrt(λ_S) w, where w is the VEV of S. But the problem states that S doesn\'t have a VEV, so this is not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, if the mass of H₂ comes from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings. For example, a diagram where H₂ (from S) couples to a loop of N_R and L_α. The mass would be generated at one loop, with the coupling g and the masses of N_R and L_α in the loop.\n\nThe self-energy for H₂ would be proportional to g^2 Λ^2/(16 π²), where Λ is the cutoff, but in a renormalizable theory, the loop integral would depend on the masses. If N_R has a mass M_i = y_i x / 2 and the lepton L_α has a mass m_α, then the mass squared of H₂ would be something like g^2 (M_i^2 - m_α^2)/(16 π²) log(M_i^2 / m_α^2). If m_α is negligible (as for neutrinos), then m_{H₂}^2 ≈ g^2 M_i^2/(16 π²) = g^2 y_i^2 x²/(64 π²), so m_{H₂} ≈ (g y_i x)/(8 π).\n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify the coupling g_{iα}, so this might not be the intended path.\n\nGiven the information in the problem, the only couplings provided are y_i and g_{iα}. The question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Since the term with y_i explicitly breaks the shift symmetry of φ (if any), leading to a mass for η (H₂), and the term with g_{iα} could also contribute if H₂ is from S.\n\nBut without more details, the most straightforward answer is that the mass is generated by the y_i Yukawa coupling through a loop of N_R, leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²). However, considering the earlier calculation where the mass squared is y_i^4 x²/(64 π²), the mass would be y_i^2 x/(8 π).\n\nGiven that radiative corrections often have 1/(16 π²) factors, but in the case of a scalar mass squared, the correction is (y^4 x²)/(16 π²) times a log, leading to m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x/(4 π sqrt(ln(...))). But since the problem asks for an approximation, the log can be considered order 1, so m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x/(4 π).\n\nHowever, different sources might use different conventions. For example, in the context of the Majoron (a pseudo-Goldstone boson from lepton number breaking), the mass can be generated by loops and is typically m ≈ (y^2 v)/(16 π²), where v is the lepton number breaking scale. If we replace v with x here, then m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²).\n\nBut I need to make a decision. Given that the mass squared from the fermion loop is δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(64 π²), then m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π). This seems plausible. Alternatively, if the loop factor is 1/(16 π²), then δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(16 π²), leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4 π).\n\nGiven that the user asks for an approximation and considering standard results, I think the answer is:\n\nThe mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is approximately m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²).\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure.

The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) arises from radiative corrections due to the explicit breaking of a global symmetry by the Yukawa coupling \( y_i \phi \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c \). At one-loop level, the dominant contribution comes from diagrams involving the right-handed neutrinos \( N_{iR} \), which acquire Majorana masses \( M_i = \frac{y_i x}{2} \) after \( \phi \) obtains a vacuum expectation value (VEV) \( x \). The mass squared of \( H_2 \) is proportional to \( y_i^4 x^2 \) suppressed by a loop factor \( 1/(16\pi^2) \). Thus, the approximate mass is:

\[
m_{H_2} \approx \frac{y_i^2 x}{8\pi}
\]

**Answer:**  
The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson \( H_2 \) through radiative corrections is approximately \(\boxed{\dfrac{y_i^2 x}{8\pi}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Alternatively, if S does get a VEV, then ⟨S⟩ would contribute to the Dirac mass. But the problem states ⟨φ⟩ and ⟨h⟩, so perhaps S doesn't get a VEV. Alternatively, maybe S is the Higgs, but the problem states H is the Higgs. So S is a new scalar doublet.

Assuming S doesn't get a VEV, then the scalar potential V(φ, S, H) would include terms like μ² |H|² + λ |H|⁴, terms for φ, and cross terms between φ, S, and H. The pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ would come from the breaking of some approximate symmetry. For example, if the potential has an approximate symmetry that's broken by some terms, the Goldstone boson gets a small mass from loop corrections.

Alternatively, if the potential has a flat direction at tree level, quantum corrections (radiative corrections) can generate a mass for the would-be Goldstone boson. This is similar to the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, where the effective potential at one-loop lifts the flat direction, giving a mass to the scalar.

But the problem states that the mass of H₂ is generated through radiative corrections. So, perhaps at tree level, H₂ is massless (a Goldstone boson), but loop effects generate a mass. The question is to compute this mass.

To proceed, I need to identify the Goldstone boson in the scalar sector. The scalar fields are:

- The Higgs doublet H, which after symmetry breaking, has a neutral component that gives the Higgs boson and three Goldstone bosons eaten by the W and Z.

- The scalar doublet S, which, if it doesn't get a VEV, has four real scalar fields. If it's a doublet with hypercharge 1, its components are S⁺, S⁰, where S⁰ is a complex field. So, S has four degrees of freedom.

- The singlet scalar φ, which is a real scalar (since it's a singlet, and assuming it's real; but if it's complex, then two degrees of freedom. The problem says "singlet scalar", so likely real. But the term (∂μ φ)^2 is written as (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is standard for a real scalar. So φ is a real scalar, with one degree of freedom. Its VEV is x, so after symmetry breaking, φ = x + η, where η is the fluctuation. The mass term for η would be from the potential.

But the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. If the potential has a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, leading to a Goldstone, which then gets a mass from loops. For example, if there's a U(1) symmetry under which φ shifts, then η would be the Goldstone. But if the symmetry is explicitly broken, η becomes a pseudo-Goldstone. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only approximate, then the mass is generated at loop level.

Alternatively, the mixing between φ and H through the potential could lead to a pseudo-Goldstone. Let me think.

Suppose the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix φ and H. For example, a term like λ (H† H - v²)² + μ φ² (H† H) + ... If there's a term that mixes φ and H, then when H and φ get VEVs, their fluctuations mix. However, the Goldstone bosons from the Higgs are eaten by the W and Z. The singlet φ's fluctuation η is a real scalar, so it can't be a Goldstone unless there's a shift symmetry. If the potential for φ is such that it's flat (no mass term), then η is a Goldstone. But if the potential has a term that breaks the shift symmetry, η gets a mass. If the breaking is small, η is a pseudo-Goldstone.

Alternatively, if the potential has a term like (φ² + H† H - Λ²)^2, then the VEVs satisfy φ² + H† H = Λ². The fluctuations orthogonal to the VEV direction would be a pseudo-Goldstone. For example, if we write φ = x + η and H = v + h, then the combination x η + v h is the massive mode, and the orthogonal combination (v η - x h) is the Goldstone. But if the potential is exactly (φ² + H† H - Λ²)^2, then the Goldstone would be massless. However, if there are other terms in the potential that break the symmetry, the Goldstone gets a mass. Alternatively, if the symmetry is only approximate, then the Goldstone becomes a pseudo-Goldstone with mass generated by the explicit breaking terms.

But the problem states that the mass is generated through radiative corrections. So perhaps at tree level, the potential has an accidental symmetry that makes H₂ massless, and loops break this symmetry, generating a mass. For example, in the Coleman-Weinberg potential, the symmetry breaking is generated radiatively. But here, maybe the tree-level potential has a flat direction, and loop corrections lift it.

Alternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone could be part of the S doublet. If S doesn't get a VEV, its components are physical scalars. If there's a global symmetry acting on S, then the components could be Goldstone bosons. But since S is a doublet under SU(2), which is a gauge symmetry, the Goldstone bosons would be eaten by the W and Z. However, if S is a complex doublet with hypercharge 1, similar to the Higgs, but with a different VEV. Wait, but the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. If S doesn't get a VEV, then its components are just scalars. But if S does get a VEV, then the Goldstone bosons would be eaten. But the problem doesn't mention S getting a VEV, so perhaps S is inert. Then, the components of S are inert scalars, and the pseudo-Gstone boson H₂ is among them. But then, why would they be pseudo-Goldstone? Unless there's an approximate symmetry.

Alternatively, the pseudo-Goldstone comes from the φ and H mixing. Let's consider that. Suppose the potential V(φ, S, H) includes terms that mix φ and H. For example, a term like λ φ² H† H. Then, when φ and H get VEVs, their fluctuations mix. The mass matrix would have off-diagonal terms. The physical scalars would be mixtures of η (from φ) and h (from H). The mass eigenstates would be combinations of these. If there's an approximate symmetry, like a U(1) under which φ and H rotate into each other, then the pseudo-Goldstone would be the combination that's light. But how does this relate to radiative corrections?

Alternatively, the potential has a term that breaks the symmetry explicitly at loop level. For example, if the tree-level potential respects a symmetry that's broken by quantum corrections, then the Goldstone boson gets a mass from loops.

Alternatively, the Yukawa couplings in the Lagrangian break the symmetry. For example, the Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks a possible shift symmetry of φ, since φ appears linearly. If φ had a shift symmetry φ → φ + c, then the Yukawa term would break it, generating a mass for the pseudo-Goldstone boson through loops involving the N_R fields.

Let me explore this possibility. Suppose φ is a Goldstone boson of a global U(1) symmetry at tree level. The Yukawa coupling y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c explicitly breaks this symmetry because φ is not invariant under the U(1) (it shifts), and the N_R are charged under the U(1). If the U(1) is explicitly broken by this Yukawa term, then the Goldstone boson (η, the fluctuation of φ) becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson, acquiring a mass from loops. The mass would be generated at loop level via diagrams involving the N_R loops.

Similarly, the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S could also contribute if S is charged under the U(1), but if S is neutral, then this term might preserve the symmetry. But if φ is the only field charged under the U(1), then the Yukawa term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c breaks the symmetry, leading to a mass for η.

In this case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson (η, which is H₂?) would be generated at one loop. The calculation would involve a loop of N_R particles with the Yukawa coupling y_i. The mass squared would be proportional to y_i² Λ² / (16π²), where Λ is some scale, but since the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa term, the mass might be related to the VEV x and the coupling y_i.

Alternatively, the Coleman-Weinberg potential could generate a mass for φ. If the tree-level potential for φ is zero (or flat), then the one-loop correction would generate an effective potential, leading to a mass. The Coleman-Weinberg potential is given by:

V_eff ≈ (λ_eff/4) φ^4 + ... 

But if the tree-level potential is zero, the one-loop potential would be something like (y^4 φ^4)/(64 π²) log(φ^2 / μ^2), leading to a mass when the minimum is chosen. However, in this case, the mass would be of order y^2 x / (16 π²), where x is the VEV.

But the problem states that the mass is generated through radiative corrections. So perhaps the tree-level mass is zero (Goldstone), and the loop corrections give a small mass. The dominant contribution would come from the Yukawa couplings to N_R, since they are the ones that explicitly break the symmetry.

The general formula for the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson from radiative corrections (due to explicit symmetry breaking) is m² ≈ (g^2 Λ^2)/(16 π²), where g is the coupling that breaks the symmetry and Λ is the cutoff scale. But in this case, the symmetry breaking is due to the Yukawa coupling y_i, and the cutoff could be related to the VEV x.

Alternatively, the mass can be estimated by computing the loop diagram where the pseudo-Goldstone (η) couples to the N_R via the Yukawa term, leading to a loop correction to the η mass. The Yukawa term is (y_i / 2) φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. Expanding φ around its VEV: φ = x + η. The interaction term becomes (y_i / 2) x N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c + (y_i / 2) η N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. The first term is the Majorana mass for N_R: M_i = y_i x / 2. The second term is the coupling between η and N_R.

The one-loop correction to the η mass comes from a loop of N_R particles. Since η is a real scalar, the diagram is a loop of two N_R propagators with two insertions of the Yukawa coupling. The amplitude is proportional to y_i² times the loop integral. The mass squared correction would be:

δm² ≈ (y_i² / (16 π²)) M_i²

But M_i = y_i x / 2, so substituting:

δm² ≈ (y_i² / (16 π²)) (y_i² x² / 4) ) = (y_i^4 x²) / (64 π²)

But this seems too small. Alternatively, if the loop is a fermion loop with two vertices, each proportional to y_i, and the loop momentum integral would give a term proportional to M_i². The general formula for a scalar mass correction from a fermion loop is:

δm² ≈ (N_f y^2)/(16 π²) Λ^2

where Λ is the cutoff. But in a renormalizable theory, the loop integral would be logarithmic, but if we use dimensional regularization, the mass correction would be proportional to y^2 M_i^2. Wait, let's recall the formula for the self-energy.

The self-energy diagram for η would be a loop with two Yukawa couplings (each y_i/2) and a fermion loop. The amplitude is:

iΣ ≈ (y_i^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k / (2π)^4 Tr[ (i(k̸ + M_i)) / (k² - M_i² + iε) ) * (i(k̸ + M_i)) / (k² - M_i² + iε) ) ]

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the self-energy at zero momentum transfer for a scalar coupling to fermions with coupling g is given by:

Σ ≈ (g^2 / (16 π²)) [ Λ^2 - 2 M_i^2 log(Λ^2 / M_i^2) + ... ]

But if we use a cutoff Λ, the quadratic divergence is Λ^2. However, in the case where the theory is renormalizable, the quadratic divergence is absorbed into the counterterms. But if the tree-level mass is zero (as for a Goldstone), the radiative correction would give a mass term. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs mass receives quadratic corrections, but here, if η is a Goldstone boson at tree level, its mass is protected by the shift symmetry. The explicit breaking of the shift symmetry by the Yukawa coupling would generate a mass at loop level.

But in the case of a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the mass is typically proportional to the symmetry-breaking parameter. Here, the symmetry is broken by the Yukawa coupling y_i. The mass should be proportional to y_i times some scale. However, the actual calculation would involve loops.

Alternatively, the mass can be estimated using the Coleman-Weinberg potential. If the tree-level potential for φ is flat (no mass term), then the one-loop correction would generate an effective potential. The Coleman-Weinberg potential for a real scalar coupled to fermions is:

V_eff = V_tree + (1/(64 π²)) [ M^4 (ln(M^2 / μ^2) - c) ]

where M is the mass of the fermion, which depends on φ: M(φ) = y φ / 2. Then,

V_eff ≈ (y^4 φ^4)/(256 π²) (ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c)

The minimum of the potential would be at some φ = x, and the curvature at that point gives the mass. Taking the second derivative:

m² = d²V_eff/dφ² |_{φ=x}

Assuming that the minimum is determined by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, but in our case, the VEV x is given, so perhaps we can compute the mass as the second derivative of the one-loop potential.

Let’s compute this. Let’s denote M(φ) = (y φ)/2. The one-loop contribution from the fermion loop is:

ΔV = - (N_f / (64 π²)) M(φ)^4 [ ln(M(φ)^2 / μ^2) - c ]

But for a real scalar field interacting with Majorana fermions, the number of degrees of freedom is different. For a Majorana fermion, the loop contribution is 1/2 that of a Dirac fermion. Since each N_iR is a Majorana fermion (because of the Majorana mass term), the contribution per fermion would be (1/2) times the Dirac case. Assuming N_f species of N_R, each with coupling y_i, the total contribution would be:

ΔV = - (1/(64 π²)) Σ_i [ (y_i^4 φ^4 / 16) (ln(y_i^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c) ]

But this is getting complicated. Let's simplify by considering one generation, N=1, and y_i = y. Then,

ΔV ≈ - (1/(64 π²)) * (y^4 φ^4 / 16) [ ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c ]

The first derivative dV/dφ would set the minimum. However, if the tree-level potential has a term that fixes the VEV x, then the one-loop correction would contribute to the mass. Suppose the tree-level potential is V_tree = λ (φ² - x²)^2. Then, the VEV is x, and the mass at tree level is m_tree² = 8 λ x². But if λ is zero (flat direction), then the entire potential comes from the loop, and the VEV is determined by the log terms. However, the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x, so perhaps the tree-level potential is responsible for the VEV, and the loop gives a small correction to the mass.

Alternatively, if the tree-level potential for φ is zero, and the VEV is generated radiatively via Coleman-Weinberg. But the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x, so maybe we can take x as given and compute the curvature at φ = x from the loop.

Assuming that the tree-level potential is such that φ has a VEV x, but the mass at tree level is zero (Goldstone), then the one-loop correction would generate the mass. The second derivative of ΔV at φ = x would be:

d²ΔV/dφ² = (d²/dφ²) [ - (y^4 φ^4)/(1024 π²) (ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c) ]

This derivative would involve terms proportional to y^4 x² / (16 π²). Let's compute it step by step.

Let’s define f(φ) = φ^4 [ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) - c]

First derivative f’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [ln(...) - c] + φ^4 * (2 / φ) * (1 / (y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2))) * (y^2 φ / (2 μ^2)) )

Wait, maybe it's better to use logarithmic differentiation. Let’s set t = y φ / (2 μ), so φ = 2 μ t / y. Then, ln(y^2 φ^2 / (4 μ^2)) = ln(t²) = 2 ln t. So,

f(φ) = φ^4 [2 ln t - c] = φ^4 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c]

But this might not help. Let's compute f’(φ):

f’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c] + φ^4 * 2 * (1/(y φ / (2 μ))) * (y / (2 μ))

Simplify the second term:

φ^4 * 2 * (2 μ)/(y φ) * (y / (2 μ)) ) = φ^4 * 2 * (1/φ) ) = 2 φ^3

So,

f’(φ) = 4 φ^3 [2 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - c] + 2 φ^3 = φ^3 [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2]

Second derivative f''(φ):

f''(φ) = 3 φ^2 [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2] + φ^3 [8 / φ * (y / (2 μ)) * (2 μ)/y ) ]

Wait, differentiating the term inside the brackets:

d/dφ [8 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) - 4 c + 2] = 8 * (1/φ)

So,

f''(φ) = 3 φ^2 [8 ln(...) -4c +2] + φ^3 * 8 / φ

= 3 φ^2 [8 ln(...) -4c +2] + 8 φ^2

= φ^2 [24 ln(...) -12 c +6 +8]

= φ^2 [24 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) -12 c +14]

Therefore, the second derivative of ΔV is:

d²ΔV/dφ² = - (y^4)/(1024 π²) * [24 ln(y φ / (2 μ)) -12 c +14]

Evaluated at φ = x, this gives:

m² ≈ - (y^4)/(1024 π²) * [24 ln(y x / (2 μ)) -12 c +14 ] * x²

But this expression is quite complicated. However, in an approximation, the dominant term is the logarithmic term. If we assume that the logarithm is of order 1, then:

m² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(128 π²)

But the coefficient might differ based on the exact calculation. However, typically, the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson from a fermion loop would be of the order:

m_{H₂}² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16 π²)

But with a numerical factor. For example, in the case of the pion in QCD, the mass is related to the quark masses via m_π² ≈ B m_q, but here it's a loop effect.

Alternatively, considering that the Majorana mass M = y x / 2, and the loop correction would be proportional to M² times a factor. The self-energy diagram for the scalar η (H₂) would have a loop with two Majorana fermions. The contribution to the mass squared would be:

δm² ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) = (y^2 (y² x² /4))/(16 π²) = y^4 x²/(64 π²)

So, m_{H₂} ≈ (y² x)/(8 π)

But this is a rough estimate. The exact coefficient depends on the loop calculation. For a real scalar coupled to Majorana fermions with coupling y/2, the self-energy at zero momentum is:

Σ ≈ (y^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 Tr[ (k̸ + M) (k̸ + M) ] / (k² - M² + iε)^2

The trace Tr[ (k̸ + M)(k̸ + M) ] = Tr[ k̸ k̸ + 2 M k̸ + M² ] = 4 k² + 4 M², since Tr(k̸ k̸) = 4 k² and Tr(M^2) = 4 M². The integral becomes:

Σ ≈ (y^2 / 4) ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 [4(k² + M²)] / (k² - M² + iε)^2

= y^2 ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4 [ (k² + M²) ] / (k² - M² + iε)^2

This integral can be evaluated in dimensional regularization. In 4 - 2ε dimensions, the integral becomes:

Σ ≈ y^2 (i/(16 π²)) [ M² (1/ε + finite) ]

But the divergent part is absorbed by counterterms. The finite part would give:

Σ ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) * (something)

Assuming minimal subtraction, the renormalized mass would receive a contribution:

δm² ≈ (y^2 M²)/(16 π²) * (1)

But M = y x / 2, so:

δm² ≈ (y^2 (y² x² /4 )) / (16 π²) = y^4 x² / (64 π²)

Thus, m_{H₂} ≈ y² x / (8 π)

But this is a rough estimate. The precise coefficient might differ by a factor, but the order of magnitude is set by y² x divided by 8 π.

However, the problem mentions H₂ as the pseudo-Goldstone boson, which could be a mixture of fields. If H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone from the φ and H mixing, then the mass might involve both the Higgs VEV v and the singlet VEV x. For example, if the potential has a term like λ φ H† H, then the mixing between φ and H would lead to two scalars: one heavy and one light. The light one could be the pseudo-Goldstone. However, the mass from such a tree-level term would be tree-level, not radiative.

But the question specifies radiative corrections. Therefore, the dominant contribution must come from loops. Given the Yukawa couplings in the theory, the loops involving the right-handed neutrinos N_R would contribute to the mass of H₂.

Another possibility is that the pseudo-Goldstone H₂ is part of the scalar doublet S. If S doesn't get a VEV, its components are physical scalars. The components of S are a charged scalar S⁺ and a neutral complex scalar S⁰. The neutral scalar can be written as S⁰ = (s + i a)/√2, where s and a are real scalars. If there's a global U(1) symmetry under which S → e^{iθ} S, then the field a would be the Goldstone boson. However, the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S breaks this symmetry explicitly, as S appears linearly. Therefore, a becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson, acquiring a mass from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings.

In this case, the mass of a (which could be H₂) would be generated by loops of N_R and leptons L_α. The coupling g_{iα} connects N_R, L_α, and S. If S has a component a that's a pseudo-Goldstone, its mass would come from a loop with N_R and L_α.

The self-energy diagram for a would involve a loop with N_R and L_α. The interaction term is -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S. Expanding S around its VEV (which is zero), the interaction term is -g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α (s + i a)/√2. The coupling to a is -i g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α a / √2.

The mass of a comes from a loop with N_R and L_α running in the loop. However, L_α are SU(2) doublets with their own masses from the Higgs VEV. But if we're considering the neutral component of L_α, which would be the neutrino, which is massless in the Standard Model but gets a mass via the seesaw mechanism here.

But in this model, the neutrino masses come from the terms g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S and y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If S doesn't get a VEV, the Dirac mass term comes from a different source. Wait, no—if S doesn't get a VEV, then the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S doesn't generate a Dirac mass. Instead, the Dirac mass would come from the Higgs H, but in the given Lagrangian, the only Yukawa coupling involving H is not shown. The given Lagrangian includes the term with S, not H. So perhaps the neutrinos get their masses via a radiative correction, with S and φ involved.

Alternatively, if S does get a VEV, but the problem states that ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. If S also gets a VEV, then the model has more scalars getting VEVs, but the problem doesn't mention that. So perhaps S is inert, not getting a VEV, and the term g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S is a Yukawa interaction that allows for neutrino masses via a loop.

In any case, if the pseudo-Goldstone H₂ is the component a from S⁰, then its mass would come from a loop involving g_{iα} couplings. The mass would be generated at one loop, with the loop containing N_R and L_α. However, L_α are Standard Model leptons, which are SU(2) doublets. The neutral component would be the neutrino, which is massless at tree level but gets a mass via the seesaw. However, in this model, the right-handed neutrinos N_R have Majorana masses from φ's VEV, and the Dirac masses could come from S's VEV or via loops.

But if S doesn't get a VEV, the Dirac mass term is absent at tree level, but can be generated at one loop via the interaction g_{iα} N̄_{iR} L_α S and the scalar potential coupling S with H and φ. This is similar to the Zee model, where a loop generates neutrino masses.

In such a case, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson a (from S) would also be generated via loops. The coupling g_{iα} would contribute to the a mass through a loop with N_R and L_α. The self-energy diagram would involve a loop with N_R and L_α propagators, with two insertions of the g_{iα} coupling and two insertions of the a field.

However, calculating this would require knowing the masses of the internal particles. The N_R have Majorana masses M_i = y_i x / 2, and the charged leptons have masses m_α = y_α v / √2 (from the Higgs). The neutrino masses would be a combination of the seesaw and loop contributions.

But this is getting too involved. The problem asks for an approximation of the mass of H₂ through radiative corrections. Given the information, the two possible candidates for H₂ are the fluctuation of φ (η) or the pseudo-Goldstone from S (a). Given that the problem mentions H₂ as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, and the fields involved, it's more likely that H₂ is the component of S that becomes a pseudo-Goldstone due to the explicit breaking of a global symmetry by the g_{iα} couplings.

Alternatively, if the potential V(φ, S, H) has a term that mixes S and H, such as μ S† H φ + h.c., this could lead to a pseudo-Goldstone when the symmetries are broken. But without the explicit form of V, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, but considering the Yukawa terms, the dominant radiative correction to H₂'s mass likely comes from the coupling y_i in the term y_i φ N_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. If H₂ is the fluctuation of φ, then its mass is generated by loops of N_R. The mass would be of order m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π), as computed earlier.

Alternatively, if H₂ is from the S doublet, the mass would be generated by loops involving g_{iα} and possibly y_i. For example, a two-loop diagram might contribute, but that's more suppressed. However, the problem states "radiative corrections," which usually means one-loop.

Given the information, I think the intended answer is that the mass of H₂ is generated at one loop via the Yukawa coupling y_i, leading to a mass of order m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π). However, to get the precise expression, let's recall the general formula for the Coleman-Weinberg potential.

The effective potential for a real scalar φ at one-loop is:

V_eff(φ) = V_tree(φ) + (1/(64 π²)) [ M_B^4 (ln(M_B^2 / μ²) - c) - M_F^4 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) ]

where M_B and M_F are the boson and fermion masses, respectively. In our case, the fermion mass is M_F = y φ / 2. Assuming the tree-level potential is such that V_tree(φ) = 0 (or has a minimum at φ = x due to other terms), the dominant contribution to the mass comes from the fermion loop.

The mass squared is the second derivative of V_eff at φ = x:

m² = (d²V_eff/dφ²)|_{φ=x} ≈ (1/(64 π²)) * d²/dφ² [ - M_F^4 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) ]

= (1/(64 π²)) * [ -12 y^2 M_F^2 (ln(M_F^2 / μ²) - c) - 4 y^2 M_F^2 ]

Substituting M_F = y x / 2:

m² ≈ (1/(64 π²)) [ -12 y^2 (y^2 x² /4) (ln(...) - c) - 4 y^2 (y^2 x² /4) ]

Assuming the logarithmic term is of order 1, the dominant term is:

m² ≈ (1/(64 π²)) [ -3 y^4 x² (ln(...) - c) - y^4 x² ]

The coefficient is negative, but the mass squared should be positive. This might indicate a mistake in the sign. The fermion contribution to the effective potential has a negative sign, so the potential is lowered by fermion loops. However, the curvature (second derivative) would depend on the specifics. Alternatively, taking the absolute value, the mass squared is approximately:

m² ≈ (y^4 x²)/(16 π²)

Thus, the mass is m_{H₂} ≈ (y² x)/(4 π)

But this is a factor of 2 difference from the previous estimate. The exact coefficient might require a precise calculation, but given the options, the standard result for a pseudo-Goldstone mass from fermion loops is often quoted as m ≈ (g^2 f)/(16 π²), where f is the decay constant (VEV). In this case, f = x, and g = y, so m ≈ (y^2 x)/(16 π²). However, this seems too small. Alternatively, if the cutoff is at the scale x, then m ≈ (y^2 x)/(16 π²) * Λ, but without knowing Λ, this is unclear.

Alternatively, considering that the mass is generated at one loop, the natural estimate is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) * something. But I need to reconcile the different factors.

Wait, let's recall the pion mass in QCD. The pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson, and its mass is given by m_π² ≈ B m_q, where B is a constant and m_q is the quark mass. Here, the explicit breaking comes from the Yukawa coupling y_i, which is analogous to the quark mass. The scale f is the decay constant, analogous to x. So, perhaps m_{H₂}² ≈ y_i x * (something). But in the case of the pion, it's a tree-level effect from the quark mass. Here, the breaking is radiative, so the mass squared would be a loop factor times y_i^2 x².

The loop factor is typically (y_i^2)/(16 π²), so m_{H₂}² ≈ (y_i^2)/(16 π²) x², leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i x)/(4 π). This seems plausible.

Given the confusion in the problem statement about ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², which might imply that x and v are related, but since the question is about the approximation, the answer is likely m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i x)/(4 π) or similar. However, different sources might have different coefficients. For example, in some models, the pseudo-Goldstone mass is m ≈ (y^2 v)/(16 π²), but here v is replaced by x.

Alternatively, if the potential has a quartic coupling λ at tree level, the mass would be m ≈ sqrt(λ) x, but if λ is generated radiatively, then λ ≈ y^4/(16 π²), leading to m ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).

Given that, the most reasonable approximation is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) * something. But without the exact potential, it's hard to be precise. However, considering the problem asks for an approximation through radiative corrections, the answer is likely:

m_{H₂} ≈ \frac{y_i^2 x}{16 \pi^2}

But this seems small. Alternatively, if it's a one-loop factor without the 16 π², but given that radiative corrections are typically suppressed by 16 π², the mass squared would be y^4 x²/(16 π²), so the mass is y² x/(4 π).

Given the options, I think the answer is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²), but I need to check standard results.

Wait, in the case of the Inflaton mass from Coleman-Weinberg, the mass is m ≈ (λ^{1/2} v), where λ is the quartic coupling. If λ is generated radiatively as λ ≈ (y^4)/(16 π²), then m ≈ y^2 v/(4 π). Similarly, here, if the quartic coupling for φ is generated via loops of N_R, then the mass would be m_{H₂} ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).

Alternatively, another approach: The Coleman-Weinberg potential generates a quartic coupling, leading to a mass. If the effective quartic coupling is λ ≈ (y^4 \ln(...))/(16 π²), then the mass is m ≈ sqrt(λ) x ≈ y^2 x/(4 π).

Given that, the answer is likely m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²) multiplied by a logarithmic factor, but since the problem asks for an approximation, the logarithmic factor can be considered O(1), so m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x / (16 π²). However, this seems dimensionally inconsistent. Wait, y_i is dimensionless, x is a mass scale, so y_i^2 x has dimensions of mass. Wait, no: y_i is dimensionless, x is a mass, so y_i^2 x is mass. But 16 π² is dimensionless. So m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²). But this would be a very small mass if x is large. Alternatively, if the mass is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4 π), which is larger.

Alternatively, considering the Majorana fermion loop: each loop contributes a factor of y_i^2/(16 π²) times M_i^2, where M_i = y_i x / 2. So the mass squared is δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(64 π²), so m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π).

Given the different possibilities, but considering that the user asks for an approximation, the most likely answer is m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²), but I need to verify.

Alternatively, in the original question, the potential V(φ, S, H) is not specified, so maybe the mass comes from the Coleman-Weinberg potential generated by the scalar interactions. If the scalar potential includes a term like λ_S |S|^4, then the quartic coupling λ_S would receive radiative corrections from the g_{iα} couplings. The mass of the components of S would then be m_S ≈ sqrt(λ_S) w, where w is the VEV of S. But the problem states that S doesn't have a VEV, so this is not applicable.

Alternatively, if the mass of H₂ comes from loops involving the g_{iα} couplings. For example, a diagram where H₂ (from S) couples to a loop of N_R and L_α. The mass would be generated at one loop, with the coupling g and the masses of N_R and L_α in the loop.

The self-energy for H₂ would be proportional to g^2 Λ^2/(16 π²), where Λ is the cutoff, but in a renormalizable theory, the loop integral would depend on the masses. If N_R has a mass M_i = y_i x / 2 and the lepton L_α has a mass m_α, then the mass squared of H₂ would be something like g^2 (M_i^2 - m_α^2)/(16 π²) log(M_i^2 / m_α^2). If m_α is negligible (as for neutrinos), then m_{H₂}^2 ≈ g^2 M_i^2/(16 π²) = g^2 y_i^2 x²/(64 π²), so m_{H₂} ≈ (g y_i x)/(8 π).

But the problem doesn't specify the coupling g_{iα}, so this might not be the intended path.

Given the information in the problem, the only couplings provided are y_i and g_{iα}. The question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Since the term with y_i explicitly breaks the shift symmetry of φ (if any), leading to a mass for η (H₂), and the term with g_{iα} could also contribute if H₂ is from S.

But without more details, the most straightforward answer is that the mass is generated by the y_i Yukawa coupling through a loop of N_R, leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²). However, considering the earlier calculation where the mass squared is y_i^4 x²/(64 π²), the mass would be y_i^2 x/(8 π).

Given that radiative corrections often have 1/(16 π²) factors, but in the case of a scalar mass squared, the correction is (y^4 x²)/(16 π²) times a log, leading to m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x/(4 π sqrt(ln(...))). But since the problem asks for an approximation, the log can be considered order 1, so m_{H₂} ≈ y_i^2 x/(4 π).

However, different sources might use different conventions. For example, in the context of the Majoron (a pseudo-Goldstone boson from lepton number breaking), the mass can be generated by loops and is typically m ≈ (y^2 v)/(16 π²), where v is the lepton number breaking scale. If we replace v with x here, then m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²).

But I need to make a decision. Given that the mass squared from the fermion loop is δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(64 π²), then m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(8 π). This seems plausible. Alternatively, if the loop factor is 1/(16 π²), then δm² ≈ (y_i^4 x²)/(16 π²), leading to m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(4 π).

Given that the user asks for an approximation and considering standard results, I think the answer is:

The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is approximately m_{H₂} ≈ (y_i^2 x)/(16 π²).

But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options and the structure, I'll go with this.
