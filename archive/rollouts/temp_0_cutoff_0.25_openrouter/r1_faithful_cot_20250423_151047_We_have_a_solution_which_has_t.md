To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we start by calculating the moles of each phosphate species from the given salts:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of KH₂PO₄} = 136.09 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = 177.99 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00562 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Total moles of phosphate species**:
   \[
   \text{Total moles} = 0.00735 \, \text{mol} + 0.00562 \, \text{mol} = 0.01297 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Concentration of phosphate species**:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.200 \, \text{L}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Concentration} = \frac{0.01297 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.06485 \, \text{M}
   \]

Given the context and the provided dissociation constants, the term "orthophosphate ions" refers to the total concentration of all phosphate species (H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻) in the solution. The third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻) is negligible due to the very small Ka3 value. Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions is the sum of the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.

Rounding to three significant figures, the concentration is:

\[
\boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Let me start by understanding the problem. We have a solution with a total volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 gram each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to the total concentration of all phosphate species present. But wait, orthophosphate usually refers to the PO₄³⁻ ion, but in solution, phosphate can exist in different protonation states: H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. However, given that we're dealing with the salts KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, these are the disodium and monopotassium salts of phosphoric acid. 

So, KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions, while Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ ions. Therefore, the solution contains both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions. The problem is probably asking for the total concentration of phosphate species, but maybe specifically the concentration of PO₄³⁻? Wait, but given the pH of the solution, the dominant species might be a mix of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Since the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻) has a very small Ka3 (1.8x10^-12), so PO₄³⁻ concentration would be negligible. Therefore, maybe the question is asking for the sum of all phosphate species, which would be the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, but since these are the two main components added, their concentrations can be calculated separately and then added? Wait, but when you mix a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), you create a buffer solution. The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of H₂PO₄⁻ to HPO₄²⁻. However, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Let me check the exact definition. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated PO₄³⁻, but in aqueous solution, depending on pH, different species dominate. However, in this case, since we have H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, maybe the problem is considering all phosphate species (H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻) as orthophosphate? Wait, actually, orthophosphate is the name for the PO₄³⁻ ion, but sometimes in environmental chemistry, "orthophosphate" refers to all the inorganic phosphate species. But I need to check the context. The problem gives the three Ka values for H3PO4, so it's expecting us to consider the different protonation states. However, since we are adding H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ salts, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of the concentrations from both salts. But perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO₄³⁻? But given that the third dissociation is so weak, maybe it's negligible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the total concentration of phosphate, regardless of the protonation state. Let me read the question again: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?" Orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is specifically PO₄³⁻, then we need to calculate its concentration. But given that the solution is a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ would be very low. Alternatively, maybe the question is using "orthophosphate" to mean all phosphate species, so the total concentration would be the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Let me check that. 

In some contexts, "orthophosphate" refers to the sum of all species derived from H3PO4, i.e., H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. But in other contexts, it might refer specifically to PO4³⁻. However, given that the problem gives the Ka values, it's possible that they want the concentration of the deprotonated form, but given the salts present, maybe the answer is the sum of the two added phosphate species. Let me think. If we have KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, then each of these will contribute to the phosphate concentration. The total phosphate concentration would be the sum of the moles of H2PO4⁻ from KH2PO4 and HPO4²⁻ from Na2HPO4, divided by the total volume. But since these are both phosphate ions, their sum would be the total phosphate concentration. However, if the problem is considering that in solution, some of the H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ may interconvert depending on pH, but since we have a buffer, the actual concentrations of each species would depend on the pH. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about pH, so maybe it's just a straightforward calculation of the total phosphate concentration from both salts, assuming they don't react with each other. But that seems unlikely because when you mix an acid (H2PO4⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO4²⁻), the pH will adjust based on their ratio, but the total phosphate concentration would still be the sum of the two. Let me verify. 

First, calculate the moles of each phosphate species. 

For KH₂PO4: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 moles. 

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 moles. 

Total volume is 0.2 L. 

So the concentration of H2PO4⁻ is 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M 

The concentration of HPO4²⁻ is 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M 

If we consider that these are the two main species, and the third (PO4³⁻) is negligible, then the total phosphate concentration would be 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4³⁻, then we need to calculate its concentration. But given that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the pH will determine the ratio of these two, and the concentration of PO4³⁻ can be found using the third dissociation constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that orthophosphate is the sum of all species, so the answer is 0.06485 M. But I need to check. Let me think again. 

Orthophosphate typically refers to the PO4³⁻ ion. However, in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms. The term "orthophosphate" is sometimes used to distinguish it from condensed phosphates like pyrophosphate. In that case, orthophosphate would include all the species derived from H3PO4. So, the total concentration of orthophosphate would be the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. However, in the solution, since we have the salts KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the H3PO4 concentration would be negligible because these salts are in solution as H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. Also, PO4³⁻ is negligible due to the low Ka3. Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration would be approximately the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which is 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M, which is approximately 0.0648 M. But let's check if the problem expects this. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when you mix H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, they will establish an equilibrium, and the concentration of PO4³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation. But since the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4³⁻, we need to calculate that. Let's explore this possibility. 

The third dissociation is HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻, with Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. The concentration of PO4³⁻ would be determined by this equilibrium. However, the solution's pH will affect this. To find the pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system. The solution contains H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which are the second dissociation of H3PO4. The relevant Ka is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8. 

The pH of the buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])

First, calculate pKa2: pKa2 = -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21 

Then, the ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] is 0.0281 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.765 

So pH ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09 

Now, with pH ≈ 7.09, we can calculate the concentration of PO4³⁻. 

The third dissociation is HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻ 

Ka3 = [H+][PO4³⁻]/[HPO4²⁻] 

We can solve for [PO4³⁻]: 

[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+]

We have [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13x10^-8 M 

Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12 

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.0281 M 

So [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ (5.06x10^-14) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ 6.22x10^-7 M 

That's a very low concentration, 6.22e-7 M, which is negligible compared to the other phosphate species. Therefore, if the question is asking specifically for PO4³⁻, the answer would be approximately 6.2x10^-7 M. However, if it's asking for the total orthophosphate (all species), then it's 0.0648 M. 

But the problem states "concentration of orthophosphate ions". The term "orthophosphate" can be ambiguous. In chemistry, "orthophosphate" typically refers to the PO₄³⁻ ion, but in environmental or analytical contexts, it might refer to the sum of all phosphate species. However, given that the problem provides the three dissociation constants, it's possible that they expect us to consider the speciation. But since the third dissociation is so small, the main species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. However, the problem might be simply asking for the total phosphate concentration from both salts, regardless of their protonation state, which would be the sum of the two concentrations. 

Wait, but let's check the exact wording again: "concentration of orthophosphate ions". If "orthophosphate ions" refers to all phosphate species, then the answer is the sum. If it refers specifically to PO4³⁻, then it's 6.2e-7 M. But I need to confirm. 

In IUPAC terminology, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and its conjugate bases are the orthophosphate ions: H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. So, "orthophosphate ions" can refer to any of these. However, in common usage, sometimes "orthophosphate" is used to mean the fully deprotonated form, PO4³⁻. But given that the problem is in a chemistry context and provides the Ka values, it's more likely that they want the total concentration of all phosphate species, which is the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ (since PO4³⁻ is negligible). Alternatively, maybe they want the molarity of phosphate regardless of protonation, which would be the same as the sum. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where they expect you to realize that both salts contribute to the phosphate concentration, so you just add their molarities. Let's calculate that. 

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol 

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol 

Total moles of phosphate = 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol 

Concentration = 0.01297 mol / 0.2 L = 0.06485 M ≈ 0.0649 M 

So that's approximately 0.065 M. If the answer is expected to be this, then that's straightforward. But why would they give the Ka values then? Unless they expect you to consider that some of the phosphate is protonated or deprotonated, but since both salts are already in solution as their respective ions, the total phosphate concentration is just the sum. 

Wait, but when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, they dissociate completely into H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The presence of both ions will create a buffer, but the total amount of phosphate is the sum of the two. The Ka values might be a red herring, or they might be needed if the question was about the concentration of a specific species like HPO4²⁻ or H2PO4⁻. But since it's asking for orthophosphate ions, which is the sum, maybe the answer is 0.0649 M. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the sum of all phosphate species, which would include any H3PO4 and PO4³⁻, but those are negligible. So the total is still approximately 0.0649 M. 

But to be thorough, let's check if there's any proton transfer between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. For example, in solution, some H2PO4⁻ might donate a proton to HPO4²⁻. Wait, but H2PO4⁻ is the conjugate acid of HPO4²⁻. So in a solution containing both, the equilibrium would be:

H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H+ + HPO4²⁻ 

The Ka for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. 

Similarly, HPO4²⁻ can accept a proton to become H2PO4⁻, but since we have both present, the pH will adjust to the buffer solution. However, the total concentration of phosphate species (H2PO4⁻ + HPO4²⁻) remains the same, because the proton transfer doesn't change the total amount; it just converts one into the other. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is still the sum of the initial amounts. 

Therefore, the answer should be the total concentration of phosphate, which is (0.00735 + 0.00562) mol / 0.2 L = 0.01297 / 0.2 = 0.06485 M, which is 0.0649 M. 

But let me check if the problem might be considering something else. For example, if the two salts were to react with each other, but they are both sodium and potassium salts of phosphate, so they should just dissociate and exist as ions in solution. There's no precipitation or reaction between them. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is indeed the sum. 

However, the problem gives the Ka values, which might suggest that we need to consider the equilibrium between the species. But since the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, and if that term refers to all phosphate species, then the answer is the sum. If it refers to a specific species like PO4³⁻, then we need to calculate it using Ka3. 

But given that the third dissociation is so small, the concentration of PO4³⁻ is negligible. Therefore, the main species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their total concentration is 0.0649 M. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using "orthophosphate" to mean the sum of HPO4²⁻ and PO4³⁻, but that seems less likely. 

Wait, another approach: sometimes in solution, the total phosphate concentration is referred to as "orthophosphate as P", meaning the concentration of phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate. But in this case, the question is about orthophosphate ions, not phosphorus. 

Given the ambiguity, but considering that the problem gives the Ka values, it's possible that they expect us to calculate the concentration of PO4³⁻. But as we saw earlier, that's about 6.2e-7 M, which is very small. However, maybe the question is a trick question to realize that the main species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their sum is the total orthophosphate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the term "orthophosphate ions" here refers to all the deprotonated forms, i.e., HPO4²⁻ and PO4³⁻, but not H2PO4⁻. But that would be non-standard terminology. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in error and actually wants the total phosphate concentration, which is 0.0649 M. 

Given that the problem is from a chemistry context, and the Ka values are provided, but the question is about concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is a specific term, I think the answer is the total concentration of all phosphate species, which is 0.0649 M. However, to confirm, let's check some references. 

In standard chemistry, "orthophosphate" refers to the PO₄³⁻ ion, but in solution, it exists in different protonation states. However, when you have a solution of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species. For example, in a phosphate buffer, the total phosphate is the sum of the concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0649 M. 

But to be absolutely sure, let's calculate it again. 

Molar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol 

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00562 mol 

Total moles phosphate = 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol 

Volume = 0.2 L 

Concentration = 0.01297 / 0.2 = 0.06485 M ≈ 0.0649 M 

Rounded to three significant figures, since the given masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The least number of sig figs in the data is three (1.00 g for each salt), so the answer should be 0.0649 M, which is 0.0649 M, but written with three sig figs as 0.0648 M or 0.0649? Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.2 L gives 0.06485 M. So, three sig figs would be 0.0649 M. 

But let's check the exact calculation: 

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073502836 mol 

1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056182932 mol 

Total = 0.012968577 mol 

Divide by 0.2 L: 0.064842885 M 

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M 

But since the third decimal place is 4, which is less than 5, it would be 0.0648. However, sometimes when the digit after is 8, you might round up. Wait, 0.064842885... So the third decimal is 4, the next digit is 8, which is more than 5, so you round up the 4 to 5. Wait, no: 0.064842885 is approximately 0.064843, which would round to 0.0648 when keeping three decimal places. Wait, but significant figures: the value is 0.064842885. The first significant figure is 6, the second is 4, the third is 8. The fourth is 4, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, 0.0648 M with three significant figures. 

But the original data: 1.00 g (three sig figs), 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs), molar masses four sig figs. The limiting factor is the 1.00 g for each salt, which is three sig figs. Therefore, the answer should have three sig figs. So 0.0648 M. 

But let me check the exact calculation again. 

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.0073502836 mol 

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.0056182932 mol 

Total moles: 0.0073502836 + 0.0056182932 = 0.0129685768 mol 

Concentration: 0.0129685768 / 0.2 = 0.064842884 M 

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M 

Yes, because the first three digits after the decimal are 6, 4, 8. The fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we keep the third digit as 8. Therefore, 0.0648 M. 

But wait, 0.064842884... when rounding to three decimal places, it's 0.065? No, wait, three significant figures. The number is 0.064842884. The first significant figure is 6 (the first non-zero digit), the second is 4, the third is 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we leave the third digit as 8. Therefore, 0.0648 M. 

But 0.0648 has three significant figures: 6, 4, 8. The trailing zero is not counted here because it's after the decimal. Wait, no: 0.0648 is three significant figures. Yes. 

Alternatively, if written in scientific notation, it's 6.48x10^-2 M, which clearly shows three sig figs. 

Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions, considering that it refers to the total phosphate species (H2PO4⁻ + HPO4²⁻), is 0.0648 M. 

But to ensure that this is what the question expects, given that they provided the Ka values, maybe we need to consider the equilibrium between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. However, the total concentration remains the same regardless of the equilibrium. The presence of both species in solution doesn't change the total amount; it only changes their ratio. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is still the sum of the two initial concentrations. 

Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M. 

But let me check one more time. Suppose someone argues that "orthophosphate ions" specifically refers to PO4³⁻. Then, using the calculated pH of ~7.09, and the third dissociation, we found [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.2e-7 M. But that's negligible. However, if the question is specifically asking for PO4³⁻, then that's the answer. But given the context, I think it's more likely that they want the total phosphate concentration. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick to realize that when you mix H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the dominant species are these two, and their sum is the total orthophosphate concentration. 

Given that, I think the answer is 0.0648 M. 

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Let me start by understanding the problem.

But that seems unlikely because when you mix an acid (H2PO4⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO4²⁻), the pH will adjust based on their ratio, but the total phosphate concentration would still be the sum of the two. Let me verify. 

First, calculate the moles of each phosphate species. 

For KH₂PO4: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 moles.

Okay, so I need to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. I'm analyzing a solution with a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 liters) containing 1.00 gram each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. I need to clarify what "orthophosphate ions" refers to in this context.

Orthophosphate technically refers to the PO₄³⁻ ion, but phosphate can exist in various protonation states in solution: H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. The salts we have are providing two different phosphate species: KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions, while Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ ions.

This means our solution contains both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions. Given that the third dissociation constant (Ka3 = 1.8×10⁻¹²) for phosphoric acid is very small, the concentration of fully deprotonated PO₄³⁻ would be negligible. The question might be asking for the total concentration of all phosphate species, which would primarily be the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.

When mixing H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base), we create a buffer solution. The pH of this solution will determine the exact ratio between these two species, but the total phosphate concentration remains the sum of both contributions.

Since the problem provides Ka values for H₃PO₄, it suggests we need to consider the different protonation states. However, the question simply asks for "orthophosphate ions," which could refer to either specifically PO₄³⁻ or to all inorganic phosphate species collectively (as sometimes used in environmental chemistry).

To calculate the total phosphate concentration, I need to determine the moles of each phosphate-containing compound:

For KH₂PO₄: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol, so 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 moles.

For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: molar mass is...

Alright, I need to determine the orthophosphate ion concentration in this solution. Let's unpack the issue. We have 200.00 cm³ (or 0.2 liters) of solution encompassing 1.00 gram each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The inquiry is about the orthophosphate concentration, which generally means the total concentration of phosphate ions present. Orthophosphate typically refers to the PO₄³⁻ ion, but in this solution, phosphate can manifest as H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. Given the salts KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, these correspond to the monopotassium and disodium variants of phosphoric acid.

KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, while Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻. Thus, the solution consists of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions. The question might be seeking the total phosphate species concentration, possibly focusing on PO₄³⁻? Yet given the minimal Ka3 (1.8x10^-12) dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is likely negligible, implying the inquiry might aim at the total of all phosphate species or at least the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Mixing a weak acid like H₂PO₄⁻ with its base counterpart HPO₄²⁻ results in a buffer. The solution's pH influences the H₂PO₄⁻ to HPO₄²⁻ ratio. But, the concentration query is about orthophosphate ions. 

Orthophosphate traditionally denotes the PO₄³⁻ ion but can refer to all inorganic phosphate species in certain contexts. With provided Ka values for H3PO4, the expectation might be to consider the protonation states. Since our added salts are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the total phosphate concentration sums up these individual concentrations. The problem could be focusing on PO₄³⁻ concentration, which is negligible given weak dissociation, or simply on total phosphate concentration. I reread the query, which asks for orthophosphate ions. If it specifically targets PO₄³⁻ concentration, it indeed requires computation. However, as the setup yields a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the PO₄³⁻ concentration is quite low.

In various contexts, "orthophosphate" can imply the total sum of species resulting from H3PO4: H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. Other times, it refers solely to PO4³⁻. Factoring in the Ka values highlights a possible interest in the deprotonated form, but considering the salts, the sum of the added phosphate ions might be sufficient.

Let's calculate the moles of each phosphate:

For KH₂PO4: Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Thus, 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol equals 0.00735 moles.

For Na2HPO4:

So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 moles. \n\nTotal volume is 0.2 L. \n\nSo the concentration of H2PO4⁻ is 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M. \n\nThe concentration of HPO4²⁻ is 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M. \n\nIf we consider that these are the two main species, and the third (PO4³⁻) is negligible, then the total phosphate concentration would be 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is considered as all phosphate species, then 0.06485 M is the answer. But if orthophosphate refers to PO4³⁻, then we need to calculate its concentration using the given Ka values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate the concentration of phosphate ions considering the dissociation of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. Let\'s think. \n\nH2PO4⁻ can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4²⁻) or as a base (accept a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4²⁻ can act as an acid (donate a proton to become PO4³⁻) or as a base (accept a proton to become H2PO4⁻). However, given the Ka values, the second dissociation (H2PO4⁻ -> HPO4²⁻ + H+) has a Ka2 of 6.2x10^-8, which is much smaller than Ka1 (7.5x10^-3). The third dissociation (HPO4²⁻ -> PO4³⁻ + H+) has a Ka3 of 1.8x10^-12, which is even smaller. \n\nBut in this solution, we have both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of these two species. However, since we are adding both, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nThe relevant pKa here would be pKa2, since we\'re dealing with H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. pKa2 is -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21. \n\nSo, the pH of the buffer solution can be calculated using: \n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])\n\nPlugging in the concentrations we calculated: \n\npH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.03675) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09\n\nSo the pH is approximately 7.09. \n\nAt this pH, the concentration of PO4³⁻ can be calculated using the third dissociation: \n\nHPO4²⁻ <-> PO4³⁻ + H+\n\nKa3 = [PO4³⁻][H+]/[HPO4²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+]\n\nWe know Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12, [HPO4²⁻] is approximately 0.0281 M, and [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13x10^-8 M.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ (5.06x10^-14) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ 6.22x10^-7 M\n\nThat\'s a very small concentration, so indeed, PO4³⁻ is negligible. \n\nSimilarly, the concentration of H3PO4 can be calculated using the first dissociation, but since we\'re starting with H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the amount of H3PO4 would be even smaller. \n\nTherefore, the total concentration of phosphate species is approximately the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which is 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. Rounding to appropriate significant figures, since the masses are given to three significant figures (1.00 g) and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five significant figures), the molar masses are four and five significant figures. The least number of significant figures in the moles calculation is three (from 1.00 g). So the concentrations would be 0.0368 M and 0.0281 M, summing to 0.0649 M. \n\nBut wait, the problem says "concentration of orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate refers to all phosphate species, then 0.0649 M is the answer. If it refers specifically to PO4³⁻, then it\'s ~6.22x10^-7 M, but that seems too small and probably not what the question is asking. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they just want the sum of the phosphate from both salts, assuming they don\'t react. But given that they provide the Ka values, they might expect us to consider the equilibrium. However, since the third dissociation is negligible, the main species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their sum is the total phosphate concentration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to realize that in solution, the phosphate will exist as different species, but the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all species. Since we added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their interconversion via the buffer doesn\'t change the total amount, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O)/volume. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you have a solution with a weak acid and its conjugate base, the total concentration of the acid/base species is the sum of the two. The buffer equilibrium shifts between the two, but the total remains the same. So even though some H2PO4⁻ might deprotonate to become HPO4²⁻ and vice versa, the total phosphate concentration is conserved. Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions (all species) is (0.00735 + 0.00562) mol / 0.2 L = 0.0130 mol / 0.2 L = 0.065 M. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.0649 M, which rounds to 0.065 M. Considering significant figures, the masses are given as 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06484 M, which can be rounded to 0.0648 M or 0.0649 M. Since the moles of KH2PO4 have three sig figs, the total moles would be 0.01297 (four sig figs), divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), so the result is 0.06485 M, which should be rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.00735 is three sig figs (since 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three, 136.09 has five, so the result is three sig figs). Similarly, 0.005618 is four sig figs. When adding, the number of decimal places is determined by the least precise. 0.00735 has five decimal places (0.00735), 0.005618 has six. Wait, actually, 0.00735 is 0.00735 (three sig figs, but written as 0.00735, which is three decimal places?), no, the number of significant figures is independent of decimal places. 0.00735 has three significant figures: 7, 3, 5. The leading zeros are not significant. Similarly, 0.005618 has four significant figures: 5, 6, 1, 8. When adding, the rule is that the result should be rounded to the least precise measurement. However, when adding 0.00735 and 0.005618, we can line them up:\n\n0.00735\n\n+0.005618\n\n=0.012968\n\nThe first number is uncertain in the fifth decimal place (since it\'s 0.00735, which could be 0.00735 ±0.000005), and the second is uncertain in the sixth decimal place. So the sum is 0.012968, with the last digit uncertain. However, since the first number has three sig figs and the second has four, the sum should be reported with three decimal places? Wait, no. The rule for addition is that the result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places of any of the addends. But here, 0.00735 has three decimal places (if written as 0.00735), but actually, the number of decimal places is different. Wait, 0.00735 is 7.35x10^-3, which has three significant figures. 0.005618 is 5.618x10^-3, which has four significant figures. When adding, the absolute uncertainty is what matters. The first number has an uncertainty of ±0.00001 (since the last digit is in the 5th decimal place), and the second has ±0.000001. So the sum\'s uncertainty is dominated by the first number. Therefore, the sum should be reported as 0.01297 with four significant figures? Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me recall: when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. \n\n0.00735 has three decimal places (if written as 0.00735, but actually, it\'s three significant figures with the last digit in the thousandth place: 7.35 x10^-3). Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places: 0.007 (three decimal places). Wait, no: 0.00735 is 7.35 thousandths, so three significant figures. The decimal places are five: 0.00735. But the significant figures are three. When adding, decimal places matter, not sig figs. For example, 1.23 + 4.567 = 5.797, which would be rounded to 5.80 (two decimal places). Wait, no: 1.23 has two decimal places, 4.567 has three. The result should be rounded to two decimal places: 5.80. \n\nSimilarly, in our case:\n\n0.00735 (three decimal places: 0.00735 is five decimal places, but the significant figures are three. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check:\n\nThe number 0.00735 can be written as 7.35 x10^-3. It has three significant figures. The decimal places are five, but the significant figures are three. When adding, the rule is about decimal places. For example:\n\n1.2 (one decimal place) + 3.45 (two decimal places) = 4.65, which is rounded to one decimal place: 4.6 (if following the rule strictly). But actually, the rule is that the result cannot be more precise than the least precise number. So if one number is known to the tenths place and another to the hundredths, the result should be to the tenths. \n\nBut in our case, 0.00735 is 0.00735 (three significant figures, but the decimal places are five). Wait, no. The number 0.00735 is written with five decimal places, but only three are significant. The zeros before 7 are not significant. So when adding, the key is to look at the uncertainty in the last digit. For 0.00735, the last digit is in the 5th decimal place (0.00735), but it\'s three significant figures. For 0.005618, the last digit is in the 6th decimal place (0.005618), four significant figures. \n\nWhen adding, the uncertainty is in the 5th decimal place for the first number and 6th for the second. Therefore, the sum should be reported to the 5th decimal place. But since the first number is uncertain in the 5th decimal place, the sum\'s uncertainty is in the 5th decimal place. So 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968. Rounded to the 5th decimal place, which is the sixth digit here. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to convert both to scientific notation with exponents matched:\n\n0.00735 = 7.35 x10^-3\n\n0.005618 = 5.618 x10^-3\n\nAdding them gives (7.35 + 5.618) x10^-3 = 12.968 x10^-3 = 1.2968 x10^-2\n\nNow, considering significant figures: 7.35 has three, 5.618 has four. When adding, the result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places in the original numbers. 7.35 has two decimal places (in the x10^-3 terms, which is three decimal places in absolute terms), and 5.618 has three decimal places. So the result should be rounded to two decimal places in the x10^-3 terms, which is 12.97 x10^-3 (but wait, 7.35 has two decimal places in the coefficient, 5.618 has three). Therefore, the sum should be rounded to two decimal places in the coefficient: 13.0 x10^-3? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWhen adding 7.35 (three sig figs, two decimal places) and 5.618 (four sig figs, three decimal places), the result should be reported with two decimal places. So 7.35 + 5.618 = 12.968, which rounded to two decimal places is 12.97. Therefore, the sum is 12.97 x10^-3 = 1.297 x10^-2. But this is three decimal places. Wait, I\'m getting confused. Maybe the key is that when adding, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise measurement. But in terms of absolute values, the uncertainty is in the last digit. \n\nAlternatively, since the moles of KH2PO4 are 0.00735 mol (three sig figs) and Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005618 mol (four sig figs), the total moles are 0.012968 mol. Since the least number of sig figs is three, the total should be rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065 M. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the moles from KH2PO4 have three sig figs, so the total moles are 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968, which we round to 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.065 M (two significant figures? Wait, 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. When dividing, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is three. 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. But 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.2 is 0.065. So 0.065 has two sig figs? No, 0.065 as written has two sig figs (6 and 5), but if it\'s written as 0.0650, that\'s three. Wait, but 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. The division: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = (1.30 x10^-2) / (2.0000 x10^-1) = (1.30 / 2.0000) x10^-1 = 0.65 x10^-1 = 0.065. The result is 0.065, which has two sig figs. Wait, but 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. 1.30 has three sig figs, 2.0000 has five, so the result should have three sig figs: 0.650. Wait, no. Let\'s do the division: 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, 2.0000 is five. The rule is that the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement, which is three. So 0.65 has two sig figs, but we need three. Therefore, it should be 0.650. Wait, but 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. To express this with three sig figs, it\'s 0.650. But 0.65 is two sig figs, 0.650 is three. Therefore, the result is 0.0650 M. \n\nWait, but 1.30 x10^-2 divided by 2.0000 x10^-1 is (1.30 / 2.0000) x10^-1. 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. Then 0.65 x10^-1 = 0.065. But 0.65 has two sig figs. To keep three, we need to write it as 0.650 x10^-1 = 0.0650. Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M, which has three significant figures. \n\nBut this seems conflicting. Let me check with actual numbers. \n\n1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, 2.0000 is five. The result should have three sig figs. 0.65 is two sig figs. To represent three, we need to write 0.650. But 0.65 is exact? No, 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65 exactly. Because 1.30 divided by 2 is 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, implying uncertainty in the hundredths place. 2.0000 is five sig figs. So the result is 0.65 with an uncertainty of ±0.005, which is two sig figs. Wait, no. If the numerator is 1.30 ±0.005 and the denominator is 2.0000 ±0.00005, then the result is 0.65 ±0.0025. So the result is 0.65 with an uncertainty in the hundredths place, which is two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 0.065 M with two sig figs. But the original moles were 0.0130 (three sig figs) divided by 0.20000 (five sig figs). So the result is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Wait, confusion arises because trailing zeros in a decimal number are significant. So 0.0650 has three sig figs. Therefore, if we write the concentration as 0.0650 M, that\'s three sig figs. But how do we get there? \n\nLet me do the division step-by-step. \n\nTotal moles: 0.0130 mol (three sig figs)\n\nVolume: 0.20000 L (five sig figs)\n\nConcentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.065 M. \n\nBut 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. However, 0.065 has two sig figs. To express three sig figs, it should be 0.0650. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because of the decimal points. If I write it as 6.50 x10^-2, that\'s three sig figs. So 0.0650 M. \n\nYes, that\'s correct. Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M, which has three significant figures. \n\nBut the original problem gives the masses as 1.00 g (three sig figs), and the volume as 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The molar masses are 136.09 g/mol (five sig figs) and 177.99 g/mol (five sig figs). \n\nCalculating moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs)\n\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol\n\nConcentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0650 M. \n\nBut wait, the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of molarity with correct significant figures. However, let\'s verify if "orthophosphate ions" refers to all phosphate species or just PO4³⁻. Earlier, we calculated that PO4³⁻ concentration is ~6.2x10^-7 M, which is negligible. Therefore, if the question is asking for the total phosphate concentration (all species), it\'s 0.0650 M. If it\'s asking specifically for PO4³⁻, it\'s ~6.2x10^-7 M. But given that the problem provides all three Ka values, maybe we need to consider the exact concentration considering the equilibria. \n\nWait, but when you have a solution containing both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species: [H3PO4] + [H2PO4⁻] + [HPO4²⁻] + [PO4³⁻]. However, in this case, we added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and the solution will have some H3PO4 and PO4³⁻ due to dissociation, but their concentrations are negligible. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is approximately [H2PO4⁻] + [HPO4²⁻] = 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M ≈ 0.0648 M. Considering significant figures, as we discussed, it\'s 0.0650 M. \n\nBut let\'s check with the exact calculation. \n\nTotal phosphate concentration = (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O) / volume\n\n= (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99) / 0.20000\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol (approximately)\n\n1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (approximately)\n\nSum: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol\n\nDivide by 0.20000 L: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But since the third significant figure is 4, and the next digit is 8, which is more than 5, we round up: 0.0648 → 0.065. Wait, 0.06483 is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, 0.06483 has four sig figs. Wait, no. 0.06483 is 6.483 x10^-2, which is four sig figs. But we need to round to three. So 6.48 x10^-2 = 0.0648. But the original data for KH2PO4 was three sig figs, leading to total moles of 0.01297 (rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130). Then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650. \n\nThis is conflicting. The exact calculation gives 0.06483, which is approximately 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But considering the significant figures from the original data, it\'s 0.0650 M. This discrepancy arises from the rounding steps. \n\nHowever, in analytical chemistry, when mixing two salts, the total concentration is simply the sum of the concentrations from each salt, assuming they don\'t react. But in reality, they do form a buffer, but the total phosphate concentration remains the sum. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M. Given the options, probably 0.0648 M is more precise, but the problem might expect three significant figures, so 0.065 M. \n\nBut let\'s check the exact values:\n\n1.00 g KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol\n\n1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol\n\nTotal moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol\n\nVolume: 0.20000 L\n\nConcentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But 0.06483 is closer to 0.0648 than 0.0649. However, the fourth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we keep the third digit as is. Therefore, 0.0648 M. But the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is five sig figs, and the masses as 1.00 g, three sig figs. The molar masses are given with more sig figs. Therefore, the limiting factor is the mass measurements. So the moles of each salt have three and four sig figs, respectively. When summed, the total moles have three sig figs (from the KH2PO4). Therefore, total moles = 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 ≈ 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. But the way, in the problem statement, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L, so five sig figs. The masses are 1.00 g, three sig figs. The molar masses are four and five sig figs. Therefore, the moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol, which should be rounded to 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol. Concentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0650 M. However, considering that "orthophosphate" might specifically refer to PO4³⁻, but as we calculated earlier, that\'s negligible. Therefore, the answer is the total phosphate concentration, which is 0.0650 M. \n\nBut let me check one more time. If the problem had wanted the concentration of PO4³⁻, it would have specified, and given the very low concentration, it\'s unlikely. Therefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. \n\nBut in the initial calculation, summing the two concentrations gives 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M, which is 0.06485, rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But according to significant figure rules, since the moles of KH2PO4 are three sig figs and Na2HPO4·2H2O are four, the total moles should be three sig figs. Therefore, 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 → 0.0130 mol. Then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. \n\nYes, this is correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. \n\nBut let me check with exact calculation without rounding intermediate steps. \n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073480654 mol\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056182931 mol\n\nTotal moles: 0.0073480654 + 0.0056182931 = 0.0129663585 mol\n\nConcentration: 0.0129663585 / 0.20000 = 0.0648317925 M\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. \n\nBut wait, the total moles are 0.0129663585 mol, which is 0.012966 mol. If we consider the significant figures, the moles of KH2PO4 are 0.00735 (three sig figs), and Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005618 (four sig figs). When adding, the result should be rounded to the least precise, which is the thousandths place (for KH2PO4: 0.00735 is 0.00735, thousandths place is the third decimal). So:\n\n0.00735 (exact to the 5th decimal)\n\n+0.005618 (exact to the 6th decimal)\n\n=0.012968\n\nBut since the KH2PO4 is only known to the 5th decimal (0.00735), the sum should be rounded to the 5th decimal place. 0.012968 rounded to the 5th decimal is 0.01297. Then, 0.01297 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0649 M. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. The key takeaway is that depending on how you handle the significant figures, the answer could be 0.0648, 0.0649, or 0.0650 M. However, given the problem\'s data, the most appropriate answer considering significant figures is 0.0648 M. But in many textbooks, when mixing solutions, the total concentration is simply the sum, and they might expect 0.0648 M. However, given that the problem provides Ka values, maybe we need to consider the buffer equilibrium. \n\nWait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If we consider that in solution, some of the H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ will interconvert, but the total phosphate concentration remains the same. Therefore, the answer is still the sum of their concentrations. Therefore, 0.0648 M. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering that orthophosphate is only PO4³⁻, then the answer is 6.2x10^-7 M. But that seems unlikely. \n\nGiven the information, I think the answer is 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M. But to adhere strictly to significant figures, it\'s 0.0648 M. However, different sources might round differently. \n\nIn conclusion, after considering all factors, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 0.065 M, considering significant figures and the total phosphate concentration from both salts.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446554, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7574, prompt_tokens=1431, total_tokens=9005, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first calculate the moles of each phosphate species from the given salts:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   This contributes to the concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:
   \[
   [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.20000 \, \text{L}} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}
   \]

2. **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   This contributes to the concentration of HPO₄²⁻:
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.20000 \, \text{L}} = 0.0281 \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Total Phosphate Concentration**:
   The total concentration of orthophosphate ions (sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, as PO₄³⁻ is negligible due to the very small \( K_{a3} \)):
   \[
   \text{Total [PO₄]} = 0.03675 \, \text{M} + 0.0281 \, \text{M} = 0.06485 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Significant Figures**:
   Considering the significant figures from the given masses (three sig figs for 1.00 g), the total concentration is rounded to **0.0648 M**.

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{0.0648 \, \text{M}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

O4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 moles. 

Total volume is 0.2 L. 

So the concentration of H2PO4⁻ is 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M. 

The concentration of HPO4²⁻ is 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M. 

If we consider that these are the two main species, and the third (PO4³⁻) is negligible, then the total phosphate concentration would be 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is considered as all phosphate species, then 0.06485 M is the answer. But if orthophosphate refers to PO4³⁻, then we need to calculate its concentration using the given Ka values. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate the concentration of phosphate ions considering the dissociation of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. Let's think. 

H2PO4⁻ can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4²⁻) or as a base (accept a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4²⁻ can act as an acid (donate a proton to become PO4³⁻) or as a base (accept a proton to become H2PO4⁻). However, given the Ka values, the second dissociation (H2PO4⁻ -> HPO4²⁻ + H+) has a Ka2 of 6.2x10^-8, which is much smaller than Ka1 (7.5x10^-3). The third dissociation (HPO4²⁻ -> PO4³⁻ + H+) has a Ka3 of 1.8x10^-12, which is even smaller. 

But in this solution, we have both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of these two species. However, since we are adding both, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. 

The relevant pKa here would be pKa2, since we're dealing with H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. pKa2 is -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21. 

So, the pH of the buffer solution can be calculated using: 

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])

Plugging in the concentrations we calculated: 

pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.03675) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09

So the pH is approximately 7.09. 

At this pH, the concentration of PO4³⁻ can be calculated using the third dissociation: 

HPO4²⁻ <-> PO4³⁻ + H+

Ka3 = [PO4³⁻][H+]/[HPO4²⁻]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4³⁻]:

[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12, [HPO4²⁻] is approximately 0.0281 M, and [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13x10^-8 M.

Plugging in:

[PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ (5.06x10^-14) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ 6.22x10^-7 M

That's a very small concentration, so indeed, PO4³⁻ is negligible. 

Similarly, the concentration of H3PO4 can be calculated using the first dissociation, but since we're starting with H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the amount of H3PO4 would be even smaller. 

Therefore, the total concentration of phosphate species is approximately the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which is 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. Rounding to appropriate significant figures, since the masses are given to three significant figures (1.00 g) and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (five significant figures), the molar masses are four and five significant figures. The least number of significant figures in the moles calculation is three (from 1.00 g). So the concentrations would be 0.0368 M and 0.0281 M, summing to 0.0649 M. 

But wait, the problem says "concentration of orthophosphate ions". If orthophosphate refers to all phosphate species, then 0.0649 M is the answer. If it refers specifically to PO4³⁻, then it's ~6.22x10^-7 M, but that seems too small and probably not what the question is asking. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they just want the sum of the phosphate from both salts, assuming they don't react. But given that they provide the Ka values, they might expect us to consider the equilibrium. However, since the third dissociation is negligible, the main species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their sum is the total phosphate concentration. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to realize that in solution, the phosphate will exist as different species, but the total phosphate concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all species. Since we added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and their interconversion via the buffer doesn't change the total amount, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O)/volume. 

Yes, that makes sense. Because when you have a solution with a weak acid and its conjugate base, the total concentration of the acid/base species is the sum of the two. The buffer equilibrium shifts between the two, but the total remains the same. So even though some H2PO4⁻ might deprotonate to become HPO4²⁻ and vice versa, the total phosphate concentration is conserved. Therefore, the total concentration of orthophosphate ions (all species) is (0.00735 + 0.00562) mol / 0.2 L = 0.0130 mol / 0.2 L = 0.065 M. 

Therefore, the answer should be 0.0649 M, which rounds to 0.065 M. Considering significant figures, the masses are given as 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06484 M, which can be rounded to 0.0648 M or 0.0649 M. Since the moles of KH2PO4 have three sig figs, the total moles would be 0.01297 (four sig figs), divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), so the result is 0.06485 M, which should be rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.00735 is three sig figs (since 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol: 1.00 has three, 136.09 has five, so the result is three sig figs). Similarly, 0.005618 is four sig figs. When adding, the number of decimal places is determined by the least precise. 0.00735 has five decimal places (0.00735), 0.005618 has six. Wait, actually, 0.00735 is 0.00735 (three sig figs, but written as 0.00735, which is three decimal places?), no, the number of significant figures is independent of decimal places. 0.00735 has three significant figures: 7, 3, 5. The leading zeros are not significant. Similarly, 0.005618 has four significant figures: 5, 6, 1, 8. When adding, the rule is that the result should be rounded to the least precise measurement. However, when adding 0.00735 and 0.005618, we can line them up:

0.00735

+0.005618

=0.012968

The first number is uncertain in the fifth decimal place (since it's 0.00735, which could be 0.00735 ±0.000005), and the second is uncertain in the sixth decimal place. So the sum is 0.012968, with the last digit uncertain. However, since the first number has three sig figs and the second has four, the sum should be reported with three decimal places? Wait, no. The rule for addition is that the result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places of any of the addends. But here, 0.00735 has three decimal places (if written as 0.00735), but actually, the number of decimal places is different. Wait, 0.00735 is 7.35x10^-3, which has three significant figures. 0.005618 is 5.618x10^-3, which has four significant figures. When adding, the absolute uncertainty is what matters. The first number has an uncertainty of ±0.00001 (since the last digit is in the 5th decimal place), and the second has ±0.000001. So the sum's uncertainty is dominated by the first number. Therefore, the sum should be reported as 0.01297 with four significant figures? Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me recall: when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. 

0.00735 has three decimal places (if written as 0.00735, but actually, it's three significant figures with the last digit in the thousandth place: 7.35 x10^-3). Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places: 0.007 (three decimal places). Wait, no: 0.00735 is 7.35 thousandths, so three significant figures. The decimal places are five: 0.00735. But the significant figures are three. When adding, decimal places matter, not sig figs. For example, 1.23 + 4.567 = 5.797, which would be rounded to 5.80 (two decimal places). Wait, no: 1.23 has two decimal places, 4.567 has three. The result should be rounded to two decimal places: 5.80. 

Similarly, in our case:

0.00735 (three decimal places: 0.00735 is five decimal places, but the significant figures are three. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check:

The number 0.00735 can be written as 7.35 x10^-3. It has three significant figures. The decimal places are five, but the significant figures are three. When adding, the rule is about decimal places. For example:

1.2 (one decimal place) + 3.45 (two decimal places) = 4.65, which is rounded to one decimal place: 4.6 (if following the rule strictly). But actually, the rule is that the result cannot be more precise than the least precise number. So if one number is known to the tenths place and another to the hundredths, the result should be to the tenths. 

But in our case, 0.00735 is 0.00735 (three significant figures, but the decimal places are five). Wait, no. The number 0.00735 is written with five decimal places, but only three are significant. The zeros before 7 are not significant. So when adding, the key is to look at the uncertainty in the last digit. For 0.00735, the last digit is in the 5th decimal place (0.00735), but it's three significant figures. For 0.005618, the last digit is in the 6th decimal place (0.005618), four significant figures. 

When adding, the uncertainty is in the 5th decimal place for the first number and 6th for the second. Therefore, the sum should be reported to the 5th decimal place. But since the first number is uncertain in the 5th decimal place, the sum's uncertainty is in the 5th decimal place. So 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968. Rounded to the 5th decimal place, which is the sixth digit here. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to convert both to scientific notation with exponents matched:

0.00735 = 7.35 x10^-3

0.005618 = 5.618 x10^-3

Adding them gives (7.35 + 5.618) x10^-3 = 12.968 x10^-3 = 1.2968 x10^-2

Now, considering significant figures: 7.35 has three, 5.618 has four. When adding, the result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places in the original numbers. 7.35 has two decimal places (in the x10^-3 terms, which is three decimal places in absolute terms), and 5.618 has three decimal places. So the result should be rounded to two decimal places in the x10^-3 terms, which is 12.97 x10^-3 (but wait, 7.35 has two decimal places in the coefficient, 5.618 has three). Therefore, the sum should be rounded to two decimal places in the coefficient: 13.0 x10^-3? Wait, no. Let me think again. 

When adding 7.35 (three sig figs, two decimal places) and 5.618 (four sig figs, three decimal places), the result should be reported with two decimal places. So 7.35 + 5.618 = 12.968, which rounded to two decimal places is 12.97. Therefore, the sum is 12.97 x10^-3 = 1.297 x10^-2. But this is three decimal places. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the key is that when adding, the number of significant figures is determined by the least precise measurement. But in terms of absolute values, the uncertainty is in the last digit. 

Alternatively, since the moles of KH2PO4 are 0.00735 mol (three sig figs) and Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005618 mol (four sig figs), the total moles are 0.012968 mol. Since the least number of sig figs is three, the total should be rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065 M. 

Yes, that makes sense. Because the moles from KH2PO4 have three sig figs, so the total moles are 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968, which we round to 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.065 M (two significant figures? Wait, 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. When dividing, the result should have the least number of sig figs, which is three. 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. But 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.2 is 0.065. So 0.065 has two sig figs? No, 0.065 as written has two sig figs (6 and 5), but if it's written as 0.0650, that's three. Wait, but 0.0130 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. The division: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = (1.30 x10^-2) / (2.0000 x10^-1) = (1.30 / 2.0000) x10^-1 = 0.65 x10^-1 = 0.065. The result is 0.065, which has two sig figs. Wait, but 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. 1.30 has three sig figs, 2.0000 has five, so the result should have three sig figs: 0.650. Wait, no. Let's do the division: 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, 2.0000 is five. The rule is that the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement, which is three. So 0.65 has two sig figs, but we need three. Therefore, it should be 0.650. Wait, but 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. To express this with three sig figs, it's 0.650. But 0.65 is two sig figs, 0.650 is three. Therefore, the result is 0.0650 M. 

Wait, but 1.30 x10^-2 divided by 2.0000 x10^-1 is (1.30 / 2.0000) x10^-1. 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. Then 0.65 x10^-1 = 0.065. But 0.65 has two sig figs. To keep three, we need to write it as 0.650 x10^-1 = 0.0650. Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M, which has three significant figures. 

But this seems conflicting. Let me check with actual numbers. 

1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, 2.0000 is five. The result should have three sig figs. 0.65 is two sig figs. To represent three, we need to write 0.650. But 0.65 is exact? No, 1.30 / 2.0000 = 0.65 exactly. Because 1.30 divided by 2 is 0.65. But 1.30 is three sig figs, implying uncertainty in the hundredths place. 2.0000 is five sig figs. So the result is 0.65 with an uncertainty of ±0.005, which is two sig figs. Wait, no. If the numerator is 1.30 ±0.005 and the denominator is 2.0000 ±0.00005, then the result is 0.65 ±0.0025. So the result is 0.65 with an uncertainty in the hundredths place, which is two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 0.065 M with two sig figs. But the original moles were 0.0130 (three sig figs) divided by 0.20000 (five sig figs). So the result is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Wait, confusion arises because trailing zeros in a decimal number are significant. So 0.0650 has three sig figs. Therefore, if we write the concentration as 0.0650 M, that's three sig figs. But how do we get there? 

Let me do the division step-by-step. 

Total moles: 0.0130 mol (three sig figs)

Volume: 0.20000 L (five sig figs)

Concentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.065 M. 

But 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. However, 0.065 has two sig figs. To express three sig figs, it should be 0.0650. 

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because of the decimal points. If I write it as 6.50 x10^-2, that's three sig figs. So 0.0650 M. 

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the concentration is 0.0650 M, which has three significant figures. 

But the original problem gives the masses as 1.00 g (three sig figs), and the volume as 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The molar masses are 136.09 g/mol (five sig figs) and 177.99 g/mol (five sig figs). 

Calculating moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs)

Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol

Concentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)

Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0650 M. 

But wait, the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of molarity with correct significant figures. However, let's verify if "orthophosphate ions" refers to all phosphate species or just PO4³⁻. Earlier, we calculated that PO4³⁻ concentration is ~6.2x10^-7 M, which is negligible. Therefore, if the question is asking for the total phosphate concentration (all species), it's 0.0650 M. If it's asking specifically for PO4³⁻, it's ~6.2x10^-7 M. But given that the problem provides all three Ka values, maybe we need to consider the exact concentration considering the equilibria. 

Wait, but when you have a solution containing both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species: [H3PO4] + [H2PO4⁻] + [HPO4²⁻] + [PO4³⁻]. However, in this case, we added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and the solution will have some H3PO4 and PO4³⁻ due to dissociation, but their concentrations are negligible. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is approximately [H2PO4⁻] + [HPO4²⁻] = 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M ≈ 0.0648 M. Considering significant figures, as we discussed, it's 0.0650 M. 

But let's check with the exact calculation. 

Total phosphate concentration = (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O) / volume

= (1.00/136.09 + 1.00/177.99) / 0.20000

Calculate each term:

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol (approximately)

1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (approximately)

Sum: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol

Divide by 0.20000 L: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But since the third significant figure is 4, and the next digit is 8, which is more than 5, we round up: 0.0648 → 0.065. Wait, 0.06483 is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, 0.06483 has four sig figs. Wait, no. 0.06483 is 6.483 x10^-2, which is four sig figs. But we need to round to three. So 6.48 x10^-2 = 0.0648. But the original data for KH2PO4 was three sig figs, leading to total moles of 0.01297 (rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130). Then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650. 

This is conflicting. The exact calculation gives 0.06483, which is approximately 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But considering the significant figures from the original data, it's 0.0650 M. This discrepancy arises from the rounding steps. 

However, in analytical chemistry, when mixing two salts, the total concentration is simply the sum of the concentrations from each salt, assuming they don't react. But in reality, they do form a buffer, but the total phosphate concentration remains the sum. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M. Given the options, probably 0.0648 M is more precise, but the problem might expect three significant figures, so 0.065 M. 

But let's check the exact values:

1.00 g KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol

Total moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol

Volume: 0.20000 L

Concentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But 0.06483 is closer to 0.0648 than 0.0649. However, the fourth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we keep the third digit as is. Therefore, 0.0648 M. But the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is five sig figs, and the masses as 1.00 g, three sig figs. The molar masses are given with more sig figs. Therefore, the limiting factor is the mass measurements. So the moles of each salt have three and four sig figs, respectively. When summed, the total moles have three sig figs (from the KH2PO4). Therefore, total moles = 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 ≈ 0.0130 mol (three sig figs). Then concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). 

Therefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. But the way, in the problem statement, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L, so five sig figs. The masses are 1.00 g, three sig figs. The molar masses are four and five sig figs. Therefore, the moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol, which should be rounded to 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (four sig figs). Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 mol. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0130 mol. Concentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. 

Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0650 M. However, considering that "orthophosphate" might specifically refer to PO4³⁻, but as we calculated earlier, that's negligible. Therefore, the answer is the total phosphate concentration, which is 0.0650 M. 

But let me check one more time. If the problem had wanted the concentration of PO4³⁻, it would have specified, and given the very low concentration, it's unlikely. Therefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. 

But in the initial calculation, summing the two concentrations gives 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M, which is 0.06485, rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But according to significant figure rules, since the moles of KH2PO4 are three sig figs and Na2HPO4·2H2O are four, the total moles should be three sig figs. Therefore, 0.00735 + 0.005618 = 0.012968 → 0.0130 mol. Then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. 

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.0650 M. 

But let me check with exact calculation without rounding intermediate steps. 

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073480654 mol

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056182931 mol

Total moles: 0.0073480654 + 0.0056182931 = 0.0129663585 mol

Concentration: 0.0129663585 / 0.20000 = 0.0648317925 M

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. 

But wait, the total moles are 0.0129663585 mol, which is 0.012966 mol. If we consider the significant figures, the moles of KH2PO4 are 0.00735 (three sig figs), and Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005618 (four sig figs). When adding, the result should be rounded to the least precise, which is the thousandths place (for KH2PO4: 0.00735 is 0.00735, thousandths place is the third decimal). So:

0.00735 (exact to the 5th decimal)

+0.005618 (exact to the 6th decimal)

=0.012968

But since the KH2PO4 is only known to the 5th decimal (0.00735), the sum should be rounded to the 5th decimal place. 0.012968 rounded to the 5th decimal is 0.01297. Then, 0.01297 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0649 M. 

This is getting too convoluted. The key takeaway is that depending on how you handle the significant figures, the answer could be 0.0648, 0.0649, or 0.0650 M. However, given the problem's data, the most appropriate answer considering significant figures is 0.0648 M. But in many textbooks, when mixing solutions, the total concentration is simply the sum, and they might expect 0.0648 M. However, given that the problem provides Ka values, maybe we need to consider the buffer equilibrium. 

Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If we consider that in solution, some of the H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ will interconvert, but the total phosphate concentration remains the same. Therefore, the answer is still the sum of their concentrations. Therefore, 0.0648 M. 

Alternatively, if the problem is considering that orthophosphate is only PO4³⁻, then the answer is 6.2x10^-7 M. But that seems unlikely. 

Given the information, I think the answer is 0.0648 M, which is approximately 0.065 M. But to adhere strictly to significant figures, it's 0.0648 M. However, different sources might round differently. 

In conclusion, after considering all factors, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 0.065 M, considering significant figures and the total phosphate concentration from both salts.

So total molar mass is 2*22.99 + 97.99 + 36.03 = 22.99*2 = 45.98 + 97.99 = 143.97 + 36.03 = 180.00 g/mol. Wait, the problem states the molar mass as 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nHPO₄²⁻: H (1.01) + P (30.97) + 4 O (16.00*4=64.00) → 1.01 + 30.97 + 64.00 = 95.98 g/mol. Then Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 2 Na (22.99*2=45.98) + HPO₄²⁻ (95.98) + 2 H₂O (2*(18.015)=36.03). So total is 45.98 + 95.98 + 36.03 = 45.98 + 95.98 = 141.96 + 36.03 = 178.0 g/mol. The problem states 177.99, which is close enough, probably due to more precise atomic masses. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00562 moles.\n\nSo total phosphate from KH₂PO₄ is 0.00735 mol (as H₂PO₄⁻) and from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 0.00562 mol (as HPO₄²⁻). The total amount of phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻) is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. The total volume is 0.2 L, so the total concentration is 0.01297 mol / 0.2 L = 0.06485 M. But wait, if the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is the sum of all phosphate species, then this would be the answer. However, if it\'s specifically PO₄³⁻, then we need to calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻ considering the equilibrium between HPO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻.\n\nBut given that the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ → PO₄³⁻ + H⁺) has a very small Ka3 (1.8×10⁻¹²), the amount of PO₄³⁻ would be negligible. Let me check that.\n\nThe pH of the solution will affect the ratio of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Since we have a mixture of these two, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is pKa2, which is 6.2×10⁻⁸, so pKa2 ≈ 7.21.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO₄²⁻ and the acid is H₂PO₄⁻. The ratio of their concentrations is [HPO₄²⁻]/[H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.00562 / 0.00735 ≈ 0.765. So pH ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09.\n\nAt this pH, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ can be calculated using the third dissociation: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ PO₄³⁻ + H⁺, with Ka3 = 1.8×10⁻¹². The concentration of H⁺ at pH 7.09 is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.13×10⁻⁸ M.\n\nUsing the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [PO₄³⁻][H⁺] / [HPO₄²⁻]. Rearranging, [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺] = (1.8×10⁻¹² * 0.00562/0.2) / (8.13×10⁻⁸). Let\'s compute that.\n\nFirst, [HPO₄²⁻] is 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M. Then:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M. That\'s 6.22×10⁻⁷ M, which is indeed very small compared to the total phosphate concentration. So the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is negligible.\n\nTherefore, if the question is asking for the total concentration of all orthophosphate species (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻ + PO₄³⁻), then it\'s approximately 0.06485 M, which is 0.06485 M. But since PO₄³⁻ is negligible, it\'s effectively 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol in 0.2 L, which is 0.06485 M. Rounded to appropriate significant figures: the given masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, so the moles would be three sig figs each. So 0.00735 is three sig figs (7.35×10⁻³), 0.00562 is three sig figs (5.62×10⁻³). Sum is 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol, but when adding, the decimal places are determined by the least precise. Both are to the fifth decimal (0.00735 and 0.00562), so sum is 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.2 L (two sig figs?), but 200.00 cm³ is five sig figs (0.20000 L). Wait, the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L, so five sig figs. The masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs each). So the moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (approx, three sig figs). So sum is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06485 M. So three sig figs would be 0.0648 M, but since the original masses are three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. Wait, 0.00735 is three sig figs (7.35e-3), 0.00562 is three sig figs (5.62e-3). Sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs, but when adding, the number of decimal places is the smallest. Let me check: 0.00735 has five decimal places (if written as 0.00735), and 0.00562 has five decimal places (0.00562). Wait, but actually, 0.00735 is three decimal places (if written as 0.00735, but that\'s three significant figures). Wait, no. The number of significant figures is determined by the leading zeros not counting. So 0.00735 is three sig figs, 0.00562 is three sig figs. When adding, the result\'s precision is to the least decimal place. Let\'s write them as:\n\n0.00735 (three decimal places to the thousandth place)\n0.00562 (three decimal places to the thousandth place)\nSum: 0.01297 (five decimal places, but since both addends are precise to the thousandth, the sum should be 0.0130 when rounded to the thousandth place? Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. If we consider that 0.00735 is ±0.000005 and 0.00562 is ±0.000005, then the sum is 0.01297 ±0.00001. So when expressed to three decimal places, it\'s 0.0130. But in terms of significant figures, the sum is 0.01297, which is 1.297e-2, so three sig figs would be 1.30e-2 (0.0130). Wait, but maybe not. Let me think. If the original numbers are 0.00735 (three sig figs) and 0.00562 (three sig figs), then when adding, the result should be reported to the same decimal place as the least precise measurement. Both are to the fifth decimal? Wait, 0.00735 is written as 0.00735 (three decimal places?), but actually, the decimal places are three (7.35 x10^-3). Similarly, 0.00562 is three decimal places. So when adding, the result should be reported to three decimal places. So 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which would be 0.0130 when rounded to three decimal places. Therefore, the total moles are 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. So three sig figs: 0.0650 M. Wait, but 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.2 is 0.065. But 0.20000 is 0.2, but with more sig figs. So 0.0130 (three sig figs) divided by 0.20000 (five sig figs) is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Wait, no. The number of sig figs in the result is determined by the least number of sig figs in the inputs. The moles are 0.0130 (three sig figs), volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So the concentration would be 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M, which has three sig figs. So the answer would be 0.0650 M. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol, divided by 0.2 L gives 0.06485 M, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But this depends on how the addition is treated. If the original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), then the moles for each are:\n\nKH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (but since 1.00 has three sig figs, this is 0.00562 mol, three sig figs)\nSum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (but since each has three sig figs, the sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs? Wait, when adding, the number of decimal places is the same as the term with the least decimal places. If 0.00735 is three decimal places (but actually, it\'s three sig figs, not decimal places), and 0.00562 is three decimal places (also three sig figs). Wait, maybe I\'m confusing decimal places with sig figs. Let\'s think in terms of absolute uncertainty. If the moles of KH₂PO₄ are 0.00735 mol with an uncertainty of ±0.00001 (since it\'s three sig figs), and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 0.00562 mol ±0.00001, then the sum is 0.01297 ±0.00002. So the sum is 0.01297 with an uncertainty in the fifth decimal. Therefore, when considering significant figures, the sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs. Wait, but the original values have three sig figs each. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. But in this case, both have three decimal places (if written as 0.00735 and 0.00562). Wait, 0.00735 is to the fifth decimal (0.00735), but in terms of significant figures, the leading zeros don\'t count, so it\'s three sig figs starting at the 7. Similarly, 0.00562 is three sig figs. So when adding, the result should be expressed with the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But both have three decimal places (if written as 0.00735 and 0.00562). Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places (0.007), but with an extra two digits? No, 0.00735 is three decimal places: 0.007 (thousandth place) plus 35 in the ten-thousandth and hundred-thousandth. Wait, no. The number of decimal places is the number of digits after the decimal point. So 0.00735 has five decimal places? Wait, no. Let\'s count:\n\n0.00735: after the decimal, it\'s 00735, which is five digits. But leading zeros after the decimal don\'t count towards decimal places in terms of precision. Wait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. Let\'s use the rule: when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. If both numbers are given to the thousandth place (three decimal places), then the sum should be to the thousandth place. But 0.00735 is 0.007 (three decimal places) plus 0.00035, so it\'s more precise. Similarly, 0.00562 is 0.005 (three decimal places) plus 0.00062. So when adding, the result should be rounded to the thousandth place. So 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which would be rounded to 0.0130 (three decimal places). Therefore, the sum is 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five decimal places), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). So the answer is 0.0650 M.\n\nBut let me check again. If the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (five sig figs), and the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs each), then the moles of each compound are:\n\nKH₂PO₄: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs, but since each term has three, maybe we keep three sig figs: 0.0130 mol)\nConcentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the total concentration of orthophosphate ions (sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻) is 0.0650 M. Since PO₄³⁻ is negligible, this is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem considers "orthophosphate ions" as PO₄³⁻, then the answer would be approximately 6.2×10⁻⁷ M, but that seems unlikely given the context. The term "orthophosphate" in many contexts refers to the sum of all phosphate species, but sometimes it\'s used to mean PO₄³⁻. However, given the presence of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, and the very low concentration of PO₄³⁻, it\'s more reasonable to assume the total phosphate concentration is required.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M, which rounds to 0.0650 M when considering significant figures properly. Wait, but 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06485 M. Rounded to three significant figures, that\'s 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.06485 is four sig figs. If we have three sig figs in the moles (0.0130) and five in the volume, then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)\nMoles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)\nTotal moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (this is 0.01297, which is four sig figs, but since each component has three, the sum should be three sig figs: 0.0130 mol)\nVolume: 0.20000 L (five sig figs)\nConcentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)\n\nYes, because when adding, the sum of 0.00735 and 0.00562 is 0.01297, but with three sig figs, it\'s 0.0130. Then dividing by 0.20000 gives 0.0650 M. So the answer is 0.0650 M.\n\nBut let me check another approach. If we don\'t round the moles until the end:\n\nKH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol (exact value)\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (exact value)\nTotal moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol\nVolume: 0.20000 L\nConcentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M\nRounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M\n\nBut this contradicts the previous method. The discrepancy arises from when to round. According to significant figure rules, we should round at each step. So:\n\nKH₂PO₄ moles: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 (three sig figs)\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O moles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00562 (three sig figs)\nSum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 (round to three sig figs: 0.0130)\nConcentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)\n\nAlternatively, if we carry more decimal places through the calculation and round at the end:\n\nKH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 ≈ 0.00735 mol\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 ≈ 0.00562 mol\nTotal moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol\nConcentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M ≈ 0.0648 M (three sig figs)\n\nBut here, the sum is 0.012966, which is approximately 0.01297, and when divided by 0.20000 gives 0.06483, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). However, the initial moles were rounded to three sig figs, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the rounded values and proceed.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given that the problem provides masses with three sig figs and volume with five, the most precise answer would be 0.0648 M (using the unrounded sum), but adhering strictly to sig fig rules, it\'s 0.0650 M. However, I think the more accurate approach is to carry the exact moles through the calculation and round at the end. Let\'s do that:\n\nExact moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348065 mol\nExact moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618293 mol\nTotal moles: 0.007348065 + 0.005618293 = 0.012966358 mol\nConcentration: 0.012966358 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06483179 M\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But wait, 0.06483179 is 0.06483, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, 0.0648 has three sig figs (6, 4, 8). Yes, because the leading zeros are not counted. So 0.0648 M is three sig figs. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because different approaches give slightly different results. However, considering that the original data (masses) have three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. The exact calculation gives approximately 0.06483, which rounds to 0.0648. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M.\n\nBut wait, the problem might expect the answer in millimolar or another unit, but the question just asks for concentration. Also, the possible confusion between total phosphate and PO₄³⁻. But as established earlier, PO₄³⁻ is negligible, so the answer is the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which is approximately 0.0648 M.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 0.0648 M, which should be written as 0.0648 M, but considering significant figures properly, it\'s 0.0648 M. However, let me check once more.\n\nIf the problem states 1.00 g of each compound (three sig figs), and the molar masses are given with more sig figs (136.09 and 177.99, which are five and five sig figs), then the moles are calculated as:\n\nKH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol → 0.00735 (three sig figs)\nNa₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol → 0.00562 (three sig figs)\nSum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs, but since each term is three, the sum should be three: 0.0130)\nConcentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)\n\nAlternatively, if we keep more decimals during calculation:\n\n0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol\n0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M → 0.0648 M (three sig figs)\n\nThis inconsistency arises from when to round. In real lab settings, we\'d carry more decimals and round at the end. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 0.0648 M. However, some might argue for 0.065 M due to sig fig rules. But given the exact calculation gives 0.06483, which is 0.0648 to three sig figs, I think 0.0648 M is correct.\n\nBut wait, 0.06483 rounds to 0.0648 when keeping four sig figs, but to three sig figs, it\'s 0.0648. Because the fourth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so it stays 0.0648.\n\nYes, so 0.0648 M is correct with three sig figs.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 0.0648 M.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446887, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5953, prompt_tokens=631, total_tokens=6584, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first calculate the moles of each phosphate-containing compound:

1. **KH₂PO₄** (Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol):  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00735 \, \text{mol} \) (three significant figures).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O** (Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol):  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00562 \, \text{mol} \) (three significant figures).

**Total moles of phosphate species** (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻):  
\( 0.00735 \, \text{mol} + 0.00562 \, \text{mol} = 0.01297 \, \text{mol} \).

The solution volume is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.20000 \, \text{L} \). The total concentration of orthophosphate ions (sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻) is:  
\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{0.01297 \, \text{mol}}{0.20000 \, \text{L}} = 0.0648 \, \text{M}.
\]

The contribution of PO₄³⁻ is negligible due to the very small \( K_{a3} \) (\( 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)), confirming that the total phosphate concentration is dominated by H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.

**Final Answer:**  
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is \(\boxed{0.0648 \, \text{M}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

let's see, Na is 22.99, HPO₄²⁻ is (1.01 + 30.97 + 4*16.00) = 97.99 g/mol, plus 2 H₂O (2*(18.015)) = 36.03. So total molar mass is 2*22.99 + 97.99 + 36.03 = 22.99*2 = 45.98 + 97.99 = 143.97 + 36.03 = 180.00 g/mol. Wait, the problem states the molar mass as 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.

HPO₄²⁻: H (1.01) + P (30.97) + 4 O (16.00*4=64.00) → 1.01 + 30.97 + 64.00 = 95.98 g/mol. Then Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 2 Na (22.99*2=45.98) + HPO₄²⁻ (95.98) + 2 H₂O (2*(18.015)=36.03). So total is 45.98 + 95.98 + 36.03 = 45.98 + 95.98 = 141.96 + 36.03 = 178.0 g/mol. The problem states 177.99, which is close enough, probably due to more precise atomic masses. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00562 moles.

So total phosphate from KH₂PO₄ is 0.00735 mol (as H₂PO₄⁻) and from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 0.00562 mol (as HPO₄²⁻). The total amount of phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻) is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. The total volume is 0.2 L, so the total concentration is 0.01297 mol / 0.2 L = 0.06485 M. But wait, if the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is the sum of all phosphate species, then this would be the answer. However, if it's specifically PO₄³⁻, then we need to calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻ considering the equilibrium between HPO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻.

But given that the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ → PO₄³⁻ + H⁺) has a very small Ka3 (1.8×10⁻¹²), the amount of PO₄³⁻ would be negligible. Let me check that.

The pH of the solution will affect the ratio of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Since we have a mixture of these two, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is pKa2, which is 6.2×10⁻⁸, so pKa2 ≈ 7.21.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO₄²⁻ and the acid is H₂PO₄⁻. The ratio of their concentrations is [HPO₄²⁻]/[H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.00562 / 0.00735 ≈ 0.765. So pH ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09.

At this pH, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ can be calculated using the third dissociation: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ PO₄³⁻ + H⁺, with Ka3 = 1.8×10⁻¹². The concentration of H⁺ at pH 7.09 is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.13×10⁻⁸ M.

Using the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [PO₄³⁻][H⁺] / [HPO₄²⁻]. Rearranging, [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺] = (1.8×10⁻¹² * 0.00562/0.2) / (8.13×10⁻⁸). Let's compute that.

First, [HPO₄²⁻] is 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M. Then:

[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8 ≈ (5.06e-14) / 8.13e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M. That's 6.22×10⁻⁷ M, which is indeed very small compared to the total phosphate concentration. So the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is negligible.

Therefore, if the question is asking for the total concentration of all orthophosphate species (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻ + PO₄³⁻), then it's approximately 0.06485 M, which is 0.06485 M. But since PO₄³⁻ is negligible, it's effectively 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol in 0.2 L, which is 0.06485 M. Rounded to appropriate significant figures: the given masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, so the moles would be three sig figs each. So 0.00735 is three sig figs (7.35×10⁻³), 0.00562 is three sig figs (5.62×10⁻³). Sum is 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol, but when adding, the decimal places are determined by the least precise. Both are to the fifth decimal (0.00735 and 0.00562), so sum is 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.2 L (two sig figs?), but 200.00 cm³ is five sig figs (0.20000 L). Wait, the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L, so five sig figs. The masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs each). So the moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs). Similarly, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (approx, three sig figs). So sum is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06485 M. So three sig figs would be 0.0648 M, but since the original masses are three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. Wait, 0.00735 is three sig figs (7.35e-3), 0.00562 is three sig figs (5.62e-3). Sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs, but when adding, the number of decimal places is the smallest. Let me check: 0.00735 has five decimal places (if written as 0.00735), and 0.00562 has five decimal places (0.00562). Wait, but actually, 0.00735 is three decimal places (if written as 0.00735, but that's three significant figures). Wait, no. The number of significant figures is determined by the leading zeros not counting. So 0.00735 is three sig figs, 0.00562 is three sig figs. When adding, the result's precision is to the least decimal place. Let's write them as:

0.00735 (three decimal places to the thousandth place)
0.00562 (three decimal places to the thousandth place)
Sum: 0.01297 (five decimal places, but since both addends are precise to the thousandth, the sum should be 0.0130 when rounded to the thousandth place? Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. If we consider that 0.00735 is ±0.000005 and 0.00562 is ±0.000005, then the sum is 0.01297 ±0.00001. So when expressed to three decimal places, it's 0.0130. But in terms of significant figures, the sum is 0.01297, which is 1.297e-2, so three sig figs would be 1.30e-2 (0.0130). Wait, but maybe not. Let me think. If the original numbers are 0.00735 (three sig figs) and 0.00562 (three sig figs), then when adding, the result should be reported to the same decimal place as the least precise measurement. Both are to the fifth decimal? Wait, 0.00735 is written as 0.00735 (three decimal places?), but actually, the decimal places are three (7.35 x10^-3). Similarly, 0.00562 is three decimal places. So when adding, the result should be reported to three decimal places. So 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which would be 0.0130 when rounded to three decimal places. Therefore, the total moles are 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five sig figs), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. So three sig figs: 0.0650 M. Wait, but 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.065. Wait, 0.0130 divided by 0.2 is 0.065. But 0.20000 is 0.2, but with more sig figs. So 0.0130 (three sig figs) divided by 0.20000 (five sig figs) is 0.0650 M (three sig figs). Wait, no. The number of sig figs in the result is determined by the least number of sig figs in the inputs. The moles are 0.0130 (three sig figs), volume is 0.20000 L (five sig figs). So the concentration would be 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M, which has three sig figs. So the answer would be 0.0650 M. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which is 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol, divided by 0.2 L gives 0.06485 M, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). But this depends on how the addition is treated. If the original masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), then the moles for each are:

KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (but since 1.00 has three sig figs, this is 0.00562 mol, three sig figs)
Sum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (but since each has three sig figs, the sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs? Wait, when adding, the number of decimal places is the same as the term with the least decimal places. If 0.00735 is three decimal places (but actually, it's three sig figs, not decimal places), and 0.00562 is three decimal places (also three sig figs). Wait, maybe I'm confusing decimal places with sig figs. Let's think in terms of absolute uncertainty. If the moles of KH₂PO₄ are 0.00735 mol with an uncertainty of ±0.00001 (since it's three sig figs), and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 0.00562 mol ±0.00001, then the sum is 0.01297 ±0.00002. So the sum is 0.01297 with an uncertainty in the fifth decimal. Therefore, when considering significant figures, the sum is 0.01297, which is four sig figs. Wait, but the original values have three sig figs each. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that when adding, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. But in this case, both have three decimal places (if written as 0.00735 and 0.00562). Wait, 0.00735 is to the fifth decimal (0.00735), but in terms of significant figures, the leading zeros don't count, so it's three sig figs starting at the 7. Similarly, 0.00562 is three sig figs. So when adding, the result should be expressed with the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But both have three decimal places (if written as 0.00735 and 0.00562). Wait, 0.00735 is three decimal places (0.007), but with an extra two digits? No, 0.00735 is three decimal places: 0.007 (thousandth place) plus 35 in the ten-thousandth and hundred-thousandth. Wait, no. The number of decimal places is the number of digits after the decimal point. So 0.00735 has five decimal places? Wait, no. Let's count:

0.00735: after the decimal, it's 00735, which is five digits. But leading zeros after the decimal don't count towards decimal places in terms of precision. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's use the rule: when adding or subtracting, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. If both numbers are given to the thousandth place (three decimal places), then the sum should be to the thousandth place. But 0.00735 is 0.007 (three decimal places) plus 0.00035, so it's more precise. Similarly, 0.00562 is 0.005 (three decimal places) plus 0.00062. So when adding, the result should be rounded to the thousandth place. So 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which would be rounded to 0.0130 (three decimal places). Therefore, the sum is 0.0130 mol. Then, divided by 0.20000 L (five decimal places), the concentration is 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs). So the answer is 0.0650 M.

But let me check again. If the problem states the volume as 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L (five sig figs), and the masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs each), then the moles of each compound are:

KH₂PO₄: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)
Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs, but since each term has three, maybe we keep three sig figs: 0.0130 mol)
Concentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)

Yes, that makes sense. So the total concentration of orthophosphate ions (sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻) is 0.0650 M. Since PO₄³⁻ is negligible, this is the answer.

Alternatively, if the problem considers "orthophosphate ions" as PO₄³⁻, then the answer would be approximately 6.2×10⁻⁷ M, but that seems unlikely given the context. The term "orthophosphate" in many contexts refers to the sum of all phosphate species, but sometimes it's used to mean PO₄³⁻. However, given the presence of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, and the very low concentration of PO₄³⁻, it's more reasonable to assume the total phosphate concentration is required.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.0648 M, which rounds to 0.0650 M when considering significant figures properly. Wait, but 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297, which is 0.01297 mol. Divided by 0.20000 L gives 0.06485 M. Rounded to three significant figures, that's 0.0648 M. Wait, but 0.06485 is four sig figs. If we have three sig figs in the moles (0.0130) and five in the volume, then 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me clarify:

The moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol (three sig figs)
Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol (three sig figs)
Total moles: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (this is 0.01297, which is four sig figs, but since each component has three, the sum should be three sig figs: 0.0130 mol)
Volume: 0.20000 L (five sig figs)
Concentration: 0.0130 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)

Yes, because when adding, the sum of 0.00735 and 0.00562 is 0.01297, but with three sig figs, it's 0.0130. Then dividing by 0.20000 gives 0.0650 M. So the answer is 0.0650 M.

But let me check another approach. If we don't round the moles until the end:

KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol (exact value)
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol (exact value)
Total moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol
Volume: 0.20000 L
Concentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M
Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M

But this contradicts the previous method. The discrepancy arises from when to round. According to significant figure rules, we should round at each step. So:

KH₂PO₄ moles: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00735 (three sig figs)
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O moles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00562 (three sig figs)
Sum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 (round to three sig figs: 0.0130)
Concentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)

Alternatively, if we carry more decimal places through the calculation and round at the end:

KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 ≈ 0.00735 mol
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 ≈ 0.00562 mol
Total moles: 0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol
Concentration: 0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M ≈ 0.0648 M (three sig figs)

But here, the sum is 0.012966, which is approximately 0.01297, and when divided by 0.20000 gives 0.06483, which rounds to 0.0648 M (three sig figs). However, the initial moles were rounded to three sig figs, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the rounded values and proceed.

This is a bit ambiguous, but given that the problem provides masses with three sig figs and volume with five, the most precise answer would be 0.0648 M (using the unrounded sum), but adhering strictly to sig fig rules, it's 0.0650 M. However, I think the more accurate approach is to carry the exact moles through the calculation and round at the end. Let's do that:

Exact moles of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348065 mol
Exact moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618293 mol
Total moles: 0.007348065 + 0.005618293 = 0.012966358 mol
Concentration: 0.012966358 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06483179 M

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. But wait, 0.06483179 is 0.06483, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places, but in terms of significant figures, 0.0648 has three sig figs (6, 4, 8). Yes, because the leading zeros are not counted. So 0.0648 M is three sig figs. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M.

But I'm a bit confused because different approaches give slightly different results. However, considering that the original data (masses) have three sig figs, the answer should be three sig figs. The exact calculation gives approximately 0.06483, which rounds to 0.0648. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M.

But wait, the problem might expect the answer in millimolar or another unit, but the question just asks for concentration. Also, the possible confusion between total phosphate and PO₄³⁻. But as established earlier, PO₄³⁻ is negligible, so the answer is the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which is approximately 0.0648 M.

Therefore, the final answer is 0.0648 M, which should be written as 0.0648 M, but considering significant figures properly, it's 0.0648 M. However, let me check once more.

If the problem states 1.00 g of each compound (three sig figs), and the molar masses are given with more sig figs (136.09 and 177.99, which are five and five sig figs), then the moles are calculated as:

KH₂PO₄: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol → 0.00735 (three sig figs)
Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005618 mol → 0.00562 (three sig figs)
Sum: 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297 mol (four sig figs, but since each term is three, the sum should be three: 0.0130)
Concentration: 0.0130 / 0.20000 = 0.0650 M (three sig figs)

Alternatively, if we keep more decimals during calculation:

0.007348 + 0.005618 = 0.012966 mol
0.012966 / 0.20000 = 0.06483 M → 0.0648 M (three sig figs)

This inconsistency arises from when to round. In real lab settings, we'd carry more decimals and round at the end. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 0.0648 M. However, some might argue for 0.065 M due to sig fig rules. But given the exact calculation gives 0.06483, which is 0.0648 to three sig figs, I think 0.0648 M is correct.

But wait, 0.06483 rounds to 0.0648 when keeping four sig figs, but to three sig figs, it's 0.0648. Because the fourth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so it stays 0.0648.

Yes, so 0.0648 M is correct with three sig figs.

Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 0.0648 M.

But if it\'s about PO₄³⁻, then we need to calculate the concentration using the third dissociation.\n\nBut given that the solution is a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-8 (pKa2 ≈ 7.21). The pH would be around pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]) = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.03675) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09.\n\nAt pH ~7.09, the dominant species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The third dissociation (HPO4²⁻ → PO4³⁻ + H+) has a very small Ka3 (1.8x10^-12), so the concentration of PO4³⁻ would be negligible. Let\'s compute it for thoroughness.\n\nUsing the third dissociation: Ka3 = [PO4³⁻][H+]/[HPO4²⁻]\n\nAt pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13x10^-8 M\n\nSo, [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ (5.06x10^-14) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ 6.22x10^-7 M\n\nThat\'s 6.22e-7 M, which is indeed negligible compared to the other concentrations. Therefore, if the question is about PO4³⁻, the answer is approximately 6.2x10^-7 M. However, if it\'s about total orthophosphate (sum of all species), then it\'s 0.03675 + 0.0281 + negligible ≈ 0.06485 M. But the problem states "orthophosphate ions," which can be ambiguous. However, in water analysis, orthophosphate usually refers to the dissolved phosphate ions, which are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ (and PO4³⁻, but negligible here). But sometimes, it\'s considered as the sum of all. Alternatively, in some contexts, orthophosphate is the sum of H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. So, perhaps the answer is the sum of all three, but given that PO4³⁻ is negligible, it\'s approximately 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But let\'s check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says "concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution." Orthophosphate is the simplest form of phosphate, the PO4³− ion, but in aqueous solution, it exists in different protonation states. So, the total concentration of orthophosphate would be the sum of all species: H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. However, in the given solution, we have added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The H3PO4 and PO4³⁻ concentrations are negligible. H3PO4 is a weak acid, but since we have a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the pH is around 7.09, which is between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, pKa1 is around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 ≈ -log(7.5e-3) ≈ 2.12), pKa2 is 7.21, and pKa3 is 11.74 (from 1.8e-12). So, at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.21), the dominant species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The concentration of H3PO4 would be negligible because the pH is above pKa1. Similarly, PO4³− is negligible because pH is way below pKa3. Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration is the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which is 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three significant figures, since the given masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The least number of sig figs in the calculation is three (from 1.00 g), so the answer should be 0.0648 M, which is 0.0648 M. But let\'s check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 1.00 g KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073503 mol. 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056183 mol. Total volume 0.20000 L. So, concentrations:\n\nKH2PO4: 0.0073503 / 0.20000 = 0.0367515 M\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.0056183 / 0.20000 = 0.0280915 M\n\nTotal phosphate: 0.0367515 + 0.0280915 = 0.064843 M. Rounded to three significant figures, that\'s 0.0648 M. But 1.00 g is three sig figs, volume 200.00 cm³ is five, molar masses are four and five. The moles would be 0.00735 (three sig figs) and 0.00562 (three sig figs). So, 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675 (three sig figs: 0.0368), 0.00562 / 0.20000 = 0.0281 (three sig figs). Then total is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. Wait, but the original moles: 1.00 / 136.09 is 0.0073503, which is approximately 0.00735 (three sig figs). Similarly, 1.00 / 177.99 is 0.0056183, which is 0.00562 (three sig figs). So, when divided by 0.20000 L, which is five sig figs, the concentrations are 0.03675 (four sig figs) and 0.02809 (four sig figs). But since the original masses are three sig figs, the concentrations should be limited to three sig figs. So, 0.0368 M and 0.0281 M. Sum is 0.0649 M. But 0.03675 + 0.02809 is 0.06484, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. Wait, but 0.03675 is 0.0368 (three sig figs), 0.02809 is 0.0281 (three sig figs). Adding them: 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649. But actually, when adding, the number of decimal places is considered. If we take 0.03675 (which is 0.0368 to three sig figs) and 0.02809 (0.0281 to three sig figs), adding them as 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649. But if we use the exact values before rounding, 0.0367515 + 0.0280915 = 0.064843, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. Hmm, conflicting. The original data: 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses: 136.09 (five sig figs) and 177.99 (five sig figs). So, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073503 mol (three sig figs: 0.00735 mol). Similarly, Na2HPO4: 0.0056183 mol (three sig figs: 0.00562 mol). Then concentrations: 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675 M (but since moles are three sig figs, 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675, but 0.00735 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five, so the result is 0.03675, which is four sig figs. Wait, no. The rule is that in multiplication/division, the number of sig figs is the least number of sig figs in the inputs. Here, 1.00 (three) / 136.09 (five) = 0.0073503, which should be three sig figs: 0.00735. Then, 0.00735 / 0.20000. 0.00735 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. So, the result is 0.03675, but with three sig figs: 0.0368. Similarly, 0.00562 / 0.20000 = 0.0281. So, total is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. But 0.0649 has three sig figs. However, if we consider that the sum of 0.03675 and 0.02809 is 0.06484, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. But since the individual concentrations are 0.0368 and 0.0281 (each three sig figs), the sum is 0.0649. But this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects to sum the exact concentrations and present with three decimal places, but given the data, three sig figs is appropriate. So, 0.0648 M or 0.0649 M? Let\'s check the exact calculation:\n\n0.0073503 + 0.0056183 = 0.0129686 mol in 0.2 L. So, 0.0129686 / 0.2 = 0.064843 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M. Because 0.064843 is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. But wait, sig figs: 0.064843 has five sig figs. But the original data (1.00 g) gives three sig figs. So, the total moles is 0.0129686, which is 0.012969 (five sig figs), but since the original masses are three sig figs, the total moles should be considered as 0.01297 (three sig figs after the decimal, but actually, when adding 0.00735 (three) and 0.00562 (three), the sum is 0.01297, which is three decimal places but four sig figs. Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. So, 0.01297 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0649 M. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But perhaps the answer is 0.0648 M. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum of the two concentrations, each calculated with their exact molar masses, then summed. Let\'s do precise calculation:\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.0073503 mol.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.0056183 mol.\n\nTotal moles of phosphate: 0.0073503 + 0.0056183 = 0.0129686 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.0129686 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.064843 M.\n\nRounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. Because the first three digits are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. Hence, 0.0648 M. But 0.064843 is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. However, sometimes, trailing zeros can complicate. Wait, 0.064843 has five significant figures. To three, it\'s 0.0648 (as the fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5). So, 0.0648 M. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. But let\'s check if the problem expects considering the actual species present. If the question is about the total phosphate concentration, regardless of protonation state, then 0.0648 M is correct. However, if it\'s about the concentration of PO4³⁻, then it\'s 6.22e-7 M. But given the problem mentions "orthophosphate ions," which in standard terms refers to the sum of H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. But in practice, PO4³⁻ is negligible here, so the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the calculation of the phosphate concentration considering the buffer equilibrium. Wait, but the total phosphate concentration is just the sum of the two added salts, because each contributes one phosphate ion. Since KH2PO4 gives H2PO4⁻ and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4²⁻, each mole of salt gives one mole of phosphate species. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) / volume. Which is exactly what we calculated. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M, which is 0.0648 M. Converting to scientific notation, that\'s 6.48x10^-2 M. But the problem might expect three significant figures, so 6.48x10^-2 M. Alternatively, 0.0648 M. Either is acceptable, but since the answer is boxed, likely 0.0648 M. However, let me check if there\'s another approach. Suppose the problem is a trick question where they expect you to realize that orthophosphate is PO4³⁻, so you need to calculate its concentration. But as we saw, it\'s about 6.2e-7 M, which is negligible. But given the problem provides all three Ka values, maybe they expect considering the speciation. Wait, but the salts are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are known. The total phosphate is the sum, but if considering the actual species in solution, some of the H2PO4^- might deprotonate to HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- might protonate to H2PO4^-. However, since both are present in solution, the pH is determined by their ratio, but the total phosphate concentration remains the sum. Because the dissociation of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- would convert one into the other, but since both are already present, the buffer system will adjust the ratio, but the total phosphate concentration (sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) remains constant. Therefore, the total concentration is indeed 0.0648 M, regardless of the pH. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. Hence, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \\boxed{0.0648\\ \\text{M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447164, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4065, prompt_tokens=846, total_tokens=4911, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we start by calculating the moles of each phosphate salt present:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of KH₂PO₄} = 136.09 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.0073503 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = 177.99 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.0056183 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Total moles of phosphate ions**:
   \[
   \text{Total moles} = 0.0073503 \, \text{mol} + 0.0056183 \, \text{mol} = 0.0129686 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Concentration of phosphate ions**:
   \[
   \text{Volume of solution} = 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.20000 \, \text{L}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Concentration} = \frac{0.0129686 \, \text{mol}}{0.20000 \, \text{L}} = 0.064843 \, \text{M}
   \]

Considering the significant figures from the given data (1.00 g, which has three significant figures), the concentration is rounded to three significant figures:

\[
\boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}
\]

This concentration represents the total orthophosphate ions (H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, as the contribution from PO₄³⁻ is negligible due to the very small third dissociation constant (Ka3).

The molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol equals 0.00562 moles.

Total volume is 0.2 L. Therefore, concentrations:

[H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M

[HPO₄²⁻] = 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M

If the question is about total phosphate concentration, it's the sum of all phosphate species, which would be 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But if it's about PO₄³⁻, then we need to calculate the concentration using the third dissociation.

But given that the solution is a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-8 (pKa2 ≈ 7.21). The pH would be around pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]) = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.03675) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.09.

At pH ~7.09, the dominant species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The third dissociation (HPO4²⁻ → PO4³⁻ + H+) has a very small Ka3 (1.8x10^-12), so the concentration of PO4³⁻ would be negligible. Let's compute it for thoroughness.

Using the third dissociation: Ka3 = [PO4³⁻][H+]/[HPO4²⁻]

At pH 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.13x10^-8 M

So, [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ (5.06x10^-14) / 8.13x10^-8 ≈ 6.22x10^-7 M

That's 6.22e-7 M, which is indeed negligible compared to the other concentrations. Therefore, if the question is about PO4³⁻, the answer is approximately 6.2x10^-7 M. However, if it's about total orthophosphate (sum of all species), then it's 0.03675 + 0.0281 + negligible ≈ 0.06485 M. But the problem states "orthophosphate ions," which can be ambiguous. However, in water analysis, orthophosphate usually refers to the dissolved phosphate ions, which are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ (and PO4³⁻, but negligible here). But sometimes, it's considered as the sum of all. Alternatively, in some contexts, orthophosphate is the sum of H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. So, perhaps the answer is the sum of all three, but given that PO4³⁻ is negligible, it's approximately 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. But let's check the problem statement again.

The problem says "concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution." Orthophosphate is the simplest form of phosphate, the PO4³− ion, but in aqueous solution, it exists in different protonation states. So, the total concentration of orthophosphate would be the sum of all species: H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. However, in the given solution, we have added H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The H3PO4 and PO4³⁻ concentrations are negligible. H3PO4 is a weak acid, but since we have a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, the pH is around 7.09, which is between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, pKa1 is around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 ≈ -log(7.5e-3) ≈ 2.12), pKa2 is 7.21, and pKa3 is 11.74 (from 1.8e-12). So, at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.21), the dominant species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. The concentration of H3PO4 would be negligible because the pH is above pKa1. Similarly, PO4³− is negligible because pH is way below pKa3. Therefore, the total orthophosphate concentration is the sum of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, which is 0.03675 + 0.0281 = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three significant figures, since the given masses are 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses are four and five sig figs, volume is 200.00 cm³ (five sig figs). The least number of sig figs in the calculation is three (from 1.00 g), so the answer should be 0.0648 M, which is 0.0648 M. But let's check the exact calculation.

Wait, 1.00 g KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073503 mol. 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056183 mol. Total volume 0.20000 L. So, concentrations:

KH2PO4: 0.0073503 / 0.20000 = 0.0367515 M

Na2HPO4: 0.0056183 / 0.20000 = 0.0280915 M

Total phosphate: 0.0367515 + 0.0280915 = 0.064843 M. Rounded to three significant figures, that's 0.0648 M. But 1.00 g is three sig figs, volume 200.00 cm³ is five, molar masses are four and five. The moles would be 0.00735 (three sig figs) and 0.00562 (three sig figs). So, 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675 (three sig figs: 0.0368), 0.00562 / 0.20000 = 0.0281 (three sig figs). Then total is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. Wait, but the original moles: 1.00 / 136.09 is 0.0073503, which is approximately 0.00735 (three sig figs). Similarly, 1.00 / 177.99 is 0.0056183, which is 0.00562 (three sig figs). So, when divided by 0.20000 L, which is five sig figs, the concentrations are 0.03675 (four sig figs) and 0.02809 (four sig figs). But since the original masses are three sig figs, the concentrations should be limited to three sig figs. So, 0.0368 M and 0.0281 M. Sum is 0.0649 M. But 0.03675 + 0.02809 is 0.06484, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. Wait, but 0.03675 is 0.0368 (three sig figs), 0.02809 is 0.0281 (three sig figs). Adding them: 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649. But actually, when adding, the number of decimal places is considered. If we take 0.03675 (which is 0.0368 to three sig figs) and 0.02809 (0.0281 to three sig figs), adding them as 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649. But if we use the exact values before rounding, 0.0367515 + 0.0280915 = 0.064843, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. Hmm, conflicting. The original data: 1.00 g (three sig figs), molar masses: 136.09 (five sig figs) and 177.99 (five sig figs). So, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.0073503 mol (three sig figs: 0.00735 mol). Similarly, Na2HPO4: 0.0056183 mol (three sig figs: 0.00562 mol). Then concentrations: 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675 M (but since moles are three sig figs, 0.00735 / 0.20000 = 0.03675, but 0.00735 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five, so the result is 0.03675, which is four sig figs. Wait, no. The rule is that in multiplication/division, the number of sig figs is the least number of sig figs in the inputs. Here, 1.00 (three) / 136.09 (five) = 0.0073503, which should be three sig figs: 0.00735. Then, 0.00735 / 0.20000. 0.00735 has three sig figs, 0.20000 has five. So, the result is 0.03675, but with three sig figs: 0.0368. Similarly, 0.00562 / 0.20000 = 0.0281. So, total is 0.0368 + 0.0281 = 0.0649 M. But 0.0649 has three sig figs. However, if we consider that the sum of 0.03675 and 0.02809 is 0.06484, which is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. But since the individual concentrations are 0.0368 and 0.0281 (each three sig figs), the sum is 0.0649. But this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects to sum the exact concentrations and present with three decimal places, but given the data, three sig figs is appropriate. So, 0.0648 M or 0.0649 M? Let's check the exact calculation:

0.0073503 + 0.0056183 = 0.0129686 mol in 0.2 L. So, 0.0129686 / 0.2 = 0.064843 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0648 M. Because 0.064843 is 0.0648 when rounded to three decimal places. But wait, sig figs: 0.064843 has five sig figs. But the original data (1.00 g) gives three sig figs. So, the total moles is 0.0129686, which is 0.012969 (five sig figs), but since the original masses are three sig figs, the total moles should be considered as 0.01297 (three sig figs after the decimal, but actually, when adding 0.00735 (three) and 0.00562 (three), the sum is 0.01297, which is three decimal places but four sig figs. Wait, 0.00735 + 0.00562 = 0.01297. So, 0.01297 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.06485 M. Rounded to three sig figs: 0.0649 M. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But perhaps the answer is 0.0648 M. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum of the two concentrations, each calculated with their exact molar masses, then summed. Let's do precise calculation:

Molar mass of KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.0073503 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.0056183 mol.

Total moles of phosphate: 0.0073503 + 0.0056183 = 0.0129686 mol.

Concentration: 0.0129686 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.064843 M.

Rounded to three significant figures: 0.0648 M. Because the first three digits are 6, 4, 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. Hence, 0.0648 M. But 0.064843 is approximately 0.0648 when rounded to three sig figs. However, sometimes, trailing zeros can complicate. Wait, 0.064843 has five significant figures. To three, it's 0.0648 (as the fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5). So, 0.0648 M. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. But let's check if the problem expects considering the actual species present. If the question is about the total phosphate concentration, regardless of protonation state, then 0.0648 M is correct. However, if it's about the concentration of PO4³⁻, then it's 6.22e-7 M. But given the problem mentions "orthophosphate ions," which in standard terms refers to the sum of H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. But in practice, PO4³⁻ is negligible here, so the answer is approximately 0.0648 M. Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the calculation of the phosphate concentration considering the buffer equilibrium. Wait, but the total phosphate concentration is just the sum of the two added salts, because each contributes one phosphate ion. Since KH2PO4 gives H2PO4⁻ and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4²⁻, each mole of salt gives one mole of phosphate species. Therefore, the total phosphate concentration is (moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4) / volume. Which is exactly what we calculated. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M, which is 0.0648 M. Converting to scientific notation, that's 6.48x10^-2 M. But the problem might expect three significant figures, so 6.48x10^-2 M. Alternatively, 0.0648 M. Either is acceptable, but since the answer is boxed, likely 0.0648 M. However, let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the problem is a trick question where they expect you to realize that orthophosphate is PO4³⁻, so you need to calculate its concentration. But as we saw, it's about 6.2e-7 M, which is negligible. But given the problem provides all three Ka values, maybe they expect considering the speciation. Wait, but the salts are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are known. The total phosphate is the sum, but if considering the actual species in solution, some of the H2PO4^- might deprotonate to HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- might protonate to H2PO4^-. However, since both are present in solution, the pH is determined by their ratio, but the total phosphate concentration remains the sum. Because the dissociation of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- would convert one into the other, but since both are already present, the buffer system will adjust the ratio, but the total phosphate concentration (sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) remains constant. Therefore, the total concentration is indeed 0.0648 M, regardless of the pH. Therefore, the answer is 0.0648 M. Hence, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 0.0648 M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is \boxed{0.0648\ \text{M}}.
