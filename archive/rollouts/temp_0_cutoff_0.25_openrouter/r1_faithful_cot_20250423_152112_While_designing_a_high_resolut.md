# Original Question

While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.

What can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?

When Mike initiated the electron beam in the ultra-high vacuum environment, the observed mean free path shifted from **λ₁** (gas molecule-gas molecule collisions) to **λ₂** (electron-gas molecule scattering). This change arises because:

1. **Different Interaction Cross-Sections**:  
   - **λ₁** is determined by collisions between gas molecules, which depend on their size (cross-sectional area ~πd²).  
   - **λ₂** involves electrons scattering off gas molecules. At high energies (1000 kV), the effective cross-section for electron-molecule interactions (σ) is much smaller than the molecule-molecule cross-section.  

2. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   - For gas molecules:  
     \[
     \lambda_1 = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
     \]  
   - For electrons:  
     \[
     \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
     \]  
     where \( n \) (number density) is proportional to pressure and inversely proportional to temperature. Since pressure and temperature remain constant, the difference in λ₂ vs. λ₁ stems from the smaller σ for electrons compared to πd² for gas molecules.  

3. **Result**:  
   The electron scattering cross-section (σ) is significantly smaller than the gas molecule cross-section (πd²). Since mean free path is inversely proportional to cross-section, **λ₂ > λ₁**.  

**Conclusion**:  
The mean free path for electron scattering (**λ₂**) is **greater than** the mean free path for gas molecule collisions (**λ₁**).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) at 1000 kV. He's created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, less than 10^-9 Torr, to minimize gas molecules. But even then, some gas particles are still there. He calculated the mean free path λ1 of these gas molecules under those conditions. Then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature hasn't changed. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm. Let me start by recalling what the mean free path (MFP) is. The MFP is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For gas molecules, the MFP λ is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule's diameter, and P is pressure. So, if temperature and pressure are constant, λ1 would be determined by those parameters. But in this case, when the electron beam is on, the MFP becomes λ2. The temperature is the same, so T isn't changing. But maybe the pressure? Wait, but the vacuum is maintained, so pressure should stay the same. Unless the electron beam somehow affects the gas molecules... Maybe ionizing them or causing outgassing? But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, and the vacuum is ultra-high. So maybe the pressure is still the same.

Wait, but the mean free path here might be referring to two different things. The first mean free path, λ1, is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves colliding with each other. The second mean free path, λ2, could be the mean free path of the electrons in the beam colliding with the gas molecules. That makes sense. Because when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas, and their mean free path would be different from the gas molecules' mean free path. 

So, the original λ1 is calculated for gas-gas molecule collisions, while λ2 is the electron-gas molecule scattering mean free path. Therefore, even if the pressure (and thus the number density of gas molecules) is the same, the cross-section for electron-molecule collisions is different from molecule-molecule collisions. Since electrons are much smaller and faster, their cross-sectional area (which is part of the MFP formula) would be different. 

The formula for the electron's mean free path would involve the number density of the gas molecules, the cross-section for electron scattering, and the electron's velocity. But since the pressure (and hence number density) is the same, the difference would come from the cross-section. The cross-section for electron-molecule collisions is likely much smaller than the cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions. Because gas molecules are larger targets compared to electrons. Wait, but electrons are point particles, so maybe the cross-section is determined by the size of the gas molecules. If the gas molecules have a diameter d, then the cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision is πd², but for an electron, maybe it's similar? Or maybe different because electrons interact via different forces. 

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section for electron scattering is much smaller. For example, if the gas molecules are, say, nitrogen or something, the cross-section for an electron to collide with a nitrogen molecule might be smaller than the cross-section for two nitrogen molecules colliding. Because when two molecules collide, they have a larger effective cross-sectional area. Whereas an electron, being a charged particle, might interact via Coulomb forces, but if the gas is neutral, maybe the cross-section is smaller. Wait, but even neutral molecules have some polarizability, so electrons can scatter off them. But the cross-section for electron scattering might be different. 

Alternatively, maybe the speed of the electrons is so high that the cross-section is smaller. Because cross-sections can depend on the relative velocity. For example, in some cases, faster particles have smaller cross-sections because the interaction time is shorter. But I'm not sure. Let's think in terms of the formula. The mean free path for the electrons would be λ2 = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of gas molecules and σ is the cross-section for electron-molecule scattering. Similarly, λ1 for the gas molecules is 1/(√2 n π d²), since for gas molecules, the cross-section is πd² and the √2 factor comes from the relative velocity in a gas. 

So if σ (electron cross-section) is smaller than πd² (molecule cross-section), then λ2 would be larger than λ1. Because λ is inversely proportional to cross-section. So if σ is smaller, λ2 is larger. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons would be longer than that for gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 > λ1. 

But wait, the problem states that when Mike initiated the electron beam, he observed that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So he was probably measuring the electron's mean free path, not the gas molecules'. Therefore, since electrons have a different cross-section, their mean free path would be different. If the cross-section for electrons is smaller, then λ2 would be larger. 

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section is larger. Let me think. For example, if the gas molecules are ionized by the electron beam, but the problem says the vacuum is maintained, so pressure is the same. If the cross-section for electron scattering is larger, then λ2 would be smaller. But I need to think about typical cross-sections. 

In electron scattering, the cross-section can vary depending on energy. At high energies (like 1000 kV electrons), the cross-sections for scattering with gas molecules might be smaller because the electrons are moving very fast. The scattering cross-section often decreases with increasing energy for some interactions. For example, Rutherford scattering cross-section decreases with energy. So if the electrons are high energy, their cross-section with gas molecules might be smaller than the cross-section between gas molecules. 

Therefore, if σ_electron < σ_molecule, then λ2 = 1/(nσ_electron) would be larger than λ1 = 1/(√2 n σ_molecule). Since σ_molecule is larger (because molecules are bigger targets), then λ1 is smaller. Therefore, λ2 would be larger than λ1. 

So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons is longer than that of the gas molecules. 

But wait, the problem says Mike "determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (<10^-9 Torr) to be λ1". So λ1 is the gas molecules' mean free path. Then, when the electron beam is on, he's measuring the mean free path related to electron scattering, which is λ2. Since the electrons are moving through the same gas, but their interaction cross-section is different, leading to a different mean free path. 

Therefore, the answer should be that λ2 is greater than λ1. Because the cross-section for electron scattering is smaller than that for gas molecule collisions, leading to a longer mean free path for the electrons. 

Alternatively, maybe the opposite. Let me check with some numbers. Suppose the gas is nitrogen at 10^-9 Torr. The mean free path for nitrogen molecules can be calculated. Let's say at room temperature, the mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P). For nitrogen, d is about 0.37 nm. Let's plug in T=300 K, P=1e-9 Torr. Converting Torr to Pascals: 1 Torr = 133.322 Pa, so 1e-9 Torr = 1.333e-7 Pa. 

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. 

So λ1 = (1.38e-23 * 300)/(√2 * π * (0.37e-9)^2 * 1.333e-7)

Calculate denominator first: √2 ≈ 1.414, so 1.414 * π ≈ 4.442. Then (0.37e-9)^2 = 0.1369e-18 m². Multiply by 1.333e-7 Pa: 4.442 * 0.1369e-18 * 1.333e-7 ≈ 4.442 * 0.1369 * 1.333 * 1e-25. Let's compute 4.442 * 0.1369 ≈ 0.608, then 0.608 * 1.333 ≈ 0.810. So denominator ≈ 0.810e-25.

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21.

So λ1 ≈ 4.14e-21 / 0.810e-25 ≈ 5.11e4 meters. That's 51 kilometers. Wait, that seems really long. But at ultra-high vacuum (1e-9 Torr), mean free paths are indeed very long. For example, at 1e-6 Torr, the mean free path is about 100 km for nitrogen. So at 1e-9, it's even longer. But maybe the calculation is right.

Now, for the electron's mean free path. Let's say the cross-section for electron scattering with nitrogen. The cross-section for electron scattering can vary, but let's take an example. For example, the cross-section for electron-nitrogen molecule scattering at high energies (1000 kV) might be on the order of 1e-20 m². Let's say σ = 1e-20 m². Then, the number density n = P/(k*T). P is 1.333e-7 Pa, so n = (1.333e-7)/(1.38e-23 * 300) ≈ 1.333e-7 / 4.14e-21 ≈ 3.22e13 molecules/m³.

Then, the electron mean free path λ2 = 1/(nσ) = 1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20) = 1/(3.22e-7) ≈ 3.1e6 meters, which is about 3,100 km. Wait, but that's even longer than λ1. But according to our previous calculation, λ1 was 51 km. So in this case, λ2 is longer. But this depends on the cross-section. If the cross-section for electrons is smaller, then λ2 is longer. If the cross-section were larger, λ2 would be shorter.

But in reality, at high energies (1000 kV), electrons have very high speeds, so the interaction time is short, leading to smaller cross-sections. For example, the cross-section for Rutherford scattering decreases with energy. So σ_electron would be smaller than the gas molecule cross-section. Therefore, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the gas molecule cross-section is πd², which for nitrogen is π*(0.37e-9)^2 ≈ 4.3e-19 m². So if the electron cross-section is 1e-20 m², which is smaller, then indeed λ2 would be longer. For example, using the same n=3.22e13 m^-3:

λ1 = 1/(√2 n π d²) = 1/(1.414 * 3.22e13 * 4.3e-19) ≈ 1/(1.414 * 1.38e-5) ≈ 1/1.95e-5 ≈ 5.13e4 m, which matches the previous calculation. Then λ2 = 1/(nσ) = 1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20) ≈ 3.1e6 m, which is longer. So yes, λ2 > λ1.

Therefore, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So when the electron beam is on, the mean free path based on electron scattering is longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.

Mike is operating a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) at 1000 kV with an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment (below 10^-9 Torr) to reduce gas molecules. Despite this vacuum, some gas particles remain present. He determined the mean free path λ1 of these gas molecules under these conditions. When he activates the electron beam, he observes that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature remains constant. The question asks what we can conclude about λ2 in relation to λ1.

The mean free path (MFP) represents the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For gas molecules, the MFP λ is calculated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule's diameter, and P is pressure. With constant temperature and pressure, λ1 would be determined by these parameters. When the electron beam is activated, the MFP becomes λ2. Since temperature remains unchanged and the vacuum is maintained, temperature and pressure aren't varying factors.

Upon reflection, I realize λ1 and λ2 might be measuring different phenomena. The first mean free path, λ1, refers to gas molecules colliding with each other. The second mean free path, λ2, likely refers to electrons in the beam colliding with gas molecules. This distinction makes sense because when the electron beam is active, electrons move through the gas with a mean free path different from that of the gas molecules themselves.

Therefore, λ1 is calculated for gas-gas molecule collisions, while λ2 represents the electron-gas molecule scattering mean free path. Even with consistent pressure (and thus gas molecule number density), the cross-section for electron-molecule collisions differs from molecule-molecule collisions. Since electrons are smaller and faster, their cross-sectional area (a component in the MFP formula) would differ. The electron's mean free path calculation would incorporate the gas molecules' number density, the electron scattering cross-section, and the electron's velocity.

# OpenAI completion

Mike is utilizing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) operating at 1000 kV. He has established an ultra-high vacuum in the sample chamber, reaching pressures below 10^-9 Torr to minimize gas molecules. However, some gas particles still remain. Under these conditions, he calculated the mean free path λ1 for these gas molecules. When the electron beam is activated, he observes that the mean free path shifts to λ2, even though the temperature remains unchanged. The question arises: how does λ2 relate to λ1?

First, it's important to recall that the mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In the case of gas molecules, the MFP λ can be determined by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k refers to Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is the pressure. With constant temperature and pressure, λ1 would be dependent on these parameters. However, when the electron beam is engaged, the MFP becomes λ2. The temperature remains constant, indicating no change there. Could it be the pressure? The high vacuum is maintained, so the pressure should theoretically remain constant. But perhaps the electron beam affects the gas molecules, potentially ionizing them or causing outgassing? However, since the problem specifies a constant sample compartment temperature and an ultra-high vacuum, the pressure likely remains unchanged.

It’s possible that the two mean free paths signify different phenomena. The initial mean free path, λ1, pertains to gas molecules colliding with each other. The second mean free path, λ2, might relate to the electron beam's interaction with the gas molecules. This makes sense, as when the electron beam is operational, the electrons traverse the gas, and their mean free path will differ from that of the gas molecules.

Consequently, λ1 is calculated for gas-gas molecule collisions, while λ2 reflects the electron-gas molecule interaction mean free path. Thus, even with constant pressure (and consequently the same number density of gas molecules), the cross-section for electron-molecule collisions differs from that of molecule-molecule collisions. Electrons, being much smaller and faster, have a different cross-sectional area, which influences the MFP formula.

For electrons, the mean free path formula would incorporate the gas molecule number density, the cross-section for electron scattering, and the electron's velocity.

At high energies (e.g., 1000 kV), electron scattering cross-sections are reduced due to relativistic speeds and shorter interaction times.\n2. **Number Density**: Both λ₁ and λ₂ depend on the gas molecule number density (n), which remains constant since pressure and temperature are unchanged.

Let's think. Gas molecules have a certain diameter, say d, so their cross-section is πd². Electrons, being point particles, have a much smaller cross-section. However, the scattering cross-section for electrons with gas molecules might depend on the energy of the electrons and the type of gas. At high energies (like 1000 kV), the cross-section might be smaller because the interaction time is shorter, leading to less scattering. So, the cross-section σ for electrons would be smaller than the cross-section for gas molecules colliding. \n\nThe mean free path for electrons would be λ2 = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of gas molecules. The original λ1 for gas molecules is 1/(√2 π d² n). So, if σ (electron cross-section) is smaller than πd², then λ2 would be longer than λ1. Alternatively, if σ is larger, λ2 would be shorter. But given that electrons are much smaller and moving fast, their cross-section is likely smaller. For example, inelastic scattering cross-sections for electrons in gases can vary, but at high energies (like 1000 keV), the cross-sections are relatively small. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons (λ2) would be longer than the mean free path for gas molecules (λ1). \n\nWait, but let me check. The cross-section for electron scattering can be approximated by the Rutherford scattering cross-section or other models. The differential cross-section for Rutherford scattering is (Z² e^4)/(4ε₀² (4π)^2 (m_e v²)^2 sin^4(θ/2)), where Z is the atomic number, e is charge, ε₀ permittivity, m_e electron mass, v velocity, θ scattering angle. The total cross-section would integrate over all angles, but for small angles (which might be relevant here), but in any case, the cross-section depends on the charge of the nucleus, the electron's velocity (energy), etc. At high energies (1000 kV is 1 MeV electrons), the velocity is relativistic, so v ≈ c. Then the cross-section would be proportional to Z²/(E²), where E is the electron energy. So higher energy electrons have smaller cross-sections. Therefore, σ_electron ~ Z²/(E²). \n\nComparing this to the gas molecule cross-section, which is πd². For a gas molecule, say nitrogen, d is about 0.3 nm. So πd² ≈ π*(0.3e-9 m)^2 ≈ 2.8e-19 m². For the electron cross-section, let's take E = 1 MeV. Let's compute σ_electron. Let's take Z=7 for nitrogen. Then, using the Rutherford formula, but maybe in practice, the actual cross-section is smaller. Wait, but Rutherford cross-section for 1 MeV electrons on nitrogen. Let me see. The cross-section for electrons scattering off nuclei is actually quite small at high energies. For example, the cross-section for electrons in air at high energies is on the order of 1e-28 m² per molecule. But wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, considering that the mean free path for electrons in air at STP is about 1e-7 meters, but in a vacuum of 1e-9 Torr, the number density is much lower. Wait, maybe I need to compute the number density first.\n\nNumber density n = P/(k*T). Let's assume the pressure is 1e-9 Torr. Convert Torr to Pascals: 1 Torr = 133.322 Pa. So 1e-9 Torr = 1.333e-7 Pa. Temperature, assuming room temperature, T=300 K. Then n = (1.333e-7 Pa)/(1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K) ≈ (1.333e-7)/(4.14e-21) ≈ 3.22e13 molecules/m³. \n\nIf the cross-section for electron scattering is σ, then the mean free path λ2 = 1/(nσ). For gas molecules, λ1 = 1/(√2 π d² n). Let's plug in numbers. For gas molecules, d ≈ 0.3e-9 m, so π d² ≈ 2.8e-19 m². Then λ1 ≈ 1/(√2 * 2.8e-19 * 3.22e13) ≈ 1/(1.414 * 2.8e-19 * 3.22e13) ≈ 1/(1.414 * 9.0e-6) ≈ 1/(1.27e-5) ≈ 7.87e4 meters. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-9 Torr is a very good vacuum. The mean free path of gas molecules in such a vacuum is indeed very large. For example, at 1e-6 Torr, the mean free path is about 40 km. So at 1e-9 Torr, it's 40,000 km? Wait, maybe my calculation is off. Let me check.\n\nThe formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P). Let's compute that. k = 1.38e-23 J/K, T=300 K, d=0.3e-9 m, P=1.33e-7 Pa. Then λ = (1.38e-23 * 300)/(√2 * π * (0.3e-9)^2 * 1.33e-7) \n\nCalculate numerator: 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21\n\nDenominator: 1.414 * 3.1416 * (0.3e-9)^2 * 1.33e-7 ≈ 1.414 * 3.1416 * 9e-20 * 1.33e-7 ≈ 1.414 * 3.1416 * 1.197e-26 ≈ 1.414 * 3.76e-26 ≈ 5.32e-26\n\nSo λ ≈ 4.14e-21 / 5.32e-26 ≈ 7.78e4 meters ≈ 78 kilometers. Hmm, so λ1 is about 78 km. That seems plausible for a UHV.\n\nNow, for the electron's mean free path. Let's assume the cross-section σ for electron scattering with a gas molecule. If σ is, say, 1e-20 m² (just a guess), then λ2 = 1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20) = 1/(3.22e-7) ≈ 3.1e6 meters, which is 3,100 km. So λ2 would be much longer than λ1. But if the cross-section is larger, say 1e-18 m², then λ2 would be 31 km, which is shorter than λ1. So it depends on the cross-section.\n\nBut in reality, what is the typical cross-section for electron scattering in gases? For high-energy electrons (1 MeV), the scattering cross-section with gas molecules is quite small. For example, the total cross-section for electron scattering in nitrogen might be on the order of 1e-20 m² or smaller. Let me check some references. \n\nWait, in particle physics, the cross-section is often measured in barns, where 1 barn = 1e-28 m². For example, the Rutherford cross-section for a nucleus might be on the order of barns. But for electron scattering from atoms, the cross-sections are larger because the atom is bigger. However, at high energies, the cross-sections decrease. For example, the cross-section for electron-atom scattering at 100 keV might be around 1e-24 m² (1 barn) to 1e-22 m² (100 barns). But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the mean free path of electrons in air at atmospheric pressure (1e5 Pa) is about 1e-7 meters. So, using the same formula, n = P/(kT) = 1e5 / (1.38e-23 * 300) ≈ 2.4e25 m^-3. Then λ = 1/(nσ) => σ = 1/(nλ) = 1/(2.4e25 * 1e-7) = 1/(2.4e18) ≈ 4.17e-19 m². So σ ≈ 4e-19 m² for electrons in air at STP. But at 1e-9 Torr, n is much lower. Wait, but the cross-section σ depends on the energy. At higher energies (1 MeV vs. maybe lower energies in the example), the cross-section would be smaller. So if at STP and lower energy, σ is 4e-19 m², then at 1 MeV, σ might be smaller, say 1e-20 m². Then, in the UHV of 1e-9 Torr, n=3.22e13 m^-3, so λ2=1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20)=1/(3.22e-7)=3.1e6 m=3,100 km. Which is much longer than λ1=78 km. So λ2 > λ1.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-section is similar to gas molecules, say 1e-19 m², then λ2=1/(3.22e13 *1e-19)=1/(3.22e-6)=310,000 m=310 km, still longer than 78 km. If the cross-section is 1e-18 m², then λ2=31 km, which is shorter than λ1. But is the cross-section for electron scattering that large?\n\nWait, but electrons are charged particles, and their interaction cross-section with gas molecules (which are neutral but polarizable) might be different. For neutral molecules, the scattering could be due to the electric polarization of the molecule by the passing electron. The cross-section for such interactions might be smaller than the gas-gas collisions, which are hard-sphere collisions. So maybe the cross-section σ for electrons is smaller than πd², leading to a longer mean free path. \n\nAlternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized by the electron beam, then the cross-section could be larger due to Coulomb interactions. But in an electron microscope, the vacuum is so high that even if some ionization occurs, the density is so low that the effect might be negligible. \n\nAnother angle: the mean free path of the electrons is important for the microscope's operation. A longer mean free path is better because it means the electrons don't scatter off gas molecules as often, leading to clearer images. So Mike designed the vacuum to have a long mean free path λ1 for gas molecules, but when he turns on the beam, the electrons have a different mean free path λ2. If λ2 is longer than λ1, that's good. But why would it be different?\n\nWait, but the original mean free path λ1 is for gas molecules colliding with each other, which is a measure of the vacuum quality. The electron's mean free path λ2 is how far the electrons travel before hitting a gas molecule. These are two different mean free paths. Since the electrons are moving through the same gas, but their interaction cross-section is different. If the cross-section for electron-molecule collisions is smaller than that for molecule-molecule collisions, then λ2 > λ1. If it's larger, then λ2 < λ1.\n\nBut in reality, for high-energy electrons, the cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule cross-sectional area. For example, gas molecules have a cross-sectional area of πd² ~ 1e-19 m², while high-energy electrons might have a cross-section of 1e-24 m² (if considering Rutherford scattering with nuclei), but maybe larger if considering interactions with the electron cloud. However, at 1 MeV, electrons are relativistic, and their interactions are less probable. So likely, σ_electron < πd², leading to λ2 > λ1. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons is longer than that for gas molecules. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1 (λ2 > λ1).

The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in the vacuum, denoted as **λ₁**, is determined by their mutual collisions and depends on pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. When the electron beam is activated, the observed MFP **λ₂** corresponds to **electron-gas molecule scattering**, not gas-gas collisions. 

Key factors influencing **λ₂**:
1. **Cross-Sectional Area**: Electrons interact with gas molecules via scattering, which has a much smaller effective cross-sectional area (σ) compared to gas molecule collisions (πd²). At high energies (e.g., 1000 kV), electron scattering cross-sections are reduced due to relativistic speeds and shorter interaction times.
2. **Number Density**: Both λ₁ and λ₂ depend on the gas molecule number density (n), which remains constant since pressure and temperature are unchanged. However, λ₂ = 1/(nσ), while λ₁ = 1/(√2 πd²n). Since σ < πd² for high-energy electrons, **λ₂ > λ₁**.

**Conclusion**: The mean free path of electrons (λ₂) is **longer** than that of gas molecules (λ₁) because the electron-gas molecule scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas molecule collision cross-section. Thus, **λ₂ > λ₁**. 

$\boxed{\lambda_2 > \lambda_1}$

The cross-section for electron scattering might be smaller or larger than the cross-section for gas molecules colliding with each other. Let's think. Gas molecules have a certain diameter, say d, so their cross-section is πd². Electrons, being point particles, have a much smaller cross-section. However, the scattering cross-section for electrons with gas molecules might depend on the energy of the electrons and the type of gas. At high energies (like 1000 kV), the cross-section might be smaller because the interaction time is shorter, leading to less scattering. So, the cross-section σ for electrons would be smaller than the cross-section for gas molecules colliding. 

The mean free path for electrons would be λ2 = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of gas molecules. The original λ1 for gas molecules is 1/(√2 π d² n). So, if σ (electron cross-section) is smaller than πd², then λ2 would be longer than λ1. Alternatively, if σ is larger, λ2 would be shorter. But given that electrons are much smaller and moving fast, their cross-section is likely smaller. For example, inelastic scattering cross-sections for electrons in gases can vary, but at high energies (like 1000 keV), the cross-sections are relatively small. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons (λ2) would be longer than the mean free path for gas molecules (λ1). 

Wait, but let me check. The cross-section for electron scattering can be approximated by the Rutherford scattering cross-section or other models. The differential cross-section for Rutherford scattering is (Z² e^4)/(4ε₀² (4π)^2 (m_e v²)^2 sin^4(θ/2)), where Z is the atomic number, e is charge, ε₀ permittivity, m_e electron mass, v velocity, θ scattering angle. The total cross-section would integrate over all angles, but for small angles (which might be relevant here), but in any case, the cross-section depends on the charge of the nucleus, the electron's velocity (energy), etc. At high energies (1000 kV is 1 MeV electrons), the velocity is relativistic, so v ≈ c. Then the cross-section would be proportional to Z²/(E²), where E is the electron energy. So higher energy electrons have smaller cross-sections. Therefore, σ_electron ~ Z²/(E²). 

Comparing this to the gas molecule cross-section, which is πd². For a gas molecule, say nitrogen, d is about 0.3 nm. So πd² ≈ π*(0.3e-9 m)^2 ≈ 2.8e-19 m². For the electron cross-section, let's take E = 1 MeV. Let's compute σ_electron. Let's take Z=7 for nitrogen. Then, using the Rutherford formula, but maybe in practice, the actual cross-section is smaller. Wait, but Rutherford cross-section for 1 MeV electrons on nitrogen. Let me see. The cross-section for electrons scattering off nuclei is actually quite small at high energies. For example, the cross-section for electrons in air at high energies is on the order of 1e-28 m² per molecule. But wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, considering that the mean free path for electrons in air at STP is about 1e-7 meters, but in a vacuum of 1e-9 Torr, the number density is much lower. Wait, maybe I need to compute the number density first.

Number density n = P/(k*T). Let's assume the pressure is 1e-9 Torr. Convert Torr to Pascals: 1 Torr = 133.322 Pa. So 1e-9 Torr = 1.333e-7 Pa. Temperature, assuming room temperature, T=300 K. Then n = (1.333e-7 Pa)/(1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K) ≈ (1.333e-7)/(4.14e-21) ≈ 3.22e13 molecules/m³. 

If the cross-section for electron scattering is σ, then the mean free path λ2 = 1/(nσ). For gas molecules, λ1 = 1/(√2 π d² n). Let's plug in numbers. For gas molecules, d ≈ 0.3e-9 m, so π d² ≈ 2.8e-19 m². Then λ1 ≈ 1/(√2 * 2.8e-19 * 3.22e13) ≈ 1/(1.414 * 2.8e-19 * 3.22e13) ≈ 1/(1.414 * 9.0e-6) ≈ 1/(1.27e-5) ≈ 7.87e4 meters. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-9 Torr is a very good vacuum. The mean free path of gas molecules in such a vacuum is indeed very large. For example, at 1e-6 Torr, the mean free path is about 40 km. So at 1e-9 Torr, it's 40,000 km? Wait, maybe my calculation is off. Let me check.

The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P). Let's compute that. k = 1.38e-23 J/K, T=300 K, d=0.3e-9 m, P=1.33e-7 Pa. Then λ = (1.38e-23 * 300)/(√2 * π * (0.3e-9)^2 * 1.33e-7) 

Calculate numerator: 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21

Denominator: 1.414 * 3.1416 * (0.3e-9)^2 * 1.33e-7 ≈ 1.414 * 3.1416 * 9e-20 * 1.33e-7 ≈ 1.414 * 3.1416 * 1.197e-26 ≈ 1.414 * 3.76e-26 ≈ 5.32e-26

So λ ≈ 4.14e-21 / 5.32e-26 ≈ 7.78e4 meters ≈ 78 kilometers. Hmm, so λ1 is about 78 km. That seems plausible for a UHV.

Now, for the electron's mean free path. Let's assume the cross-section σ for electron scattering with a gas molecule. If σ is, say, 1e-20 m² (just a guess), then λ2 = 1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20) = 1/(3.22e-7) ≈ 3.1e6 meters, which is 3,100 km. So λ2 would be much longer than λ1. But if the cross-section is larger, say 1e-18 m², then λ2 would be 31 km, which is shorter than λ1. So it depends on the cross-section.

But in reality, what is the typical cross-section for electron scattering in gases? For high-energy electrons (1 MeV), the scattering cross-section with gas molecules is quite small. For example, the total cross-section for electron scattering in nitrogen might be on the order of 1e-20 m² or smaller. Let me check some references. 

Wait, in particle physics, the cross-section is often measured in barns, where 1 barn = 1e-28 m². For example, the Rutherford cross-section for a nucleus might be on the order of barns. But for electron scattering from atoms, the cross-sections are larger because the atom is bigger. However, at high energies, the cross-sections decrease. For example, the cross-section for electron-atom scattering at 100 keV might be around 1e-24 m² (1 barn) to 1e-22 m² (100 barns). But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, consider that the mean free path of electrons in air at atmospheric pressure (1e5 Pa) is about 1e-7 meters. So, using the same formula, n = P/(kT) = 1e5 / (1.38e-23 * 300) ≈ 2.4e25 m^-3. Then λ = 1/(nσ) => σ = 1/(nλ) = 1/(2.4e25 * 1e-7) = 1/(2.4e18) ≈ 4.17e-19 m². So σ ≈ 4e-19 m² for electrons in air at STP. But at 1e-9 Torr, n is much lower. Wait, but the cross-section σ depends on the energy. At higher energies (1 MeV vs. maybe lower energies in the example), the cross-section would be smaller. So if at STP and lower energy, σ is 4e-19 m², then at 1 MeV, σ might be smaller, say 1e-20 m². Then, in the UHV of 1e-9 Torr, n=3.22e13 m^-3, so λ2=1/(3.22e13 * 1e-20)=1/(3.22e-7)=3.1e6 m=3,100 km. Which is much longer than λ1=78 km. So λ2 > λ1.

Alternatively, if the cross-section is similar to gas molecules, say 1e-19 m², then λ2=1/(3.22e13 *1e-19)=1/(3.22e-6)=310,000 m=310 km, still longer than 78 km. If the cross-section is 1e-18 m², then λ2=31 km, which is shorter than λ1. But is the cross-section for electron scattering that large?

Wait, but electrons are charged particles, and their interaction cross-section with gas molecules (which are neutral but polarizable) might be different. For neutral molecules, the scattering could be due to the electric polarization of the molecule by the passing electron. The cross-section for such interactions might be smaller than the gas-gas collisions, which are hard-sphere collisions. So maybe the cross-section σ for electrons is smaller than πd², leading to a longer mean free path. 

Alternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized by the electron beam, then the cross-section could be larger due to Coulomb interactions. But in an electron microscope, the vacuum is so high that even if some ionization occurs, the density is so low that the effect might be negligible. 

Another angle: the mean free path of the electrons is important for the microscope's operation. A longer mean free path is better because it means the electrons don't scatter off gas molecules as often, leading to clearer images. So Mike designed the vacuum to have a long mean free path λ1 for gas molecules, but when he turns on the beam, the electrons have a different mean free path λ2. If λ2 is longer than λ1, that's good. But why would it be different?

Wait, but the original mean free path λ1 is for gas molecules colliding with each other, which is a measure of the vacuum quality. The electron's mean free path λ2 is how far the electrons travel before hitting a gas molecule. These are two different mean free paths. Since the electrons are moving through the same gas, but their interaction cross-section is different. If the cross-section for electron-molecule collisions is smaller than that for molecule-molecule collisions, then λ2 > λ1. If it's larger, then λ2 < λ1.

But in reality, for high-energy electrons, the cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule cross-sectional area. For example, gas molecules have a cross-sectional area of πd² ~ 1e-19 m², while high-energy electrons might have a cross-section of 1e-24 m² (if considering Rutherford scattering with nuclei), but maybe larger if considering interactions with the electron cloud. However, at 1 MeV, electrons are relativistic, and their interactions are less probable. So likely, σ_electron < πd², leading to λ2 > λ1. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons is longer than that for gas molecules. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1 (λ2 > λ1). Because the cross-sectional area for electron scattering is smaller than that for gas molecule collisions, leading to a longer mean free path for the electrons.

Since electrons are moving at high speeds (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), their velocity is much higher than that of the gas molecules. However, the MFP is inversely proportional to the product of the number density and the scattering cross-section. The cross-section for electron scattering (σ_e) is different from the cross-section for gas molecule collisions (σ_g). If σ_e is smaller than σ_g, then the MFP for electrons (λ2) would be longer than λ1. Conversely, if σ_e is larger, λ2 would be shorter.

But in reality, the scattering cross-section for electrons with gas molecules (especially for elastic scattering) is typically smaller than the cross-section for gas molecules colliding with each other. Gas molecules have larger physical sizes (diameters on the order of angstroms) compared to the effective cross-section for electron scattering, which might be smaller, especially at high energies. For example, Rutherford scattering cross-section decreases with increasing energy. At 1000 kV, electrons have very high kinetic energy, so their scattering cross-section with gas molecules (like residual nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) would be relatively small. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons (λ2) would be longer than the mean free path for gas molecules (λ1).

Alternatively, if the cross-section for electron scattering is larger, then λ2 would be shorter. But given the high energy of the electrons, the cross-section is likely smaller. Therefore, λ2 > λ1.

Wait, but the problem states that when the electron beam is initiated, the mean free path is now λ2. But the mean free path in question here—is it the mean free path of the gas molecules or the electrons? The original λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other. When the electron beam is on, the mean free path being referred to is that of the electrons traveling through the gas. Therefore, the two MFPs are for different particles: gas molecules vs. electrons. Since the electrons are moving through the same gas, their MFP (λ2) depends on their own scattering cross-section with the gas molecules. Since electrons are much lighter and faster, and their scattering cross-section is smaller (especially at high energies), their MFP would be longer. Therefore, λ2 > λ1.

But let me verify. The formula for the mean free path for electrons would be λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of gas molecules and σ is the scattering cross-section. The number density n is the same as in the case of gas molecules (since pressure and temperature are the same). If σ for electron scattering is smaller than σ for gas molecule collisions (which is πd² for gas molecules), then λ2 would be larger. For example, if gas molecules have a diameter d, then σ_gas = πd². For electrons, the cross-section could be, say, σ_e = πr_e², where r_e is the effective radius for electron scattering. If r_e < d, then σ_e < σ_gas, leading to λ2 > λ1. Since electrons are point particles, but their scattering cross-section depends on the interaction (like Coulomb scattering). At high energies, the cross-section decreases. Therefore, yes, σ_e is smaller, so λ2 is longer. Therefore, λ2 > λ1.

Therefore, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.
