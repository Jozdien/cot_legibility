The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = cS \) (where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli-Y matrix) are determined as follows:

1. **Eigenvalues**:  
   The matrix \( S \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Multiplying by \( c \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:  
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvectors**:  
   - For \( \lambda = +1 \) (eigenvalue \( a = +\frac{h}{4\pi} \)):  
     The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).  
   - For \( \lambda = -1 \) (eigenvalue \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \)):  
     The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

**Key Correct Statements**:  
- The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).  
- The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) are proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).  
- The matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli-Y matrix, which inherently has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).  

These conclusions follow from solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \) and verifying the eigenvectors via substitution.

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Hmm, let me start by recalling how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. 

First, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Since Ay = cS, this would be equivalent to det(cS - aI) = 0. But maybe I can factor out the constant c? Let me check. If I factor out c, the equation becomes det(S - (a/c)I) = 0. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. That might simplify things. 

So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of the matrix S, then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay. Let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 and -i, and the second row is i and 0. So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

To find its eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (S - λI), where λ represents the eigenvalues of S. Let's set that up:

| -λ    -i    |
| i    -λ     |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i)(i). Let's compute (-i)(i). That's -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1. Setting this equal to zero gives λ² = 1, so λ = ±1. 

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times these, so a = c*1 and a = c*(-1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Now, moving on to the eigenvectors. For each eigenvalue, we need to solve (S - λI)φ = 0. Let's start with λ = 1. Plugging into the matrix:

[ -1   -i ] [φ1]   [0]
[ i    -1 ] [φ2] = [0]

So the equations are:
-1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0
i*φ1 - 1*φ2 = 0

Let me take the first equation: -φ1 - iφ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = -iφ2. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation. Plugging into the second equation: i*(-iφ2) - φ2 = (i*(-i))φ2 - φ2 = (1)φ2 - φ2 = 0. So yes, it works. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 1 is any scalar multiple of [ -i, 1 ]^T. 

Similarly, for λ = -1, the matrix becomes:

[ 1   -i ] [φ1]   [0]
[ i    1 ] [φ2] = [0]

The equations are:
1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0
i*φ1 + 1*φ2 = 0

From the first equation: φ1 = iφ2. Plugging into the second equation: i*(iφ2) + φ2 = (i²)φ2 + φ2 = (-1)φ2 + φ2 = 0. So that works. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = -1 is a scalar multiple of [ i, 1 ]^T. 

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is ±h/(4π), and the corresponding eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] respectively. 

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake with the eigenvectors. Let me verify for λ = 1. The matrix S times the eigenvector [ -i, 1 ] should equal 1 times the eigenvector. Let's compute S * [ -i, 1 ]^T:

First component: 0*(-i) + (-i)*1 = -i
Second component: i*(-i) + 0*1 = i*(-i) = -i² = 1

So the result is [ -i, 1 ]^T. But λ is 1, so multiplying the eigenvector by 1 should give the same. Wait, but the result here is [ -i, 1 ]^T, which is the same as the original eigenvector. So that's correct. Similarly, for λ = -1, S * [ i, 1 ]^T:

First component: 0*i + (-i)*1 = -i
Second component: i*i + 0*1 = i² = -1

So the result is [ -i, -1 ]^T, which is -1 times [ i, 1 ]^T. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the eigenvalues are indeed ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are as found. 

But wait, the problem mentions that Ay(φ) = aφ, so the eigenvectors φ are the same as those of S, but scaled by c in the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues a are c times the eigenvalues of S. 

So putting it all together, the eigenvalues are a = ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] normalized. 

I think that's it. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. The matrix S is actually the Pauli y-matrix scaled by 1/2? Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are usually given as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_y matrix is indeed [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which is exactly the matrix S here. So S is the Pauli y-matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, so that's consistent with our earlier result. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c times S, would be ±c, which is ±h/(4π). 

Therefore, the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are as calculated. So the answer should state that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ]. 

But the question is asking which statement below is correct during the calculation. Since the options are not provided here, but the user is probably expecting me to outline the correct reasoning. However, since the user hasn't provided the options, maybe the correct statements would be along the lines of:

- The eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π).

- The eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] up to normalization.

- The matrix S is the Pauli-Y matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, one might consider that the trace of S is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0, which matches ±1. The determinant is -1 (Wait, earlier we had determinant λ² -1 =0, so determinant is 1? Wait, determinant of S is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) = 0 -1 = -1. Wait, but earlier when we computed det(S - λI) = λ² -1, which would mean determinant of S is -1. Wait, but determinant of S is calculated as (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1)) because i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1. Wait, no: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant of S is 0*0 - (-i)(i) = 0 - 1 = -1. Wait, but in the characteristic equation, det(S - λI) = λ² -1. Let me check that again. 

The matrix S - λI is:

[ -λ   -i ]

[ i    -λ ]

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - [ (-i)(i) ].

Compute (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1. Therefore, determinant of S - λI is λ² -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are λ = ±1. But determinant of S itself is det(S) = product of eigenvalues = (1)(-1) = -1, which matches the earlier calculation. 

So that's correct. Therefore, the eigenvalues of S are ±1, and of Ay are ±c. 

Therefore, the correct statements would involve recognizing that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), the eigenvectors are as found, and that S is the Pauli-Y matrix. 

But since the user hasn't provided the options, but the assistant is supposed to write the thought process, I think the key steps here are correct: eigenvalues are ±c, eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ], and the matrix S is indeed the Pauli-Y matrix. So if the options include statements like these, those would be correct.

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Hmm, let me start by recalling how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. 

First, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Since Ay = cS, this would be equivalent to det(cS - aI) = 0. But maybe I can factor out the constant c? Let me check. If I factor out c, the equation becomes det(S - (a/c)I) = 0. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. That might simplify things. 

So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of the matrix S, then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay. Let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 and -i, and the second row is i and 0. So S looks like this:

       [i, 0] ]

To find its eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (S - λI), where λ represents the eigenvalues of S. Let's set that up:

| i    -λ     |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i)(i). Let's compute (-i)(i). That's -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1. Setting this equal to zero gives λ² = 1, so λ = ±1. 

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times these, so a = c*1 and a = c*(-1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Now, moving on to the eigenvectors. For each eigenvalue, we need to solve (S - λI)φ = 0. Le

Alright, I need to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which equals c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is defined as h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with elements [0, -i] in the first row and [i, 0] in the second row.

I'll start by recalling the method for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a represents the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Since Ay = cS, this is equivalent to solving det(cS - aI) = 0. I can factor out the constant c to get det(S - (a/c)I) = 0. This means the eigenvalues of Ay will be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S, which simplifies the problem.

So I'll first find matrix S's eigenvalues, then multiply them by c to obtain Ay's eigenvalues. Matrix S is:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

To determine S's eigenvalues, I need to calculate the determinant of (S - λI), where λ represents S's eigenvalues:

| -λ    -i |
| i     -λ |

The determinant equals (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i)(i). Since (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1, the determinant becomes λ² - 1. Setting this equal to zero gives λ² = 1, so λ = ±1.

Therefore, S's eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Consequently, Ay's eigenvalues are c×1 and c×(-1). Since c equals h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Now for the eigenvectors, I need to solve (S - λI)φ = 0 for each eigenvalue.

# OpenAI completion

To determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, defined as c times the matrix S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0), I first need to remember how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are obtained by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a represents the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Given Ay = cS, the equation becomes det(cS - aI) = 0. I should be able to factor out the constant c, simplifying to det(S - (a/c)I) = 0. Thus, the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. This simplification should help.

I should start by finding the eigenvalues of S and then multiply them by c to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The matrix S is as follows:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

To find its eigenvalues, I need the determinant of (S - λI), with λ being the eigenvalues of S. The matrix setup is:

| -λ    -i    |
|  i    -λ    |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i)(i). Calculating (-i)(i) gives -i², which is -(-1) = 1. Therefore, the determinant is λ² - 1. Setting this to zero gives λ² = 1, so λ = ±1.

Thus, the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Consequently, the eigenvalues of Ay are c times these values, being a = c*1 and a = c*(-1). Given c as h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Next, I need to find the eigenvectors by solving (S - λI)φ = 0 for each eigenvalue.

Let\'s check if this satisfies the second equation. Substitute φ1 = -iφ2 into the second equation: i*(-iφ2) - φ2 = (i*(-i))φ2 - φ2 = (1)φ2 - φ2 = 0. So yes, it works. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = 1 is any scalar multiple of [ -i, 1 ]. \n\nSimilarly, for λ = -1, the matrix (S + I) is:\n\n[ 1    -i ]\n[ i     1 ]\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0\ni*φ1 + 1*φ2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation: φ1 = iφ2.

Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = -1 is any scalar multiple of [ i, 1 ].\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that Ay(φ) = aφ, where φ is the eigenfunction. So the eigenvectors we found for S (with eigenvalues ±1) correspond to the eigenvectors of Ay with eigenvalues ±c. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] respectively. \n\nLet me double-check the matrix S. The Pauli matrices are usually given as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The standard spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle. The matrix S here looks similar to the Pauli y-matrix, which is usually:\n\nσ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nYes, exactly. So S is the Pauli y-matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, and their eigenvectors are as we found. So scaling the Pauli matrix by c would scale the eigenvalues by c, but the eigenvectors remain the same. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the corresponding eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] (up to a scalar multiple). \n\nWait, but eigenvectors can be multiplied by any non-zero scalar. So sometimes they are presented in normalized form. Let me check if the problem requires normalization. The question says "calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors", but it doesn\'t specify if they need to be normalized. However, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are usually normalized. \n\nTo normalize the eigenvectors, let\'s take the first one [ -i, 1 ]. The norm squared is | -i |² + |1|² = 1 + 1 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/√2)[ -i, 1 ]. Similarly for the other eigenvector [ i, 1 ], the norm is also √2, so normalized as (1/√2)[ i, 1 ].\n\nBut the problem might not require normalization, just the form of the eigenvectors. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. The options aren\'t given here, but the user is probably expecting me to outline the correct steps. \n\nWait, the original question says: "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?" But the user hasn\'t provided the options. Hmm. Since this is a thought process, maybe I need to think about possible statements and see which ones are correct. \n\nBut since the user hasn\'t given the options, perhaps they just want me to explain the process and the correct eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me recap:\n\nEigenvalues of Ay: ±h/(4π)\n\nEigenvectors: For +h/(4π), the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]; for -h/(4π), proportional to [ i, 1 ].\n\nAlternatively, normalized eigenvectors are (1/√2)[ -i, 1 ] and (1/√2)[ i, 1 ].\n\nCommon mistakes here could be mixing up the signs, or miscalculating the determinant. For example, if someone forgets that the determinant is λ² - 1, they might think it\'s λ² + 1, leading to imaginary eigenvalues. But in this case, the eigenvalues are real, as the matrix S is Hermitian (since it\'s a Pauli matrix), so eigenvalues must be real. \n\nAnother mistake could be in solving for the eigenvectors. For example, if when solving (S - I)φ = 0, someone might miscalculate the equations. Let me check again:\n\nFor λ = 1:\n\n-1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = -iφ2\n\nSo if φ2 = 1, then φ1 = -i. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, for λ = -1:\n\n1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = iφ2\n\nIf φ2 = 1, then φ1 = i. So eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].\n\nYes, that\'s correct. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the eigenvectors are [1, i] and [1, -i], that would be incorrect. Wait, let\'s see. If you take the matrix S and act on [1, i], what happens?\n\nS * [1, i] = [0*1 + (-i)*i, i*1 + 0*i] = [ -i², i ] = [1, i]. So [1, i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Wait, that\'s different from what I had before. Wait, hold on. Let me check this.\n\nWait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo if I take the vector [1, i], then:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1\n\nSecond component: i*1 + 0*i = i\n\nSo S * [1, i] = [1, i], which is the same as 1*[1, i]. So [1, i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. But earlier, I found [ -i, 1 ] as an eigenvector. Are these equivalent?\n\nWait, let\'s see. If [ -i, 1 ] is an eigenvector, then multiplying by i gives [ -i*i, i*1 ] = [1, i]. So [1, i] is just i times [ -i, 1 ]. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, these are the same eigenvector. So both [ -i, 1 ] and [1, i ] are valid eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1, just differing by a scalar multiple. Similarly, [ i, 1 ] multiplied by i gives [ i², i ] = [ -1, i ], which is not the same as [1, -i]. Wait, let\'s check [1, -i].\n\nS * [1, -i] = [0*1 + (-i)*(-i), i*1 + 0*(-i) ] = [ (-i)(-i) = i² = -1, i ]\n\nSo [ -1, i ] which is -1*[1, -i]. So [1, -i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. Wait, but earlier we had [ i, 1 ] as the eigenvector for eigenvalue -1. Let\'s check:\n\nS * [i, 1] = [0*i + (-i)*1 = -i, i*i + 0*1 = i² = -1 ]\n\nSo S * [i, 1] = [ -i, -1 ] which is -1*[i, 1] because -1*[i,1] = [ -i, -1 ]. So yes, [i,1] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. \n\nBut if we take [1, -i], S*[1, -i] = [ -1, i ] which is -1*[1, -i]. So [1, -i] is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. So both [i,1] and [1, -i] are eigenvectors for eigenvalue -1, differing by a scalar multiple. \n\nTherefore, depending on how you solve the equations, you can get different representations of the eigenvectors, but they are all scalar multiples of each other. So in the problem, if the options present eigenvectors as [1, i] and [1, -i], or [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ], both are correct. However, the standard form is often presented as [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] when solving the equations directly, but they can be written in other equivalent forms. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the matrix S is Hermitian (since S† = conjugate transpose of S, which is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]† = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is not the same as S. Wait, hold on. Wait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. The conjugate transpose would be [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]^T conjugated, which is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]. But S is not equal to its conjugate transpose. Wait, but the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Wait, σ_y is actually [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], and its conjugate transpose is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is equal to σ_y^T, but not σ_y itself. Wait, but σ_y is Hermitian, so σ_y† should equal σ_y. Let me check:\n\nσ_y† = conjugate transpose of σ_y. So original σ_y is:\n\nRow 1: 0, -i\n\nRow 2: i, 0\n\nConjugate transpose would be:\n\nColumn 1: 0, -i (conjugated) → 0, i\n\nColumn 2: -i (conjugated), 0 → i, 0\n\nWait, no. Wait, the conjugate transpose is transposing the matrix and taking the complex conjugate of each entry. So transpose of σ_y is:\n\nRow 1: 0, i\n\nRow 2: -i, 0\n\nThen take complex conjugate:\n\nRow 1: 0, -i\n\nRow 2: i, 0\n\nWhich is the original matrix. So σ_y is equal to its conjugate transpose, hence Hermitian. Wait, that\'s correct. Because transposing swaps the off-diagonal elements, which are -i and i. Then conjugating changes -i to i and i to -i. So transpose gives [0, i; -i, 0], then conjugate gives [0, -i; i, 0], which is the original matrix. Therefore, σ_y is Hermitian.

The eigenvalues of the operator \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), respectively. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Operator Structure:**  
   \( A_y = cS \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which is Hermitian.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( S \):**  
   Solve \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \):  
   \[
   \det\begin{pmatrix} -\lambda & -i \\ i & -\lambda \end{pmatrix} = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm 1.
   \]

3. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**  
   Since \( A_y = cS \), the eigenvalues scale by \( c \):  
   \[
   a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]

4. **Eigenvectors of \( S \):**  
   - For \( \lambda = 1 \):  
     Solve \( (S - I)\phi = 0 \):  
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -i \\ i & -1 \end{pmatrix} \implies \phi_1 = -i\phi_2 \implies \text{Eigenvector: } \propto \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - For \( \lambda = -1 \):  
     Solve \( (S + I)\phi = 0 \):  
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -i \\ i & 1 \end{pmatrix} \implies \phi_1 = i\phi_2 \implies \text{Eigenvector: } \propto \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]

5. **Normalization (Optional):**  
   Normalizing eigenvectors (quantum mechanics convention):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

**Correct Statements:**  
- Eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).  
- Eigenvectors are \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) (or scalar multiples).  
- The operator \( A_y \) is Hermitian, ensuring real eigenvalues.  

**Final Answer:**  
The eigenvalues are \( \boxed{\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}} \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \) and \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

'ts start with λ = 1. 

For λ = 1, the matrix (S - I) is:

[ -1   -i ]
[ i    -1 ]

So the equations from this matrix are:

-1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0
i*φ1 - 1*φ2 = 0

Let me take the first equation: -φ1 - iφ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = -iφ2. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation. Substitute φ1 = -iφ2 into the second equation: i*(-iφ2) - φ2 = (i*(-i))φ2 - φ2 = (1)φ2 - φ2 = 0. So yes, it works. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = 1 is any scalar multiple of [ -i, 1 ]. 

Similarly, for λ = -1, the matrix (S + I) is:

[ 1    -i ]
[ i     1 ]

The equations are:

1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0
i*φ1 + 1*φ2 = 0

From the first equation: φ1 = iφ2. Substitute into the second equation: i*(iφ2) + φ2 = (i²)φ2 + φ2 = (-1)φ2 + φ2 = 0. So that works. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = -1 is any scalar multiple of [ i, 1 ].

But wait, the problem mentions that Ay(φ) = aφ, where φ is the eigenfunction. So the eigenvectors we found for S (with eigenvalues ±1) correspond to the eigenvectors of Ay with eigenvalues ±c. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] respectively. 

Let me double-check the matrix S. The Pauli matrices are usually given as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The standard spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle. The matrix S here looks similar to the Pauli y-matrix, which is usually:

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Yes, exactly. So S is the Pauli y-matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, and their eigenvectors are as we found. So scaling the Pauli matrix by c would scale the eigenvalues by c, but the eigenvectors remain the same. 

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the corresponding eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] (up to a scalar multiple). 

Wait, but eigenvectors can be multiplied by any non-zero scalar. So sometimes they are presented in normalized form. Let me check if the problem requires normalization. The question says "calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors", but it doesn't specify if they need to be normalized. However, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are usually normalized. 

To normalize the eigenvectors, let's take the first one [ -i, 1 ]. The norm squared is | -i |² + |1|² = 1 + 1 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/√2)[ -i, 1 ]. Similarly for the other eigenvector [ i, 1 ], the norm is also √2, so normalized as (1/√2)[ i, 1 ].

But the problem might not require normalization, just the form of the eigenvectors. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. The options aren't given here, but the user is probably expecting me to outline the correct steps. 

Wait, the original question says: "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?" But the user hasn't provided the options. Hmm. Since this is a thought process, maybe I need to think about possible statements and see which ones are correct. 

But since the user hasn't given the options, perhaps they just want me to explain the process and the correct eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me recap:

Eigenvalues of Ay: ±h/(4π)

Eigenvectors: For +h/(4π), the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]; for -h/(4π), proportional to [ i, 1 ].

Alternatively, normalized eigenvectors are (1/√2)[ -i, 1 ] and (1/√2)[ i, 1 ].

Common mistakes here could be mixing up the signs, or miscalculating the determinant. For example, if someone forgets that the determinant is λ² - 1, they might think it's λ² + 1, leading to imaginary eigenvalues. But in this case, the eigenvalues are real, as the matrix S is Hermitian (since it's a Pauli matrix), so eigenvalues must be real. 

Another mistake could be in solving for the eigenvectors. For example, if when solving (S - I)φ = 0, someone might miscalculate the equations. Let me check again:

For λ = 1:

-1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = -iφ2

So if φ2 = 1, then φ1 = -i. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for λ = -1:

1*φ1 - i*φ2 = 0 ⇒ φ1 = iφ2

If φ2 = 1, then φ1 = i. So eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

Yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that the eigenvectors are [1, i] and [1, -i], that would be incorrect. Wait, let's see. If you take the matrix S and act on [1, i], what happens?

S * [1, i] = [0*1 + (-i)*i, i*1 + 0*i] = [ -i², i ] = [1, i]. So [1, i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, hold on. Let me check this.

Wait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So if I take the vector [1, i], then:

First component: 0*1 + (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1

Second component: i*1 + 0*i = i

So S * [1, i] = [1, i], which is the same as 1*[1, i]. So [1, i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. But earlier, I found [ -i, 1 ] as an eigenvector. Are these equivalent?

Wait, let's see. If [ -i, 1 ] is an eigenvector, then multiplying by i gives [ -i*i, i*1 ] = [1, i]. So [1, i] is just i times [ -i, 1 ]. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, these are the same eigenvector. So both [ -i, 1 ] and [1, i ] are valid eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1, just differing by a scalar multiple. Similarly, [ i, 1 ] multiplied by i gives [ i², i ] = [ -1, i ], which is not the same as [1, -i]. Wait, let's check [1, -i].

S * [1, -i] = [0*1 + (-i)*(-i), i*1 + 0*(-i) ] = [ (-i)(-i) = i² = -1, i ]

So [ -1, i ] which is -1*[1, -i]. So [1, -i] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. Wait, but earlier we had [ i, 1 ] as the eigenvector for eigenvalue -1. Let's check:

S * [i, 1] = [0*i + (-i)*1 = -i, i*i + 0*1 = i² = -1 ]

So S * [i, 1] = [ -i, -1 ] which is -1*[i, 1] because -1*[i,1] = [ -i, -1 ]. So yes, [i,1] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. 

But if we take [1, -i], S*[1, -i] = [ -1, i ] which is -1*[1, -i]. So [1, -i] is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. So both [i,1] and [1, -i] are eigenvectors for eigenvalue -1, differing by a scalar multiple. 

Therefore, depending on how you solve the equations, you can get different representations of the eigenvectors, but they are all scalar multiples of each other. So in the problem, if the options present eigenvectors as [1, i] and [1, -i], or [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ], both are correct. However, the standard form is often presented as [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] when solving the equations directly, but they can be written in other equivalent forms. 

Another thing to note is that the matrix S is Hermitian (since S† = conjugate transpose of S, which is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]† = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is not the same as S. Wait, hold on. Wait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. The conjugate transpose would be [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]^T conjugated, which is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]. But S is not equal to its conjugate transpose. Wait, but the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Wait, σ_y is actually [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], and its conjugate transpose is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is equal to σ_y^T, but not σ_y itself. Wait, but σ_y is Hermitian, so σ_y† should equal σ_y. Let me check:

σ_y† = conjugate transpose of σ_y. So original σ_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

Conjugate transpose would be:

Column 1: 0, -i (conjugated) → 0, i

Column 2: -i (conjugated), 0 → i, 0

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate transpose is transposing the matrix and taking the complex conjugate of each entry. So transpose of σ_y is:

Row 1: 0, i

Row 2: -i, 0

Then take complex conjugate:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

Which is the original matrix. So σ_y is equal to its conjugate transpose, hence Hermitian. Wait, that's correct. Because transposing swaps the off-diagonal elements, which are -i and i. Then conjugating changes -i to i and i to -i. So transpose gives [0, i; -i, 0], then conjugate gives [0, -i; i, 0], which is the original matrix. Therefore, σ_y is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues are real, which they are (1 and -1). 

So since Ay = cS, and c is a real constant (h/(4π) is real), then Ay is also Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. 

Therefore, the eigenvalues are indeed ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are as found. 

So, in conclusion, the correct statements during the calculation would be that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] (or scalar multiples thereof). If the options given include these, then those are correct. Common incorrect statements might involve incorrect eigenvalues (like ±h/2π, which is the usual spin operator scaling), or incorrect eigenvectors (like [1, ±i] instead of [±i, 1], but as we saw, these are equivalent up to a scalar multiple). Another possible mistake is thinking the eigenvalues are complex, but since the operator is Hermitian, they must be real. 

Therefore, the key correct points are the eigenvalues being real and equal to ±c, with c = h/(4π), and the eigenvectors corresponding to the structure of the Pauli y-matrix's eigenvectors.

The spin angular momentum operator S_y is ħ/2 times σ_y. So if Ay = cS, and S here is σ_y, then Ay = cσ_y. If c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π))σ_y. But h/(4π) is equal to ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π).

So if the options include that, it\'s correct. But since the problem specifically defines c as h/(4π), then the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So both are correct, but the problem might expect the answer in terms of c, which is h/(4π). However, the problem asks for the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c times S.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), we start by noting that \( A_y = cS \) where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we find the eigenvalues of \( S \). The characteristic equation is given by:

\[
\det(S - \lambda I) = 0
\]

Substituting \( S \) and solving the determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix} -\lambda & -i \\ i & -\lambda \end{vmatrix} = \lambda^2 - (-i)(i) = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0
\]

This gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).

Since \( A_y = cS \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( c \times \pm 1 \). Given \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. For \( \lambda = 1 \):

\[
(S - I) \phi = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -i \\ i & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This leads to the equations:

\[
-\phi_1 - i\phi_2 = 0 \implies \phi_1 = -i\phi_2
\]

Choosing \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

For \( \lambda = -1 \):

\[
(S + I) \phi = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -i \\ i & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This leads to the equations:

\[
\phi_1 - i\phi_2 = 0 \implies \phi_1 = i\phi_2
\]

Choosing \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \) with corresponding eigenvectors \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Final Answer
The eigenvalues of the operator \( A_y \) are \( \boxed{\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}} \) with corresponding eigenvectors \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \) and \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \).

Let's start with λ = 1.

For λ = 1:

(S - I) = [ -1   -i ]
          [ i    -1 ]

This gives the system of equations:

-1*φ₁ - i*φ₂ = 0
i*φ₁ - 1*φ₂ = 0

Let me check if these equations are consistent. From the first equation: φ₁ = -i*φ₂. Substitute into the second equation: i*(-i*φ₂) - φ₂ = (i*(-i))φ₂ - φ₂ = (1)φ₂ - φ₂ = 0. So it's consistent. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ=1 is any scalar multiple of [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for λ = -1:

(S + I) = [ 1   -i ]
          [ i    1 ]

The equations are:

1*φ₁ - i*φ₂ = 0
i*φ₁ + 1*φ₂ = 0

From the first equation: φ₁ = i*φ₂. Substitute into the second equation: i*(i*φ₂) + φ₂ = (i²)φ₂ + φ₂ = (-1)φ₂ + φ₂ = 0. So this is also consistent. The eigenvector for λ=-1 is a scalar multiple of [ i, 1 ].

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the corresponding eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] respectively.

Wait, but let me confirm the eigenvectors again. For λ=1, the system is:

-φ₁ - iφ₂ = 0 → φ₁ = -iφ₂. So if φ₂ = 1, φ₁ = -i. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for λ=-1, φ₁ = iφ₂. If φ₂=1, φ₁ = i. So eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

Yes, that seems correct. The matrix S is actually the Pauli y-matrix multiplied by 2, but the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, so scaling by c would give eigenvalues ±c. The eigenvectors are as calculated.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] up to normalization. The problem might not require normalization, so these are the correct eigenvectors.

So, during the calculation, the correct statements would be that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

But the question is asking which statement below will I consider correct. Since the options aren't provided, but the user is asking me to write the answer in a specific format, perhaps the answer is that the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, but wait, c is h/(4π), and ħ is h/(2π), so c = ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So maybe the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π) or equivalently ±ħ/2. Since ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

But the problem states that Ay = cS, where c = h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). But if the answer options mention ħ, then it's ±ħ/2. But since the problem defines c as h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). However, in standard quantum mechanics, the spin operators are S = ħ/2 * σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Here, the matrix S given is the Pauli y-matrix (σ_y), which has eigenvalues ±1. So if Ay = cS, and c = h/(4π) = ħ/2, then Ay = (ħ/2)σ_y, so eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which matches the standard result. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. But since the problem defines c as h/(4π), which is equal to ħ/2, so both expressions are correct. Depending on the options, either form could be correct.

But the problem says "the constant c = h/(4π)", so the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). However, if the options use ħ, then it's ±ħ/2. But since the problem didn't mention ħ, perhaps the answer is ±h/(4π). But let me check the standard spin matrices. The Pauli matrices σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly the matrix S here. The spin angular momentum operator S_y is ħ/2 times σ_y. So if Ay = cS, and S here is σ_y, then Ay = cσ_y. If c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π))σ_y. But h/(4π) is equal to ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π). Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2)σ_y, which is the standard spin-1/2 angular momentum operator. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be ±ħ/2, which is equivalent to ±h/(4π). So both are correct, but depending on the options given.

But since the problem defines c as h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±c, so ±h/(4π). However, in terms of standard notation, it's ±ħ/2. The eigenvectors are as calculated: [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Therefore, the correct statements would be that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

But since the user hasn't provided the options, but the original question is in Chinese and the translation might have some nuances, but according to the problem's given data, the answer should be eigenvalues ±h/(4π) and eigenvectors as above. However, given that in standard quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of the spin operator S_y are ±ħ/2, and here Ay = cS with c = h/(4π) = ħ/2, so eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So if the options include that, it's correct. But since the problem specifically defines c as h/(4π), then the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So both are correct, but the problem might expect the answer in terms of c, which is h/(4π). However, the problem asks for the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c times S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay has eigenvalues ±c, which is ±h/(4π). Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Therefore, the correct statements would be:

- The eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

- The corresponding eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

So if the options include these, those are correct. Since the user hasn't provided the options, but the question is to write the answer here, I need to box the final answer. But the problem says "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" implying multiple choice, but since there are no options, perhaps the answer is that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

But let me check once more. The matrix S is the Pauli y-matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, Ay = cS has eigenvalues ±c. Since c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). The eigenvectors are the same as those of S, which for eigenvalue +1 is [ -i, 1 ] and for -1 is [ i, 1 ].

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and eigenvectors are as above. So the correct statements would be those that state the eigenvalues as ±h/(4π) and eigenvectors as [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the operator \( A_y \) are \( \boxed{\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}} \) with corresponding eigenvectors \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \) and \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \).

The conjugate transpose would have (1,2) entry -i* (since original is -i, conjugate is i) and (2,1) entry i* (which is -i). So the conjugate transpose of S is [0, i; -i, 0], which is not equal to S.

Starting with λ = 1:

For λ = 1, the matrix (S - I) becomes:

[ -1   -i ]
[  i   -1 ]

This leads to the equations:
-1*φ₁ - i*φ₂ = 0
i*φ₁ - 1*φ₂ = 0

From the first equation: φ₁ = -i*φ₂. Let φ₂ = 1, then φ₁ = -i. So the eigenvector is proportional to (-i, 1). Normalizing it, the magnitude squared is |−i|² + |1|² = 1 + 1 = 2, so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)(-i, 1).

For λ = -1, the matrix (S + I) is:

[ 1   -i ]
[ i    1 ]

The equations become:
1*φ₁ - i*φ₂ = 0
i*φ₁ + 1*φ₂ = 0

From the first equation: φ₁ = i*φ₂. Let φ₂ = 1, then φ₁ = i. The eigenvector is (i, 1), and normalized as (1/√2)(i, 1).

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the corresponding eigenvectors are (1/√2)(-i, 1) and (1/√2)(i, 1). I need to check if these eigenvectors are orthogonal. Taking the inner product: (-i)(i) + (1)(1) = (-i²) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, but since they are normalized, the inner product should be zero. Wait, actually, the inner product for eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator should be zero. However, S is Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Taking its conjugate transpose: [0, i; -i, 0], which is not equal to S. Wait, that's not Hermitian. Wait, but the spin matrices are supposed to be Hermitian. Let me check again. The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal elements and take complex conjugates. The original S has (1,2) entry -i and (2,1) entry i. The conjugate transpose would have (1,2) entry -i* (since original is -i, conjugate is i) and (2,1) entry i* (which is -i). So the conjugate transpose of S is [0, i; -i, 0], which is not equal to S. Therefore, S is not Hermitian. Wait, but spin matrices are supposed to be Hermitian. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, the standard Pauli matrices include σ_y as [0, -i; i, 0], which is indeed Hermitian. Let me check: the conjugate transpose of σ_y is [0, i; -i, 0], which is the same as σ_y because the (1,2) entry becomes i, but the original (2,1) entry is i. Wait, no. Wait, the standard σ_y is:

σ_y = [0, -i]
        [i, 0]

Then, its conjugate transpose is [0, i; -i, 0], which is not the same as σ_y. Therefore, σ_y is not Hermitian? But that contradicts what I know. Wait, no, actually, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me check again. The conjugate transpose of σ_y:

Original entries:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Conjugate transpose would be:
Column 1: 0, -i (conjugate of row 1, column 1 and row 2, column 1)
Wait, no. The conjugate transpose is formed by transposing the matrix and then taking complex conjugates. So transpose of σ_y is:

[0, i;
 -i, 0]

Then taking complex conjugates:

[0, -i;
 i, 0]

Which is the same as the original σ_y. Therefore, σ_y is Hermitian. Therefore, S here is the same as σ_y, which is Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be real. But earlier, when I calculated the eigenvalues of S, I found ±1, which are real. So that's correct. Then, the eigenvectors should be orthogonal. Let me check the inner product of the eigenvectors I found. The eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are ( -i, 1 ) and ( i, 1 ). The inner product is (-i)*i + 1*1 = (-i^2) + 1 = (-(-1)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. But since they are supposed to be orthogonal, this suggests a mistake. Wait, but perhaps I need to take the conjugate transpose of one of them when taking the inner product. The correct inner product for complex vectors is the conjugate of the first vector dotted with the second. So the inner product of [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] is (-i)*i + 1*1 = (-i)(i) + 1*1 = (-i²) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. But they should be orthogonal. Wait, that's a problem. That suggests that my eigenvectors are not orthogonal, which contradicts the fact that Hermitian matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors.

Wait, let's re-examine the eigenvectors. For λ=1:

The matrix S - I is:

[ -1   -i ]
[  i   -1 ]

The equations are:

-φ₁ - iφ₂ = 0
iφ₁ - φ₂ = 0

From the first equation: φ₁ = -iφ₂. Let's substitute into the second equation: i*(-iφ₂) - φ₂ = (i*(-i))φ₂ - φ₂ = (1)φ₂ - φ₂ = 0. So that works. So the eigenvector is proportional to (-i, 1). Similarly, for λ=-1:

S + I is:

[1   -i]
[i    1]

Equations:

φ₁ - iφ₂ = 0
iφ₁ + φ₂ = 0

From first equation: φ₁ = iφ₂. Substitute into second equation: i*(iφ₂) + φ₂ = (i²)φ₂ + φ₂ = (-1)φ₂ + φ₂ = 0. So that works. So eigenvector is (i, 1). Now, taking the inner product of (-i, 1) and (i, 1) with proper conjugation:

The correct inner product is the conjugate of the first vector times the second vector. So:

Conj(-i) * i + conj(1) * 1 = (i)*(i) + 1*1 = i² + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0. Ah! There we go. I forgot to take the conjugate of the first vector. So the inner product is indeed zero, confirming orthogonality. Therefore, the eigenvectors are orthogonal. So my initial calculation was correct, but I had to remember to take the complex conjugate when computing the inner product.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), and the corresponding normalized eigenvectors are (1/√2)(-i, 1) and (1/√2)(i, 1). This makes sense because the operator Ay is proportional to the Pauli y-matrix, which has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. However, in this case, the constant c is h/(4π), which is equal to ℏ/2 since ℏ = h/(2π). Therefore, c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π))/2 = ℏ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2, which matches the standard result for the spin-y component. The eigenvectors are the standard spin-up and spin-down eigenstates for the y-direction.

Therefore, the correct statements would be that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are (1/√2)(-i, 1) and (1/√2)(i, 1). Any options provided in the problem that align with these results would be correct. Since the problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation, possible correct statements could include that the eigenvalues are proportional to ±c, the eigenvectors involve complex numbers, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, or that the matrix S is Hermitian leading to real eigenvalues.
