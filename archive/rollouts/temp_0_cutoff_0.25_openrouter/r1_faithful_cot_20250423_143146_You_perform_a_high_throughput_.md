# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

The experimental results suggest the following genetic interaction hierarchy and roles for G1, G2, and G3 in anthracnose resistance:

1. **G2 is a critical transcription factor acting downstream**:
   - The complete loss of resistance in *g2* (0% resistance) indicates that G2 is essential for resistance. Its absence cannot be compensated by other genes, implying it is the terminal node in the pathway.
   - Double mutants *g1g2* and *g2g3* also show 0% resistance, identical to *g2* alone. This **epistatic relationship** confirms that G2 functions downstream of both G1 and G3. If G2 is nonfunctional, upstream genes (G1/G3) have no effect.

2. **G1 and G3 act upstream of G2**:
   - Single mutants *g1* (75% resistance) and *g3* (50% resistance) retain partial resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 enhance but are not strictly required for G2’s activity.
   - The double mutant *g1g3* (10% resistance) shows a synergistic reduction in resistance compared to individual *g1* or *g3* knockouts. This implies **additive contributions** from G1 and G3 in activating G2. Their combined absence severely impairs, but does not abolish, G2-mediated resistance.

3. **Hierarchical pathway**:
   - G1 and G3 likely regulate G2 through independent or partially redundant pathways. For example, they may produce signals or cofactors necessary for G2’s transcriptional activity. 
   - The residual 10% resistance in *g1g3* suggests minor alternative activation mechanisms for G2 or contributions from unstudied genes.

**Conclusion**: G2 is the central transcription factor required for anthracnose resistance, acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 modulate G2’s activity, with their combined input being critical for full resistance. The data support a model where **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**, and its function is necessary to execute the resistance pathway.

Okay, let's try to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the given data. So, we have three genes: G1, G2, and G3. The mutants are g1, g2, g3, and the double mutants. The resistance percentages are given compared to the wild type. The question is about figuring out the hierarchy or the pathway of these genes, especially since at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

First, let's list out the data again to make sure I have it right. The wild type has 100% resistance. The single mutants: g1 is 75%, which is a 25% reduction. g2 is 0%, so completely susceptible. g3 is 50%, which is a 50% reduction. Then the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. 

Hmm. So, starting with the single mutants. The fact that g2 has 0% suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. If you knock out G2, there's no resistance at all. So maybe G2 is a key gene here. Then, G1 and G3 contribute but aren't as critical. 

Now, looking at the double mutants. When you have g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining g1 and g3 gives a more severe phenotype than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might act in parallel pathways, so when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic. But wait, 75% and 50%... if they were additive, maybe 25% (since 100-25-50=25?), but the result is 10%, which is even lower. Maybe there's some interaction here.

But then, when you look at the other double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So if you knock out G2 along with either G1 or G3, the resistance is the same as just G2 knockout. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene (G2) masks the effect of the other (G1 or G3). So if G2 is not functional, it doesn't matter if G1 or G3 are functional or not. That would imply that G2 acts downstream of G1 and G3. Wait, no, actually, in epistasis, the downstream gene is epistatic to the upstream gene. Because if the downstream gene is non-functional, the upstream gene's activity doesn't matter. For example, if gene A produces a substrate that gene B acts on, then if B is knocked out, the presence or absence of A doesn't matter. So B is downstream of A, and B is epistatic to A. So in this case, since knocking out G2 (which gives 0%) and adding a knockout of G1 or G3 doesn't make it worse, that suggests that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 act upstream of G2. 

But then, the single mutants of G1 and G3 have partial resistance. So G1 and G3 contribute to the pathway but aren't completely necessary. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is even lower (10%). So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to G2's function. Or maybe they work in a linear pathway but with some redundancy. 

Wait, let's think again. If G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, then the function of G2 depends on both G1 and G3. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, G2 might still be partially active. For example, if G1 and G3 both contribute to activating G2, then knocking out one would reduce G2's activity, but not eliminate it. But in the case of G2 knockout, the activity is completely gone. 

But the data shows that g1 has 75% resistance, which is a 25% decrease. g3 has 50%, which is a 50% decrease. So maybe G3 contributes more to the pathway than G1. Then, when both are knocked out, the pathway is almost non-functional (10% resistance). But since G2 is downstream, if G2 is not working, then even if G1 and G3 are working, the resistance is 0%. 

So the hierarchy would be G1 and G3 acting upstream of G2. Both G1 and G3 contribute to the activation of G2. If either G1 or G3 is non-functional, G2's activity is reduced, leading to partial resistance. If both G1 and G3 are non-functional, G2's activity is almost gone (10% resistance). But if G2 itself is non-functional, then no resistance, regardless of G1 and G3. 

But wait, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G2 is downstream, then even if G1 and G3 are both knocked out, G2 might still have some residual activity, leading to 10% resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. So that makes sense. 

Additionally, the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors typically regulate the expression of other genes. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it could be regulating other genes involved in resistance. But according to our previous analysis, G2 is downstream. Alternatively, maybe G1 or G3 is the transcription factor. 

Wait, if G2 is downstream, then the transcription factor could be G1 or G3. For example, G1 could be a transcription factor that activates G2, which in turn activates other genes. But the data shows that knocking out G1 only reduces resistance to 75%, so G1 isn't absolutely required, but contributes. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, then in the absence of G1, G2 expression would be lower, leading to lower resistance. But in the case of g1 knockout, resistance is 75%, which is still pretty high. Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would eliminate all resistance, which matches the data (g2 is 0%). Then, G1 and G3 might be genes that enhance the activity of G2. For example, G1 and G3 could be involved in producing signals or proteins that activate G2. So if either G1 or G3 is missing, G2's activity is reduced, leading to lower resistance. If both are missing, G2's activity is even lower (10%). But if G2 itself is missing, then no resistance. 

This seems plausible. So G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream, and G1 and G3 are upstream genes that regulate G2's activity. The fact that the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single mutant suggests that G1 and G3 have additive effects on G2's function. 

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to G2's activation. For example, G1 might be in one pathway and G3 in another, both leading to the activation of G2. So if one pathway is disrupted (g1 or g3), G2 is partially active, but if both are disrupted (g1g3), G2 is barely active. 

But then, why does g1g3 have 10% resistance? Maybe there's a little residual activation of G2 even without G1 and G3, or another gene not considered here. 

Putting this all together, the conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute to the activation of G2, and their combined absence severely reduces resistance, but not as much as knocking out G2 itself. The epistatic relationships show that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2's function is necessary for the resistance, and the effects of G1 and G3 are mediated through G2. 

So the hierarchy is G1 and G3 → G2. Since the problem mentions that at least one is a transcription factor, and G2's knockout has the most severe effect, it's likely that G2 is the transcription factor. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor that is required for resistance, and G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2's activity.

Let's attempt to understand the interactions among these genes using the provided data. We're examining three genes: G1, G2, and G3, along with their mutants g1, g2, g3, and various double mutant combinations. The resistance percentages are given relative to the wild type, and we need to determine the genetic pathway or hierarchy, particularly since at least one gene is a transcription factor operating upstream of others.

To clarify the data: The wild type exhibits 100% resistance. For single mutants, g1 shows 75% resistance (a 25% decrease), g2 shows 0% resistance (completely susceptible), and g3 shows 50% resistance (a 50% decrease). Regarding double mutants, g1g3 exhibits 10% resistance (lower than either individual mutant), while both g2g3 and g1g2 show 0% resistance (identical to g2 alone).

Analyzing the single mutants first, g2's 0% resistance suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. When G2 is knocked out, resistance disappears completely, indicating G2 might be a crucial gene. Meanwhile, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but aren't as vital.

Examining the double mutants, g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is significantly lower than either single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%). This suggests G1 and G3 might function in parallel pathways, creating an additive or synergistic effect when both are knocked out. Interestingly, if purely additive, we might expect 25% resistance (since 100-25-50=25), but the actual 10% suggests a more complex interaction.

For the other double mutants, both g1g2 and g2g3 show 0% resistance, identical to g2 alone. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out along with either G1 or G3, the resistance matches that of the G2 knockout alone.

Alright, let's try to determine the interactions between these genes from the provided data. We have three genes: G1, G2, and G3, and the mutants are g1, g2, g3, along with their double mutants. The resistance percentages are compared to the wild type, and our goal is to ascertain the hierarchy or pathway of these genes, acknowledging that at least one gene is a transcription factor operating upstream of others.

To ensure accuracy, let's recap the data: The wild type displays 100% resistance. For the single mutants, g1 shows 75% resistance, a 25% decrease; g2 has 0% resistance, indicating total susceptibility; and g3 has 50% resistance, a 50% decrease. Regarding the double mutants: g1g3 shows 10% resistance, lower than either single mutant; g2g3 is 0%, identical to g2 alone; and g1g2 is also 0%, similar to g2 alone.

Let's analyze the single mutants first. The fact that g2 has 0% resistance implies that G2 is crucial for resistance, as its knockout results in complete loss of resistance. Therefore, G2 appears to be a key gene. G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical.

As for the double mutants, when g1g3 displays 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant (g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%), it implies that G1 and G3 might operate in parallel pathways. This results in a more severe phenotype when both are knocked out, indicating an additive or synergistic effect. The observed resistance is lower than expected (which would be 25% if simply additive), suggesting some form of interaction.

In the other double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, similar to g2 alone. This indicates that knocking out G2 in combination with either G1 or G3 yields the same resistance level as the G2 knockout by itself. This suggests G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2 functions upstream or is more influential in the pathway affecting resistance.

For example, G2 is necessary for some basal resistance, and G1 and G3 add to that. So in the g2 mutant, there's no basal resistance, so 0%. In g1, you lose some enhancement, so 75% of control. In g3, you lose more enhancement, 50%. But then, when you combine g1 and g3, you lose both enhancers, so maybe 25%? But the actual result is 10%, which is lower. Hmm, maybe there's a multiplicative effect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes are in a linear pathway. If G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would block the pathway entirely. If G1 and G3 are upstream, then their knockouts would only partially reduce the resistance. But in that case, the double knockout of G1 and G3 would be additive. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So maybe they are in parallel pathways that both contribute to activating G2. So if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 can't be activated, leading to a more severe phenotype. But wait, in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, so if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would make their contributions irrelevant. But in the g1g3 double mutant, if they are both upstream, then G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe G2 is acting upstream of G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance would be 0%, which matches the data. Then, in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are still active. But the resistance is 75%, so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still active. But if G2's only role is to activate G1 and G3, then knocking out G1 and G3 would make G2's activity irrelevant. So the resistance would be 0%, but the data says 10%. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe G2 has some function independent of G1 and G3. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still active and provides some resistance, but since G1 and G3 are knocked out, the total resistance is 10%. But that would mean that G2's independent function is 10%, and G1 and G3 contribute the rest. But in the g2 mutant, it's 0%, so maybe G2's independent function is 0%? That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pathway is G2 -> G1 -> G3. If G2 is upstream, activating G1, which activates G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not active, leading to 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G3 is not active, so resistance is lower. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which would mean that without G1, G3 is still active? But if G1 is required for G3, then g1 would have the same as g3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both require G2. So G2 is a transcription factor needed for both pathways. Then, in the g2 mutant, both pathways are inactive, so 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, only the G1 pathway is inactive, so the G3 pathway (which requires G2) is still active, giving 75% resistance. Similarly, in the g3 mutant, the G3 pathway is inactive, but G1 is active (with G2), giving 50% resistance. Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, both pathways are inactive, but since G2 is still active, maybe there's a residual 10% from another pathway or G2 itself. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. If G2 is the transcription factor, then maybe G2 has some residual function even without G1 and G3. But why would the double mutant g1g3 have 10%? That's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but with some redundancy. For example, G1 and G3 both contribute to a pathway downstream of G2. If G2 is upstream, then in the g2 mutant, the pathway is off (0%). In the g1 mutant, the pathway is partially active via G3, giving 75%. In the g3 mutant, partially active via G1, giving 50%. Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, the pathway is completely inactive, so 0%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, not matching. But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So maybe there's another pathway that contributes 10% resistance that's independent of G1, G2, and G3. But the question doesn't mention other genes, so maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think about epistatic relationships. If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would mean that G2 is downstream. So the pathway would be G1 and G3 → G2. Then, knocking out G2 would block the pathway regardless of G1 and G3. So the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 would have the same as g2 (0%). That matches the data. Then, the single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance because they can still signal through G2. The double mutant g1g3 would have both upstream genes knocked out, so G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, which is not 0%. Hmm, discrepancy here. Unless there's another pathway that allows for 10% resistance when both G1 and G3 are out. But according to the problem statement, we only have these three genes as candidates. So maybe the model isn't perfect, but the best fit is that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because the double mutants with G2 and either G1 or G3 are the same as G2 alone, which is epistatic. The g1g3 double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single, suggesting they act in parallel upstream of G2. So the 10% might be due to some residual activity or another factor not considered. But given the options, the conclusion would be that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream in the pathway. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream (wait, downstream?), but the problem says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So if G2 is downstream, then the transcription factor would be upstream. Wait, maybe G1 or G3 is the transcription factor. If G2 is downstream, then G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor regulating G2. For example, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, and G3 is another gene in a parallel pathway. But then, in the g1 mutant, G2 isn't activated, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is still quite high. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is the transcription factor, acting upstream to regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, their expression is normal (since G2 is still present), but their function is lost. So the resistance in g1 is 75%, meaning G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50%. Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so resistance is 25% (100 -25 -50 =25), but the data says 10%. Maybe there's a synergistic effect. But the key point is that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which would be the case if G2 is required for both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream, a transcription factor necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%). In the g3 mutant, G2 and G1 are active, so resistance is 50% (G3 contributes 50%). Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, even though G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so their contributions are gone, leading to 25% resistance. But the data says 10%, which is lower. Maybe there's an additive effect beyond just summing, or maybe G1 and G3 have some interaction. But the main point is that G2 is upstream, required for G1 and G3. Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, which both contribute additively to resistance. The double mutants with G2 and either G1 or G3 don't change the resistance because G2 is already knocked out, making G1 and G3 irrelevant. The g1g3 double mutant has lower resistance than either single, showing they work in parallel pathways downstream of G2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the hierarchy is G2 (transcription factor) → G1 and G3. G1 and G3 act in separate pathways downstream of G2, contributing additively to resistance. When both are knocked out, resistance is almost gone (10%), but since G2 is still present, maybe there's a tiny residual effect. The key is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, as knocking out G2 nullifies any effect of G1 or G3. Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, which function in partially redundant pathways to confer resistance.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444022, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3064, prompt_tokens=808, total_tokens=3872, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

From the experimental data, the following conclusions can be drawn about the interaction of the genes **G1**, **G2**, and **G3** in anthracnose resistance:

1. **G2 is a critical transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3**:
   - The **g2** mutant shows **0% resistance**, indicating that **G2 is essential** for resistance. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor required to activate downstream genes (G1 and G3). Without G2, the entire resistance pathway collapses.
   - In double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, resistance remains **0%** (same as **g2** alone), confirming that **G2 is epistatic** to G1 and G3. This means G2’s function is necessary for G1 and G3 to contribute to resistance.

2. **G1 and G3 act in partially redundant pathways downstream of G2**:
   - The **g1** mutant retains **75% resistance**, and the **g3** mutant retains **50% resistance**, showing that both genes contribute to resistance but are not individually essential. Their partial loss suggests they function in parallel pathways downstream of G2.
   - The **g1g3** double mutant has **10% resistance**, significantly lower than either single mutant. This indicates **additive/synergistic effects** when both G1 and G3 are absent, further supporting their roles in distinct but complementary pathways.

3. **Hierarchical relationship**:
   - The hierarchy is **G2 (transcription factor) → G1 and G3 (effectors)**. G2 regulates or enables the function of G1 and G3, which then act in parallel to confer resistance. The residual 10% resistance in **g1g3** may stem from minor contributions of other uncharacterized factors or weak basal activity of G2.

**Conclusion**: **G2 is the upstream transcription factor required to activate G1 and G3**, which function in partially redundant pathways to mediate anthracnose resistance. Loss of G2 abolishes all resistance, while loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance proportionally, and their combined loss nearly eliminates it.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

aeans that G2's function is downstream of G1 and G3, or that G2 is required for G1 and G3 to function. Wait, but if G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would mask the effects of G1 and G3. So in the double mutants, since G2 is already knocked out, the additional knockout of G1 or G3 doesn't make a difference. That would fit with G2 being downstream.

But wait, in the case of g1g3, which is 10%, that's lower than either single mutant, so maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance is almost gone, but not entirely. But since G2 is a transcription factor upstream, maybe G2 regulates both G1 and G3? Or maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but have some redundancy.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of G1 and G3. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, their resistance is reduced but not eliminated. So if G2 is upstream, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in reality, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, which is worse than the g1 and g3 mutants. So maybe G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. Alternatively, G2 could be part of a separate pathway.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 enhance the resistance. For example, G2 is necessary for some basal resistance, and G1 and G3 add to that. So in the g2 mutant, there's no basal resistance, so 0%. In g1, you lose some enhancement, so 75% of control. In g3, you lose more enhancement, 50%. But then, when you combine g1 and g3, you lose both enhancers, so maybe 25%? But the actual result is 10%, which is lower. Hmm, maybe there's a multiplicative effect.

Alternatively, maybe the genes are in a linear pathway. If G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would block the pathway entirely. If G1 and G3 are upstream, then their knockouts would only partially reduce the resistance. But in that case, the double knockout of G1 and G3 would be additive. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So maybe they are in parallel pathways that both contribute to activating G2. So if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 can't be activated, leading to a more severe phenotype. But wait, in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, so if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would make their contributions irrelevant. But in the g1g3 double mutant, if they are both upstream, then G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G2 is acting upstream of G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance would be 0%, which matches the data. Then, in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are still active. But the resistance is 75%, so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still active. But if G2's only role is to activate G1 and G3, then knocking out G1 and G3 would make G2's activity irrelevant. So the resistance would be 0%, but the data says 10%. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe G2 has some function independent of G1 and G3. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still active and provides some resistance, but since G1 and G3 are knocked out, the total resistance is 10%. But that would mean that G2's independent function is 10%, and G1 and G3 contribute the rest. But in the g2 mutant, it's 0%, so maybe G2's independent function is 0%? That doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe the pathway is G2 -> G1 -> G3. If G2 is upstream, activating G1, which activates G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not active, leading to 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G3 is not active, so resistance is lower. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which would mean that without G1, G3 is still active? But if G1 is required for G3, then g1 would have the same as g3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both require G2. So G2 is a transcription factor needed for both pathways. Then, in the g2 mutant, both pathways are inactive, so 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, only the G1 pathway is inactive, so the G3 pathway (which requires G2) is still active, giving 75% resistance. Similarly, in the g3 mutant, the G3 pathway is inactive, but G1 is active (with G2), giving 50% resistance. Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, both pathways are inactive, but since G2 is still active, maybe there's a residual 10% from another pathway or G2 itself. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. If G2 is the transcription factor, then maybe G2 has some residual function even without G1 and G3. But why would the double mutant g1g3 have 10%? That's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but with some redundancy. For example, G1 and G3 both contribute to a pathway downstream of G2. If G2 is upstream, then in the g2 mutant, the pathway is off (0%). In the g1 mutant, the pathway is partially active via G3, giving 75%. In the g3 mutant, partially active via G1, giving 50%. Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, the pathway is completely inactive, so 0%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, not matching. But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So maybe there's another pathway that contributes 10% resistance that's independent of G1, G2, and G3. But the question doesn't mention other genes, so maybe not.

Wait, let's think about epistatic relationships. If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would mean that G2 is downstream. So the pathway would be G1 and G3 → G2. Then, knocking out G2 would block the pathway regardless of G1 and G3. So the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 would have the same as g2 (0%). That matches the data. Then, the single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance because they can still signal through G2. The double mutant g1g3 would have both upstream genes knocked out, so G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, which is not 0%. Hmm, discrepancy here. Unless there's another pathway that allows for 10% resistance when both G1 and G3 are out. But according to the problem statement, we only have these three genes as candidates. So maybe the model isn't perfect, but the best fit is that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because the double mutants with G2 and either G1 or G3 are the same as G2 alone, which is epistatic. The g1g3 double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single, suggesting they act in parallel upstream of G2. So the 10% might be due to some residual activity or another factor not considered. But given the options, the conclusion would be that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream in the pathway. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream (wait, downstream?), but the problem says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So if G2 is downstream, then the transcription factor would be upstream. Wait, maybe G1 or G3 is the transcription factor. If G2 is downstream, then G1 or G3 could be the transcription factor regulating G2. For example, G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2, and G3 is another gene in a parallel pathway. But then, in the g1 mutant, G2 isn't activated, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is still quite high. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, G2 is the transcription factor, acting upstream to regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But in the single mutants of G1 or G3, their expression is normal (since G2 is still present), but their function is lost. So the resistance in g1 is 75%, meaning G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50%. Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so resistance is 25% (100 -25 -50 =25), but the data says 10%. Maybe there's a synergistic effect. But the key point is that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which would be the case if G2 is required for both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream, a transcription factor necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%). In the g3 mutant, G2 and G1 are active, so resistance is 50% (G3 contributes 50%). Then, in the g1g3 double mutant, even though G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so their contributions are gone, leading to 25% resistance. But the data says 10%, which is lower. Maybe there's an additive effect beyond just summing, or maybe G1 and G3 have some interaction. But the main point is that G2 is upstream, required for G1 and G3. Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, which both contribute additively to resistance. The double mutants with G2 and either G1 or G3 don't change the resistance because G2 is already knocked out, making G1 and G3 irrelevant. The g1g3 double mutant has lower resistance than either single, showing they work in parallel pathways downstream of G2.

So putting it all together, the hierarchy is G2 (transcription factor) → G1 and G3. G1 and G3 act in separate pathways downstream of G2, contributing additively to resistance. When both are knocked out, resistance is almost gone (10%), but since G2 is still present, maybe there's a tiny residual effect. The key is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, as knocking out G2 nullifies any effect of G1 or G3. Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, which function in partially redundant pathways to confer resistance.

If G2 is required for G1 and G3 to be active, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. However, in the single mutants of G1 or G3, the remaining genes (including G2) can still provide some resistance. For example, in g1, G2 and G3 are functional. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1, G3 might still be active (if G2 is present), contributing to 50% resistance. Wait, but the g3 mutant has 50% resistance. If G3 is downstream of G2, then knocking out G3 would mean that even though G2 is active, it can't act through G3. But G1 is still present. So maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, which work in parallel. So in the wild type, G2 activates both G1 and G3, each contributing to resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then G3 can still contribute 50% (so G3's contribution is 50%, and G1's is 50% as well, since 100% - 75% = 25% loss from G1, but that doesn't add up). Alternatively, maybe the contributions are not additive in a simple way. \n\nAlternatively, the resistance pathway might have two branches: one through G1 and another through G3, both activated by G2. So, if G2 is knocked out, both branches are inactive (0% resistance). If G1 is knocked out, the G3 branch still works, providing 50% resistance. If G3 is knocked out, the G1 branch works, providing 75% resistance. Then, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), only 10% resistance remains, which might be a residual effect or another pathway. But this doesn't fit exactly with the numbers. Let's check:\n\nIf G2 is upstream, activating G1 and G3. Then:\n\n- Wild type: G2 activates both G1 and G3, leading to 100% resistance.\n\n- g1: G2 and G3 active. If G3 alone provides 50%, then the resistance would be 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. For example, G2 activates G1, which activates G3. Then:\n\n- g2: 0% (no activation of G1 or G3).\n\n- g1: G3 is not activated, so same as g3? But g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 have independent functions. For example, G2 is a transcription factor that upregulates both G1 and G3. In the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then G3 is still expressed (since G2 is functional), contributing 50% resistance. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out (g3), G1 is expressed, contributing 75% resistance. Then, the double mutant g1g3 would have neither G1 nor G3, but since G2 is present, maybe there's a residual 10% from another pathway or a partial function. However, the data shows that g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant. This might suggest that G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance, and their combined absence leads to a more severe phenotype. But if G2 is upstream, then in the presence of G2, even if G1 and G3 are knocked out, perhaps there's another gene (not tested here) contributing, but the 10% is still lower than either single mutant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both require G2. So, G2 is necessary for both pathways. If G1 is knocked out, the G3 pathway (via G2) works at 50%, and vice versa. If both are knocked out, only 10% remains, perhaps from another minor pathway. But then, why does g1g3 have lower resistance than either single mutant? If they are additive, then 50% (g3) + 75% (g1) would be more than 100%, but that's not the case. Wait, the resistance is multiplicative? If each gene contributes a certain factor, but in the mutants, their contributions are reduced. For example, if G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, then the total would be 75% (100% -25% from G1) and 50% (100% -50% from G3). But when both are knocked out, the total would be 100% -25% -50% = 25%, but the actual data is 10%, which is lower. So maybe there's an interaction where the presence of one gene enhances the effect of the other. \n\nAlternatively, the genes might work in a redundant manner. If G1 and G3 can compensate for each other, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. The data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, so when both are missing, the resistance is almost gone. However, the presence of G2 in the double mutant g1g3 might still allow some residual resistance (10%), but that's speculative. \n\nLooking at the other double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the phenotype of one gene (here, G2) masks the effect of another gene. If G2 is non-functional, then the status of G1 and G3 doesn't matter. This implies that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. So, in the pathway, G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. For example, G2 might encode a transcription factor that activates the expression of G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so their individual knockouts don't add any further effect. Hence, g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2. \n\nBut in the single mutants g1 and g3, since G2 is functional, their knockouts reduce resistance but don't eliminate it. This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance when G2 is active. So, G2 might regulate G1 and G3, which in turn contribute additively to resistance. For example, G2 activates both G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance. If G1 is knocked out, G3 can still contribute (50%), and vice versa. When both are knocked out (g1g3), even though G2 is active, there's very little resistance left (10%), perhaps from another minor pathway or a small residual effect. \n\nPutting this together, the hierarchy would be G2 acting upstream, regulating both G1 and G3, which function in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. The additive effect of G1 and G3 is seen in the double mutant g1g3, which has lower resistance than either single mutant.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

From the experimental data, the following conclusions can be drawn about the interaction of the genes **G1**, **G2**, and **G3** in anthracnose resistance:

1. **G2 is essential for resistance and acts upstream of G1 and G3**:
   - The **g2** mutant has **0% resistance**, indicating that **G2 is indispensable** for resistance. 
   - In double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, resistance remains **0%** (same as **g2** alone). This **epistatic relationship** shows that **G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3**. If G2 is non-functional, the downstream effects of G1 and G3 are irrelevant.

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance downstream of G2**:
   - **g1** (75% resistance) and **g3** (50% resistance) retain partial resistance, suggesting they act in **parallel pathways** that depend on G2. 
   - The **g1g3** double mutant (10% resistance) shows a **synergistic effect**, where the combined loss of G1 and G3 results in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. This implies their roles are partially redundant but collectively critical for full resistance.

3. **Hierarchical pathway**:
   - **G2** likely encodes a **transcription factor** that regulates the expression or activity of **G1** and **G3**. 
   - **G1** and **G3** function in **distinct but complementary pathways** downstream of G2, each contributing to resistance. Their combined loss (g1g3) leaves only minimal residual resistance (10%), possibly from a minor secondary pathway.

**Summary**:  
**G2** is the master regulator (transcription factor) upstream of **G1** and **G3**, which act in parallel to confer resistance. Loss of G2 abolishes resistance entirely, while loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance partially, and their combined loss nearly eliminates it.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

If G2 is non-functional, the downstream effects of G1 and G3 become irrelevant, hence the same 0% resistance.

Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the likely candidate. If G2 is a transcription factor, it might regulate the expression of G1 and G3. However, the data shows that G1 and G3 still contribute to resistance even when G2 is functional. This suggests that G2 might not be the sole regulator. Alternatively, G2 could be part of a pathway where G1 and G3 have roles that are partially independent but still influenced by G2. The additive effect in g1g3 suggests that G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, but both are dependent on G2. 

Wait, but if G2 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would negate the effects of G1 and G3. However, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, their resistance is reduced but not eliminated, implying that G2's function is still present. Therefore, G2 might be acting in a separate pathway that's essential, while G1 and G3 contribute in another pathway. Alternatively, G2 could be a master regulator, and the partial resistance in g1 and g3 suggests that G2 can still function to some degree even when G1 or G3 are knocked out. But that doesn't align with the double mutants. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3. If G2 is required for G1 and G3 to be active, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance.
