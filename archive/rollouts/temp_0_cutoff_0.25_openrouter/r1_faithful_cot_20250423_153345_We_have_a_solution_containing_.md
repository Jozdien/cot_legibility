To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by considering the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \) and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

1. **Assumption of Free SCN⁻ Concentration**:
   - We assume the free SCN⁻ concentration is approximately 0.1 M, as the problem states \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), which typically denotes the equilibrium (free) concentration in chemical notation.

2. **Expressing Complex Concentrations**:
   - Using the stability constants and the free SCN⁻ concentration, we express the concentrations of each cobalt complex in terms of the free Co²+ concentration (\([Co^{2+}] = c_0\)):
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] &= \beta_1 \cdot c_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot c_0 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 c_0, \\
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] &= \beta_2 \cdot c_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot c_0 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 c_0, \\
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] &= \beta_3 \cdot c_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot c_0 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 c_0, \\
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] &= \beta_4 \cdot c_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot c_0 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 c_0.
     \end{aligned}
     \]

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   - Summing all cobalt species:
     \[
     c_0 + 0.9 c_0 + 0.4 c_0 + 0.063 c_0 + 0.0016 c_0 = c_0 (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c_0 \cdot 2.3646.
     \]
   - Given \( c(\text{Co}) = 0.01 \, \text{M} \):
     \[
     c_0 \cdot 2.3646 = 0.01 \implies c_0 = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \, \text{M}.
     \]

4. **Concentration of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   - The concentration of \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]\) is:
     \[
     0.4 \cdot c_0 = 0.4 \cdot 0.00423 \approx 0.00169 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]\) among all cobalt species:
     \[
     \left( \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.9\%.
     \]

6. **Considering SCN⁻ Consumption**:
   - Iterative calculations adjusting for SCN⁻ consumption showed a slight decrease in the percentage, but the problem's context suggests using the free SCN⁻ concentration. The final answer, considering standard notation and approximations, rounds to 17%.

\[
\boxed{17\%}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me start by understanding the problem.

We have a solution with Co²+ ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with each successive ligand addition, but here β3 is higher than β4. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe the values are correct? Hmm. Let me check. If β1 is for [Co(SCN)]⁺, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, then sometimes the stability constants can decrease after a certain point. Maybe the fourth ligand isn't as stable. I'll proceed with the given values.

The question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the complex with two SCN⁻ ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]. The formula for the distribution of complexes involves the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

First, let's recall that the stability constants (β) are cumulative. So β1 is for the first complex: Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with β1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]). Similarly, β2 is for Co²+ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂], so β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2). Same for β3 and β4.

The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all the complexes and the free Co²+:

c(Co) = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10^-2 M.

Given that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration, we might assume that the free SCN⁻ concentration is approximately 0.1 M, because the amount of SCN⁻ consumed by complexation with Co²+ is negligible compared to 0.1 M. Let me check that. The total cobalt is 0.01 M, and if each Co can bind up to 4 SCN⁻, the maximum SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.01*4 = 0.04 M. But since [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, 0.04 M is 40% of it, which is not negligible. Hmm, so maybe the assumption is not valid. But maybe the actual consumption is less because not all Co is in the highest complex. Let's see. If most of the Co is in the lower complexes, like up to β2 or β3, then the SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.01*(average number of SCN⁻ per Co). If the average is, say, 2, then 0.02 M consumed, which is 20% of 0.1 M. Still significant. So maybe we can't assume [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. Hmm, this complicates things. Then we might need to set up equations considering the change in [SCN⁻]. But that would require solving a more complex system. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to proceed with the approximation that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M, even though it's not strictly valid. Let me see what the problem expects. Since the SCN⁻ concentration is given as 0.1 M, perhaps they consider that as the free concentration, so we don't have to adjust for the complexation. That would make the problem easier. Let me check standard problems. Usually, when the ligand is in large excess, the free ligand concentration is approximated as the total concentration. But here, the ligand is 0.1 M and cobalt is 0.01 M. The ligand is 10 times higher, but if each Co takes up 4 ligands, then 0.01*4=0.04, which is 40% of 0.1. So maybe the approximation is not great. But perhaps the problem still wants us to proceed with [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. Let's tentatively proceed with that, and then check if the assumption holds.

So, if [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, then we can express each complex concentration in terms of [Co²+].

Let me denote [Co²+] as c0, then:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 * c0 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * c0 * 0.1 = 0.9 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * c0 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * c0 * 0.01 = 0.4 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^3 = 63 * c0 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * c0 * 0.001 = 0.063 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^4 = 16 * c0 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * c0 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 c0

Then the total cobalt concentration is:

c0 + 0.9 c0 + 0.4 c0 + 0.063 c0 + 0.0016 c0 = c0 (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0 * 2.3646

But the total cobalt is 0.01 M, so:

c0 * 2.3646 = 0.01 → c0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.4 * c0 ≈ 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169 M

The percentage is ([Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)) * 100 = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.9%

But wait, this is under the assumption that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. However, if the SCN⁻ consumed is significant, this might not hold. Let's check how much SCN⁻ is consumed.

Each complex contributes n * [Co(SCN)_n], so:

Total SCN⁻ consumed = 1*[Co(SCN)⁺] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

Plugging in the values:

= 1*(0.9 c0) + 2*(0.4 c0) + 3*(0.063 c0) + 4*(0.0016 c0)

= 0.9 c0 + 0.8 c0 + 0.189 c0 + 0.0064 c0

= (0.9 + 0.8 + 0.189 + 0.0064) c0 ≈ 1.8954 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00423 M, total SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.8954 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00803 M

So the free SCN⁻ would be 0.1 - 0.00803 ≈ 0.09197 M, which is approximately 0.092 M. So the initial assumption that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M is off by about 8%. That might affect the result. So perhaps we need to iterate.

Let me try to adjust the [SCN⁻] to 0.092 M and recalculate.

First iteration:

[SCN⁻] = 0.092 M

Recalculate the complex concentrations:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.092 = 0.828 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * (0.092)^2 = 40 * c0 * 0.008464 = 0.33856 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c0 * (0.092)^3 ≈ 63 * c0 * 0.000778688 ≈ 0.04906 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c0 * (0.092)^4 ≈ 16 * c0 * 0.0000716 ≈ 0.001146 c0

Total cobalt concentration:

c0 (1 + 0.828 + 0.33856 + 0.04906 + 0.001146) ≈ c0 * 2.2168

So c0 = 0.01 / 2.2168 ≈ 0.00451 M

Then, SCN⁻ consumed:

1*(0.828 c0) + 2*(0.33856 c0) + 3*(0.04906 c0) + 4*(0.001146 c0)

= 0.828 c0 + 0.67712 c0 + 0.14718 c0 + 0.004584 c0 ≈ (0.828 + 0.67712 + 0.14718 + 0.004584) c0 ≈ 1.65688 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00451 M, SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.65688 * 0.00451 ≈ 0.00747 M

Thus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00747 ≈ 0.09253 M

Wait, the previous estimate was 0.092 M, and now after recalculating, it's 0.09253 M. The change is small. So the adjustment is minimal. Let's do another iteration.

Second iteration:

[SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M

Recalculate complexes:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.0925 ≈ 0.8325 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * c0 * 0.008556 ≈ 0.34225 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c0 * (0.0925)^3 ≈ 63 * c0 * 0.000791 ≈ 0.04983 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c0 * (0.0925)^4 ≈ 16 * c0 * 0.0000731 ≈ 0.00117 c0

Total cobalt:

c0 (1 + 0.8325 + 0.34225 + 0.04983 + 0.00117) ≈ c0 * 2.22575

c0 ≈ 0.01 / 2.22575 ≈ 0.004493 M

SCN⁻ consumed:

1*(0.8325 c0) + 2*(0.34225 c0) + 3*(0.04983 c0) + 4*(0.00117 c0)

≈ 0.8325 c0 + 0.6845 c0 + 0.1495 c0 + 0.00468 c0 ≈ 1.67018 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.004493 M, SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.67018 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.00750 M

Free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00750 ≈ 0.0925 M

So after two iterations, the free [SCN⁻] stabilizes around 0.0925 M. The change is minimal, so we can stop here.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.34225 * c0 ≈ 0.34225 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.001538 M

Total cobalt is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.001538 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.38%

Comparing this with the initial approximation of ~16.9%, the adjustment for SCN⁻ consumption brings it down to ~15.4%. But maybe even more precise iterations would change it slightly, but probably the answer expects using the initial approximation. However, since the problem states the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M, perhaps they consider that as the free concentration, so the first calculation of ~16.9% is acceptable. But given that the SCN⁻ consumption is not negligible, the more accurate answer is around 15.4%.

But let's check the problem statement again. It says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". This could be interpreted as the total concentration of SCN⁻, which would include both free and bound SCN⁻. But in the context of such problems, usually, when they give the concentration of the ligand, it's the total concentration unless specified as free. However, in our case, the problem might be intending that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M as the free concentration. But if it's the total SCN⁻, then we have to account for both free and bound.

Wait, this is a crucial point. If the problem states that the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M, does that mean total SCN⁻ (free + complexes) or free SCN⁻? Typically, in such problems, if they say "the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M", it refers to the total concentration. But in the context of equilibrium calculations, sometimes they might specify. If it's total SCN⁻, then we have to set up the equation considering that.

But in the problem statement, it's written as "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote the equilibrium concentration, i.e., free SCN⁻. So maybe the problem is giving the free SCN⁻ concentration as 0.1 M. If that's the case, then our initial calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, if it's the total SCN⁻, then we need to adjust.

But given the square brackets, which in chemistry usually mean the equilibrium (free) concentration, I think the problem is stating that [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is the free concentration. Therefore, the first calculation where we didn't adjust for SCN⁻ consumption is the correct approach, leading to ~16.9%.

But wait, the problem says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If that's the total SCN⁻, then we have to write:

Total SCN⁻ = [SCN⁻]free + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

But that complicates things because we have two equations:

1. c(Co) = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M

2. c(SCN) = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

This would require solving a system of equations. But this is more complex. However, given that the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", which is ambiguous, but likely refers to the free SCN⁻. Let's check the problem statement again: "where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". The cobalt is specified as total, but SCN⁻ is in square brackets, which usually means free. So probably, the problem wants us to take [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M as the free ligand concentration.

Therefore, proceeding with the first calculation where [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, leading to ~16.9%. But the answer might expect rounding to two significant figures, so 17%. However, the given stability constants are given as integers, so maybe the answer is 16% or 17%.

But let's check the exact calculation again with [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

Total cobalt species:

[Co²+] = c0

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 * c0 * 0.1 = 9 * c0 * 0.1 = 0.9 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * 0.1² = 40 * c0 * 0.01 = 0.4 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * 0.1³ = 63 * c0 * 0.001 = 0.063 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 * c0 * 0.1⁴ = 16 * c0 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 c0

Total = c0 (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0 * 2.3646

c0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

[Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169 M

Percentage = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.9%

So approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, the problem might expect an exact answer using the given β values without considering SCN⁻ consumption. Alternatively, if they consider SCN⁻ consumption, the answer is around 15.4%. But given the problem's wording, I think they expect the first approach.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is higher than β4. That's unusual. Normally, the stability constants increase with each successive ligand addition, but here β4 is lower than β3. That might indicate that the fourth ligand is less stable. But in any case, we have to use the given values.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses stepwise constants instead of cumulative. Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16". Stability constants (βn) are usually cumulative, meaning βn is the product of the stepwise constants K1*K2*...*Kn. If that's the case, then the values given are cumulative. But if they were stepwise, the fourth step would have a lower K, which is possible. But since they are labeled β1 to β4, they are cumulative.

But regardless, the calculation proceeds as above.

Another way to check: if β1=9, β2=40, then the stepwise K2 = β2/β1 = 40/9 ≈ 4.44. Then K3 = β3/β2 = 63/40 = 1.575, and K4 = β4/β3 = 16/63 ≈ 0.254. So the fourth step has a lower K, which is possible. So the complexes become less stable as more ligands are added beyond the third. That's acceptable.

So, proceeding with the initial calculation, the answer is approximately 16.9%. But let's check if the problem expects an exact fraction.

Alternatively, compute it more precisely.

Total cobalt species denominator:

1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4

= 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

= 1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] is β2[SCN]^2 / total = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691, which is 16.91%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, the problem might expect the answer to be in two significant figures, so 17%. But let's see the options. If it's an exam question, sometimes they want an exact fraction. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16.9%, which can be written as 17%.

But let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, using the formula for the distribution:

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is (β2 * [SCN⁻]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4)

Plugging in the numbers:

= (40 * 0.1^2) / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.1^2 + 63*0.1^3 + 16*0.1^4)

= (40 * 0.01) / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016)

= 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691 → 16.91%

So the answer is approximately 16.9%, which is 16.9%. Depending on the problem's requirement, it might be 17%, but since the given data has β as integers and concentrations with one significant figure (0.1 M is one significant figure, but 10^-2 is two), maybe the answer should have two significant figures, so 17%. However, 0.1 M is one significant figure, which would suggest the answer should be 20%, but that seems too rough. Alternatively, since 0.1 M is given as 0.1 (which could be two significant figures if the decimal is present), but usually 0.1 is one, 0.10 is two. The problem says 0.1 M, so one significant figure. But the cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, two significant figures. Hmm, conflicting. But the stability constants are given as integers, which are exact. So perhaps the answer should be two significant figures, 17%.

But let me check the exact calculation again:

0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1691, which is 16.91%, so 16.9% or 17%.

But the problem might expect rounding to the nearest whole number, so 17%.

However, considering that in the initial approximation without considering SCN⁻ consumption, the answer is ~17%, but when adjusting for SCN⁻ consumption, it's ~15.4%. But since the problem states [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, which is likely the free concentration, the correct answer is 16.9%, which rounds to 17%.

But wait, the given β4=16 is less than β3=63. That might affect the calculation, but we've already included all terms.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and β4 should be higher, but we have to use the given values.

In conclusion, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 16.9%, which is closest to 17%. However, looking back, when I did the iteration considering SCN⁻ consumption, the percentage was ~15.4%. But if the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M as free, then 16.9% is correct. If it's total SCN⁻, then it's different. But given the problem's wording, I think it's free SCN⁻, so 16.9% is the answer. But let's verify once more.

If [SCN⁻] is free, then the calculation is straightforward as done. If it's total, then we need to solve the system. Let's attempt that.

Let’s denote:

Total Co: T_Co = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M

Total SCN: T_SCN = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

Express all complexes in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN⁻]:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^2

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^3

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^4

Let’s let x = [Co²+] and y = [SCN⁻]

Then:

T_Co = x + β1 x y + β2 x y² + β3 x y³ + β4 x y⁴ = 0.01

T_SCN = y + β1 x y + 2 β2 x y² + 3 β3 x y³ + 4 β4 x y⁴ = 0.1

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and y. Solving this system would give the exact values. However, this is a nonlinear system and might require numerical methods.

Let’s attempt to solve it.

First, express T_Co:

x (1 + β1 y + β2 y² + β3 y³ + β4 y⁴) = 0.01 → x = 0.01 / (1 + β1 y + β2 y² + β3 y³ + β4 y⁴)

Similarly, T_SCN:

y + x (β1 y + 2 β2 y² + 3 β3 y³ + 4 β4 y⁴) = 0.1

Substitute x from the first equation into the second:

y + (0.01 / (1 + β1 y + β2 y² + β3 y³ + β4 y⁴)) * (β1 y + 2 β2 y² + 3 β3 y³ + 4 β4 y⁴) = 0.1

This equation can be solved numerically for y. Let's denote:

Let’s define f(y) = y + (0.01 / D) * N - 0.1 = 0, where D = 1 + β1 y + β2 y² + β3 y³ + β4 y⁴, and N = β1 y + 2 β2 y² + 3 β3 y³ + 4 β4 y⁴

We need to find y such that f(y) = 0.

Let’s start with an initial guess. Earlier, when we assumed y=0.1, we found that the consumed SCN⁻ was ~0.008 M, leading to y≈0.092. Let's use y=0.09 as a guess.

Compute f(0.09):

D = 1 + 9*0.09 + 40*(0.09)^2 + 63*(0.09)^3 + 16*(0.09)^4

Calculate each term:

9*0.09 = 0.81

40*(0.09)^2 = 40*0.0081 = 0.324

63*(0.09)^3 = 63*0.000729 ≈ 0.0459

16*(0.09)^4 = 16*0.0006561 ≈ 0.0105

So D = 1 + 0.81 + 0.324 + 0.0459 + 0.0105 ≈ 2.1904

N = 9*0.09 + 2*40*(0.09)^2 + 3*63*(0.09)^3 + 4*16*(0.09)^4

Calculate each term:

9*0.09 = 0.81

2*40*0.0081 = 2*0.324 = 0.648

3*63*0.000729 ≈ 3*0.0459 ≈ 0.1377

4*16*0.0006561 ≈ 4*0.0105 ≈ 0.042

So N = 0.81 + 0.648 + 0.1377 + 0.042 ≈ 1.6377

Then f(0.09) = 0.09 + (0.01 / 2.1904) * 1.6377 - 0.1

Calculate (0.01 / 2.1904) ≈ 0.004565

0.004565 * 1.6377 ≈ 0.00748

So f(0.09) ≈ 0.09 + 0.00748 - 0.1 = -0.00252

So f(0.09) ≈ -0.00252 < 0

We need f(y) = 0. Let's try y=0.095

Compute D and N at y=0.095:

D = 1 + 9*0.095 + 40*(0.095)^2 + 63*(0.095)^3 + 16*(0.095)^4

Calculate:

9*0.095 = 0.855

40*(0.095)^2 = 40*0.009025 = 0.361

63*(0.095)^3 ≈ 63*0.000857 ≈ 0.054

16*(0.095)^4 ≈ 16*0.0000815 ≈ 0.001304

D ≈ 1 + 0.855 + 0.361 + 0.054 + 0.001304 ≈ 2.2713

N = 9*0.095 + 2*40*(0.095)^2 + 3*63*(0.095)^3 + 4*16*(0.095)^4

= 0.855 + 2*0.361 + 3*0.054 + 4*0.001304

= 0.855 + 0.722 + 0.162 + 0.005216 ≈ 1.7442

f(0.095) = 0.095 + (0.01 / 2.2713) * 1.7442 - 0.1

Calculate (0.01 / 2.2713) ≈ 0.004403

0.004403 * 1.7442 ≈ 0.00768

f(0.095) ≈ 0.095 + 0.00768 - 0.1 = 0.00268 > 0

So f(0.095) ≈ +0.00268

We have f(0.09) = -0.00252 and f(0.095) = +0.00268. We need to find y where f(y)=0 between 0.09 and 0.095.

Use linear approximation:

The difference in y is 0.005, and the difference in f(y) is 0.00268 - (-0.00252) = 0.0052

We need to find Δy such that f(y) = 0 at y = 0.09 + Δy*(0.005)/0.0052

Wait, the change needed is from -0.00252 to 0, which is Δf = 0.00252 over a total Δf range of 0.0052 over Δy=0.005.

So Δy = (0.00252 / 0.0052) * 0.005 ≈ (0.00252 / 0.0052) * 0.005 ≈ 0.00242

So y ≈ 0.09 + 0.00242 ≈ 0.09242

Check f(0.09242):

Compute D and N at y=0.09242

D = 1 + 9*0.09242 + 40*(0.09242)^2 + 63*(0.09242)^3 + 16*(0.09242)^4

Calculate each term:

9*0.09242 ≈ 0.8318

40*(0.09242)^2 ≈ 40*0.00854 ≈ 0.3416

63*(0.09242)^3 ≈ 63*(0.000789) ≈ 0.0497

16*(0.09242)^4 ≈ 16*(0.0000729) ≈ 0.001166

D ≈ 1 + 0.8318 + 0.3416 + 0.0497 + 0.001166 ≈ 2.2243

N = 9*0.09242 + 2*40*(0.09242)^2 + 3*63*(0.09242)^3 + 4*16*(0.09242)^4

= 0.8318 + 2*0.3416 + 3*0.0497 + 4*0.001166

= 0.8318 + 0.6832 + 0.1491 + 0.004664 ≈ 1.6688

f(y) = 0.09242 + (0.01 / 2.2243) * 1.6688 - 0.1

Calculate (0.01 / 2.2243) ≈ 0.004496

0.004496 * 1.6688 ≈ 0.00750

f(y) ≈ 0.09242 + 0.00750 - 0.1 = 0.0000

Wow, that's very close. So y ≈ 0.09242 M

Thus, the free SCN⁻ concentration is approximately 0.0924 M

Now, compute x = [Co²+] = 0.01 / D = 0.01 / 2.2243 ≈ 0.004496 M

Now, compute [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x y² = 40 * 0.004496 * (0.09242)^2

Calculate (0.09242)^2 ≈ 0.00854

So [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 40 * 0.004496 * 0.00854 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M

Percentage = (0.001536 / 0.01) * 100 = 15.36%

So approximately 15.4%

This is the accurate calculation considering both total Co and total SCN⁻. Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 15.4%. But the problem might expect the answer considering free SCN⁻ as 0.1 M, leading to ~17%. However, given that the problem states the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M without specifying it's free, but in chemical notation, [SCN⁻] usually refers to free, but if it's total, then the answer is ~15.4%. This is ambiguous.

But given that the problem mentions "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", and in equilibrium problems, when they give the concentration of a ligand without specifying, it's often the total concentration. However, the use of square brackets might imply equilibrium concentration. This is a common ambiguity.

Given the problem's context, if we assume [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, answer is ~17%. If it's total, answer is ~15.4%. Since the problem didn't specify, but used square brackets, which usually denote free concentration, the answer is likely 17%. However, in the detailed calculation considering total SCN⁻, it's ~15.4%. This discrepancy shows the importance of clear problem statements.

But given that in the initial problem statement, the cobalt concentration is given as total ("total cobalt concentration"), while SCN⁻ is given as "[SCN⁻] concentration", which is ambiguous. If they wanted total SCN⁻, they should have written "total thiocyanate concentration". Therefore, it's more consistent that [SCN⁻] refers to the free concentration. Hence, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%.

But to confirm, let's check some references. In analytical chemistry problems, when they say "the concentration of ligand is X", it's usually the total unless specified as free. However, the use of square brackets might indicate equilibrium concentration. This is a bit confusing. For example, in the problem, total cobalt is specified as c(Co), but SCN⁻ is given as [SCN⁻], which might imply free. Therefore, the answer is 17%.

But given that when we solved considering both total Co and total SCN, we got ~15.4%, which is significantly different. This suggests that the problem might have intended [SCN⁻] as free, otherwise, the answer would require more involved calculation.

Given the time I've spent, and considering that in most textbook problems, if the ligand is in excess, they assume [SCN⁻] ≈ total SCN⁻. But here, since SCN⁻ is not in large excess (only 0.1 M vs Co 0.01 M), the accurate answer requires solving the system. However, the problem might expect the student to proceed with the assumption that [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, leading to 17%.

But since the accurate calculation gives ~15.4%, and the problem might have intended that, but given the square brackets, I'm torn. However, to reconcile, perhaps the answer is 16.9%, which is approximately 17%, and that's what the problem expects.

But wait, the given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Let me check if these are log values? No, because log β values for Co(SCN) complexes are typically around 1-3 for each step. For example, Co²+ with SCN⁻ might have log β1 ~ 1-2, so β1=10^1.5≈30, but here β1=9, which is possible if they are not log values. So the given βs are indeed the cumulative stability constants, not log values.

Therefore, the calculation is correct as done.

In conclusion, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, due to the problem's ambiguity regarding SCN⁻ concentration, both 15.4% and 17% are possible. But following standard notation where [SCN⁻] is free, the answer is 17%.

The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{17\%}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me start by understanding the problem.

We have a solution with Co²+ ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with each successive ligand addition, but here β3 is higher than β4. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe the values are correct? Hmm. Let me check. If β1 is for [Co(SCN)]⁺, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, then sometimes the stability constants can decrease after a certain point. Maybe the fourth ligand isn't as stable. I'll proceed with the given values.

The question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the complex with two SCN⁻ ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]. The formula for the distribution of complexes involves the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

First, let's recall that the stability constants (β) are cumulative. So β1 is for the first complex: Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with β1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]). Similarly, β2 is for Co²+ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂], so β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2). Same for β3 and β4.

The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all the complexes and the free Co²+:

c(Co) = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10^-2 M.

Given that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration, we might assume that the free SCN⁻ concentration is approximately 0.1 M, because the amount of SCN⁻ consumed by complexation with Co²+ is negligible compared to 0.1 M. Let me check that. The total cobalt is 0.01 M, and if each Co can bind up to 4 SCN⁻, the maximum SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.01*4 = 0.04 M. But since [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, 0.04 M is 40% of it, which is not negligible. Hmm, so maybe the assumption is not valid. But maybe the actual consumption is less because not all Co is in the highest complex. Let's see. If most of the Co is in the lower complexes, like up to β2 or β3, then the SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.01*(average number of SCN⁻ per Co). If the average is, say, 2, then 0.02 M consumed, which is 20% of 0.1 M. Still significant. So maybe we can't assume [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. Hmm, this complicates things. Then we might need to set up equations considering the change in [SCN⁻]. But that would require solving a more complex system. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to proceed with the approximation that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M, even though it's not strictly valid. Let me see what the problem expects. Since the SCN⁻ concentration is given as 0.1 M, perhaps they consider that as the free concentration, so we don't have to adjust for the complexation. That would make the problem easier. Let me check standard problems. Usually, when the ligand is in large excess, the free ligand concentration is approximated as the total concentration. But here, the ligand is 0.1 M and cobalt is 0.01 M. The ligand is 10 times higher, but if each Co takes up 4 ligands, then 0.01*4=0.04, which is 40% of 0.1. So maybe the approximation is not great. But perhaps the problem still wants us to proceed with [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. Let's tentatively proceed with that, and then check if the assumption holds.

So, if [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, then we can express each complex concentration in terms of [Co²+].

Let me denote [Co²+] as c0, then:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 * c0 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * c0 * 0.1 = 0.9 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * c0 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * c0 * 0.01 = 0.4 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^3 = 63 * c0 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * c0 * 0.001 = 0.063 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^4 = 16 * c0 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * c0 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 c0

Then the total cobalt concentration is:

c0 + 0.9 c0 + 0.4 c0 + 0.063 c0 + 0.0016 c0 = c0 (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0 * 2.3646

But the total cobalt is 0.01 M, so:

c0 * 2.3646 = 0.01 → c0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.4 * c0 ≈ 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169 M

The percentage is ([Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)) * 100 = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.9%

But wait, this is under the assumption that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. However, if the SCN⁻ consumed is significant, this might not hold. Let's check how much SCN⁻ is consumed.

Each complex contributes n * [Co(SCN)_n], so:

Total SCN⁻ consumed = 1*[Co(SCN)⁺] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

Plugging in the values:

= 1*(0.9 c0) + 2*(0.4 c0) + 3*(0.063 c0) + 4*(0.0016 c0)

= 0.9 c0 + 0.8 c0 + 0.189 c0 + 0.0064 c0

= (0.9 + 0.8 + 0.189 + 0.0064) c0 ≈ 1.8954 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00423 M, total SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.8954 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00803 M

So the free SCN⁻ would be 0.1 - 0.00803 ≈ 0.09197 M, which is approximately 0.092 M. So the initial assumption that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M is off by about 8%. That might affect the result. So perhaps we need to iterate.

Let me try to adjust the [SCN⁻] to 0.092 M and recalculate.

First iteration:

[SCN⁻] = 0.092 M

Recalculate the complex concentrations:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.092 = 0.828 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * (0.092)^2 = 40 * c0 * 0.008464 = 0.33856 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c0 * (0.092)^3 ≈ 63 * c0 * 0.000778688 ≈ 0.04906 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c0 * (0.092)^4 ≈ 16 * c0 * 0.0000716 ≈ 0.001146 c0

Total cobalt concentration:

c0 (1 + 0.828 + 0.33856 + 0.04906 + 0.001146) ≈ c0 * 2.2168

So c0 = 0.01 / 2.2168 ≈ 0.00451 M

Then, SCN⁻ consumed:

1*(0.828 c0) + 2*(0.33856 c0) + 3*(0.04906 c0) + 4*(0.001146 c0)

= 0.828 c0 + 0.67712 c0 + 0.14718 c0 + 0.004584 c0 ≈ (0.828 + 0.67712 + 0.14718 + 0.004584) c0 ≈ 1.65688 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00451 M, SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.65688 * 0.00451 ≈ 0.00747 M

Thus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00747 ≈ 0.09253 M

Wait, the previous estimate was 0.092 M, and now after recalculating, it's 0.09253 M. The change is small. So the adjustment is minimal. Let's do

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I need to calculate the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in solution. I'll analyze the given information.

The solution contains Co²⁺ ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, with total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M and SCN⁻ concentration of 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16. It's unusual that β₄ is lower than β₃, but this can happen if the fourth ligand addition is less favorable. I'll use these values as given.

I need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], which is the dithiocyanato complex. Since stability constants are cumulative, β₁ represents Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with β₁ = [Co(SCN)⁺]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]). Similarly, β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²), and so on for β₃ and β₄.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:
c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10⁻² M

Initially, I'll assume [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, though this may not be precise since the complexation could consume significant SCN⁻. The maximum consumption would be 0.01*4 = 0.04 M (40% of available SCN⁻), which isn't negligible. However, let's proceed with this approximation first.

If I denote [Co²⁺] as c₀, then:
[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁ * c₀ * [SCN⁻] = 9 * c₀ * 0.1 = 0.9c₀
[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * c₀ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * c₀ * 0.01 = 0.4c₀
[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * c₀ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * c₀ * 0.001 = 0.063c₀
[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * c₀ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * c₀ * 0.0001 = 0.0016c₀

Total cobalt concentration:
c₀(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c₀ * 2.3646 = 0.01 M
Therefore, c₀ = 0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169 M
Thus, the percentage is (0.00169/0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.9%

To verify my assumption about [SCN⁻], I'll calculate how much is consumed:
SCN⁻ consumed = 1*[Co(SCN)⁺] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]
= 0.9c₀ + 0.8c₀ + 0.189c₀ + 0.0064c₀
≈ 1.8954c₀ ≈ 1.8954 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00803 M

So free [SCN⁻] would be approximately 0.1 - 0.00803 = 0.092 M, about 8% less than assumed.

Let me iterate using [SCN⁻] = 0.092 M:
[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c₀ * 0.092 = 0.828c₀
[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c₀ * 0.092² ≈ 0.33856c₀
[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c₀ * 0.092³ ≈ 0.04906c₀
[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c₀ * 0.092⁴ ≈ 0.001146c₀

Total cobalt: c₀(1 + 0.828 + 0.33856 + 0.04906 + 0.001146) ≈ c₀ * 2.2168 = 0.01 M
Therefore, c₀ ≈ 0.00451 M

Recalculating SCN⁻ consumed gives about 0.00747 M, making free [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.09253 M, close to our iteration value.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. I'll begin by clarifying the problem.

We're dealing with a solution containing Co²+ and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Typically, stability constants increase with more ligands, but here β3 is larger than β4, which might be a typo. If assumed to be correct, this could mean the fourth ligand isn't as stable. For now, I'll use these values as given.

The problem requires the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, specifically [Co(SCN)₂]. Stability constants (β) relate to the equilibrium of the complexes, for example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]⁺, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], and so on.

The total concentration of cobalt species is summed as:

c(Co) = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10^-2 M.

Given [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which exceeds the cobalt concentration, the free SCN⁻ concentration might be close to 0.1 M. However, if SCN⁻ consumption by Co²+ isn't negligible, this assumption might not hold. At maximum coordination, 0.01 M of Co can consume 0.04 M SCN⁻. Considering not all Co forms the highest complex, the actual SCN⁻ needed could be less, meaning some approximation might be justified.

Assuming, tentatively, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we express each complex in terms of [Co²+].

Define [Co²+] as c0:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 * c0 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * c0 * 0.1 = 0.9 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * c0 * 0.01 = 0.4 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * c0 * 0.001 = 0.063 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 * c0 * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * c0 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 c0

Thus, the total cobalt concentration is:

c0(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0 * 2.3646

With total cobalt at 0.01 M:

c0 * 2.3646 = 0.01 → c0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] concentration is approximately 0.00169 M.

Calculate the percentage: ([Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)) * 100 = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 16.9%.

This calculation assumes [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, which might vary if SCN⁻ consumption is significant. Estimating SCN⁻ consumption gives:

Total SCN⁻ used = 1*[Co(SCN)⁺] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 1.8954 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00423 M, total SCN⁻ consumption is 0.00803 M, making free SCN⁻ ≈ 0.09197 M.

Re-calculate with [SCN⁻] = 0.092 M:

Recompute complex concentrations:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.092 = 0.828 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * 0.008464 = 0.33856 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c0 * 0.000778688 ≈ 0.04906 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c0 * 0.0000716 ≈ 0.001146 c0

Total cobalt concentration gives:

c0 * 2.2168, solving c0 = 0.00451 M

Total SCN⁻ consumed = 1.65688 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.00451 M, SCN⁻ consumption ≈ 0.00747 M, thus free [SCN⁻] = 0.09253 M, aligning closely with previous assumptions.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Express Complex Concentrations**:\n   - Each complex concentration is expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration ([Co²⁺] = c₀) and the free SCN⁻ concentration ([SCN⁻] = s):\n     - [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁c₀s\n     - [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂c₀s²\n     - [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃c₀s³\n     - [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄c₀s⁴\n\n2. **Total Cobalt Balance**:\n   - The sum of all cobalt species equals 0.01 M:\n     \\[\n     c₀(1 + β₁s + β₂s² + β₃s³ + β₄s⁴) = 0.01\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total SCN⁻ Balance**:\n   - The free SCN⁻ plus the SCN⁻ consumed by complexes equals 0.1 M:\n     \\[\n     s + c₀(β₁s + 2β₂s² + 3β₃s³ + 4β₄s⁴) = 0.1\n     \\]\n\n4. **Iterative Calculation**:\n   - Assume an initial free SCN⁻ concentration (e.g., s ≈ 0.0925 M) and iteratively solve for c₀ and s until convergence. After iterations, the free [SCN⁻] stabilizes at ~0.0925 M, and [Co²⁺] ≈ 0.004493 M.\n\n5. **Calculate [Co(SCN)₂]**:\n   - Using the converged values:\n     \\[\n     [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂c₀s² = 40 \\times 0.004493 \\times (0.0925)^2 ≈ 0.001537 \\, \\text{M}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Percentage Calculation**:\n   - The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] relative to total cobalt:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{0.001537}{0.01}\\right) \\times 100 ≈ 15.4\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter accounting for SCN⁻ consumption and iterating to refine the free ligand concentration, **the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 15.4%**. Rounded to two significant figures, this is **15%**.\n\n**Answer:** 15%', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' another iteration.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\n[SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M\n\n[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.0925 ≈ 0.8325 c0\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * c0 * 0.008556 ≈ 0.34225 c0\n\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻] ≈ 63 * c0 * (0.0925)^3 ≈ 63 * c0 * 0.000791 ≈ 0.04983 c0\n\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] ≈ 16 * c0 * (0.0925)^4 ≈ 16 * c0 * 0.0000731 ≈ 0.00117 c0\n\nTotal cobalt concentration:\n\nc0 (1 + 0.8325 + 0.34225 + 0.04983 + 0.00117) ≈ c0 * 2.22575\n\nThus, c0 ≈ 0.01 / 2.22575 ≈ 0.004493 M\n\nSCN⁻ consumed:\n\n1*(0.8325 c0) + 2*(0.34225 c0) + 3*(0.04983 c0) + 4*(0.00117 c0)\n\n≈ 0.8325 c0 + 0.6845 c0 + 0.1495 c0 + 0.00468 c0 ≈ 1.67018 c0\n\nWith c0 ≈ 0.004493 M, SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.67018 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.0075 M\n\nFree [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.0075 ≈ 0.0925 M\n\nSo after two iterations, the free [SCN⁻] stabilizes around 0.0925 M. The change is minimal, so we can stop here.\n\nNow, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.34225 * c0 ≈ 0.34225 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.001537 M\n\nTotal cobalt is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.001537 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.37%\n\nComparing this with the initial estimate of ~16.9%, the adjustment for SCN⁻ consumption reduces the percentage by about 1.5%. So the answer is approximately 15.4%.\n\nBut let\'s check if another iteration changes it.\n\nThird iteration:\n\n[SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M (same as before)\n\nBut let\'s recalculate with c0 = 0.004493 M\n\nWait, actually, the SCN⁻ consumed was 0.0075 M, so free [SCN⁻] is 0.0925 M. The previous calculation already used [SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M, so further iterations won\'t change the result. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 15.4%.\n\nBut let\'s do the calculation more precisely.\n\nCompute [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^2\n\nWith β2=40, c0=0.004493 M, [SCN⁻]=0.0925 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.004493 * (0.0925)^2\n\nFirst compute (0.0925)^2 = 0.00855625\n\nThen 40 * 0.004493 = 0.17972\n\nMultiply by 0.00855625: 0.17972 * 0.00855625 ≈ 0.001537 M\n\nTotal cobalt is 0.01 M, so 0.001537 / 0.01 = 0.1537, so 15.37%\n\nSo approximately 15.4%. But the answer might expect using the initial assumption, leading to ~16.9%, but since we did the iteration and found 15.4%, which is more accurate.\n\nBut let me check the stability constants again. Wait, the given β3=63 and β4=16. That seems like β4 is smaller than β3, which is unusual. Typically, the stability constants increase with each step, but sometimes they can decrease. For example, in some cases, adding more ligands might lead to less stable complexes due to steric hindrance or other factors. So maybe the values are correct. Let\'s confirm the calculation with β4=16.\n\nYes, in the calculation above, β4=16 was used. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses stepwise constants (K1, K2, K3, K4) instead of cumulative constants (β). Wait, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands. So β2 is for the formation of [Co(SCN)₂] from Co²+ and 2 SCN⁻. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the constants were stepwise, the values would be different, but the problem specifies β, which are cumulative.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the iterated result of ~15.4%.\n\nBut let\'s see if the problem expects the non-iterated approximate answer. Since in some textbooks, they might just use the initial [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M for simplicity, even if it\'s not a huge excess. Let\'s compute both.\n\nFirst method (approximate [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M):\n\nTotal cobalt species:\n\nc0*(1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4)\n\n= c0*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0*2.3646\n\nc0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40*(0.1)^2 * c0 = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169\n\nPercentage: 0.00169 / 0.01 = 16.9%\n\nSecond method (iterated, [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.0925 M):\n\nPercentage ≈15.4%\n\nBut which one is correct? Since the problem gives [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, but doesn\'t specify whether it\'s the free concentration or the total. If it\'s the total SCN⁻, then we need to account for the consumed SCN⁻. However, usually, in such problems, if the ligand is in excess, they give the total concentration, and you have to compute the free concentration. But here, the SCN⁻ concentration is given as 0.1 M, which might be the total. Wait, the problem states: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." The wording is ambiguous. If it\'s the total concentration of SCN⁻, then we have to subtract the amount consumed by Co complexes. If it\'s the free concentration, then we can use it directly.\n\nBut given that the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", it\'s more likely referring to the free concentration, because in solution, the concentration given is usually the free ion concentration unless stated otherwise. However, in practice, when you make a solution, you add the ligand, and part of it complexes with the metal, so the free concentration is less than the total. But the problem might be simplifying by considering that [SCN⁻] is in large excess, so the free concentration is approximately 0.1 M. However, as we saw, it\'s not that large, so the answer would differ.\n\nBut since the problem is from a textbook or exam, it might expect the first method, using [SCN⁻] =0.1 M directly, leading to ~16.9%. However, the more accurate answer considering ligand consumption is ~15.4%. But which one is expected?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the total SCN⁻ concentration, which would be 0.1 M, and we have to compute the free [SCN⁻]. Wait, that complicates things further. Let\'s clarify.\n\nIf the given [SCN⁻] =0.1 M is the total concentration (i.e., before complexation), then:\n\nTotal SCN⁻, [SCN⁻]_total = [SCN⁻]_free + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nBut this would require solving a system of equations where both [SCN⁻]_free and the cobalt species are variables. This is more complex and would need a more involved calculation.\n\nBut given the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", it\'s ambiguous. If it\'s the free concentration, proceed as before. If it\'s the total, then we need to set up equations.\n\nBut given that the problem is likely intended for an approximate answer, and considering that in many such problems, the ligand concentration is given as the free concentration when it\'s in excess, even if not strictly true, the answer expected is probably ~17%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s try setting up the equations considering total SCN⁻.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTotal Co: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M\n\nTotal SCN⁻: [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nExpress all complexes in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN⁻]:\n\n[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^4\n\nLet’s denote [Co²+] = c and [SCN⁻] = s.\n\nThen:\n\nTotal Co:\n\nc + β1 c s + β2 c s² + β3 c s³ + β4 c s⁴ = 0.01\n\nTotal SCN⁻:\n\ns + β1 c s + 2 β2 c s² + 3 β3 c s³ + 4 β4 c s⁴ = 0.1\n\nWe have two equations with two variables c and s. This system needs to be solved numerically.\n\nLet’s divide the two equations to eliminate c.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nc (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴) = 0.01 → c = 0.01 / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)\n\nPlug this into the second equation:\n\ns + β1 c s + 2 β2 c s² + 3 β3 c s³ + 4 β4 c s⁴ = 0.1\n\nSubstitute c:\n\ns + [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] * (0.01 / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)) = 0.1\n\nLet’s denote denominator D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴\n\nThen:\n\ns + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] / D = 0.1\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\ns D + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0.1 D\n\nRearrange:\n\ns D - 0.1 D + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0\n\nFactor D:\n\nD (s - 0.1) + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0\n\nBut D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴\n\nSo:\n\n(1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)(s - 0.1) + 0.01 (β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴) = 0\n\nThis is a complex equation in s. Solving this analytically is difficult, so we need to use numerical methods. Let\'s attempt to approximate s.\n\nLet’s make an initial guess. Let’s assume s ≈ 0.0925 M as before. Let\'s plug s=0.0925 into the equation.\n\nFirst, compute D = 1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n9*0.0925 = 0.8325\n\n40*(0.0925)^2 = 40*0.008556 = 0.34224\n\n63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.000791 ≈ 0.04983\n\n16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.000073 ≈ 0.001168\n\nSum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.34224 + 0.04983 + 0.001168 ≈ 2.2257\n\nThen D = 2.2257\n\nNow compute (D)(s - 0.1) + 0.01 (β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴)\n\nFirst term: 2.2257*(0.0925 - 0.1) = 2.2257*(-0.0075) ≈ -0.016693\n\nSecond term: 0.01*(9*0.0925 + 2*40*(0.0925)^2 + 3*63*(0.0925)^3 + 4*16*(0.0925)^4)\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n9*0.0925 = 0.8325\n\n2*40*(0.0925)^2 = 80*0.008556 ≈ 0.6845\n\n3*63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 189*0.000791 ≈ 0.150\n\n4*16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 64*0.000073 ≈ 0.00467\n\nSum: 0.8325 + 0.6845 + 0.150 + 0.00467 ≈ 1.67167\n\nMultiply by 0.01: 0.01*1.67167 ≈ 0.0167167\n\nTotal equation: -0.016693 + 0.0167167 ≈ 0.0000237 ≈ 0. So s=0.0925 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, our previous iteration was correct. Thus, the free [SCN⁻] is approximately 0.0925 M, and the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is ~15.4%.\n\nBut let\'s check with s=0.0925:\n\nCompute c = 0.01 / D = 0.01 / 2.2257 ≈ 0.004493 M\n\nThen [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 c s² = 40 * 0.004493 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.004493 * 0.008556 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M\n\nPercentage: (0.001536 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.36% ≈ 15.4%\n\nTherefore, the accurate answer is approximately 15.4%. However, considering significant figures, the given stability constants are whole numbers, and concentrations are given to one or two decimal places. The answer should probably be rounded to two significant figures, so 15%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects more precise. The given β values are integers, but the calculation leads to ~15.4%. If we round to two significant figures, 15%, or one decimal place, 15.4%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 16%, considering the initial approximation. But given that we did the more accurate calculation, 15.4% is better. However, in exams, sometimes they expect you to use the given concentrations without considering the change in [SCN⁻], leading to ~17%.\n\nBut the problem statement might not expect the iterative approach. Let me verify with the initial method where [SCN⁻]=0.1 M:\n\nPercentage = (β2 [SCN⁻]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN⁻] + β2 [SCN⁻]^2 + β3 [SCN⁻]^3 + β4 [SCN⁻]^4) * 100\n\nPlugging in:\n\n= (40*(0.1)^2) / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4) * 100\n\n= (40*0.01) / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) * 100\n\n= 0.4 / 2.3646 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nSo if the problem expects this approach, the answer is approximately 17%. However, considering the more accurate calculation, it\'s ~15.4%. The discrepancy is due to the assumption about [SCN⁻].\n\nGiven that the problem states the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M, and doesn\'t mention it\'s the total concentration, it\'s safer to assume it\'s the free concentration, hence the answer is ~16.9%. But we saw that this leads to an inconsistency in the SCN⁻ consumption. However, in many textbooks, such problems are presented with the ligand concentration as the free concentration when it\'s in excess, even if not strictly the case. Therefore, the expected answer is likely 16.9%, which rounds to 17%.\n\nBut the precise calculation considering the SCN⁻ consumption gives ~15.4%. This is a dilemma. To resolve, perhaps check similar problems. In most cases, if the ligand is in 10-fold excess over the metal, the approximation is considered acceptable. Here, SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, Co is 0.01 M, so 10-fold excess. However, since each Co can bind up to 4 SCN⁻, the total possible consumption is 0.04 M, which is 40% of 0.1 M, so the approximation is not great. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the SCN⁻ consumption, leading to ~15.4%.\n\nBut since the problem gives β4=16, which is less than β3=63, the formation of higher complexes is less favored, so the main species are up to the third complex. However, with the given β values, even the third complex has a higher β than the second. Wait, β3=63, which is for three ligands. So [Co(SCN)₃⁻] has a higher stability than [Co(SCN)₂]. So maybe the third complex is more prevalent.\n\nWait, in our calculation, even with β3=63, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₃⁻] is β3 c0 s³ =63 * c0 * (0.0925)^3 ≈63 *0.004493*0.000791≈0.000223 M, which is 0.223e-3, while [Co(SCN)₂] is ~0.0015 M. Wait, no, that can\'t be. Wait, no:\n\nWait, [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * s³ =63 *0.004493*(0.0925)^3\n\nFirst compute (0.0925)^3 ≈0.000791\n\nThen 63*0.004493≈0.283\n\nMultiply by 0.000791≈0.0002237 M\n\nSo [Co(SCN)₃⁻]≈0.000224 M, which is 0.224 mM, while [Co(SCN)₂]≈0.001537 M (1.537 mM). So the dithiocyanato complex is more prevalent than the tri, despite β3 being higher. Because s^3 is much smaller than s^2. So even though β3 is higher, the ligand concentration to the third power reduces its contribution.\n\nTherefore, the main species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]⁺, and [Co(SCN)₂]. The higher complexes are less significant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 15.4%, which is roughly 15%.\n\nBut given the options, perhaps the answer is expected to be 16%.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s compute with more precise numbers.\n\nUsing s=0.0925 M, c=0.004493 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] =40 *0.004493*(0.0925)^2\n\nFirst compute (0.0925)^2=0.00855625\n\nMultiply by 0.004493:0.00855625*0.004493≈0.00003845\n\nMultiply by40:0.00003845*40≈0.001538 M\n\nTotal Co=0.01 M\n\nPercentage=0.001538/0.01=15.38%\n\nRounded to two significant figures, 15%.\n\nBut the given data has β values as exact integers, and concentrations given to 1 or 2 decimal places. The answer should have two significant figures, so 15%.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, one decimal place is acceptable, making it 15.4%. But since the problem might expect an approximate answer, and given the options (if it\'s multiple choice), but since it\'s open response, we should state it as 15%.\n\nBut to check, let\'s verify once more.\n\nTotal cobalt species:\n\n[Co²+] =0.004493 M\n\n[Co(SCN)⁺]=9*0.004493*0.0925≈0.828*0.004493≈0.00372 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂]=0.001538 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻]=63*0.004493*(0.0925)^3≈0.000224 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]=16*0.004493*(0.0925)^4≈0.000016 M\n\nSum:0.004493 +0.00372 +0.001538 +0.000224 +0.000016≈0.009991≈0.01 M, which checks out.\n\nTotal SCN⁻ consumed:\n\n0.00372 +2*0.001538 +3*0.000224 +4*0.000016≈0.00372 +0.003076 +0.000672 +0.000064≈0.007532 M\n\nFree SCN⁻=0.1 -0.007532≈0.092468 M, consistent with our assumption.\n\nThus, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.001538 /0.01 =15.38%, which is 15.4% when rounded to one decimal place, or 15% to two significant figures.\n\nGiven that the problem\'s data has c(Co) as 10^-2 M (one significant figure?), but written as 10^-2, which is exact, and [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M (one decimal place, so two significant figures). The β values are given as integers, so exact. Therefore, the answer should have two significant figures, so 15%.\n\nBut in many cases, 15.4% would be written as 15%, but if precise, 15.4%. However, since the initial method gives 16.9%, and the accurate method gives 15.4%, and the problem might expect recognition that the SCN⁻ concentration isn\'t in vast excess, requiring adjustment, leading to 15%.\n\nBut to match the precise calculation, the answer is approximately 15.4%. Depending on the source, this might be rounded to 15% or 15.4%.\n\nHowever, looking back, the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Sometimes, the dithiocyanato complex might be the major species, but here it\'s only ~15%. Given the options, perhaps the answer is 16%, but our calculation says 15.4%. Since the user asks for the percentage, and in chemistry, two decimal places are sometimes used, but here likely two significant figures.\n\nBut given the precise calculation is 15.38%, which is approximately 15.4%, and if we round to two significant figures, that\'s 15%.\n\nHowever, to check, let\'s see if the problem might have a typo in the β values. If β4=63 and β3=16, then the calculation would be different. Wait, the given β3=63 and β4=16. If that\'s correct, then the third complex is more stable than the fourth. If it\'s a typo and should be β3=16 and β4=63, then the fourth complex would be more stable. But the user provided β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So descending after β3. That seems intentional.\n\nIn conclusion, after careful calculation considering the consumption of SCN⁻, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 15.4%.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species, we start by considering the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

### Key Steps:
1. **Express Complex Concentrations**:
   - Each complex concentration is expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration ([Co²⁺] = c₀) and the free SCN⁻ concentration ([SCN⁻] = s):
     - [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁c₀s
     - [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂c₀s²
     - [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃c₀s³
     - [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄c₀s⁴

2. **Total Cobalt Balance**:
   - The sum of all cobalt species equals 0.01 M:
     \[
     c₀(1 + β₁s + β₂s² + β₃s³ + β₄s⁴) = 0.01
     \]

3. **Total SCN⁻ Balance**:
   - The free SCN⁻ plus the SCN⁻ consumed by complexes equals 0.1 M:
     \[
     s + c₀(β₁s + 2β₂s² + 3β₃s³ + 4β₄s⁴) = 0.1
     \]

4. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - Assume an initial free SCN⁻ concentration (e.g., s ≈ 0.0925 M) and iteratively solve for c₀ and s until convergence. After iterations, the free [SCN⁻] stabilizes at ~0.0925 M, and [Co²⁺] ≈ 0.004493 M.

5. **Calculate [Co(SCN)₂]**:
   - Using the converged values:
     \[
     [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂c₀s² = 40 \times 0.004493 \times (0.0925)^2 ≈ 0.001537 \, \text{M}
     \]

6. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] relative to total cobalt:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{0.001537}{0.01}\right) \times 100 ≈ 15.4\%
     \]

### Conclusion:
After accounting for SCN⁻ consumption and iterating to refine the free ligand concentration, **the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 15.4%**. Rounded to two significant figures, this is **15%**.

**Answer:** 15%

another iteration.

Second iteration:

[SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c0 * 0.0925 ≈ 0.8325 c0

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c0 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * c0 * 0.008556 ≈ 0.34225 c0

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] ≈ 63 * c0 * (0.0925)^3 ≈ 63 * c0 * 0.000791 ≈ 0.04983 c0

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] ≈ 16 * c0 * (0.0925)^4 ≈ 16 * c0 * 0.0000731 ≈ 0.00117 c0

Total cobalt concentration:

c0 (1 + 0.8325 + 0.34225 + 0.04983 + 0.00117) ≈ c0 * 2.22575

Thus, c0 ≈ 0.01 / 2.22575 ≈ 0.004493 M

SCN⁻ consumed:

1*(0.8325 c0) + 2*(0.34225 c0) + 3*(0.04983 c0) + 4*(0.00117 c0)

≈ 0.8325 c0 + 0.6845 c0 + 0.1495 c0 + 0.00468 c0 ≈ 1.67018 c0

With c0 ≈ 0.004493 M, SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 1.67018 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.0075 M

Free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.0075 ≈ 0.0925 M

So after two iterations, the free [SCN⁻] stabilizes around 0.0925 M. The change is minimal, so we can stop here.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.34225 * c0 ≈ 0.34225 * 0.004493 ≈ 0.001537 M

Total cobalt is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.001537 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.37%

Comparing this with the initial estimate of ~16.9%, the adjustment for SCN⁻ consumption reduces the percentage by about 1.5%. So the answer is approximately 15.4%.

But let's check if another iteration changes it.

Third iteration:

[SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M (same as before)

But let's recalculate with c0 = 0.004493 M

Wait, actually, the SCN⁻ consumed was 0.0075 M, so free [SCN⁻] is 0.0925 M. The previous calculation already used [SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M, so further iterations won't change the result. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 15.4%.

But let's do the calculation more precisely.

Compute [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * c0 * [SCN⁻]^2

With β2=40, c0=0.004493 M, [SCN⁻]=0.0925 M

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.004493 * (0.0925)^2

First compute (0.0925)^2 = 0.00855625

Then 40 * 0.004493 = 0.17972

Multiply by 0.00855625: 0.17972 * 0.00855625 ≈ 0.001537 M

Total cobalt is 0.01 M, so 0.001537 / 0.01 = 0.1537, so 15.37%

So approximately 15.4%. But the answer might expect using the initial assumption, leading to ~16.9%, but since we did the iteration and found 15.4%, which is more accurate.

But let me check the stability constants again. Wait, the given β3=63 and β4=16. That seems like β4 is smaller than β3, which is unusual. Typically, the stability constants increase with each step, but sometimes they can decrease. For example, in some cases, adding more ligands might lead to less stable complexes due to steric hindrance or other factors. So maybe the values are correct. Let's confirm the calculation with β4=16.

Yes, in the calculation above, β4=16 was used. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses stepwise constants (K1, K2, K3, K4) instead of cumulative constants (β). Wait, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands. So β2 is for the formation of [Co(SCN)₂] from Co²+ and 2 SCN⁻. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, if the constants were stepwise, the values would be different, but the problem specifies β, which are cumulative.

Therefore, proceeding with the iterated result of ~15.4%.

But let's see if the problem expects the non-iterated approximate answer. Since in some textbooks, they might just use the initial [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M for simplicity, even if it's not a huge excess. Let's compute both.

First method (approximate [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M):

Total cobalt species:

c0*(1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4)

= c0*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = c0*2.3646

c0 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40*(0.1)^2 * c0 = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169

Percentage: 0.00169 / 0.01 = 16.9%

Second method (iterated, [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.0925 M):

Percentage ≈15.4%

But which one is correct? Since the problem gives [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, but doesn't specify whether it's the free concentration or the total. If it's the total SCN⁻, then we need to account for the consumed SCN⁻. However, usually, in such problems, if the ligand is in excess, they give the total concentration, and you have to compute the free concentration. But here, the SCN⁻ concentration is given as 0.1 M, which might be the total. Wait, the problem states: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." The wording is ambiguous. If it's the total concentration of SCN⁻, then we have to subtract the amount consumed by Co complexes. If it's the free concentration, then we can use it directly.

But given that the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", it's more likely referring to the free concentration, because in solution, the concentration given is usually the free ion concentration unless stated otherwise. However, in practice, when you make a solution, you add the ligand, and part of it complexes with the metal, so the free concentration is less than the total. But the problem might be simplifying by considering that [SCN⁻] is in large excess, so the free concentration is approximately 0.1 M. However, as we saw, it's not that large, so the answer would differ.

But since the problem is from a textbook or exam, it might expect the first method, using [SCN⁻] =0.1 M directly, leading to ~16.9%. However, the more accurate answer considering ligand consumption is ~15.4%. But which one is expected?

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the total SCN⁻ concentration, which would be 0.1 M, and we have to compute the free [SCN⁻]. Wait, that complicates things further. Let's clarify.

If the given [SCN⁻] =0.1 M is the total concentration (i.e., before complexation), then:

Total SCN⁻, [SCN⁻]_total = [SCN⁻]_free + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

But this would require solving a system of equations where both [SCN⁻]_free and the cobalt species are variables. This is more complex and would need a more involved calculation.

But given the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", it's ambiguous. If it's the free concentration, proceed as before. If it's the total, then we need to set up equations.

But given that the problem is likely intended for an approximate answer, and considering that in many such problems, the ligand concentration is given as the free concentration when it's in excess, even if not strictly true, the answer expected is probably ~17%.

But to be thorough, let's try setting up the equations considering total SCN⁻.

Let me denote:

Total Co: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M

Total SCN⁻: [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

Express all complexes in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN⁻]:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^2

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^3

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^4

Let’s denote [Co²+] = c and [SCN⁻] = s.

Then:

Total Co:

c + β1 c s + β2 c s² + β3 c s³ + β4 c s⁴ = 0.01

Total SCN⁻:

s + β1 c s + 2 β2 c s² + 3 β3 c s³ + 4 β4 c s⁴ = 0.1

We have two equations with two variables c and s. This system needs to be solved numerically.

Let’s divide the two equations to eliminate c.

From the first equation:

c (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴) = 0.01 → c = 0.01 / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)

Plug this into the second equation:

s + β1 c s + 2 β2 c s² + 3 β3 c s³ + 4 β4 c s⁴ = 0.1

Substitute c:

s + [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] * (0.01 / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)) = 0.1

Let’s denote denominator D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴

Then:

s + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] / D = 0.1

Multiply both sides by D:

s D + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0.1 D

Rearrange:

s D - 0.1 D + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0

Factor D:

D (s - 0.1) + 0.01 [β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴] = 0

But D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴

So:

(1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s⁴)(s - 0.1) + 0.01 (β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴) = 0

This is a complex equation in s. Solving this analytically is difficult, so we need to use numerical methods. Let's attempt to approximate s.

Let’s make an initial guess. Let’s assume s ≈ 0.0925 M as before. Let's plug s=0.0925 into the equation.

First, compute D = 1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4

Calculate each term:

9*0.0925 = 0.8325

40*(0.0925)^2 = 40*0.008556 = 0.34224

63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.000791 ≈ 0.04983

16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.000073 ≈ 0.001168

Sum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.34224 + 0.04983 + 0.001168 ≈ 2.2257

Then D = 2.2257

Now compute (D)(s - 0.1) + 0.01 (β1 s + 2 β2 s² + 3 β3 s³ + 4 β4 s⁴)

First term: 2.2257*(0.0925 - 0.1) = 2.2257*(-0.0075) ≈ -0.016693

Second term: 0.01*(9*0.0925 + 2*40*(0.0925)^2 + 3*63*(0.0925)^3 + 4*16*(0.0925)^4)

Calculate each part:

9*0.0925 = 0.8325

2*40*(0.0925)^2 = 80*0.008556 ≈ 0.6845

3*63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 189*0.000791 ≈ 0.150

4*16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 64*0.000073 ≈ 0.00467

Sum: 0.8325 + 0.6845 + 0.150 + 0.00467 ≈ 1.67167

Multiply by 0.01: 0.01*1.67167 ≈ 0.0167167

Total equation: -0.016693 + 0.0167167 ≈ 0.0000237 ≈ 0. So s=0.0925 is a solution.

Therefore, our previous iteration was correct. Thus, the free [SCN⁻] is approximately 0.0925 M, and the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is ~15.4%.

But let's check with s=0.0925:

Compute c = 0.01 / D = 0.01 / 2.2257 ≈ 0.004493 M

Then [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 c s² = 40 * 0.004493 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.004493 * 0.008556 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M

Percentage: (0.001536 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.36% ≈ 15.4%

Therefore, the accurate answer is approximately 15.4%. However, considering significant figures, the given stability constants are whole numbers, and concentrations are given to one or two decimal places. The answer should probably be rounded to two significant figures, so 15%.

But let me check if the problem expects more precise. The given β values are integers, but the calculation leads to ~15.4%. If we round to two significant figures, 15%, or one decimal place, 15.4%.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16%, considering the initial approximation. But given that we did the more accurate calculation, 15.4% is better. However, in exams, sometimes they expect you to use the given concentrations without considering the change in [SCN⁻], leading to ~17%.

But the problem statement might not expect the iterative approach. Let me verify with the initial method where [SCN⁻]=0.1 M:

Percentage = (β2 [SCN⁻]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN⁻] + β2 [SCN⁻]^2 + β3 [SCN⁻]^3 + β4 [SCN⁻]^4) * 100

Plugging in:

= (40*(0.1)^2) / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4) * 100

= (40*0.01) / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) * 100

= 0.4 / 2.3646 * 100 ≈ 16.9%

So if the problem expects this approach, the answer is approximately 17%. However, considering the more accurate calculation, it's ~15.4%. The discrepancy is due to the assumption about [SCN⁻].

Given that the problem states the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M, and doesn't mention it's the total concentration, it's safer to assume it's the free concentration, hence the answer is ~16.9%. But we saw that this leads to an inconsistency in the SCN⁻ consumption. However, in many textbooks, such problems are presented with the ligand concentration as the free concentration when it's in excess, even if not strictly the case. Therefore, the expected answer is likely 16.9%, which rounds to 17%.

But the precise calculation considering the SCN⁻ consumption gives ~15.4%. This is a dilemma. To resolve, perhaps check similar problems. In most cases, if the ligand is in 10-fold excess over the metal, the approximation is considered acceptable. Here, SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, Co is 0.01 M, so 10-fold excess. However, since each Co can bind up to 4 SCN⁻, the total possible consumption is 0.04 M, which is 40% of 0.1 M, so the approximation is not great. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the SCN⁻ consumption, leading to ~15.4%.

But since the problem gives β4=16, which is less than β3=63, the formation of higher complexes is less favored, so the main species are up to the third complex. However, with the given β values, even the third complex has a higher β than the second. Wait, β3=63, which is for three ligands. So [Co(SCN)₃⁻] has a higher stability than [Co(SCN)₂]. So maybe the third complex is more prevalent.

Wait, in our calculation, even with β3=63, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₃⁻] is β3 c0 s³ =63 * c0 * (0.0925)^3 ≈63 *0.004493*0.000791≈0.000223 M, which is 0.223e-3, while [Co(SCN)₂] is ~0.0015 M. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no:

Wait, [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * c0 * s³ =63 *0.004493*(0.0925)^3

First compute (0.0925)^3 ≈0.000791

Then 63*0.004493≈0.283

Multiply by 0.000791≈0.0002237 M

So [Co(SCN)₃⁻]≈0.000224 M, which is 0.224 mM, while [Co(SCN)₂]≈0.001537 M (1.537 mM). So the dithiocyanato complex is more prevalent than the tri, despite β3 being higher. Because s^3 is much smaller than s^2. So even though β3 is higher, the ligand concentration to the third power reduces its contribution.

Therefore, the main species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]⁺, and [Co(SCN)₂]. The higher complexes are less significant.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 15.4%, which is roughly 15%.

But given the options, perhaps the answer is expected to be 16%.

Alternatively, let's compute with more precise numbers.

Using s=0.0925 M, c=0.004493 M

[Co(SCN)₂] =40 *0.004493*(0.0925)^2

First compute (0.0925)^2=0.00855625

Multiply by 0.004493:0.00855625*0.004493≈0.00003845

Multiply by40:0.00003845*40≈0.001538 M

Total Co=0.01 M

Percentage=0.001538/0.01=15.38%

Rounded to two significant figures, 15%.

But the given data has β values as exact integers, and concentrations given to 1 or 2 decimal places. The answer should have two significant figures, so 15%.

However, in some contexts, one decimal place is acceptable, making it 15.4%. But since the problem might expect an approximate answer, and given the options (if it's multiple choice), but since it's open response, we should state it as 15%.

But to check, let's verify once more.

Total cobalt species:

[Co²+] =0.004493 M

[Co(SCN)⁺]=9*0.004493*0.0925≈0.828*0.004493≈0.00372 M

[Co(SCN)₂]=0.001538 M

[Co(SCN)₃⁻]=63*0.004493*(0.0925)^3≈0.000224 M

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]=16*0.004493*(0.0925)^4≈0.000016 M

Sum:0.004493 +0.00372 +0.001538 +0.000224 +0.000016≈0.009991≈0.01 M, which checks out.

Total SCN⁻ consumed:

0.00372 +2*0.001538 +3*0.000224 +4*0.000016≈0.00372 +0.003076 +0.000672 +0.000064≈0.007532 M

Free SCN⁻=0.1 -0.007532≈0.092468 M, consistent with our assumption.

Thus, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.001538 /0.01 =15.38%, which is 15.4% when rounded to one decimal place, or 15% to two significant figures.

Given that the problem's data has c(Co) as 10^-2 M (one significant figure?), but written as 10^-2, which is exact, and [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M (one decimal place, so two significant figures). The β values are given as integers, so exact. Therefore, the answer should have two significant figures, so 15%.

But in many cases, 15.4% would be written as 15%, but if precise, 15.4%. However, since the initial method gives 16.9%, and the accurate method gives 15.4%, and the problem might expect recognition that the SCN⁻ concentration isn't in vast excess, requiring adjustment, leading to 15%.

But to match the precise calculation, the answer is approximately 15.4%. Depending on the source, this might be rounded to 15% or 15.4%.

However, looking back, the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Sometimes, the dithiocyanato complex might be the major species, but here it's only ~15%. Given the options, perhaps the answer is 16%, but our calculation says 15.4%. Since the user asks for the percentage, and in chemistry, two decimal places are sometimes used, but here likely two significant figures.

But given the precise calculation is 15.38%, which is approximately 15.4%, and if we round to two significant figures, that's 15%.

However, to check, let's see if the problem might have a typo in the β values. If β4=63 and β3=16, then the calculation would be different. Wait, the given β3=63 and β4=16. If that's correct, then the third complex is more stable than the fourth. If it's a typo and should be β3=16 and β4=63, then the fourth complex would be more stable. But the user provided β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So descending after β3. That seems intentional.

In conclusion, after careful calculation considering the consumption of SCN⁻, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 15.4%. Depending on rounding, this is either 15% or 15.4%. Since the problem gives β values as integers and concentrations to one or two decimal places, 15% or 15.4% are both reasonable. However, to match the precision of the given data, 15% is appropriate.

But I think in precise terms, it's 15.4%, so I'll go with 15.4% and round to 15% if necessary. But let me check once more.

The calculation gave us 15.38%, which is 15.4% when rounded to one decimal place. Since the total Co is 0.01 M (two significant figures), and [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (one significant figure), the result should have one significant figure, but since the calculation involves multiple steps with more sig figs, it's typically reported to two or three. However, in exams, often two sig figs are expected. So 15%.

But I'm conflicted. Given the precise answer is ~15.4%, and the options are open, I think the answer should be 15.4%, which can be written as 15.4% or rounded to 15%.

But to check standard practices, in analytical chemistry, such problems often expect considering the ligand concentration as free if it's in excess, but here it's not sufficiently in excess, so the accurate answer is 15.4%. Therefore, I will state the answer as approximately 15.4%, which is 15%.

Let\'s check SCN⁻ consumption again:\n\nSCN⁻ consumed = (0.83277 + 2*0.3424 + 3*0.0499 + 4*0.001173)*0.00449\n≈ (0.83277 + 0.6848 + 0.1497 + 0.004692)*0.00449\n≈ 1.67196 * 0.00449 ≈ 0.00751 M\nFree [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00751 ≈ 0.09249 M, which is very close to previous. So the percentage is about 15.4%.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. Maybe they consider it in excess, so the change in [SCN⁻] is negligible. If that\'s the case, perhaps the first approximation of 16.9% is acceptable. However, the problem might expect considering the SCN⁻ consumption. But given that the answer after iteration is around 15.4%, but the options might prefer the first approximation. Wait, but the problem says the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. Is that the total concentration or the free concentration?\n\nWait, the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If that\'s the total SCN⁻ concentration, then we need to account for the SCN⁻ consumed in complexes. But if it\'s the free SCN⁻ concentration, then we can use 0.1 M directly. The wording is ambiguous. However, in such problems, if they state the concentration of the ligand, it\'s usually the total concentration unless specified as free. But here, since they specify "total cobalt concentration", maybe [SCN⁻] is the free concentration. Wait, but in the problem statement: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If that\'s the analytical concentration (total SCN⁻), then we need to consider that some is consumed in complexes. But if it\'s the equilibrium concentration (free SCN⁻), then we can use it directly. The problem is ambiguous. However, in many cases, when they give the concentration of a ligand along with a metal ion and stability constants, they often mean the free ligand concentration. But in this case, since the SCN⁻ is in excess (0.1 M vs. Co²⁺ 0.01 M), maybe the consumption is negligible. Let me check.\n\nIf [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then the first calculation gives 16.9%. If [SCN⁻] is total, then we need to set up equations considering that total SCN⁻ = 0.1 M = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\nBut that complicates things. Let me check the problem statement again: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote equilibrium concentration, so free SCN⁻. Therefore, the first approximation where [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is correct, and the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, when I considered SCN⁻ consumption, the percentage dropped to around 15.4%. But if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then we shouldn\'t adjust it. Wait, but in reality, the SCN⁻ would be consumed, so the free SCN⁻ would be less than 0.1 M. But if the problem says [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, maybe they are giving the free concentration. Let me check standard problem conventions. Typically, if a problem states the concentration of a ligand without mentioning it\'s in excess or that it\'s the total concentration, and provides stability constants, it\'s likely the free ligand concentration. However, in this case, since the SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, even if all Co formed the highest complex, SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.04 M, leaving 0.06 M free. But the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which would imply that the free SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, so the complexes are formed without affecting the SCN⁻ concentration. This is possible if the solution is buffered with excess SCN⁻, but the problem doesn\'t mention that. However, given the problem states [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we should take it as the equilibrium concentration. Therefore, the first calculation is correct, giving approximately 16.9%. But when I did the iteration, considering that SCN⁻ is consumed, the percentage was lower. But if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, then we must use that as the free concentration, and the answer is 16.9%. However, the problem might have a typo, or maybe the given β values are log β? Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Typically, stability constants can be stepwise (K1, K2, ...) or cumulative (βn). Here, βn is the cumulative constant for n ligands. For example, β2 = K1*K2. If the values are as given, then the first approach is correct. But if the β values were log values, they would be much larger. Since the values are small, they are likely the cumulative stability constants. For example, β1=9, which is reasonable for a cumulative constant. So proceeding with that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 16.9%, but after considering SCN⁻ consumption, it\'s around 15.4%. However, if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then 16.9% is correct. But given that the problem mentions the total cobalt concentration and the [SCN⁻] concentration, it\'s possible that [SCN⁻] is the total concentration. Let me re-express the problem with that in mind.\n\nIf [SCN⁻] total is 0.1 M, then:\n\nTotal SCN⁻ = 0.1 = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\nBut we also have total Co = 0.01 = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\nLet me denote [Co²⁺] = x. Then:\n\n[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 x [SCN⁻] = 9x[SCN⁻]\n[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN⁻]^2 = 40x[SCN⁻]^2\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 x [SCN⁻]^3 = 63x[SCN⁻]^3\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 x [SCN⁻]^4 = 16x[SCN⁻]^4\n\nTotal Co: x + 9x[SCN⁻] + 40x[SCN⁻]^2 + 63x[SCN⁻]^3 + 16x[SCN⁻]^4 = 0.01\n\nTotal SCN⁻: [SCN⁻] + 9x[SCN⁻] + 2*40x[SCN⁻]^2 + 3*63x[SCN⁻]^3 + 4*16x[SCN⁻]^4 = 0.1\n\nThis is a system of two equations with two variables x and [SCN⁻]. Solving this would require substitution, but it\'s complex. Let\'s attempt an iterative approach.\n\nAssume [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M (initial guess). Then:\n\nTotal Co: x(1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*2.3646 = 0.01 → x ≈ 0.00423 M\n\nThen, compute SCN⁻ consumption:\n\nSCN⁻ consumed = 9x*0.1 + 2*40x*(0.1)^2 + 3*63x*(0.1)^3 + 4*16x*(0.1)^4\n= 0.9x + 0.8x + 0.189x + 0.0064x\n= 1.8954x ≈ 1.8954*0.00423 ≈ 0.00803 M\n\nThus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00803 ≈ 0.09197 M\n\nNow, use this [SCN⁻] = 0.09197 M in the total Co equation:\n\nTotal Co: x(1 + 9*0.09197 + 40*(0.09197)^2 + 63*(0.09197)^3 + 16*(0.09197)^4)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n9*0.09197 ≈ 0.8277\n\n40*(0.09197)^2 ≈ 40*0.00846 ≈ 0.3384\n\n63*(0.09197)^3 ≈ 63*(0.000778) ≈ 0.0490\n\n16*(0.09197)^4 ≈ 16*(0.0000715) ≈ 0.001144\n\nSum: 1 + 0.8277 + 0.3384 + 0.0490 + 0.001144 ≈ 2.2162\n\nThus, x = 0.01 / 2.2162 ≈ 0.00451 M\n\nNow compute SCN⁻ consumption:\n\n= 9x*0.09197 + 2*40x*(0.09197)^2 + 3*63x*(0.09197)^3 + 4*16x*(0.09197)^4\n= 9*0.00451*0.09197 + 2*40*0.00451*(0.09197)^2 + 3*63*0.00451*(0.09197)^3 + 4*16*0.00451*(0.09197)^4\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nFirst term: 9*0.00451*0.09197 ≈ 0.00376\n\nSecond term: 2*40*0.00451*0.00846 ≈ 0.00306\n\nThird term: 3*63*0.00451*0.000778 ≈ 0.00066\n\nFourth term: 4*16*0.00451*0.0000715 ≈ 0.0000206\n\nTotal SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 0.00376 + 0.00306 + 0.00066 + 0.0000206 ≈ 0.0075 M\n\nThus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.0075 ≈ 0.0925 M\n\nRepeat the process with [SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M:\n\nTotal Co: x(1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4)\n\nCalculate:\n\n9*0.0925 ≈ 0.8325\n\n40*(0.0925)^2 ≈ 40*0.00856 ≈ 0.3424\n\n63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.000792 ≈ 0.0499\n\n16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.0000732 ≈ 0.001171\n\nSum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.3424 + 0.0499 + 0.001171 ≈ 2.22597\n\nx = 0.01 / 2.22597 ≈ 0.00449 M\n\nSCN⁻ consumed:\n\n= 9*0.00449*0.0925 + 2*40*0.00449*(0.0925)^2 + 3*63*0.00449*(0.0925)^3 + 4*16*0.00449*(0.0925)^4\n\nFirst term: 9*0.00449*0.0925 ≈ 0.00376\n\nSecond term: 2*40*0.00449*0.00856 ≈ 0.00307\n\nThird term: 3*63*0.00449*0.000792 ≈ 0.00067\n\nFourth term: 4*16*0.00449*0.0000732 ≈ 0.000021\n\nTotal SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 0.00376 + 0.00307 + 0.00067 + 0.000021 ≈ 0.00752 M\n\nFree [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00752 ≈ 0.09248 M\n\nConvergence is achieved. Now, compute [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.00856 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M\n\nPercentage: (0.001536 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.36%\n\nSo, considering that [SCN⁻] total is 0.1 M, the percentage is approximately 15.4%. However, the problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If this is the total SCN⁻, then the answer is ~15.4%. If it\'s the free SCN⁻, then the answer is ~16.9%. The problem\'s wording is ambiguous. In many textbooks, when they provide the concentration of the ligand without specifying, it\'s usually the total concentration. However, in coordination chemistry problems, sometimes they assume the ligand is in large excess, so free ≈ total. Given that SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, even if all Co is complexed as [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, it would consume 0.04 M SCN⁻, leaving 0.06 M free. But the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which would mean that the solution has additional SCN⁻ to keep the free concentration at 0.1 M, perhaps using a buffer or excess SCN⁻. However, without such information, it\'s ambiguous.\n\nGiven the problem\'s phrasing, it\'s safer to assume that [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, so the first calculation of ~16.9% is correct. However, considering the problem might expect accounting for SCN⁻ consumption, leading to ~15.4%. But the given β values are quite low, which might imply that the complexes are not very stable, so the consumption of SCN⁻ is minimal. Let\'s check the first approximation again with β2=40:\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * [Co²⁺] * 0.01\n\nIf [Co²⁺] is x, then total Co = x + 9x*0.1 + 40x*0.01 + 63x*0.001 + 16x*0.0001 = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 2.3646x = 0.01 → x ≈ 0.00423\n\nThus, [Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of 0.01 M.\n\nBut if SCN⁻ is free at 0.1 M, this is correct. If SCN⁻ is total, then the answer is lower. Given the problem\'s wording, I think the intended answer is 16.9%, rounding to 17%, but let\'s check the β values again. Wait, β2=40, which is the cumulative constant for two SCN⁻ ligands. So the calculation is correct. However, the stepwise constants would be K1=β1=9, K2=β2/β1=40/9≈4.44, K3=β3/β2=63/40≈1.575, K4=β4/β3=16/63≈0.254. The decreasing K values make sense, as adding more ligands becomes harder. The fourth K is less than 1, indicating lower stability. So the calculations are valid.\n\nGiven that, and if the problem states [SCN⁻]=0.1 M as free, the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, the exact answer after considering SCN⁻ consumption is around 15.4%. But since the problem might not expect iteration, the first approximation is likely expected. Let\'s compute it precisely.\n\nFirst approximation:\n\n[Co²⁺] = 0.01 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = 0.01 / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.1² = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M\n\nPercentage: (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.9%\n\nIf the problem expects this answer, it\'s 16.9%. However, considering the iterations, it\'s about 15.4%. But without more information, I think the problem expects the first approach. Therefore, the answer is approximately 17%.\n\nBut let\'s check exact calculation with the system of equations. Let me set up the equations properly.\n\nLet [SCN⁻] = s\n\nTotal Co: x + 9x s + 40x s² + 63x s³ + 16x s⁴ = 0.01\n\nTotal SCN⁻: s + 9x s + 2*40x s² + 3*63x s³ + 4*16x s⁴ = 0.1\n\nThis is a system of nonlinear equations. Let\'s substitute x from the first equation into the second.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx = 0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\ns + 9*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s + 2*40*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s² + 3*63*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s³ + 4*16*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s⁴ = 0.1\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴):\n\ns*(1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴) + 0.09s + 0.8s² + 1.89s³ + 0.64s⁴ = 0.1*(1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)\n\nExpand left side:\n\ns + 9s² + 40s³ + 63s⁴ + 16s⁵ + 0.09s + 0.8s² + 1.89s³ + 0.64s⁴\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ns + 0.09s = 1.09s\n\n9s² + 0.8s² = 9.8s²\n\n40s³ + 1.89s³ = 41.89s³\n\n63s⁴ + 0.64s⁴ = 63.64s⁴\n\n16s⁵\n\nRight side:\n\n0.1 + 0.9s + 4s² + 6.3s³ + 1.6s⁴\n\nSet equation:\n\n1.09s + 9.8s² + 41.89s³ + 63.64s⁴ + 16s⁵ = 0.1 + 0.9s + 4s² + 6.3s³ + 1.6s⁴\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n1.09s - 0.9s + 9.8s² - 4s² + 41.89s³ - 6.3s³ + 63.64s⁴ - 1.6s⁴ + 16s⁵ - 0.1 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.19s + 5.8s² + 35.59s³ + 62.04s⁴ + 16s⁵ - 0.1 = 0\n\nThis is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. Let\'s attempt numerical methods. Let\'s denote f(s) = 16s⁵ + 62.04s⁴ + 35.59s³ + 5.8s² + 0.19s - 0.1\n\nWe need to find s where f(s) = 0.

This method is too time-consuming. Alternatively, use the previous iteration results where after two iterations, s≈0.0925 M, leading to [Co(SCN)₂]≈15.4%.

However, the exact answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is approximately 15.4%. Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, it\'s safer to go with the first approach if [SCN⁻] is free, leading to 16.9%. If the problem intended total SCN⁻, then 15.4%. Since the problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", and uses square brackets (which usually denote equilibrium concentrations), the answer is 16.9%.\n\nBut let\'s check one more time with s=0.0925 (from iteration):\n\nx=0.00449 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂]=40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.00856 ≈ 0.001536 M\n\nPercentage: 15.36%\n\nIf the problem expects this, it\'s 15.4%. However, without more information, it\'s ambiguous. Given the possible options, and common problem setups, I think the intended answer is approximately 16.9%, which is 17%, but since the exact calculation gives around 15.4%, there\'s a discrepancy. However, the problem\'s given β values might be log β? If β1=9 is log β1=9, then β1=10^9, which is unrealistic. So no, they are cumulative stability constants.\n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent, I\'ll conclude that the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%, but the precise answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is about 15.4%. Given that the problem might not expect iteration, the answer is 17%.\n\nBut wait, let\'s compute the exact value using the final iteration:\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * x * s² = 40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.008556 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M\n\nPercentage: 0.001536 / 0.01 = 0.1536 or 15.36%\n\nThis is approximately 15.4%. Therefore, the correct answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is 15.4%. However, the problem might have intended the first approximation. But given the calculations, the accurate answer is around 15.4%. Since the problem gives β4=16, which is lower than β3=63, indicating that higher complexes are less stable, the majority of Co is in lower complexes. Therefore, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is around 15.4%.\n\nBut to check, let\'s compute all species with s=0.0925 and x=0.00449:\n\n[Co²⁺] = 0.00449 M\n\n[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9*0.00449*0.0925 ≈ 0.00376 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₂] = 40*0.00449*(0.0925)^2 ≈ 0.001536 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63*0.00449*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.00449*0.000792 ≈ 0.000224 M\n\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16*0.00449*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.00449*0.0000732 ≈ 0.00000526 M\n\nTotal Co: 0.00449 + 0.00376 + 0.001536 + 0.000224 + 0.00000526 ≈ 0.010015 M (checks out)\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂]: (0.001536 / 0.010015) * 100 ≈ 15.34%\n\nTherefore, the accurate answer is approximately 15.3%, which rounds to 15.3%. However, the problem might expect the answer to be given to two significant figures, so 15%.\n\nBut the given stability constants are given as integers, and concentrations are given to one or two decimal places. The answer is likely expected to be around 15% or 16%. However, my precise calculation gives 15.3%. Given that, the answer is approximately 15%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". If the answer options are integers, it\'s likely 15% or 16%. Given the calculation, 15.3% is closest to 15%. However, in some contexts, it\'s rounded to the nearest whole number, so 15%.\n\nBut I need to check if the problem\'s β values are correct. The given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. This is unusual because β3 > β4, which is possible if adding the fourth ligand is less favorable. For example, maybe due to steric hindrance. So the calculations are valid.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering the consumption of SCN⁻, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is approximately 15.3%, which should be rounded to 15% or 15.3% depending on the required precision. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, but the given data has two significant figures (β1=9, β2=40, etc.), the answer should be given to two significant figures, so 15%.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745448407, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8938, prompt_tokens=1249, total_tokens=10187, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt species, we use the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and concentrations (total Co = 0.01 M, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). 

Assuming [SCN⁻] is the free concentration (0.1 M), the initial approximation gives:

\[
\text{[Co(SCN)₂]} = \beta_2 \cdot \text{[Co²⁺]} \cdot \text{[SCN⁻]}^2 = 40 \cdot \text{[Co²⁺]} \cdot (0.1)^2
\]

Total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
\text{[Co²⁺]} \left(1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.1^2 + 63 \cdot 0.1^3 + 16 \cdot 0.1^4\right) = 0.01
\]

Solving for [Co²⁺] gives ≈ 0.00423 M. Thus, [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 0.00169 M, leading to 16.9%. However, considering SCN⁻ consumption reduces free [SCN⁻], iterative calculations show the percentage converges to approximately **15.3%** after accounting for ligand depletion.

**Answer:** \boxed{15\%}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The change is minimal, so further iterations may not be necessary. Let's proceed with the second iteration.

[Co(SCN)₂] = 0.33856 * 0.00451 ≈ 0.001528 M
Percentage: (0.001528/0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.28%

Another iteration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - (0.828 + 2*0.33856 + 3*0.04906 + 4*0.001146)*c₀
= 0.1 - (0.828 + 0.67712 + 0.14718 + 0.004584)*0.00451
= 0.1 - (1.656884)*0.00451 ≈ 0.1 - 0.00747 ≈ 0.09253 M

Using [SCN⁻] = 0.09253 M:
[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9 * c₀ * 0.09253 ≈ 0.83277c₀
[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * c₀ * (0.09253)^2 ≈ 40 * c₀ * 0.00856 ≈ 0.3424c₀
[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63 * c₀ * (0.09253)^3 ≈ 63 * c₀ * 0.000792 ≈ 0.0499c₀
[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16 * c₀ * (0.09253)^4 ≈ 16 * c₀ * 0.0000733 ≈ 0.001173c₀

Total cobalt: c₀*(1 + 0.83277 + 0.3424 + 0.0499 + 0.001173) ≈ c₀*2.22625 = 0.01
c₀ ≈ 0.01/2.22625 ≈ 0.00449 M

[Co(SCN)₂] = 0.3424 * 0.00449 ≈ 0.001537 M
Percentage: (0.001537/0.01)*100 ≈ 15.37%

The value is converging around 15.3-15.4%. Let's check SCN⁻ consumption again:

SCN⁻ consumed = (0.83277 + 2*0.3424 + 3*0.0499 + 4*0.001173)*0.00449
≈ (0.83277 + 0.6848 + 0.1497 + 0.004692)*0.00449
≈ 1.67196 * 0.00449 ≈ 0.00751 M
Free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00751 ≈ 0.09249 M, which is very close to previous. So the percentage is about 15.4%.

But wait, the problem states that the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. Maybe they consider it in excess, so the change in [SCN⁻] is negligible. If that's the case, perhaps the first approximation of 16.9% is acceptable. However, the problem might expect considering the SCN⁻ consumption. But given that the answer after iteration is around 15.4%, but the options might prefer the first approximation. Wait, but the problem says the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. Is that the total concentration or the free concentration?

Wait, the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If that's the total SCN⁻ concentration, then we need to account for the SCN⁻ consumed in complexes. But if it's the free SCN⁻ concentration, then we can use 0.1 M directly. The wording is ambiguous. However, in such problems, if they state the concentration of the ligand, it's usually the total concentration unless specified as free. But here, since they specify "total cobalt concentration", maybe [SCN⁻] is the free concentration. Wait, but in the problem statement: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If that's the analytical concentration (total SCN⁻), then we need to consider that some is consumed in complexes. But if it's the equilibrium concentration (free SCN⁻), then we can use it directly. The problem is ambiguous. However, in many cases, when they give the concentration of a ligand along with a metal ion and stability constants, they often mean the free ligand concentration. But in this case, since the SCN⁻ is in excess (0.1 M vs. Co²⁺ 0.01 M), maybe the consumption is negligible. Let me check.

If [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then the first calculation gives 16.9%. If [SCN⁻] is total, then we need to set up equations considering that total SCN⁻ = 0.1 M = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

But that complicates things. Let me check the problem statement again: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote equilibrium concentration, so free SCN⁻. Therefore, the first approximation where [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is correct, and the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, when I considered SCN⁻ consumption, the percentage dropped to around 15.4%. But if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then we shouldn't adjust it. Wait, but in reality, the SCN⁻ would be consumed, so the free SCN⁻ would be less than 0.1 M. But if the problem says [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, maybe they are giving the free concentration. Let me check standard problem conventions. Typically, if a problem states the concentration of a ligand without mentioning it's in excess or that it's the total concentration, and provides stability constants, it's likely the free ligand concentration. However, in this case, since the SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, even if all Co formed the highest complex, SCN⁻ consumed would be 0.04 M, leaving 0.06 M free. But the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which would imply that the free SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, so the complexes are formed without affecting the SCN⁻ concentration. This is possible if the solution is buffered with excess SCN⁻, but the problem doesn't mention that. However, given the problem states [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we should take it as the equilibrium concentration. Therefore, the first calculation is correct, giving approximately 16.9%. But when I did the iteration, considering that SCN⁻ is consumed, the percentage was lower. But if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, then we must use that as the free concentration, and the answer is 16.9%. However, the problem might have a typo, or maybe the given β values are log β? Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Typically, stability constants can be stepwise (K1, K2, ...) or cumulative (βn). Here, βn is the cumulative constant for n ligands. For example, β2 = K1*K2. If the values are as given, then the first approach is correct. But if the β values were log values, they would be much larger. Since the values are small, they are likely the cumulative stability constants. For example, β1=9, which is reasonable for a cumulative constant. So proceeding with that.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 16.9%, but after considering SCN⁻ consumption, it's around 15.4%. However, if the problem states that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (free), then 16.9% is correct. But given that the problem mentions the total cobalt concentration and the [SCN⁻] concentration, it's possible that [SCN⁻] is the total concentration. Let me re-express the problem with that in mind.

If [SCN⁻] total is 0.1 M, then:

Total SCN⁻ = 0.1 = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

But we also have total Co = 0.01 = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

Let me denote [Co²⁺] = x. Then:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 x [SCN⁻] = 9x[SCN⁻]
[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN⁻]^2 = 40x[SCN⁻]^2
[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 x [SCN⁻]^3 = 63x[SCN⁻]^3
[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 x [SCN⁻]^4 = 16x[SCN⁻]^4

Total Co: x + 9x[SCN⁻] + 40x[SCN⁻]^2 + 63x[SCN⁻]^3 + 16x[SCN⁻]^4 = 0.01

Total SCN⁻: [SCN⁻] + 9x[SCN⁻] + 2*40x[SCN⁻]^2 + 3*63x[SCN⁻]^3 + 4*16x[SCN⁻]^4 = 0.1

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and [SCN⁻]. Solving this would require substitution, but it's complex. Let's attempt an iterative approach.

Assume [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M (initial guess). Then:

Total Co: x(1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x*2.3646 = 0.01 → x ≈ 0.00423 M

Then, compute SCN⁻ consumption:

SCN⁻ consumed = 9x*0.1 + 2*40x*(0.1)^2 + 3*63x*(0.1)^3 + 4*16x*(0.1)^4
= 0.9x + 0.8x + 0.189x + 0.0064x
= 1.8954x ≈ 1.8954*0.00423 ≈ 0.00803 M

Thus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00803 ≈ 0.09197 M

Now, use this [SCN⁻] = 0.09197 M in the total Co equation:

Total Co: x(1 + 9*0.09197 + 40*(0.09197)^2 + 63*(0.09197)^3 + 16*(0.09197)^4)

Calculate each term:

9*0.09197 ≈ 0.8277

40*(0.09197)^2 ≈ 40*0.00846 ≈ 0.3384

63*(0.09197)^3 ≈ 63*(0.000778) ≈ 0.0490

16*(0.09197)^4 ≈ 16*(0.0000715) ≈ 0.001144

Sum: 1 + 0.8277 + 0.3384 + 0.0490 + 0.001144 ≈ 2.2162

Thus, x = 0.01 / 2.2162 ≈ 0.00451 M

Now compute SCN⁻ consumption:

= 9x*0.09197 + 2*40x*(0.09197)^2 + 3*63x*(0.09197)^3 + 4*16x*(0.09197)^4
= 9*0.00451*0.09197 + 2*40*0.00451*(0.09197)^2 + 3*63*0.00451*(0.09197)^3 + 4*16*0.00451*(0.09197)^4

Calculate each term:

First term: 9*0.00451*0.09197 ≈ 0.00376

Second term: 2*40*0.00451*0.00846 ≈ 0.00306

Third term: 3*63*0.00451*0.000778 ≈ 0.00066

Fourth term: 4*16*0.00451*0.0000715 ≈ 0.0000206

Total SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 0.00376 + 0.00306 + 0.00066 + 0.0000206 ≈ 0.0075 M

Thus, free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.0075 ≈ 0.0925 M

Repeat the process with [SCN⁻] = 0.0925 M:

Total Co: x(1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4)

Calculate:

9*0.0925 ≈ 0.8325

40*(0.0925)^2 ≈ 40*0.00856 ≈ 0.3424

63*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.000792 ≈ 0.0499

16*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.0000732 ≈ 0.001171

Sum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.3424 + 0.0499 + 0.001171 ≈ 2.22597

x = 0.01 / 2.22597 ≈ 0.00449 M

SCN⁻ consumed:

= 9*0.00449*0.0925 + 2*40*0.00449*(0.0925)^2 + 3*63*0.00449*(0.0925)^3 + 4*16*0.00449*(0.0925)^4

First term: 9*0.00449*0.0925 ≈ 0.00376

Second term: 2*40*0.00449*0.00856 ≈ 0.00307

Third term: 3*63*0.00449*0.000792 ≈ 0.00067

Fourth term: 4*16*0.00449*0.0000732 ≈ 0.000021

Total SCN⁻ consumed ≈ 0.00376 + 0.00307 + 0.00067 + 0.000021 ≈ 0.00752 M

Free [SCN⁻] = 0.1 - 0.00752 ≈ 0.09248 M

Convergence is achieved. Now, compute [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.00856 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M

Percentage: (0.001536 / 0.01) * 100 ≈ 15.36%

So, considering that [SCN⁻] total is 0.1 M, the percentage is approximately 15.4%. However, the problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If this is the total SCN⁻, then the answer is ~15.4%. If it's the free SCN⁻, then the answer is ~16.9%. The problem's wording is ambiguous. In many textbooks, when they provide the concentration of the ligand without specifying, it's usually the total concentration. However, in coordination chemistry problems, sometimes they assume the ligand is in large excess, so free ≈ total. Given that SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, even if all Co is complexed as [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, it would consume 0.04 M SCN⁻, leaving 0.06 M free. But the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which would mean that the solution has additional SCN⁻ to keep the free concentration at 0.1 M, perhaps using a buffer or excess SCN⁻. However, without such information, it's ambiguous.

Given the problem's phrasing, it's safer to assume that [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, so the first calculation of ~16.9% is correct. However, considering the problem might expect accounting for SCN⁻ consumption, leading to ~15.4%. But the given β values are quite low, which might imply that the complexes are not very stable, so the consumption of SCN⁻ is minimal. Let's check the first approximation again with β2=40:

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * [Co²⁺] * 0.01

If [Co²⁺] is x, then total Co = x + 9x*0.1 + 40x*0.01 + 63x*0.001 + 16x*0.0001 = x*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 2.3646x = 0.01 → x ≈ 0.00423

Thus, [Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of 0.01 M.

But if SCN⁻ is free at 0.1 M, this is correct. If SCN⁻ is total, then the answer is lower. Given the problem's wording, I think the intended answer is 16.9%, rounding to 17%, but let's check the β values again. Wait, β2=40, which is the cumulative constant for two SCN⁻ ligands. So the calculation is correct. However, the stepwise constants would be K1=β1=9, K2=β2/β1=40/9≈4.44, K3=β3/β2=63/40≈1.575, K4=β4/β3=16/63≈0.254. The decreasing K values make sense, as adding more ligands becomes harder. The fourth K is less than 1, indicating lower stability. So the calculations are valid.

Given that, and if the problem states [SCN⁻]=0.1 M as free, the answer is approximately 16.9%. However, the exact answer after considering SCN⁻ consumption is around 15.4%. But since the problem might not expect iteration, the first approximation is likely expected. Let's compute it precisely.

First approximation:

[Co²⁺] = 0.01 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = 0.01 / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.1² = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M

Percentage: (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.9%

If the problem expects this answer, it's 16.9%. However, considering the iterations, it's about 15.4%. But without more information, I think the problem expects the first approach. Therefore, the answer is approximately 17%.

But let's check exact calculation with the system of equations. Let me set up the equations properly.

Let [SCN⁻] = s

Total Co: x + 9x s + 40x s² + 63x s³ + 16x s⁴ = 0.01

Total SCN⁻: s + 9x s + 2*40x s² + 3*63x s³ + 4*16x s⁴ = 0.1

This is a system of nonlinear equations. Let's substitute x from the first equation into the second.

From the first equation:

x = 0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)

Substitute into the second equation:

s + 9*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s + 2*40*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s² + 3*63*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s³ + 4*16*(0.01 / (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)) * s⁴ = 0.1

Multiply both sides by (1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴):

s*(1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴) + 0.09s + 0.8s² + 1.89s³ + 0.64s⁴ = 0.1*(1 + 9s + 40s² + 63s³ + 16s⁴)

Expand left side:

s + 9s² + 40s³ + 63s⁴ + 16s⁵ + 0.09s + 0.8s² + 1.89s³ + 0.64s⁴

Combine like terms:

s + 0.09s = 1.09s

9s² + 0.8s² = 9.8s²

40s³ + 1.89s³ = 41.89s³

63s⁴ + 0.64s⁴ = 63.64s⁴

16s⁵

Right side:

0.1 + 0.9s + 4s² + 6.3s³ + 1.6s⁴

Set equation:

1.09s + 9.8s² + 41.89s³ + 63.64s⁴ + 16s⁵ = 0.1 + 0.9s + 4s² + 6.3s³ + 1.6s⁴

Bring all terms to left side:

1.09s - 0.9s + 9.8s² - 4s² + 41.89s³ - 6.3s³ + 63.64s⁴ - 1.6s⁴ + 16s⁵ - 0.1 = 0

Simplify:

0.19s + 5.8s² + 35.59s³ + 62.04s⁴ + 16s⁵ - 0.1 = 0

This is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. Let's attempt numerical methods. Let's denote f(s) = 16s⁵ + 62.04s⁴ + 35.59s³ + 5.8s² + 0.19s - 0.1

We need to find s where f(s) = 0. Let's try s=0.09:

f(0.09) = 16*(0.09)^5 + 62.04*(0.09)^4 + 35.59*(0.09)^3 + 5.8*(0.09)^2 + 0.19*0.09 - 0.1

Calculate each term:

16*(0.000059) ≈ 0.000944

62.04*(0.0006561) ≈ 0.0407

35.59*(0.000729) ≈ 0.0259

5.8*(0.0081) ≈ 0.04698

0.19*0.09 ≈ 0.0171

Sum: 0.000944 + 0.0407 + 0.0259 + 0.04698 + 0.0171 - 0.1 ≈ 0.1316 - 0.1 = 0.0316 >0

Try s=0.1:

f(0.1) = 16*(0.1)^5 + 62.04*(0.1)^4 + 35.59*(0.1)^3 + 5.8*(0.1)^2 + 0.19*0.1 - 0.1

= 0.00016 + 0.06204 + 0.03559 + 0.058 + 0.019 - 0.1 ≈ 0.17479 - 0.1 = 0.07479 >0

Wait, but earlier iterations suggested s≈0.0925. Let's try s=0.08:

f(0.08) = 16*(0.08)^5 + 62.04*(0.08)^4 + 35.59*(0.08)^3 + 5.8*(0.08)^2 + 0.19*0.08 - 0.1

= 16*0.000032768 + 62.04*0.0004096 + 35.59*0.000512 + 5.8*0.0064 + 0.0152 - 0.1

≈ 0.000524 + 0.0254 + 0.0182 + 0.03712 + 0.0152 - 0.1 ≈ 0.096444 - 0.1 ≈ -0.003556 <0

So between s=0.08 and s=0.09, f(s) crosses zero. Use linear approximation:

At s=0.08, f=-0.003556

At s=0.09, f=0.0316

The difference in s=0.01 corresponds to Δf=0.0316 - (-0.003556)=0.035156

We need to find Δs where f=0:

Δs = 0.08 + (0 - (-0.003556))/0.035156 * 0.01 ≈ 0.08 + (0.003556/0.035156)*0.01 ≈ 0.08 + 0.00101 ≈ 0.08101

Check s=0.081:

f(0.081) = 16*(0.081)^5 + 62.04*(0.081)^4 + 35.59*(0.081)^3 + 5.8*(0.081)^2 + 0.19*0.081 - 0.1

Approximate:

(0.081)^2=0.006561, (0.081)^3≈0.000531, (0.081)^4≈0.000043, (0.081)^5≈0.0000035

So:

16*0.0000035 ≈ 0.000056

62.04*0.000043 ≈ 0.002668

35.59*0.000531 ≈ 0.0189

5.8*0.006561 ≈ 0.03805

0.19*0.081 ≈ 0.01539

Sum: 0.000056 + 0.002668 + 0.0189 + 0.03805 + 0.01539 ≈ 0.074064 - 0.1 ≈ -0.025936

Wait, this doesn't match previous calculation. Maybe my approximations are off. Let's compute more accurately:

s=0.081

s²=0.006561

s³=0.081*0.006561≈0.000531

s⁴=0.081*0.000531≈0.00004301

s⁵≈0.081*0.00004301≈0.00000348

Now:

16s⁵ ≈ 0.0000557

62.04s⁴ ≈ 62.04*0.00004301 ≈ 0.002668

35.59s³ ≈ 35.59*0.000531 ≈ 0.0189

5.8s² ≈ 5.8*0.006561 ≈ 0.03805

0.19s ≈ 0.19*0.081 ≈ 0.01539

Sum: 0.0000557 + 0.002668 + 0.0189 + 0.03805 + 0.01539 ≈ 0.0740637 - 0.1 ≈ -0.0259363

Still negative. Wait, this contradicts the earlier calculation. Maybe my method is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the function is not linear in this interval. Let's try s=0.085:

s=0.085

s²=0.007225

s³=0.0006141

s⁴=0.0000522

s⁵≈0.00000443

16s⁵≈0.0000709

62.04s⁴≈62.04*0.0000522≈0.00324

35.59s³≈35.59*0.0006141≈0.02186

5.8s²≈5.8*0.007225≈0.0419

0.19s≈0.01615

Sum: 0.0000709 + 0.00324 + 0.02186 + 0.0419 + 0.01615 ≈ 0.08222 - 0.1 ≈ -0.01778

Still negative. s=0.09 gives f=0.0316, s=0.085 gives f≈-0.01778. Wait, this suggests the root is between 0.085 and 0.09. Let's try s=0.0875:

s=0.0875

s²=0.007656

s³≈0.000669

s⁴≈0.0000585

s⁵≈0.00000512

16s⁵≈0.000082

62.04s⁴≈62.04*0.0000585≈0.00363

35.59s³≈35.59*0.000669≈0.0238

5.8s²≈5.8*0.007656≈0.0444

0.19s≈0.016625

Sum: 0.000082 + 0.00363 + 0.0238 + 0.0444 + 0.016625 ≈ 0.088537 - 0.1 ≈ -0.01146

s=0.09 gives f=0.0316, s=0.0875 gives f≈-0.01146. Let's interpolate between s=0.0875 (-0.01146) and s=0.09 (0.0316). The difference in f is 0.0316 - (-0.01146)=0.04306 over Δs=0.0025. To reach f=0, need Δs=0.0875 + (0.01146/0.04306)*0.0025 ≈ 0.0875 + 0.00067 ≈ 0.08817

Check s=0.08817:

s²≈0.007774

s³≈0.000685

s⁴≈0.0000604

s⁵≈0.00000533

16s⁵≈0.0000853

62.04s⁴≈62.04*0.0000604≈0.003746

35.59s³≈35.59*0.000685≈0.02437

5.8s²≈5.8*0.007774≈0.0451

0.19s≈0.01675

Sum: 0.0000853 + 0.003746 + 0.02437 + 0.0451 + 0.01675 ≈ 0.08905 - 0.1 ≈ -0.01095

Still not close. This method is too time-consuming. Alternatively, use the previous iteration results where after two iterations, s≈0.0925 M, leading to [Co(SCN)₂]≈15.4%. However, given the complexity, the problem likely expects the first approximation where [SCN⁻]=0.1 M, leading to 16.9%.

But considering the answer options (if any) and standard problem conventions, the answer is likely 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, the exact answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is approximately 15.4%. Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, it's safer to go with the first approach if [SCN⁻] is free, leading to 16.9%. If the problem intended total SCN⁻, then 15.4%. Since the problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M", and uses square brackets (which usually denote equilibrium concentrations), the answer is 16.9%.

But let's check one more time with s=0.0925 (from iteration):

x=0.00449 M

[Co(SCN)₂]=40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.00856 ≈ 0.001536 M

Percentage: 15.36%

If the problem expects this, it's 15.4%. However, without more information, it's ambiguous. Given the possible options, and common problem setups, I think the intended answer is approximately 16.9%, which is 17%, but since the exact calculation gives around 15.4%, there's a discrepancy. However, the problem's given β values might be log β? If β1=9 is log β1=9, then β1=10^9, which is unrealistic. So no, they are cumulative stability constants.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%, but the precise answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is about 15.4%. Given that the problem might not expect iteration, the answer is 17%.

But wait, let's compute the exact value using the final iteration:

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * x * s² = 40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2 ≈ 40 * 0.00449 * 0.008556 ≈ 40 * 0.0000384 ≈ 0.001536 M

Percentage: 0.001536 / 0.01 = 0.1536 or 15.36%

This is approximately 15.4%. Therefore, the correct answer considering SCN⁻ consumption is 15.4%. However, the problem might have intended the first approximation. But given the calculations, the accurate answer is around 15.4%. Since the problem gives β4=16, which is lower than β3=63, indicating that higher complexes are less stable, the majority of Co is in lower complexes. Therefore, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is around 15.4%.

But to check, let's compute all species with s=0.0925 and x=0.00449:

[Co²⁺] = 0.00449 M

[Co(SCN)⁺] = 9*0.00449*0.0925 ≈ 0.00376 M

[Co(SCN)₂] = 40*0.00449*(0.0925)^2 ≈ 0.001536 M

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = 63*0.00449*(0.0925)^3 ≈ 63*0.00449*0.000792 ≈ 0.000224 M

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 16*0.00449*(0.0925)^4 ≈ 16*0.00449*0.0000732 ≈ 0.00000526 M

Total Co: 0.00449 + 0.00376 + 0.001536 + 0.000224 + 0.00000526 ≈ 0.010015 M (checks out)

Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]: (0.001536 / 0.010015) * 100 ≈ 15.34%

Therefore, the accurate answer is approximately 15.3%, which rounds to 15.3%. However, the problem might expect the answer to be given to two significant figures, so 15%.

But the given stability constants are given as integers, and concentrations are given to one or two decimal places. The answer is likely expected to be around 15% or 16%. However, my precise calculation gives 15.3%. Given that, the answer is approximately 15%.

But wait, the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". If the answer options are integers, it's likely 15% or 16%. Given the calculation, 15.3% is closest to 15%. However, in some contexts, it's rounded to the nearest whole number, so 15%.

But I need to check if the problem's β values are correct. The given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. This is unusual because β3 > β4, which is possible if adding the fourth ligand is less favorable. For example, maybe due to steric hindrance. So the calculations are valid.

In conclusion, after considering the consumption of SCN⁻, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is approximately 15.3%, which should be rounded to 15% or 15.3% depending on the required precision. Since the problem doesn't specify, but the given data has two significant figures (β1=9, β2=40, etc.), the answer should be given to two significant figures, so 15%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by using the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

The fraction of cobalt in the form of [Co(SCN)₂] is given by:

\[
\alpha_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

Substituting the given values and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M:

\[
\alpha_2 = \frac{40 \times (0.1)^2}{1 + 9 \times 0.1 + 40 \times (0.1)^2 + 63 \times (0.1)^3 + 16 \times (0.1)^4}
\]

Calculating each term in the denominator:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The numerator is:

\[
40 \times 0.01 = 0.4
\]

Thus, the fraction \(\alpha_2\) is:

\[
\alpha_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1692
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
0.1692 \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately 17%.

\[
\boxed{17\%}
\]

Iterating further would yield minimal changes.

Using the adjusted [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.092 M, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is (0.33856 * 0.00451) / 0.01 * 100 ≈ (0.001526) / 0.01 * 100 ≈ 15.26%.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, use the approximation that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M, leading to ~16.9%, which is close enough given possible errors. Alternatively, use exact calculation.

Alternatively, use the formula for the distribution of complexes. The fraction of Co²+ in the form of [Co(SCN)₂] is:

α₂ = β₂ [SCN⁻]^2 / (1 + β1 [SCN⁻] + β2 [SCN⁻]^2 + β3 [SCN⁻]^3 + β4 [SCN⁻]^4)

Plugging in [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M:

Denominator = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

Calculate each term:

1 = 1

9*0.1 = 0.9

40*0.01 = 0.4

63*0.001 = 0.063

16*0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

Thus, α₂ = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692, so 16.92%.

Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%.

But wait, the problem states β3=63 and β4=16. That seems odd because usually, β increases with each ligand addition. If β4 is less than β3, it might indicate that the fourth ligand is less stable, which is possible. So, the calculation is correct as per given values.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. But let me check again.

Wait, the denominator is 2.3646, and the numerator is 0.4. 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.1692, so 16.92%, which is 16.9% when rounded to one decimal place. The problem might expect an integer, so 17%, but perhaps 16.9% is acceptable. Alternatively, check if the given β values are stepwise (K1, K2, etc.) instead of cumulative (β). Wait, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Typically, βn is the cumulative stability constant for the complex with n ligands, so β2 = K1*K2. If that's the case, then the calculation is correct as done above.

Yes, so the answer is approximately 16.9%, so the percentage is 16.9% or 17%. Depending on the problem's required precision, but likely 16.9% is the exact value. So, the answer is 16.9%.

**Final Answer**
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{17\%}.
