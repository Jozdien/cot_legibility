# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) in a uniformly distributed stellar population is determined by the relationship between parallax and distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), a small parallax range \( d(\text{plx}) \) corresponds to a spherical shell in space with thickness \( dr \), where \( r = 1/\text{plx} \). 

The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = 1/\text{plx} \) and \( dr = -1/\text{plx}^2 \, d(\text{plx}) \), the volume becomes proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \, d(\text{plx}) \). Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax, which scales with volume, is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax increases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). This means the distribution rises steeply at smaller parallaxes (larger distances) under the assumption of uniform stellar density. 

Final answer:  
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax (plx) is related to the distance of a star from us. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and the farther away it is, the smaller the parallax. 

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, that should mean their number density is constant in space, right? So, if we consider a volume element in space, the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume itself. But we need to relate this to parallax. 

Let me think. If we have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + d(plx), this corresponds to a range in distance from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx. So, I need to express the volume element in terms of parallax. 

First, let's express the volume element in spherical coordinates. The volume element is 4πr² dr, where r is the distance. But since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/r, we need to change variables from r to plx. 

Let me do that substitution. Let plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. Then, dr/d(plx) = -1/plx². The absolute value of that derivative is 1/plx². So, when changing variables from r to plx, the volume element becomes 4πr² dr = 4π(1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). 

Wait, let me check that again. If r = 1/plx, then dr = -1/plx² d(plx). The volume element is 4πr² dr, so substituting, we get 4π*(1/plx)² * (-1/plx²) d(plx). The negative sign just indicates the direction, but since we're interested in the magnitude (volume can't be negative), we take the absolute value. So, the volume element becomes 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). 

Therefore, the number of stars in a parallax range d(plx) is proportional to 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). So, the number per unit parallax (i.e., the density in parallax space) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, that seems like a steep dependence. Let me verify. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars at distance r is proportional to r² dr. But when we change variables to parallax, which is 1/r, the number should be proportional to (1/plx²) * (dr/d(plx)) d(plx). Since dr/d(plx) = -1/plx², so the number becomes proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So yes, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If you have more stars at larger distances (since volume increases with r²), but parallax decreases with distance. So, as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax should increase? Wait, but according to this, it's 1/plx⁴, so as plx decreases (distance increases), 1/plx⁴ increases. So, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as parallax decreases. That makes sense because even though each shell at larger r has more volume, when you map it to parallax, the bins in parallax get compressed. 

Wait, let's think of it another way. Suppose you have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + Δplx. The corresponding distances are from 1/(plx + Δplx) to 1/plx. The volume between these distances is 4π/3 [ (1/plx)^3 - (1/(plx + Δplx))^3 ] ≈ 4π/3 [ 3/(plx^4) Δplx ] (using a Taylor expansion for small Δplx). So, the volume is approximately 4π/plx^4 Δplx. Therefore, the number of stars is proportional to 4π/plx^4 Δplx, so the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. 

Yes, that seems consistent. So, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx to the -4th power. Therefore, the distribution of stars per unit parallax falls off very steeply as parallax increases (i.e., for nearby stars, there are fewer stars per unit parallax, and for distant stars, more stars per unit parallax). 

But wait, this seems contradictory to the fact that in reality, we have more nearby stars because we can see them, but in reality, the distribution isn't uniform. However, the question assumes uniform distribution, so even though in reality the number might drop due to observational limits, here we have to assume uniformity. 

So, under uniform density, the number per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. 

But let me check with an example. Suppose plx is 1 arcsec, which corresponds to 1 parsec distance. A plx of 0.5 arcsec corresponds to 2 parsecs. The volume between 1 and 2 parsecs is 4π/3 (8 - 1) = 28π/3. The volume between 2 and 4 parsecs (plx from 0.5 to 0.25) is 4π/3 (64 - 8) = 224π/3. So, the volume is 8 times larger. The parallax interval here is 0.25, compared to the previous interval of 0.5. Wait, but in terms of per unit parallax, the first interval (from 1 to 0.5 plx) has a Δplx of 0.5, and the volume is 28π/3. The volume per unit parallax is 28π/3 / 0.5 = 56π/3. The second interval (plx from 0.5 to 0.25) has Δplx of 0.25, and volume 224π/3. Volume per unit parallax is 224π/3 / 0.25 = 896π/3. 

Comparing 56π/3 vs 896π/3, which is a factor of 16. But the plx ratio is 1 vs 0.5, so plx decreased by a factor of 2, and the volume per unit parallax increased by a factor of 16, which is (1/plx)^4, since (1/0.5)^4 = 16. So yes, that matches. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4. 

But wait, another way to think: if you have N = ρ * Volume, where ρ is the number density. Then, dN/d(plx) = ρ * dV/d(plx). We found dV/d(plx) = 4π / plx^4. Therefore, dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4. So, indeed, proportional to plx^-4. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4, so it increases as plx decreases. 

But let me check if I made a mistake in the derivative. Let's do the derivative step by step. 

Given plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. 

Volume as a function of r is V(r) = 4π/3 r^3. 

So, dV/dr = 4π r². 

But we need dV/d(plx) = dV/dr * dr/d(plx). 

Since dr/d(plx) = -1/plx² = -r². 

Therefore, dV/d(plx) = 4π r² * (-r²) = -4π r^4. 

But r = 1/plx, so substituting back, dV/d(plx) = -4π (1/plx)^4. 

Taking absolute value, it's 4π / plx^4. 

Therefore, yes, the derivative is correct. 

Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. 

So, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. Wait, but if plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases. So, as parallax increases (stars are closer), the number per unit parallax decreases. Conversely, as parallax decreases (stars are farther), the number per unit parallax increases. 

But in terms of the function, N(plx) d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4 d(plx). So, the density is 4πρ / plx^4. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. 

So, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx^-4. Therefore, when you plot the number of stars per unit parallax against parallax, it's a steeply rising curve as parallax decreases. 

But wait, in reality, we don't see this because stars are not uniformly distributed, and there are observational limits. But in the idealized case here, with uniform distribution, this is the result. 

Yes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx^{-4}, meaning it increases as parallax decreases.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax (plx) is related to the distance of a star from us. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and the farther away it is, the smaller the parallax.

Wait, let me check that again. If r = 1/plx, then dr = -1/plx² d(plx). The volume element is 4πr² dr, so substituting, we get 4π*(1/plx)² * (-1/plx²) d(plx). The negative sign just indicates the direction, but since we're interested in the magnitude (volume can't be negative), we take the absolute value. So, the volume element becomes 4π / plx⁴ d(plx).

In order to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies with parallax, assuming uniform stellar distribution across the sky, I'll need to analyze the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance, expressed as plx = 1/d, where d represents distance measured in parsecs. This means stars closer to us have larger parallax values, while more distant stars have smaller parallax measurements.

Since I'm investigating the number of stars per unit parallax, and given that stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space should be constant. This means the number of stars within any volume of space is directly proportional to that volume. I need to connect this concept to parallax.

For a small parallax range from plx to plx + d(plx), there's a corresponding distance range from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx. I need to express the volume element in terms of parallax rather than distance.

In spherical coordinates, the volume element is expressed as 4πr² dr, with r representing distance. To convert this to parallax terms, I'll substitute plx = 1/r, which means r = 1/plx. The derivative dr/d(plx) equals -1/plx². Taking the absolute value of this derivative gives 1/plx².

When changing variables from r to plx, the volume element transforms as follows:
4πr² dr = 4π(1/plx)² × (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π/plx⁴ d(plx)

Let me verify this calculation. With r = 1/plx, we get dr = -1/plx² d(plx). Substituting into the volume element formula 4πr² dr yields 4π×(1/plx)² × (-1/plx²) d(plx). Since volume cannot be negative, I take the absolute value, resulting in 4π/plx⁴ d(plx).

Therefore, the number of stars in a particular volume is proportional to 4π/plx⁴ d(plx).

Alright, I need to determine how the number of stars per unit of parallax varies with parallax, given that stars are evenly dispersed across the sky. Let's begin by understanding parallax. Parallax (plx) relates to the distance of a star from us. It is calculated using the formula plx = 1/d, with d representing distance in parsecs. Hence, stars closer to us have a larger parallax, while those farther away have a smaller one.

The focus here is on the number of stars per unit of parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density should remain constant in space. Consequently, the number of stars within a given volume would be proportional to that volume. However, we must connect this to parallax.

Let me think this through. When we take a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + d(plx), it corresponds to a distance range from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx. Thus, we need to express the volume element in terms of parallax.

To do this, let's use spherical coordinates for the volume element. The volume element is 4πr² dr, where r is the distance. Since we're associating this with parallax, which is 1/r, variable substitution from r to plx is needed.

Let's make this substitution: let plx = 1/r, therefore r = 1/plx. The derivative dr/d(plx) equals -1/plx². Taking the absolute value of this derivative gives 1/plx². Thus, upon changing variables from r to plx, the volume element becomes 4πr² dr = 4π(1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4π / plx⁴ d(plx).

Let me verify that. If r = 1/plx, then dr equals -1/plx² d(plx). Substituting into the volume element 4πr² dr, we find 4π*(1/plx)² * (-1/plx²) d(plx). The negative sign shows direction, but considering we're interested in magnitude (since volume can't be negative), we use the absolute value. Therefore, the volume element becomes 4π / plx⁴ d(plx).

Hence, the number of stars in a

So, the number per unit parallax (i.e., the density) would be proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut wait, that seems like a steep dependence. Let me verify. If the number density in space is uniform, then the number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to r² dr. But when we change variables to plx, which is 1/r, the number becomes proportional to (1/plx²) * (dr/d(plx)) d(plx). Since dr/d(plx) is -1/plx², so the total is (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So, yes, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive. If plx is small (distant stars), the number per unit parallax is very large, and for nearby stars (large plx), the number per unit parallax is small. That makes sense because a small range in parallax at small plx (distant stars) corresponds to a large range in distance, hence more volume, but wait, no. Wait, actually, when plx is small (distant stars), a unit range in plx corresponds to a larger range in distance. Let me think. \n\nSuppose plx is 0.1 arcsec, so distance is 10 pc. A parallax range from 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec corresponds to distance from 10 pc to 5 pc. So, the distance range is 5 pc. But if plx is 0.01 arcsec (100 pc), a range from 0.01 to 0.02 arcsec corresponds to 100 pc to 50 pc, a distance range of 50 pc. So, the same parallax interval (0.01 arcsec) corresponds to a larger distance interval when plx is smaller. Therefore, the volume element for a given d(plx) increases as plx decreases. \n\nBut according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as plx decreases (more distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases. But since each unit parallax corresponds to a larger volume when plx is small, but the volume element is scaling as 1/plx⁴. Let me check with numbers. \n\nSuppose we have plx1 = 0.1 arcsec (10 pc). The volume element for d(plx) = 0.01 arcsec would be 4π*(10 pc)^2 * (0.01 arcsec corresponds to dr = 1/(0.1 - 0.01) - 1/0.1? Wait, maybe this approach is confusing. Let's use the formula. \n\nIf plx = 1/r, then a small change in plx, delta_plx, corresponds to a change in r, delta_r = - (1/(plx + delta_plx) - 1/plx) ≈ (delta_plx)/plx². So, delta_r ≈ delta_plx / plx². Therefore, the volume element is 4πr² delta_r = 4π(1/plx)² * (delta_plx / plx²) = 4π delta_plx / plx⁴. \n\nTherefore, the number of stars in delta_plx is proportional to delta_plx / plx⁴. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases as 1/plx⁴. However, in reality, we know that if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars should increase with distance cubed, but since we are limited by flux, etc., but here we are assuming uniform distribution without considering brightness. Wait, but the question is purely about spatial distribution. \n\nWait, but in reality, the number of stars you observe up to a certain distance depends on the volume, which is r³. But here, we are considering differential number per unit parallax. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let's think again. \n\nIf the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr is dN = n * 4πr² dr. \n\nBut we want to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/r (in arcseconds when r is in parsecs), then r = 1/plx, and dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). \n\nTherefore, substituting into dN: \n\ndN = n * 4π (1/plx)² * |dr| = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx). \n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is dN/d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴. \n\nSo, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut this seems to indicate that as parallax decreases (i.e., as we look at more distant stars), the number of stars per unit parallax increases rapidly. However, this seems counterintuitive because the volume at larger distances (smaller plx) is larger, but the number density is constant. Wait, but the problem is that a unit interval in parallax corresponds to a larger physical volume when plx is smaller. \n\nFor example, consider two different parallax ranges: \n\n1. From plx = 1 to plx = 0.5 (distance from 1 pc to 2 pc). The volume is 4π*(2³ -1³)/3 = 4π*(8 -1)/3 = 28π/3 ≈ 29.32 pc³. \n\n2. From plx = 0.5 to plx = 0.25 (distance from 2 pc to 4 pc). The volume is 4π*(4³ -2³)/3 = 4π*(64 -8)/3 = 4π*56/3 ≈ 234.57 pc³. \n\nSo, each halving of parallax (from 1 to 0.5, then 0.5 to 0.25) corresponds to increasing the volume by a factor of 8 (since (4³ -2³)/(2³ -1³) = (56)/7 = 8). But the parallax interval in the first case is 0.5, and in the second case is 0.25. Wait, no, the parallax intervals here are 0.5 and 0.25, but the actual intervals in parallax are different. Wait, maybe I need to compute the number of stars per unit parallax. \n\nIn the first interval, from plx=1 to plx=0.5, delta_plx=0.5. The number of stars is proportional to 4πn / plx⁴ * delta_plx. But plx varies from 1 to 0.5, so the integral would be ∫ from 0.5 to 1 of 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx) = 4πn [ (1/(-3)) plx^(-3) ] from 0.5 to 1 = (4πn/3)(1 - 8) = -28πn/3. Taking absolute, 28πn/3. \n\nSimilarly, for plx from 0.5 to 0.25, delta_plx=0.25. The integral is ∫ from 0.25 to 0.5 of 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx) = 4πn/3 [ (1/(0.25)^3 - 1/(0.5)^3 ) ] = 4πn/3 (64 - 8) = 4πn/3 *56 = 224πn/3 ≈ 74.67πn. \n\nBut the delta_plx here is 0.25, so the number per unit parallax in that region would be approximately 224πn/3 /0.25 = 896πn/3 ≈ 298.67πn. \n\nWhereas in the first interval, delta_plx=0.5, so number per unit parallax is 28πn/3 /0.5 ≈ 18.67πn. \n\nWait, so even though the volume is larger for the smaller plx interval, the number per unit parallax is actually higher? But according to the formula, the number per unit parallax is 4πn / plx⁴. So at plx=1, it's 4πn, at plx=0.5, it's 4πn / (0.5)^4 = 4πn /0.0625=64πn, and at plx=0.25, it's 4πn / (0.25)^4=4πn /0.00390625≈1024πn. \n\nSo, yes, the number per unit parallax increases rapidly as plx decreases. \n\nBut this seems to suggest that there are more stars per unit parallax at smaller plx (larger distances). However, in reality, when we observe stars, we see fewer stars at larger distances because they are fainter, but this question assumes uniform distribution without considering observational limitations. So, in this idealized scenario, even though the volume at larger distances is bigger, the way parallax relates to distance causes the number per unit parallax to increase as plx decreases. \n\nBut let's think again. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars at a distance between r and r+dr is proportional to r² dr. When we change variables to plx=1/r, then r=1/plx, dr= -1/plx² d(plx). So, substituting, the number becomes proportional to (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax, i.e., N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴. \n\nBut wait, let me check units. Parallax is in arcseconds, distance in parsecs. The number per unit parallax (per arcsecond) would have units of stars per arcsecond. The relation plx = 1/d (parsecs). So, if we have N(plx) d(plx) = number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx). \n\nBut according to the calculation, N(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴. So, yes, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to plx⁴. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx^(-4), so it increases as plx decreases. \n\nBut this seems to contradict the intuition that there are more stars at larger distances (smaller plx) but since the volume is larger, but the number per unit parallax depends on how the volume element translates into parallax. Since a small plx corresponds to a large distance, and a unit change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance when plx is small. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have plx1 = 0.1 arcsec (10 pc) and plx2 = 0.2 arcsec (5 pc). The distance between plx1 and plx1 + delta_plx is from 10 pc to 1/(0.1 + delta_plx). If delta_plx = 0.01 arcsec, then the new distance is 1/0.11 ≈ 9.09 pc, so delta_r = 0.91 pc. \n\nFor plx = 0.01 arcsec (100 pc), delta_plx = 0.01 arcsec would give a new distance of 1/0.02 = 50 pc, so delta_r = 50 pc. \n\nSo, the same delta_plx of 0.01 arcsec corresponds to a delta_r of 0.91 pc at plx=0.1, and 50 pc at plx=0.01. Therefore, the volume element for delta_plx=0.01 is much larger at smaller plx (larger distance). Hence, the number of stars in that delta_plx is proportional to the volume element, which is 4πr² delta_r. \n\nAt plx=0.1, r=10 pc, delta_r=0.91 pc, volume ≈4π*(10)^2*0.91 ≈ 4π*100*0.91 ≈ 1140.4 pc³. \n\nAt plx=0.01, r=100 pc, delta_r=50 pc, volume≈4π*(100)^2*50 ≈4π*10,000*50≈6,283,185 pc³. \n\nSo, the volume (and hence number of stars) for the same delta_plx is much larger at smaller plx.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. 

For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). We need to express this volume element in terms of parallax. 

Changing variables from distance \( d \) to parallax \( \text{plx} \), we have \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The differential distance \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) is given by:
\[
dd = \left| \frac{d}{d(\text{plx})} \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \right) \right| d(\text{plx}) = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \) into the volume element, we get:
\[
4\pi d^2 \, dd = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx})
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with \( \text{plx} \) as:

\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

parallax range d(plx) around plx is proportional to 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). So, the number per unit parallax (i.e., the density) would be proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, that seems like a steep dependence. Let me verify. If the number density in space is uniform, then the number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to r² dr. But when we change variables to plx, which is 1/r, the number becomes proportional to (1/plx²) * (dr/d(plx)) d(plx). Since dr/d(plx) is -1/plx², so the total is (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So, yes, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If plx is small (distant stars), the number per unit parallax is very large, and for nearby stars (large plx), the number per unit parallax is small. That makes sense because a small range in parallax at small plx (distant stars) corresponds to a large range in distance, hence more volume, but wait, no. Wait, actually, when plx is small (distant stars), a unit range in plx corresponds to a larger range in distance. Let me think. 

Suppose plx is 0.1 arcsec, so distance is 10 pc. A parallax range from 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec corresponds to distance from 10 pc to 5 pc. So, the distance range is 5 pc. But if plx is 0.01 arcsec (100 pc), a range from 0.01 to 0.02 arcsec corresponds to 100 pc to 50 pc, a distance range of 50 pc. So, the same parallax interval (0.01 arcsec) corresponds to a larger distance interval when plx is smaller. Therefore, the volume element for a given d(plx) increases as plx decreases. 

But according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as plx decreases (more distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases. But since each unit parallax corresponds to a larger volume when plx is small, but the volume element is scaling as 1/plx⁴. Let me check with numbers. 

Suppose we have plx1 = 0.1 arcsec (10 pc). The volume element for d(plx) = 0.01 arcsec would be 4π*(10 pc)^2 * (0.01 arcsec corresponds to dr = 1/(0.1 - 0.01) - 1/0.1? Wait, maybe this approach is confusing. Let's use the formula. 

If plx = 1/r, then a small change in plx, delta_plx, corresponds to a change in r, delta_r = - (1/(plx + delta_plx) - 1/plx) ≈ (delta_plx)/plx². So, delta_r ≈ delta_plx / plx². Therefore, the volume element is 4πr² delta_r = 4π(1/plx)² * (delta_plx / plx²) = 4π delta_plx / plx⁴. 

Therefore, the number of stars in delta_plx is proportional to delta_plx / plx⁴. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But this seems to suggest that as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases as 1/plx⁴. However, in reality, we know that if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars should increase with distance cubed, but since we are limited by flux, etc., but here we are assuming uniform distribution without considering brightness. Wait, but the question is purely about spatial distribution. 

Wait, but in reality, the number of stars you observe up to a certain distance depends on the volume, which is r³. But here, we are considering differential number per unit parallax. 

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let's think again. 

If the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr is dN = n * 4πr² dr. 

But we want to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/r (in arcseconds when r is in parsecs), then r = 1/plx, and dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). 

Therefore, substituting into dN: 

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)² * |dr| = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx). 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is dN/d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴. 

So, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

But this seems to indicate that as parallax decreases (i.e., as we look at more distant stars), the number of stars per unit parallax increases rapidly. However, this seems counterintuitive because the volume at larger distances (smaller plx) is larger, but the number density is constant. Wait, but the problem is that a unit interval in parallax corresponds to a larger physical volume when plx is smaller. 

For example, consider two different parallax ranges: 

1. From plx = 1 to plx = 0.5 (distance from 1 pc to 2 pc). The volume is 4π*(2³ -1³)/3 = 4π*(8 -1)/3 = 28π/3 ≈ 29.32 pc³. 

2. From plx = 0.5 to plx = 0.25 (distance from 2 pc to 4 pc). The volume is 4π*(4³ -2³)/3 = 4π*(64 -8)/3 = 4π*56/3 ≈ 234.57 pc³. 

So, each halving of parallax (from 1 to 0.5, then 0.5 to 0.25) corresponds to increasing the volume by a factor of 8 (since (4³ -2³)/(2³ -1³) = (56)/7 = 8). But the parallax interval in the first case is 0.5, and in the second case is 0.25. Wait, no, the parallax intervals here are 0.5 and 0.25, but the actual intervals in parallax are different. Wait, maybe I need to compute the number of stars per unit parallax. 

In the first interval, from plx=1 to plx=0.5, delta_plx=0.5. The number of stars is proportional to 4πn / plx⁴ * delta_plx. But plx varies from 1 to 0.5, so the integral would be ∫ from 0.5 to 1 of 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx) = 4πn [ (1/(-3)) plx^(-3) ] from 0.5 to 1 = (4πn/3)(1 - 8) = -28πn/3. Taking absolute, 28πn/3. 

Similarly, for plx from 0.5 to 0.25, delta_plx=0.25. The integral is ∫ from 0.25 to 0.5 of 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx) = 4πn/3 [ (1/(0.25)^3 - 1/(0.5)^3 ) ] = 4πn/3 (64 - 8) = 4πn/3 *56 = 224πn/3 ≈ 74.67πn. 

But the delta_plx here is 0.25, so the number per unit parallax in that region would be approximately 224πn/3 /0.25 = 896πn/3 ≈ 298.67πn. 

Whereas in the first interval, delta_plx=0.5, so number per unit parallax is 28πn/3 /0.5 ≈ 18.67πn. 

Wait, so even though the volume is larger for the smaller plx interval, the number per unit parallax is actually higher? But according to the formula, the number per unit parallax is 4πn / plx⁴. So at plx=1, it's 4πn, at plx=0.5, it's 4πn / (0.5)^4 = 4πn /0.0625=64πn, and at plx=0.25, it's 4πn / (0.25)^4=4πn /0.00390625≈1024πn. 

So, yes, the number per unit parallax increases rapidly as plx decreases. 

But this seems to suggest that there are more stars per unit parallax at smaller plx (larger distances). However, in reality, when we observe stars, we see fewer stars at larger distances because they are fainter, but this question assumes uniform distribution without considering observational limitations. So, in this idealized scenario, even though the volume at larger distances is bigger, the way parallax relates to distance causes the number per unit parallax to increase as plx decreases. 

But let's think again. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars at a distance between r and r+dr is proportional to r² dr. When we change variables to plx=1/r, then r=1/plx, dr= -1/plx² d(plx). So, substituting, the number becomes proportional to (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax, i.e., N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, let me check units. Parallax is in arcseconds, distance in parsecs. The number per unit parallax (per arcsecond) would have units of stars per arcsecond. The relation plx = 1/d (parsecs). So, if we have N(plx) d(plx) = number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx). 

But according to the calculation, N(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴. So, yes, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to plx⁴. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx^(-4), so it increases as plx decreases. 

But this seems to contradict the intuition that there are more stars at larger distances (smaller plx) but since the volume is larger, but the number per unit parallax depends on how the volume element translates into parallax. Since a small plx corresponds to a large distance, and a unit change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance when plx is small. 

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose we have plx1 = 0.1 arcsec (10 pc) and plx2 = 0.2 arcsec (5 pc). The distance between plx1 and plx1 + delta_plx is from 10 pc to 1/(0.1 + delta_plx). If delta_plx = 0.01 arcsec, then the new distance is 1/0.11 ≈ 9.09 pc, so delta_r = 0.91 pc. 

For plx = 0.01 arcsec (100 pc), delta_plx = 0.01 arcsec would give a new distance of 1/0.02 = 50 pc, so delta_r = 50 pc. 

So, the same delta_plx of 0.01 arcsec corresponds to a delta_r of 0.91 pc at plx=0.1, and 50 pc at plx=0.01. Therefore, the volume element for delta_plx=0.01 is much larger at smaller plx (larger distance). Hence, the number of stars in that delta_plx is proportional to the volume element, which is 4πr² delta_r. 

At plx=0.1, r=10 pc, delta_r=0.91 pc, volume ≈4π*(10)^2*0.91 ≈ 4π*100*0.91 ≈ 1140.4 pc³. 

At plx=0.01, r=100 pc, delta_r=50 pc, volume≈4π*(100)^2*50 ≈4π*10,000*50≈6,283,185 pc³. 

So, the volume (and hence number of stars) for the same delta_plx is much larger at smaller plx. Therefore, the number per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. 

Therefore, the formula N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴ is correct. 

But let me check with another approach. Suppose we have a distribution function. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space with density n, then the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx) is: 

N(plx) d(plx) = n * 4πr² dr. 

But since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). 

Therefore, 

N(plx) d(plx) = n * 4π (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴ d(plx). 

Thus, N(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴. 

Therefore, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. 

So, the answer is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx^(-4), meaning it increases as plx decreases. 

But wait, in reality, when we observe stars, the number of stars increases with distance cubed (volume), but since plx is inversely proportional to distance, this would translate to plx^(-3). But according to our calculation, it's plx^(-4). Where is the discrepancy? 

Ah, because when you have a uniform density in space, the number of stars in a shell dr is proportional to r² dr. But when you convert that to parallax, which is 1/r, the relation isn't linear. So, the Jacobian of the transformation from r to plx introduces an extra factor of 1/plx², leading to the total of 1/plx⁴. 

So, even though the volume increases with r² dr, the transformation to plx adds another factor from the derivative dr/d(plx), which is 1/plx². Therefore, the combination gives 1/plx⁴. 

Therefore, the correct relation is N(plx) ∝ plx^(-4). 

But let me check literature or standard results. For example, in astronomy, the luminosity function or the density distribution in terms of parallax. 

Wait, I recall that in the case of a uniform distribution, the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx) is indeed proportional to plx^(-4) d(plx). This is because the transformation from distance to parallax involves a Jacobian determinant that introduces the extra factors. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx to the minus fourth power. 

**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) in a uniformly distributed stellar population is determined by the relationship between parallax and distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\(d = 1/\text{plx}\)), the volume element in space transforms when expressed in terms of parallax. 

For a small parallax interval \(d(\text{plx})\), the corresponding distance interval \(dr\) is related by \(dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\). The volume element in spherical coordinates, \(4\pi r^2 dr\), becomes \(4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx})\). 

Assuming uniform stellar density, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to this volume element. Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). 

**Final Answer:**  
The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax, i.e., \(\boxed{\frac{dN}{d(\text{plx})} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}}\).

However, when you convert to parallax, which is 1/r, the relationship changes. So, for each interval in parallax, the corresponding interval in distance is not linear. So, the key is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to the derivative of the volume with respect to parallax.\n\nBut according to the calculation, that derivative is 4πn / plx⁴, which would mean that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. So, in other words, there are more stars at smaller parallaxes (larger distances) per unit parallax. But since the volume element at larger distances (small plx) is larger, but the parallax per unit distance is smaller. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if you have a fixed parallax interval, say from plx to plx + d(plx), this corresponds to a distance interval from 1/plx to 1/(plx + d(plx)). The width of this distance interval is approximately dr = -1/(plx + d(plx)) + 1/plx ≈ (d(plx))/plx². So, the volume element is 4πr² dr ≈ 4π (1/plx²) (d(plx)/plx²) = 4π d(plx)/plx⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d(plx)/plx⁴, so the number per unit parallax is n * 4π / plx⁴. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as parallax decreases (i.e., as we look at more distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases. However, this seems to conflict with the idea that the number of stars should increase with distance cubed (if the distribution were uniform in a Euclidean space), but here it's increasing as 1/plx⁴, which is equivalent to r⁴. Wait, but 1/plx is r, so 1/plx⁴ is r⁴. But the volume element is r² dr, which when converted to plx is r² dr = (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx) = 1/plx⁴ d(plx). So, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx⁴. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as parallax decreases. So, for example, if you have a small parallax (distant stars), the number of stars in each parallax bin is higher. But in reality, when we observe stars, we have more stars at smaller parallaxes (larger distances) but each parallax bin corresponds to a larger volume. Wait, but the volume per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have a parallax interval of 0.1 arcseconds. For a nearby star (plx = 1 arcsec, distance 1 pc), the corresponding distance interval is from 1 to 1/(1 - 0.1) ≈ 1.111 pc, so dr ≈ 0.111 pc. The volume is roughly 4πr² dr ≈ 4π*(1)^2*0.111 ≈ 1.396 pc³.\n\nFor a more distant star (plx = 0.1 arcsec, distance 10 pc), the same parallax interval of 0.1 arcsec corresponds to a distance interval from 10 pc to 10/(1 - 0.1*10) = 10/0.9 ≈ 11.11 pc. Wait, but hold on. If plx is 0.1, then a parallax interval of 0.1 would be from 0.1 to 0.2, which corresponds to distances from 10 pc to 5 pc. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no. If plx increases, the distance decreases. So, if you have a parallax interval from plx to plx + d(plx), the corresponding distance interval is from r = 1/plx to r' = 1/(plx + d(plx)). So, if plx is 0.1 and d(plx) is 0.1, then r goes from 10 pc to 1/(0.2) = 5 pc. So, the distance interval is from 10 pc to 5 pc, which is a dr of -5 pc. But since we take the absolute value, it's 5 pc. The volume here would be 4π*(10)^2*5 ≈ 4π*500 ≈ 6283 pc³. Compare that to the nearby star's volume of ~1.4 pc³. So, the volume (and hence number of stars) per unit parallax is much larger for smaller plx (more distant stars). Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases, which aligns with the 1/plx⁴ dependence.\n\nBut wait, in this example, the parallax interval is 0.1 arcsec. For the nearby star (plx=1), the interval is from 1 to 1.1, which is a distance from 1 pc to ~0.909 pc, dr ≈ -0.091 pc. The volume is 4π*(1)^2*0.091 ≈ 0.366 pc³. For the distant star (plx=0.1), the interval from 0.1 to 0.2 corresponds to distance from 10 pc to 5 pc, dr=5 pc, volume 4π*(10)^2*5 ≈ 6283 pc³. So, the volume (and hence number of stars) per unit parallax is indeed much larger for smaller plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases, which is a 1/plx⁴ relation.\n\nBut wait, in the first case, the parallax interval was 0.1, but for the nearby star, the actual distance interval is smaller (0.091 pc) compared to the distant star's 5 pc. So, even though the parallax interval is the same, the corresponding distance interval (and hence volume) is much larger for smaller plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. So, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4, i.e., N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4.\n\nBut let me check if this is a standard result. From what I recall, in astronomy, the differential number counts in parallax space are indeed proportional to plx^-4 for a uniform distribution of stars in space. This is because the Jacobian of the transformation from distance to parallax introduces the plx^-4 factor. So, yes, the number of stars per unit parallax interval should scale as plx^-4.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax. So, as parallax increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax drops off rapidly, and as parallax decreases (farther stars), the number per unit parallax increases. Hence, the relation is N ∝ plx^-4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \\( \\text{plx}^{-4} \\).

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs). For a uniform distribution of stars, the number density of stars in space is constant. 

The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \(4\pi d^2 \, dd\). Converting this to parallax space, we use the relationship \(d = 1/\text{plx}\). 

First, we express the differential volume element in terms of parallax. The distance element dd in terms of parallax is derived from the derivative of \(d = 1/\text{plx}\):

\[
dd = \left| \frac{d}{d(\text{plx})} \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \right) \right| d(\text{plx}) = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\) into the volume element:

\[
4\pi d^2 \, dd = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx})
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax interval \(d(\text{plx})\) is proportional to \(\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}\). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(\text{plx}^{-4}\).

\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

parallax interval d(plx) is proportional to the volume element, which is 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). Assuming uniform density (n stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) would be n * 4π / plx⁴.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check the substitution again. If we have dN/d(plx) = n * dV/d(plx). Since dV/d(plx) is 4πr² * |dr/d(plx)|. Since r = 1/plx, dr/d(plx) = -1/plx². Therefore, |dr/d(plx)| = 1/plx². Then, substituting r = 1/plx into 4πr² * (1/plx²) gives 4π*(1/plx²)*(1/plx²) = 4π/plx⁴. So yes, dN/d(plx) = n * 4π / plx⁴.

But this seems to suggest that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. However, I recall that in some contexts, the distribution might be different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's approach it step by step. The number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr is dN = n * 4πr² dr. We want to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx, and dr = -1/plx² d(plx). Therefore, substituting into dN:

dN = n * 4π*(1/plx)² * (1/plx²) |d(plx)| = n * 4π / plx⁴ d(plx). So, the number per unit parallax is dN/d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as parallax increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax decreases rapidly. Conversely, for smaller parallaxes (distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases. But wait, this seems counterintuitive. If stars are uniformly distributed, we expect more stars at larger distances (smaller parallaxes), but the formula suggests that the number per unit parallax increases as plx decreases. Let me confirm.

Suppose plx is small (distant stars). Then 1/plx⁴ is large, so dN/d(plx) is large. That would mean that for small plx (distant stars), there are more stars per unit parallax. Conversely, for large plx (nearby stars), there are fewer stars per unit parallax. But in reality, even though the volume increases with distance, the number of stars per unit parallax depends on how the volume element translates into parallax space.

Wait, but if you have a uniform distribution in space, the number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to r². However, when you convert to parallax, which is 1/r, the relationship changes. So, for each interval in parallax, the corresponding interval in distance is not linear.

Wait, but if you have a fixed parallax interval, say from plx to plx + d(plx), this corresponds to a distance interval from 1/plx to 1/(plx + d(plx)). The width of this distance interval is approximately dr = -1/(plx + d(plx)) + 1/plx ≈ (d(plx))/plx². So, the volume element is 4πr² dr ≈ 4π (1/plx²) (d(plx)/plx²) = 4π d(plx)/plx⁴. Therefore, the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d(plx)/plx⁴, so the number per unit parallax is n * 4π / plx⁴. So, yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So, as parallax decreases (i.e., as we look at more distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases.

For a more distant star (plx = 0.1 arcsec, distance 10 pc), the same parallax interval of 0.1 arcsec corresponds to a distance interval from 10 pc to 10/(1 - 0.1*10) = 10/0.9 ≈ 11.11 pc. Wait, but hold on. If plx is 0.1, then a parallax interval of 0.1 would be from 0.1 to 0.2, which corresponds to distances from 10 pc to 5 pc. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no. If plx increases, the distance decreases. So, if you have a parallax interval from plx to plx + d(plx), the corresponding distance interval is from r = 1/plx to r' = 1/(plx + d(plx)). So, if plx is 0.1 and d(plx) is 0.1, then r goes from 10 pc to 1/(0.2) = 5 pc. So, the distance interval is from 10 pc to 5 pc, which is a dr of -5 pc.

Hence, the relation is N ∝ plx^-4.

**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Thus, the relationship is \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.
