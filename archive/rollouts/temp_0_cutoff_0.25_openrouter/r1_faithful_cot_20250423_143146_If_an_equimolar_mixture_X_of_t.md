# Original Question

If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.
Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.

The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which decolorize bromine water. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Hydrocarbon Z Identification**:  
   - Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This matches cyclohexane’s molecular formula (C₆H₁₂), confirming Z’s identity.

2. **Mixture X Analysis**:  
   - X contains two unsaturated compounds (dec. bromine water). Hydrogenation of X yields Z, so both components must hydrogenate to cyclohexane.  
   - Possible candidates: **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexyne (C₆H₈)**.  
     - Cyclohexene (1 double bond) and cyclohexyne (1 triple bond) are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

3. **Disproportionation to Mixture Y**:  
   - Heating X with Pt causes cyclohexyne to lose H₂ (forming benzene, C₆H₆) and cyclohexene to gain H₂ (forming cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).  
   - Y is an equimolar mix of benzene and cyclohexane (both saturated, no bromine decolorization).

4. **Hydrogen Count in X**:  
   - Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀): **10 H atoms**.  
   - Cyclohexyne (C₆H₈): **8 H atoms**.  
   - **Total = 10 + 8 = 18 H atoms**.

**Answer:**  
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.  
$\boxed{18}$

Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

First, the problem states that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. That suggests that both components in mixture X are unsaturated compounds, like alkenes or alkynes, since they react with bromine. Then, when this mixture is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, mixture Y must be saturated, meaning they don't have double or triple bonds anymore. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z, which is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might give us a clue.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7 (since 14.28% is roughly 1/7). So, if the hydrocarbon Z has a formula C_nH_m, the mass of hydrogen is m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Solving this:

7m = 12n + m  
6m = 12n  
m = 2n

So the formula is C_nH_{2n}. That suggests it's a cycloalkane (since alkanes are C_nH_{2n+2}, so if it's 2n, it's missing two hydrogens, which would be a cycloalkane). For example, cyclohexane is C6H12, which is a common solvent. Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:

Hydrogen mass = 12*1 = 12  
Total mass = (6*12) + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84  
12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Perfect! So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

So Z is cyclohexane. Now, since hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, that means that X must have been a mixture of compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Since X decolorizes bromine water, they must be unsaturated. The possible candidates would be cyclohexene (which has one double bond) and another unsaturated compound. But wait, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. When heated with platinum, they undergo disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation reactions often involve transfer of hydrogen atoms. For example, in the case of alkenes, heating with a catalyst might lead to some molecules adding hydrogen (hydrogenation) and others losing hydrogen (dehydrogenation), but that might not exactly be disproportionation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but the problem doesn't mention any halogens.

Wait, but the problem says that mixture Y is formed by disproportionation. Disproportionation typically refers to a reaction where a substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of benzene derivatives, perhaps. Wait, but cyclohexane is a saturated hydrocarbon. If X is a mixture that when heated with Pt undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which includes cyclohexane (Z) and another compound. Wait, but hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Wait, no: hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So Y must already contain Z and another compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so the other component in Y must be something that can take up hydrogen. But if Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine, they are saturated. However, if hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is already saturated, then perhaps the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open up? Wait, but cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But if it's already saturated, how can it be hydrogenated further? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the other component in Y is benzene? But benzene would decolorize bromine under certain conditions, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, benzene doesn't react with bromine water under normal conditions because the reaction requires a catalyst. But bromine water is usually for addition reactions (like with alkenes), whereas benzene would undergo substitution, but not decolorize bromine water quickly. Hmm, but the problem says Y does not decolorize bromine water, so maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and something else saturated. But then hydrogenation of Y would not change cyclohexane, but the other component would need to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But if the other component is already saturated, how? Maybe it's a diene or something else. Wait, but Y is formed by disproportionation of X. Let's think about X first.

X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. Let's think cyclohexene and another unsaturated compound. But when heated with Pt, they disproportionate. Disproportionation of alkenes could lead to a smaller and a larger hydrocarbon. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could disproportionate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene? But cyclohexadiene would still have double bonds and decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not decolorizing. Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to hydrogen transfer. For example, one molecule loses hydrogen (becoming more unsaturated) and another gains hydrogen (becoming saturated). But if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, maybe they exchange hydrogen. Wait, but the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene, which upon disproportionation gives cyclohexane and another compound. But I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So the components of X can't have conjugated double bonds. So maybe they have isolated double bonds or a triple bond. Wait, but triple bonds also decolorize bromine water. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, but cyclohexyne is not very stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture of two different alkenes. Wait, but how would they disproportionate?

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. Wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y when hydrogenated give Z (cyclohexane). So X must be a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that when hydrogenated become cyclohexane. Similarly, Y is a mixture of two compounds that when hydrogenated also become cyclohexane. Since Y is formed by disproportionation of X, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, and when heated with Pt, they disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound. Let's suppose that X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound. When heated with Pt, maybe cyclohexene disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But cyclohexadiene would still have double bonds and decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not decolorizing. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to two different compounds. For example, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, say cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene, but that's getting complicated. Wait, but the problem says that Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. So the reaction must take two molecules from X and convert them into two molecules of Y. For example, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, maybe they undergo some kind of coupling or transfer. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's a [4+2] cycloaddition, which usually requires a diene and a dienophile. But the problem says there are no conjugated double bonds in X, so the diene would have conjugated bonds, which is not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation is a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no mention of halogens. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. For example, if X is cyclohexene and cyclohexane, but cyclohexane doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, but X must have both components decolorizing bromine. So both components must be unsaturated. So maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene, but the problem states no conjugated bonds. So they must have isolated double bonds. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But 1,4-cyclohexadiene is less common. Alternatively, maybe the components are cyclohexene and another monoene with a different structure. Wait, but how would they disproportionate?

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that can undergo disproportionation. Let's think about the structure of Z, which is cyclohexane. So when X is hydrogenated, both components become cyclohexane. That means each component in X must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, adds two hydrogen molecules (for a double bond) or more. For example, if X has cyclohexene (C6H10) which hydrogenates to C6H12 (cyclohexane), and another component, say, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (norbornene), which on hydrogenation would give norbornane. But norbornane isn't cyclohexane. So that's not right. Alternatively, maybe both components in X are isomers that hydrogenate to the same product. For example, maybe 1-methylcyclopentene and cyclohexene. But hydrogenation of 1-methylcyclopentene would give methylcyclopentane, which is different from cyclohexane. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, which is cyclohexane. So both components in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, and both components in Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Therefore, the components in X must be isomers that when hydrogenated become cyclohexane. The only way that can happen is if they are different dienes or alkynes that, when hydrogenated, add enough hydrogen to become cyclohexane. For example, if X contains cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene, but those would have conjugated double bonds (in the case of 1,3), which the problem says are not present. Wait, the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So the components of X must have isolated double bonds or triple bonds. So maybe they are cyclohexene (one double bond) and another compound with a triple bond, like cyclohexyne. But cyclohexyne is very unstable. Alternatively, maybe the components are two different mono-enes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But how can two different mono-enes hydrogenate to the same product? They would have to be isomers. For example, 1-cyclohexene and 2-cyclohexene (but those are the same due to ring structure). Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the double bond can be in different positions, but in a six-membered ring, the position doesn't matter because of ring puckering. So maybe they are not cyclohexene but something else. Wait, maybe the components are methylenecyclohexane (which is a cyclohexane with a methylene group, but that's still cyclohexene). Alternatively, maybe they are different bicyclic compounds that open up to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of benzene and another compound. Wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. The problem says X decolorizes bromine water, so benzene wouldn't qualify. So X must have compounds that rapidly react with bromine, like alkenes or alkynes.

Wait, another approach: since Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine, which when hydrogenated give Z. So Y must contain Z (cyclohexane) and another compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. But since Z is already saturated, the other compound must be something that can add hydrogen to become Z. The only way that's possible is if the other compound is a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open upon hydrogenation. For example, if Y contains cyclohexane and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane or something, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a cycloalkane with a bridge that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Wait, but hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen to double or triple bonds, not opens rings. Unless it's a highly strained ring that can undergo ring-opening hydrogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the other component in Y is methylcyclopentane, but hydrogenation of that wouldn't change it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another cycloalkane that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But how? If the other component is a cycloalkene, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. This is confusing.

Let me recap:

- X: equimolar mix of two unsaturated compounds (dec. bromine) → when heated with Pt, disproportionate to Y.

- Y: equimolar mix of two saturated compounds (don't dec. bromine) → when hydrogenated, both components become Z (cyclohexane).

- Z is a component of Y and is a solvent (cyclohexane).

So Y must contain Z (cyclohexane) and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But since Y's components are saturated, the other compound must be something that can add hydrogen even though it's saturated. That doesn't make sense unless it's a different structure, like a bicyclic compound that can open upon hydrogenation. For example, if the other component is decalin (decahydronaphthalene), but decalin is already saturated and hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Alternatively, maybe it's a strained cycloalkane like cyclopropane or cyclobutane, but those are gases, not liquids. Wait, but cyclohexane is a liquid, and maybe the other component is a smaller cycloalkane. But hydrogenation of cyclopropane would require breaking the ring, but hydrogenation typically doesn't do that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the other component in Y is a cyclohexane derivative with a substituent that can be removed upon hydrogenation. For example, if it's methylcyclohexane, but hydrogenation wouldn't remove the methyl group. This is tricky.

Wait, maybe the disproportionation reaction converts two molecules of an alkene into a molecule of an alkane and a molecule of a more unsaturated hydrocarbon. For example, if X is cyclohexene (C6H10), then disproportionation could yield cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But cyclohexadiene would still have double bonds and decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not doing so. Unless the cyclohexadiene is further hydrogenated, but Y is the product of disproportionation, not hydrogenation. So this seems problematic.

Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to the formation of benzene and cyclohexane. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, so Y would be a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation of benzene (which is in Y) would give cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains the same. So hydrogenation of Y (benzene + cyclohexane) would give only cyclohexane. That fits. Also, hydrogenation of X (which must be something that becomes cyclohexane) would also give cyclohexane. So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Wait, but if Y is benzene and cyclohexane, then X must be something that when heated with Pt disproportionates into benzene and cyclohexane. What reaction does that? Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, but that's a single compound. Wait, but X is a mixture of two compounds. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexane. But cyclohexane doesn't decolorize bromine, so X can't have cyclohexane. So X must be two unsaturated compounds. Let's think again.

If Y is benzene and cyclohexane, then hydrogenation of Y would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains. So Y is 1:1 benzene:cyclohexane. Then, X must be a mixture that when heated with Pt undergoes disproportionation to form benzene and cyclohexane. What reaction could that be? Maybe the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, but that's a single compound. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. But again, conjugated bonds are not allowed. Wait, the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So the components of X must have isolated double bonds or triple bonds.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes with isolated double bonds. For example, 1,2-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But 1,2-cyclohexadiene is very strained and unlikely. Alternatively, maybe one is a diene and the other is an alkyne. For example, cyclohexene and cyclohexyne. But cyclohexyne is not stable. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another monoene. Wait, but how would that disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane?

Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation is a coupling reaction. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could form benzene and cyclohexane. Let's check the stoichiometry:

2 C6H10 → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H14 (hexane?) But hexane is not cyclohexane. Wait, but cyclohexane is C6H12. So that doesn't balance. Let's see:

2 C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H14. The left side has 12 C and 20 H. The right side has 12 C and 6+14=20 H. So that balances. But cyclohexane is C6H12, not C6H14. So this would produce hexane (C6H14) and benzene. But hexane is a straight-chain alkane, which is a gas or a very light liquid. But the problem says Y is a mixture of two liquids. Hexane is a liquid, but cyclohexane is also a liquid. Wait, but in this case, the products would be benzene (liquid) and hexane (liquid). But hydrogenation of hexane would not change it, but the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). So this doesn't fit. Therefore, this can't be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:

3 C6H10 → C6H6 + 2 C6H12

But let's check: 3 C6H10 has 18 C and 30 H. The products would have 6 + 12*2 = 30 H. So 6 (benzene) + 24 (2 cyclohexane) = 30 H. That works. So 3 molecules of cyclohexene disproportionate into 1 benzene and 2 cyclohexane. But the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So this doesn't fit because the reaction would involve only one component. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that together disproportionate. For example, if X is cyclohexene and cyclohexane, but cyclohexane doesn't decolorize bromine. So that's not possible.

Wait, another angle: Z is cyclohexane, which is in Y. So Y has Z and another compound. When Y is hydrogenated, both components become Z. Therefore, the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to Z. The only way a saturated compound (since Y doesn't decolorize bromine) can hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane) is if it's a different isomer of cyclohexane. But cyclohexane is a single isomer. Wait, unless it's a bicyclic compound that can open upon hydrogenation. For example, norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) but hydrogenation wouldn't open that. Alternatively, maybe the other component is methylcyclopentane, but hydrogenation wouldn't change that. This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the other component in Y is benzene. Because benzene is unsaturated (but doesn't react with bromine water without a catalyst), and when hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. So Y is a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane and leave cyclohexane as is, resulting in only cyclohexane. That fits. Also, X must be a mixture that when treated with Pt gives benzene and cyclohexane. What could X be? If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene. For example, maybe cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). When heated with Pt, they disproportionate. But how? Maybe two molecules of cyclohexadiene could form benzene and cyclohexane. Let's see:

2 C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H10 (cyclohexene). But that doesn't give cyclohexane. Alternatively, 3 C6H8 → C6H6 + 2 C6H9. Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine, so X can't have benzene. So X must be two unsaturated compounds. Let's think again.

If Y is benzene and cyclohexane, then X must be something that can disproportionate into those. The reaction that forms benzene and cyclohexane from an unsaturated compound could be the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, but that's a single compound. Alternatively, maybe a Diels-Alder reaction, but that requires conjugated dienes.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes that can undergo some coupling or disproportionation. For example, if one is cyclohexene and the other is a linear alkene. But how would that form benzene and cyclohexane?

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene, but conjugated dienes are not allowed. The problem states no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So the components must have isolated double bonds or triple bonds.

Wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cycloalkene, say, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene). Hydrogenation of norbornene gives norbornane, which is not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two cyclohexenes with different substituents. But they would hydrogenate to the same cyclohexane. For example, if one is cyclohexene and the other is methylcyclohexene. But hydrogenation would give methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane, which are different. So that doesn't work.

Wait, the key is that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). So every component in X and Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Therefore, X must be a mixture of two different unsaturated compounds that each hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only way that's possible is if they are isomers. For example, two different cyclohexenes (but in a ring, the position of the double bond doesn't matter due to ring puckering), so they are the same compound. Therefore, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that isn't a cyclohexene but can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only other possibility is an alkyne. For example, cyclohexyne (C6H8) which on hydrogenation would become cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne is highly unstable. However, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), then hydrogenation of both would give cyclohexane. Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, they disproportionate into Y, which is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Because cyclohexyne could cyclize to benzene under certain conditions, and cyclohexene could hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Let's check:

If X is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), then heating with Pt might cause the cyclohexyne to trimerize to benzene (but that's not disproportionation). Alternatively, cyclohexyne could lose hydrogen to form benzene, and cyclohexene could gain hydrogen to form cyclohexane. That would be a disproportionation. For example:

C6H8 (cyclohexyne) → C6H6 (benzene) + H2  
C6H10 (cyclohexene) + H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane)

So overall, the cyclohexyne loses hydrogen (oxidized to benzene) and cyclohexene gains hydrogen (reduced to cyclohexane). That's a disproportionation reaction where one component is oxidized and the other is reduced. Since X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, the reaction would produce an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, which is Y. Then, hydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, leaving only cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and cyclohexyne) would convert both to cyclohexane. This fits all the conditions.

Now, checking the details:

- X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Both decolorize bromine water (alkene and alkyne react with bromine).

- When heated with Pt, cyclohexyne loses H2 to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains H2 to become cyclohexane. So Y is a 1:1 mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, and cyclohexane is saturated, so Y doesn't decolorize bromine.

- Hydrogenation of Y: benzene → cyclohexane, cyclohexane remains. So only cyclohexane is obtained.

- Hydrogenation of X: cyclohexene → cyclohexane, cyclohexyne → cyclohexane. So only cyclohexane is obtained.

- Z is cyclohexane, which is a component of Y and a common solvent.

- The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated), cyclohexyne has a triple bond (no conjugation), so that's okay.

Therefore, the components of X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). The number of hydrogen atoms in each:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 → 10 H atoms.

- Cyclohexyne: C6H8 → 8 H atoms.

Total H atoms in the two liquids: 10 + 8 = 18.

So the answer is 18.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

First, the problem states that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. That suggests that both components in mixture X are unsaturated compounds, like alkenes or alkynes, since they react with bromine. Then, when this mixture is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, mixture Y must be saturated, meaning they don't have double or triple bonds anymore. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z, which is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z first because that might give us a clue.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7 (since 14.28% is roughly 1/7). So, if the hydrocarbon Z has a formula C_nH_m, the mass of hydrogen is m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Solving this:

7m = 12n + m  
6m = 12n  
m = 2n

So the formula is C_nH_{2n}. That suggests it's a cycloalkane (since alkanes are C_nH_{2n+2}, so if it's 2n, it's missing two hydrogens, which would be a cycloalkane). For example, cyclohexane is C6H12, which is a common solvent. Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:

Hydrogen mass = 12*1 = 12  
Total mass = (6*12) + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84  
12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Perfect! So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

So Z is cyclohexane. Now, since hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, that means that X must have been a mixture of compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Since X decolorizes bromine water, they must be unsaturated. The possible candidates would be cyclohexene (which has one double bond) and another unsaturated compound. But wait, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. When heated with platinum, they undergo disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation reactions often involve transfer of hydrogen atoms. For example, in the case of alkenes, heating with a catalyst might lead to some molecules adding hydrogen (hydrogenation) and others losing hydrogen (dehydrogenation), but that might not exactly be disproportionation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but the problem doesn't mention any halogens.

Wait, but the problem says that mixture Y is formed by disproportionation. Disproportionation typically refers to a reaction where a substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of benzene derivatives, perhaps. Wait, but cyclohexane is a saturated hydrocarbon. If X is a mixture that when heated with Pt undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which includes cyclohexane (Z) and another compound. Wait, but hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Wait, no: hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So Y must already contain Z and another compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so the other component in Y must be something that can take up hydrogen. But if Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine, they are saturated. However, if hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is already saturated, then perhaps the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open up? Wait, but cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But if it's already saturated, how can it be hydrogenated further? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the other component in Y is benzene? But benzene would decolorize bromine under certain conditions, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, benzene doesn't react with bromine water under normal conditions because the reaction requires a catalyst. But bromine water is usually for addition reactions (like with alkenes), whereas benzene would undergo substitution, but not decolorize bromine water quickly. Hmm, but the problem says Y does not decolorize bromine water, so maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and something else saturated. But then hydrogenation of Y would not change cyclohexane, but the other component would need to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But if the other component is already saturated, how? Maybe it's a diene or something else. Wait, but Y is formed by disproportionation of X. Let's think about X first.

X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. Let's think cyclohexene and another unsaturated compound. But when heated with Pt, they disproportionate. Disproportionation of alkenes could lead to a smaller and a larger hydrocarbon. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could disproportionate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene? But cyclohexadiene would still have double bonds and decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not decolorizing. Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to hydrogen transfer. For example, one molecule loses hydrogen (becoming more unsaturated) and another gains hydrogen (becoming saturated). But if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, maybe they exchange hydrogen. Wait, but the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene, which upon disproportionation gives cyclohexane and another compound. But I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So the components of X can't have conjugated double bonds. So maybe they have isolated double bonds or a triple bond. Wait, but triple bonds also decolorize bromine water. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, but cyclohexyne is not very stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture of two different alkenes. Wait, but how would they disproportionate?

Let me break down this problem systematically. We're dealing with an equimolar mixture X containing two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating they're unsaturated compounds. When mixture X is treated with heated platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y—another equimolar mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water, suggesting they're saturated compounds without double or triple bonds.

When both mixtures X and Y undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions, they yield only one hydrocarbon Z, which is a component of mixture Y and functions as a solvent. Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, confirming it's fully saturated. The hydrogen mass fraction in Z is 14.28%, approximately 1/7.

To determine Z's formula, I'll use the mass fraction: if Z has formula CₙHₘ, then m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Solving this equation:
7m = 12n + m
6m = 12n
m = 2n

This gives us formula CₙH₂ₙ, indicating a cycloalkane structure. For cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂):
Hydrogen mass = 12×1 = 12
Total mass = (6×12) + 12 = 84
Hydrogen fraction = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%

Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).

Since hydrogenation of both X and Y yields Z, mixture X must contain unsaturated compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Mixture Y must include cyclohexane (Z) and another saturated compound that can also be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.

The disproportionation reaction suggests that heating X with platinum causes some molecules to gain hydrogen while others lose hydrogen. This creates mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water because both components lack double bonds.

The problem statement notes that molecules in X don't have conjugated multiple bonds, ruling out compounds like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Perhaps X contains cyclohexene and another non-conjugated unsaturated compound that, through disproportionation, forms cyclohexane and another saturated compound.

Let's approach this problem methodically. It's a bit complex, but I'll simplify it step by step.

Firstly, the problem specifies that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. This indicates that both components of mixture X are unsaturated compounds, such as alkenes or alkynes, as they react with bromine. When this mixture is heated with platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. Therefore, mixture Y must be saturated, meaning it no longer contains double or triple bonds.

When both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they produce only one hydrocarbon Z, which is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. Moreover, Z does not further react with hydrogen, indicating that it is fully saturated. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, approximately 14.28%. To find clues, let's compute the molecular formula of Z.

A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% corresponds to 1/7. Hence, if the hydrocarbon Z has the formula C_nH_m, the mass of hydrogen is m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Solving:

7m = 12n + m  
6m = 12n  
m = 2n

Thus, the formula is C_nH_{2n}, suggesting a cycloalkane (since alkanes are C_nH_{2n+2}, a cycloalkane lacks two hydrogens). For instance, cyclohexane is C6H12, a common solvent. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:

Hydrogen mass = 12 * 1 = 12  
Total mass = (6 * 12) + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84  
12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Perfect! Therefore, Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

So, Z is cyclohexane. Since hydrogenating both X and Y yields Z, it means X comprises compounds capable of being hydrogenated to form cyclohexane. Since X decolorizes bromine water, these must be unsaturated. Potential candidates include cyclohexene (having one double bond) and another unsaturated compound. But wait, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Upon heating with platinum, they disproportionate to form Y, an equimolar mixture of two liquids not reacting with bromine water. Disproportionation commonly involves hydrogen transfer. For instance, with alkenes, heating with a catalyst might cause some molecules to add hydrogen (hydrogenation) and others to lose hydrogen (dehydrogenation). However, that might not exactly be disproportionation. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, though the problem doesn't mention halogens.

But the problem states that mixture Y results from disproportionation. Disproportionation typically involves simultaneous oxidation and reduction. For example, in benzene derivatives. Wait, but if Y contains cyclohexane and another compound hydrogenates to cyclohexane, then the other component must be a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open up. But cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring. Alternatively, Y could contain cyclohexane and another saturated compound convertible to cyclohexane through hydrogenation. But how can it be hydrogenated further if it's already saturated? This doesn't add up. Maybe it's benzene. However, benzene would decolorize bromine under certain conditions, and the problem states Y does not decolorize bromine water. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water without a catalyst because bromine water typically targets addition reactions (like alkenes), whereas benzene undergoes substitution, not quickly decolorizing bromine water. Since the problem states Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y could be a mix of cyclohexane and something else saturated. Yet, hydrogenating Y wouldn't alter cyclohexane, implying the other component must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But if it's already saturated, how? Maybe it's a diene or similar. Wait, but Y forms via X disproportionation. Let's reconsider X.

X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. Consider cyclohexene and another unsaturated compound. When heated with platinum, they could disproportionate. Disproportionating alkenes might yield smaller and larger hydrocarbons. For example, two cyclohexene molecules might disproportionate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene? However, cyclohexadiene retains double bonds, which decolorizes bromine, conflicting with Y being non-reactive with bromine. Alternatively, disproportionation could imply hydrogen transfer. One molecule gains hydrogen (saturating) and another loses hydrogen (becoming unsaturated). Assuming X is a mix of different alkenes, perhaps they exchange hydrogen. But X is evidently an equimolar mix of two liquids, and Y is an equimolar mix of two distinct liquids. Thus, X might comprise cyclohexene and another alkene, disproportionating into cyclohexane and another compound. More thought is needed.

Perhaps X is a combination of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. However, the problem notes that there are no conjugated multiple bonds within X. So X can't have conjugated double bonds. The components might instead possess isolated double bonds or a triple bond. Yet, triple bonds also decolorize bromine water. Conceivably, X is a mixture like cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, though cyclohexyne is unstable. Alternatively, maybe it's a mix of different alkenes. But how would these undergo disproportionation?

So maybe X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes, like cyclohexene and cyclopentene. But when heated with Pt, they disproportionate. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: since hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z (cyclohexane), that means that all components in X and Y must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. So X must be a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that when hydrogenated become cyclohexane. So each component in X must have the same number of carbons as cyclohexane but with fewer hydrogens. For cyclohexane, C6H12. If X components are alkenes, they would be C6H10 (cyclohexene) or C6H8 (cyclohexadiene), but since there are no conjugated double bonds, maybe two isolated double bonds? Wait, but if they have isolated double bonds, then hydrogenation would add two H2 per double bond. But if X is a mixture of two different dienes, each with two isolated double bonds, then hydrogenation would add four H2, turning C6H8 into C6H16? Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. So if a compound in X is C6H10 (one double bond), hydrogenation would add two H2 to get C6H14, which is hexane, not cyclohexane. Wait, that\'s a problem. So maybe the components are cyclic. For example, cyclohexene (C6H10) would hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12). But if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, like maybe cyclopentene (C5H8), but hydrogenation of cyclopentene would give cyclopentane (C5H10), which is not cyclohexane. So that doesn\'t fit. Therefore, both components in X must be cyclohexene derivatives. Wait, but if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and something else, but the problem states no conjugated bonds. So maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated), but that\'s less common. Alternatively, maybe the components are bicyclic compounds. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let\'s think about the disproportionation reaction. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, and when heated with Pt, they disproportionate into Y, which is a mixture of cyclohexane and another compound. Since Y is equimolar, maybe for every mole of cyclohexene that gets hydrogenated to cyclohexane, another mole gets dehydrogenated to cyclohexadiene. But then cyclohexadiene would still decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not doing so. Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to breaking the ring. For example, cyclohexene could disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. But benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, so Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Then hydrogenation of Y would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane (since benzene hydrogenation under severe conditions would give cyclohexane), and cyclohexane remains the same. So hydrogenation of Y would give only cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and benzene) would hydrogenate cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene to cyclohexane, so Z is cyclohexane. But wait, the problem states that X is a mixture that decolorizes bromine. If X is cyclohexene and benzene, benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine, so that\'s a problem. Therefore, both components of X must decolorize bromine. So cyclohexene and another alkene. But then, how does disproportionation lead to Y?\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne. Cyclohexyne is a very strained molecule and might not be stable, but let\'s consider it. Hydrogenation of cyclohexyne (C6H8) would add two H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexene (C6H10) would add one H2 to become cyclohexane. So if X is a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. Then, when heated with Pt, they undergo disproportionation. What would that look like? Maybe cyclohexene and cyclohexyne reacting to form cyclohexane and something else. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene donates hydrogen to the cyclohexyne. For example, one molecule loses hydrogen (cyclohexene becomes cyclohexyne) and another gains hydrogen (cyclohexyne becomes cyclohexane). But that would require a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the problem says that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. If X is equimolar cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, and they disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound, maybe cyclohexane and another molecule. But I\'m not sure. This is getting too vague.\n\nWait, another angle: Z is cyclohexane. Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. So the other compound in Y must be something that can take up hydrogen to become cyclohexane. If Y\'s components are saturated (don\'t decolorize bromine), then the other compound must be something like a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open upon hydrogenation. Wait, but cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring. If the other compound is, say, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, but hydrogenation wouldn\'t open that. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a bridged cycloalkane. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. But hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane would not change it, as it\'s already saturated. So that doesn\'t help. Alternatively, maybe the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with a different structure that can isomerize under hydrogenation. But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component in Y is benzene. Wait, but benzene is unsaturated (aromatic) but doesn\'t decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. If Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, then hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane (under severe conditions), and cyclohexane remains. So Z would be cyclohexane. But then, X must be a mixture that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane and also when disproportionated gives Y (cyclohexane and benzene). But X must decolorize bromine, so X would have to be a mixture of something that reacts with bromine. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene, but benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine, so that\'s no good. Alternatively, X is a mixture of cyclohexadiene and benzene. But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine, and benzene wouldn\'t. So X would have one component that decolorizes and one that doesn\'t, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nWait, going back to the disproportionation. If X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon heating with Pt undergo disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of an alkane and another compound. For example, if we have two molecules of an alkene, one gets hydrogenated to an alkane, and the other gets dehydrogenated to a diene. But the problem states that Y doesn\'t decolorize bromine, so the diene would still react with bromine. Therefore, that can\'t be. Alternatively, maybe the dehydrogenation leads to an aromatic compound, which doesn\'t react with bromine water. For example, if X is cyclohexene, heating with Pt could dehydrogenate it to benzene and hydrogenate another molecule to cyclohexane. But cyclohexene alone would disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane. But then X would be just cyclohexene, not a mixture. However, the problem says X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that together disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Then, heating with Pt could transfer hydrogen from the diene to the monoene, forming cyclohexane and benzene. But the diene would have conjugated double bonds, which the problem says are not present in X. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So that\'s not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-enes, like cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. But I don\'t see how that would disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound. This is getting too convoluted. Let\'s try to think of known reactions where alkenes disproportionate.\n\nOne example is the disproportionation of alkenes via the Heck reaction or other catalytic processes, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, the disproportionation of propene into propane and 1,5-hexadiene, but that\'s specific to certain catalysts. Alternatively, considering the reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction, but that\'s not really disproportionation.\n\nWait, another thought: if X is a mixture of cis and trans isomers of an alkene. But they would both decolorize bromine, and heating with Pt might cause them to isomerize, but that\'s not disproportionation. Disproportionation requires a transfer of atoms, leading to different oxidation states.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that when X (which has two different alkenes) is hydrogenated, it becomes Z (cyclohexane). So each component of X must have the same number of carbons as Z. Therefore, both components of X are C6H10 (cyclohexene) and C6H8 (cyclohexadiene), but without conjugated bonds. If cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, like 1,4-cyclohexadiene, then it\'s non-conjugated. So X is a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Then, when heated with Pt, they disproportionate. How?\n\nMaybe cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8) react to form cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexatriene (C6H6), which is benzene. But benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water, so Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Then hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane, giving only Z. Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene) would add H2 to both to form cyclohexane. This seems plausible. But does this fit the problem\'s conditions?\n\nLet\'s check:\n\n- X is equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize bromine (since they have double bonds), and there are no conjugated bonds (if the diene is non-conjugated). \n\n- When heated with Pt, they disproportionate. The reaction could be:\n\nC6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\nThis is a 1:1 reaction, so Y would be an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water, so Y doesn\'t either. \n\nHydrogenation of X (C6H10 and C6H8) would add H2 to both:\n\nC6H10 + H2 → C6H12\n\nC6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12\n\nSo total hydrogenation gives only C6H12 (Z).\n\nHydrogenation of Y (C6H12 and C6H6):\n\nC6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12\n\nC6H12 remains the same. So under severe conditions, both components would become C6H12. Hence, Z is cyclohexane.\n\nThis fits all the conditions. Therefore, the components of X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). \n\nNow, the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. \n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms per molecule.\n\n1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms per molecule.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, the total number of hydrogen atoms per mole of each component would be 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms per two moles (since it\'s equimolar, 1 mole each). Wait, but the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". So for each molecule of the two components, how many H atoms in total?\n\nEach molecule of cyclohexene has 10 H, each of cyclohexadiene has 8 H. So per molecule pair, 10 + 8 = 18 H atoms. But the question might be asking for the sum of H atoms in each component\'s molecular formula. Since both are in mixture X, their molecular formulas are C6H10 and C6H8. The total H atoms would be 10 + 8 = 18. So the answer is 18.\n\nBut let me double-check. The problem says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". If they mean per mole of mixture X (which is equimolar), then per mole of X, there\'s 0.5 moles of each component. But the total H atoms would be 0.5*(10 + 8)*Avogadro\'s number. But the question is likely asking for the sum of hydrogen atoms in the molecular formulas of the two components. So 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444216, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3402, prompt_tokens=1614, total_tokens=5016, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Wait, going back to the disproportionation. If X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon heating with Pt undergo disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of an alkane and another compound. For example, if we have two molecules of an alkene, one gets hydrogenated to an alkane, and the other gets dehydrogenated to a diene. But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so the diene would still react with bromine. Therefore, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the dehydrogenation leads to an aromatic compound, which doesn't react with bromine water. For example, if X is cyclohexene, heating with Pt could dehydrogenate it to benzene and hydrogenate another molecule to cyclohexane. But cyclohexene alone would disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane. But then X would be just cyclohexene, not a mixture. However, the problem says X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that together disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Then, heating with Pt could transfer hydrogen from the diene to the monoene, forming cyclohexane and benzene. But the diene would have conjugated double bonds, which the problem says are not present in X. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-enes, like cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. But I don't see how that would disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound. This is getting too convoluted. Let's try to think of known reactions where alkenes disproportionate.

One example is the disproportionation of alkenes via the Heck reaction or other catalytic processes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the disproportionation of propene into propane and 1,5-hexadiene, but that's specific to certain catalysts. Alternatively, considering the reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not really disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of cis and trans isomers of an alkene. But they would both decolorize bromine, and heating with Pt might cause them to isomerize, but that's not disproportionation. Disproportionation requires a transfer of atoms, leading to different oxidation states.

Wait, maybe the key is that when X (which has two different alkenes) is hydrogenated, it becomes Z (cyclohexane). So each component of X must have the same number of carbons as Z. Therefore, both components of X are C6H10 (cyclohexene) and C6H8 (cyclohexadiene), but without conjugated bonds. If cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, like 1,4-cyclohexadiene, then it's non-conjugated. So X is a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Then, when heated with Pt, they disproportionate. How?

Maybe cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8) react to form cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexatriene (C6H6), which is benzene. But benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water, so Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Then hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane, giving only Z. Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene) would add H2 to both to form cyclohexane. This seems plausible. But does this fit the problem's conditions?

Let's check:

- X is equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize bromine (since they have double bonds), and there are no conjugated bonds (if the diene is non-conjugated). 

- When heated with Pt, they disproportionate. The reaction could be:

C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)

This is a 1:1 reaction, so Y would be an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water, so Y doesn't either. 

Hydrogenation of X (C6H10 and C6H8) would add H2 to both:

C6H10 + H2 → C6H12

C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12

So total hydrogenation gives only C6H12 (Z).

Hydrogenation of Y (C6H12 and C6H6):

C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12

C6H12 remains the same. So under severe conditions, both components would become C6H12. Hence, Z is cyclohexane.

This fits all the conditions. Therefore, the components of X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). 

Now, the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. 

Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms per molecule.

1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms per molecule.

Since the mixture is equimolar, the total number of hydrogen atoms per mole of each component would be 10 + 8 = 18 hydrogen atoms per two moles (since it's equimolar, 1 mole each). Wait, but the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". So for each molecule of the two components, how many H atoms in total?

Each molecule of cyclohexene has 10 H, each of cyclohexadiene has 8 H. So per molecule pair, 10 + 8 = 18 H atoms. But the question might be asking for the sum of H atoms in each component's molecular formula. Since both are in mixture X, their molecular formulas are C6H10 and C6H8. The total H atoms would be 10 + 8 = 18. So the answer is 18.

But let me double-check. The problem says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". If they mean per mole of mixture X (which is equimolar), then per mole of X, there's 0.5 moles of each component. But the total H atoms would be 0.5*(10 + 8)*Avogadro's number. But the question is likely asking for the sum of hydrogen atoms in the molecular formulas of the two components. So 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.

For example, two cyclohexene molecules could form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not reacting.

But the more dehydrogenated would be aromatic, which might not react with bromine under certain conditions. Wait, benzene does react with bromine in presence of Fe catalyst, but maybe in Y, the other component is benzene, which doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions? Wait, actually, benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Bromine water is a test for alkenes and alkynes. So if Y contains cyclohexane and benzene, then benzene wouldn't decolorize bromine water (since it requires a catalyst for substitution). So that could be possible.\n\nSo, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and another compound. Wait, but X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. If X is cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (but not conjugated), but the problem states that X's components don't have conjugated bonds. So cyclohexadiene (1,4) is non-conjugated. Then, when heated with Pt, they might disproportionate. For example:\n\nSuppose X is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). But then hydrogenation of X would give cyclohexane, but the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). But if X already contains cyclohexane, then hydrogenation of cyclohexene would add H2 to become cyclohexane. But the original X is equimolar, so maybe X is cyclohexene and another unsaturated compound. Wait, but if X is cyclohexene and benzene, but benzene is not a liquid (it's a liquid at room temp, actually). But benzene would not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Wait, but the problem states that X decolorizes bromine water. So components of X must have double or triple bonds. So benzene wouldn't decolorize bromine water, so X can't contain benzene. Therefore, X must have two unsaturated compounds.\n\nWait, but if X is cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, like maybe cyclopentene? But then hydrogenation would give cyclopentane and cyclohexane, which contradicts the problem stating that hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, both components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Therefore, they must both be C6H10 (cyclohexene) and another isomer. Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. If there's another isomer, like maybe 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but conjugated, which is prohibited). So maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). But then hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene would require two moles of H2 to become cyclohexane. However, when X is hydrogenated under severe conditions, both components would add H2 to become cyclohexane. So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. But the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture. Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to Y. Let's think about the disproportionation reaction. For example, if cyclohexene (C6H10) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But if X is already a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, then maybe the reaction is:\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8\n\nBut if X is equimolar in C6H10 and C6H8, then upon heating with Pt, maybe they redistribute. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.\n\nHydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z (cyclohexane). So Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The other compound in Y must be something that can take up hydrogen to become cyclohexane. If Y is equimolar, then it's cyclohexane and another compound. What compound can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane? Maybe cyclohexene (C6H10), but then Y would have cyclohexane and cyclohexene. But cyclohexene would decolorize bromine water, which contradicts Y not decolorizing. Therefore, the other component in Y must be a saturated compound. Wait, but if it's saturated, how can it hydrogenate further? Unless it's a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open under severe hydrogenation. But cyclohexane is already a stable six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a bicyclic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But this seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. But hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane wouldn't change it. Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds H2 to double bonds. If Y's components are saturated, they can't be hydrogenated further. But the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another unsaturated compound. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so the other component must not have double bonds. Contradiction. Therefore, this line of thought is flawed.\n\nWait, the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So Y must be a mixture where both components can be hydrogenated to Z. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so they are saturated. But if they are saturated, they can't be hydrogenated further. Therefore, this suggests that Y is already fully saturated, but hydrogenation under severe conditions might break rings? Wait, maybe Z is a straight-chain alkane. Wait, but the hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which fits cyclohexane. If Z were a straight-chain alkane like hexane (C6H14), the hydrogen mass fraction would be 14/86 ≈ 16.28%, which doesn't match. So Z is cyclohexane.\n\nBut if Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and something else that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. The only way that can happen is if the other component is cyclohexane itself. But then Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane, which isn't two different liquids. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the disproportionation reaction converts the components of X into cyclohexane and another compound. Since Y is equimolar, maybe each molecule of X's components disproportionates into one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of another compound. For example, if X is a mixture of two different dienes, each undergoing disproportionation to form cyclohexane and another molecule. But this is vague.\n\nWait, another angle: The problem states that Z is a constituent of Y. So Y contains Z (cyclohexane) and another compound. When Y is hydrogenated, both components become Z. Therefore, the other component in Y must be something that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, the other component must be a saturated compound. The only way a saturated compound can hydrogenate to cyclohexane is if it's a smaller ring that can open and hydrogenate. For example, if the other component is a bicyclic compound like norbornane, but hydrogenation wouldn't open that. Alternatively, maybe it's a cycloalkane with a bridge that can break under severe hydrogenation. This seems too speculative.\n\nWait, maybe the other component in Y is benzene. Wait, benzene is unsaturated (aromatic) but doesn't decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. If Y contains cyclohexane and benzene, then hydrogenation of benzene (under severe conditions) would produce cyclohexane. So Y is cyclohexane and benzene. Then, hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z). This fits because Z is a component of Y (cyclohexane) and benzene hydrogenates to Z. Also, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water because cyclohexane is saturated and benzene doesn't react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n\nIf this is the case, then mixture Y is cyclohexane and benzene. Then, mixture X, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes disproportionation to form Y. So X must be a mixture that can disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. What reaction produces cyclohexane and benzene from unsaturated compounds? Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene and hydrogen, but that's not disproportionation. Disproportionation typically involves a species being both oxidized and reduced.\n\nWait, if X is cyclohexene (C6H10), then disproportionation could involve some molecules adding hydrogen (to become cyclohexane) and others losing hydrogen (to become benzene). The reaction would be:\n\n3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6\n\nBut this would require a 3:1 ratio, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture. Alternatively, maybe:\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8\n\nBut C6H8 would be cyclohexadiene, which would decolorize bromine water, contradicting Y's properties. Therefore, this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. Suppose X is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Then, hydrogenation of both would give cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne is highly unstable. Also, the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds, which might not apply here. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated, which is prohibited) and another compound. The problem states no conjugated bonds, so that's out.\n\nWait, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-enes that can disproportionate. For example, if X is a mixture of two cyclohexene isomers. But their disproportionation would still produce similar products. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the industrial process. Platinum-catalyzed disproportionation of alkenes. For example, propene can disproportionate to propane and propadiene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reverse of this: maybe cyclohexane and benzene are formed from cyclohexene via disproportionation. Let's check the hydrogen count.\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 H. If it disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12, +2 H) and benzene (C6H6, -4 H), the hydrogen balance would need to be maintained. For every three molecules of cyclohexene, one becomes cyclohexane (gains 2 H) and two become benzene (each loses 4 H, total -8 H). But 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6. Check H: 3*10 = 30; 12 + 2*6 = 24. So deficit of 6 H. Not balanced. Therefore, this reaction isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe with different stoichiometry. Suppose 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8. Then H: 2*10=20 → 12 +8=20. Balanced. C6H8 is cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine water, so Y would have cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other product is something else. If X is cyclohexene and another compound, say, a cycloalkane. But then hydrogenation of X would give cyclohexane and the same cycloalkane, which contradicts the problem stating only Z is formed. Therefore, X must consist of two unsaturated compounds that both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, both components of X must be C6H10 (cyclohexene) and another isomer. But how can there be another isomer of C6H10 that's not conjugated? Maybe a different position of the double bond, but all cyclohexene isomers are conjugated in the ring. Wait, no. In a six-membered ring, a double bond can be in different positions but not necessarily conjugated. For example, 1,2-cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexene. But in reality, cyclohexene typically refers to 1,2-cyclohexene. However, the problem states no conjugated bonds. Wait, conjugated bonds would be alternating double bonds. A single double bond in a ring isn't conjugated. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another monoene, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe one is a cycloalkene and the other is an alkyne. For example, cyclohexene and cyclohexyne. But cyclohexyne is very unstable. Alternatively, maybe a diene and a monoene. But the problem states no conjugated bonds, so the diene would have isolated double bonds. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, hydrogenation of both would require adding H2: C6H8 + 2 H2 → C6H12 and C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. Therefore, under severe hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. Then, X is an equimolar mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. When heated with Pt, they disproportionate. What would that look like? Maybe each component undergoes disproportionation. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene could disproportionate into cyclohexene and cyclohexane:\n\nC6H8 → C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H6 (benzene). But benzene would decolorize bromine with a catalyst, but Y doesn't decolorize. Alternatively, maybe:\n\n2 C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H10. But again, benzene is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that upon disproportionation gives cyclohexane and benzene. But then Y would have cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane, so Z is cyclohexane. This fits. But does the initial step make sense?\n\nIf X is cyclohexene (C6H10), then heating with Pt could cause some molecules to add H2 (to become cyclohexane, C6H12) and others to lose H2 (to become benzene, C6H6). The reaction would be:\n\n3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6\n\nBut this requires 3 moles of cyclohexene to produce 1 mole cyclohexane and 2 moles benzene. However, the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So if X is pure cyclohexene, Y would have a 1:2 ratio, which isn't equimolar. Therefore, X must be a mixture of two compounds that each disproportionate to give one part of Y's components.\n\nSuppose X is a 1:1 mixture of two different compounds, A and B. When heated with Pt, each A and B disproportionate into one part cyclohexane and one part benzene. Then Y would be equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. But how?\n\nAlternatively, each molecule of A and B in X converts to one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene. But that would require A and B to be the same. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture where each component disproportionates independently. For example, component A of X disproportionates into cyclohexane and something else, and component B also disproportionates into cyclohexane and something else. But then Y would have more than two components. The problem states Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Therefore, the two components of X must each disproportionate to give one of the two components of Y. For example, component A of X becomes cyclohexane, and component B becomes benzene. Then Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. But then, what are A and B?\n\nIf component A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which can hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), and component B is something that can dehydrogenate to benzene (C6H6). But what would component B be? If B is cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then dehydrogenation could produce benzene. So X is a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). When heated with Pt, cyclohexene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, and cyclohexadiene dehydrogenates to benzene. But how does the hydrogen balance work? The hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexadiene (C6H8 → C6H6 + H2) could provide the hydrogen needed for cyclohexene (C6H10 + H2 → C6H12). So the overall reaction would be:\n\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\nThis balances the carbons. For hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right. So it balances. Therefore, X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, which upon heating with Pt, disproportionate into equimolar cyclohexane and benzene (Y). Then, hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) under severe conditions converts benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only Z (cyclohexane). This fits all the conditions.\n\nNow, check if X's components decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene both have double bonds, so they would decolorize bromine water, which matches the problem statement. Also, the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. Cyclohexene has one double bond, and cyclohexadiene (if 1,4) has isolated double bonds, so no conjugation. Therefore, this fits.\n\nTherefore, mixture X is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The number of hydrogen atoms in each are 10 and 8. The total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of X is 10 + 8 = 18. But the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since it's an equimolar mixture, but the question just wants the sum of H atoms per molecule of each component. So 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444378, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4731, prompt_tokens=610, total_tokens=5341, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

However, since Y is equimolar and X is equimolar, the reaction must balance.

Considering the disproportionation of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) with platinum as a catalyst, it might undergo dehydrogenation to benzene (C₆H₆) and hydrogenation to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). However, benzene would decolorize bromine water via electrophilic substitution, but the problem states Y doesn't. Therefore, this path is invalid.

Alternative approach: If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another diene (but not conjugated), perhaps 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Disproportionation could lead to cyclohexane and another compound. However, the problem states X doesn't have conjugated bonds, so 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. But upon heating with Pt, maybe it disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene. But benzene would still react with bromine under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the diene becomes a monoene and a triene? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and another cycloalkene, but when heated with Pt, they undergo disproportionation. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not reacting. Alternatively, maybe the other product is a fully hydrogenated compound and a more dehydrogenated one. But the more dehydrogenated would be aromatic, which might not react with bromine under certain conditions. Wait, benzene does react with bromine in presence of Fe catalyst, but maybe in Y, the other component is benzene, which doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions? Wait, actually, benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Bromine water is a test for alkenes and alkynes. So if Y contains cyclohexane and benzene, then benzene wouldn't decolorize bromine water (since it requires a catalyst for substitution). So that could be possible.

So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and another compound. Wait, but X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. If X is cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (but not conjugated), but the problem states that X's components don't have conjugated bonds. So cyclohexadiene (1,4) is non-conjugated. Then, when heated with Pt, they might disproportionate. For example:

Suppose X is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). But then hydrogenation of X would give cyclohexane, but the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). But if X already contains cyclohexane, then hydrogenation of cyclohexene would add H2 to become cyclohexane. But the original X is equimolar, so maybe X is cyclohexene and another unsaturated compound. Wait, but if X is cyclohexene and benzene, but benzene is not a liquid (it's a liquid at room temp, actually). But benzene would not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Wait, but the problem states that X decolorizes bromine water. So components of X must have double or triple bonds. So benzene wouldn't decolorize bromine water, so X can't contain benzene. Therefore, X must have two unsaturated compounds.

Wait, but if X is cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, like maybe cyclopentene? But then hydrogenation would give cyclopentane and cyclohexane, which contradicts the problem stating that hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, both components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Therefore, they must both be C6H10 (cyclohexene) and another isomer. Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. If there's another isomer, like maybe 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but conjugated, which is prohibited). So maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). But then hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene would require two moles of H2 to become cyclohexane. However, when X is hydrogenated under severe conditions, both components would add H2 to become cyclohexane. So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. But the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture. Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to Y. Let's think about the disproportionation reaction. For example, if cyclohexene (C6H10) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But if X is already a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, then maybe the reaction is:

2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8

But if X is equimolar in C6H10 and C6H8, then upon heating with Pt, maybe they redistribute. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z (cyclohexane). So Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The other compound in Y must be something that can take up hydrogen to become cyclohexane. If Y is equimolar, then it's cyclohexane and another compound. What compound can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane? Maybe cyclohexene (C6H10), but then Y would have cyclohexane and cyclohexene. But cyclohexene would decolorize bromine water, which contradicts Y not decolorizing. Therefore, the other component in Y must be a saturated compound. Wait, but if it's saturated, how can it hydrogenate further? Unless it's a cycloalkane with a smaller ring that can open under severe hydrogenation. But cyclohexane is already a stable six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a bicyclic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But this seems less likely.

Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. But hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane wouldn't change it. Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds H2 to double bonds. If Y's components are saturated, they can't be hydrogenated further. But the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another unsaturated compound. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so the other component must not have double bonds. Contradiction. Therefore, this line of thought is flawed.

Wait, the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So Y must be a mixture where both components can be hydrogenated to Z. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so they are saturated. But if they are saturated, they can't be hydrogenated further. Therefore, this suggests that Y is already fully saturated, but hydrogenation under severe conditions might break rings? Wait, maybe Z is a straight-chain alkane. Wait, but the hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which fits cyclohexane. If Z were a straight-chain alkane like hexane (C6H14), the hydrogen mass fraction would be 14/86 ≈ 16.28%, which doesn't match. So Z is cyclohexane.

But if Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and something else that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. The only way that can happen is if the other component is cyclohexane itself. But then Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane, which isn't two different liquids. Therefore, this is impossible.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the disproportionation reaction converts the components of X into cyclohexane and another compound. Since Y is equimolar, maybe each molecule of X's components disproportionates into one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of another compound. For example, if X is a mixture of two different dienes, each undergoing disproportionation to form cyclohexane and another molecule. But this is vague.

Wait, another angle: The problem states that Z is a constituent of Y. So Y contains Z (cyclohexane) and another compound. When Y is hydrogenated, both components become Z. Therefore, the other component in Y must be something that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, the other component must be a saturated compound. The only way a saturated compound can hydrogenate to cyclohexane is if it's a smaller ring that can open and hydrogenate. For example, if the other component is a bicyclic compound like norbornane, but hydrogenation wouldn't open that. Alternatively, maybe it's a cycloalkane with a bridge that can break under severe hydrogenation. This seems too speculative.

Wait, maybe the other component in Y is benzene. Wait, benzene is unsaturated (aromatic) but doesn't decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. If Y contains cyclohexane and benzene, then hydrogenation of benzene (under severe conditions) would produce cyclohexane. So Y is cyclohexane and benzene. Then, hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane (Z). This fits because Z is a component of Y (cyclohexane) and benzene hydrogenates to Z. Also, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water because cyclohexane is saturated and benzene doesn't react with bromine water without a catalyst.

If this is the case, then mixture Y is cyclohexane and benzene. Then, mixture X, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes disproportionation to form Y. So X must be a mixture that can disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. What reaction produces cyclohexane and benzene from unsaturated compounds? Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene and hydrogen, but that's not disproportionation. Disproportionation typically involves a species being both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, if X is cyclohexene (C6H10), then disproportionation could involve some molecules adding hydrogen (to become cyclohexane) and others losing hydrogen (to become benzene). The reaction would be:

3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6

But this would require a 3:1 ratio, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture. Alternatively, maybe:

2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8

But C6H8 would be cyclohexadiene, which would decolorize bromine water, contradicting Y's properties. Therefore, this can't be.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. Suppose X is cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Then, hydrogenation of both would give cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne is highly unstable. Also, the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds, which might not apply here. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated, which is prohibited) and another compound. The problem states no conjugated bonds, so that's out.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different mono-enes that can disproportionate. For example, if X is a mixture of two cyclohexene isomers. But their disproportionation would still produce similar products. Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the industrial process. Platinum-catalyzed disproportionation of alkenes. For example, propene can disproportionate to propane and propadiene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reverse of this: maybe cyclohexane and benzene are formed from cyclohexene via disproportionation. Let's check the hydrogen count.

Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 H. If it disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12, +2 H) and benzene (C6H6, -4 H), the hydrogen balance would need to be maintained. For every three molecules of cyclohexene, one becomes cyclohexane (gains 2 H) and two become benzene (each loses 4 H, total -8 H). But 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6. Check H: 3*10 = 30; 12 + 2*6 = 24. So deficit of 6 H. Not balanced. Therefore, this reaction isn't possible.

Alternatively, maybe with different stoichiometry. Suppose 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8. Then H: 2*10=20 → 12 +8=20. Balanced. C6H8 is cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine water, so Y would have cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, this can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the other product is something else. If X is cyclohexene and another compound, say, a cycloalkane. But then hydrogenation of X would give cyclohexane and the same cycloalkane, which contradicts the problem stating only Z is formed. Therefore, X must consist of two unsaturated compounds that both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, both components of X must be C6H10 (cyclohexene) and another isomer. But how can there be another isomer of C6H10 that's not conjugated? Maybe a different position of the double bond, but all cyclohexene isomers are conjugated in the ring. Wait, no. In a six-membered ring, a double bond can be in different positions but not necessarily conjugated. For example, 1,2-cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexene. But in reality, cyclohexene typically refers to 1,2-cyclohexene. However, the problem states no conjugated bonds. Wait, conjugated bonds would be alternating double bonds. A single double bond in a ring isn't conjugated. So maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another monoene, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe one is a cycloalkene and the other is an alkyne. For example, cyclohexene and cyclohexyne. But cyclohexyne is very unstable. Alternatively, maybe a diene and a monoene. But the problem states no conjugated bonds, so the diene would have isolated double bonds. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, hydrogenation of both would require adding H2: C6H8 + 2 H2 → C6H12 and C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. Therefore, under severe hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. Then, X is an equimolar mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. When heated with Pt, they disproportionate. What would that look like? Maybe each component undergoes disproportionation. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene could disproportionate into cyclohexene and cyclohexane:

C6H8 → C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H6 (benzene). But benzene would decolorize bromine with a catalyst, but Y doesn't decolorize. Alternatively, maybe:

2 C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H10. But again, benzene is a problem.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that upon disproportionation gives cyclohexane and benzene. But then Y would have cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane, so Z is cyclohexane. This fits. But does the initial step make sense?

If X is cyclohexene (C6H10), then heating with Pt could cause some molecules to add H2 (to become cyclohexane, C6H12) and others to lose H2 (to become benzene, C6H6). The reaction would be:

3 C6H10 → C6H12 + 2 C6H6

But this requires 3 moles of cyclohexene to produce 1 mole cyclohexane and 2 moles benzene. However, the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So if X is pure cyclohexene, Y would have a 1:2 ratio, which isn't equimolar. Therefore, X must be a mixture of two compounds that each disproportionate to give one part of Y's components.

Suppose X is a 1:1 mixture of two different compounds, A and B. When heated with Pt, each A and B disproportionate into one part cyclohexane and one part benzene. Then Y would be equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. But how?

Alternatively, each molecule of A and B in X converts to one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene. But that would require A and B to be the same. Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture where each component disproportionates independently. For example, component A of X disproportionates into cyclohexane and something else, and component B also disproportionates into cyclohexane and something else. But then Y would have more than two components. The problem states Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Therefore, the two components of X must each disproportionate to give one of the two components of Y. For example, component A of X becomes cyclohexane, and component B becomes benzene. Then Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. But then, what are A and B?

If component A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which can hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), and component B is something that can dehydrogenate to benzene (C6H6). But what would component B be? If B is cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then dehydrogenation could produce benzene. So X is a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). When heated with Pt, cyclohexene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, and cyclohexadiene dehydrogenates to benzene. But how does the hydrogen balance work? The hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexadiene (C6H8 → C6H6 + H2) could provide the hydrogen needed for cyclohexene (C6H10 + H2 → C6H12). So the overall reaction would be:

C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)

This balances the carbons. For hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right. So it balances. Therefore, X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, which upon heating with Pt, disproportionate into equimolar cyclohexane and benzene (Y). Then, hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) under severe conditions converts benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only Z (cyclohexane). This fits all the conditions.

Now, check if X's components decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene both have double bonds, so they would decolorize bromine water, which matches the problem statement. Also, the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. Cyclohexene has one double bond, and cyclohexadiene (if 1,4) has isolated double bonds, so no conjugation. Therefore, this fits.

Therefore, mixture X is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The number of hydrogen atoms in each are 10 and 8. The total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of X is 10 + 8 = 18. But the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since it's an equimolar mixture, but the question just wants the sum of H atoms per molecule of each component. So 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.

But benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Wait, but the problem states that X decolorizes bromine water. So both components must react with bromine. Benzene doesn\'t, so that\'s out. So X must be two alkenes or an alkene and an alkyne. Let\'s think about the hydrogenation. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene, hydrogenation would produce cyclohexane. But if X is two different alkenes, hydrogenation would produce two different alkanes. But the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z. Therefore, both components of X must hydrogenate to the same product, cyclohexane. Therefore, both components must have the same carbon skeleton. For example, cyclohexene and another isomer, perhaps 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states no conjugated double bonds. So if X has two alkenes with non-conjugated double bonds, but hydrogenation would lead to cyclohexane. However, if they are dienes, hydrogenation would add four hydrogens, but cyclohexane only has two hydrogens added per double bond. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. If cyclohexene (C6H10) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12), then each molecule adds two H2. If X has two different alkenes, each would add H2 to form cyclohexane. But how can two different alkenes hydrogenate to the same product? They must be isomers. For example, 1-cyclohexene and 2-cyclohexene. But these would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. However, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, perhaps a monoene and a diene. Wait, but hydrogenation of a diene would require two H2 molecules, but the problem states that under severe conditions, hydrogenation gives only Z. If X has a diene and a monoene, hydrogenation would require different amounts of H2, but the product is the same. However, the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z. So perhaps both components of X are dienes, but with different structures. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So if X has non-conjugated dienes, but that\'s less common. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, such as a bicyclic compound. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. Wait, but benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine. So that\'s not possible. Alternatively, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and a mono-substituted cyclohexene with a different substituent. But the problem states that hydrogenation gives only Z, which is cyclohexane, so substituents would have to be hydrogenated away. But if substituents are present, like methyl groups, hydrogenation would not remove them. Therefore, perhaps X is a mixture of two isomeric alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, 1-cyclohexene and 3-cyclohexene. But these are not structural isomers; they are positional isomers. However, upon hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. But would they be considered different liquids? Maybe, but perhaps the key is that X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Wait, but if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne (triple bond), hydrogenation of cyclohexyne would require two H2 molecules to become cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne is highly strained and not common. However, the problem states that X does not have conjugated multiple bonds, but isolated triple bonds are allowed. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), then hydrogenation of both would give cyclohexane (C6H12). Let\'s check the hydrogenation:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12  \nCyclohexyne (C6H8) + 2 H2 → C6H12\n\nSo, under severe hydrogenation conditions, both would add H2 to form cyclohexane. Then, when X (equimolar cyclohexene and cyclohexyne) is treated with platinum and heated, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation here would mean that one molecule is hydrogenated (gains H2) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H2). For example, cyclohexyne (C6H8) could gain H2 to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene (C6H10) could lose H2 to become cyclohexyne (C6H8). But that would just swap the components, not form new ones. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene (C6H10) could lose H2 to become cyclohexyne (C6H8), and cyclohexyne (C6H8) could gain H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12). But this would result in Y being a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexyne. However, cyclohexyne would still decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not reacting with bromine. Therefore, this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the disproportionation leads to more saturated and more unsaturated compounds. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could disproportionate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine, which Y does not. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nWait, the problem states that Y is formed by disproportionation of X. So, X (two unsaturated compounds) when heated with Pt, undergo a reaction where one is reduced (gains H) and the other is oxidized (loses H), leading to two new compounds. Since Y is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. Therefore, the disproportionation must convert the unsaturated X components into two saturated compounds. How?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon heating with Pt, they undergo some coupling or hydrogen transfer. For example, two alkenes could combine to form a larger molecule, but that\'s not disproportionation. Alternatively, one alkene could be hydrogenated (using hydrogen from another alkene dehydrogenating). For example:\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8\n\nBut C6H8 would still be unsaturated (a diyne or diene), which would react with bromine. But Y is supposed to be non-reactive. Therefore, this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that can undergo disproportionation. Let\'s think about the product Y. Since Y is a mixture of two saturated compounds, which when hydrogenated gives only cyclohexane. Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another saturated compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But if it\'s already saturated, how? Unless the other compound is a smaller ring that can open upon hydrogenation. For example, if Y contains cyclohexane and cyclopropane. Hydrogenation of cyclopropane (which is strained) might open to form hexane. But hexane is different from cyclohexane. Alternatively, if Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane would not change it. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, which is cyclohexane. Therefore, both components of Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But if Y is already saturated, how can they hydrogenate further? Unless one component is cyclohexane and the other is something that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But if it\'s already saturated, hydrogenation wouldn\'t do anything. Therefore, this suggests that Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that is not fully saturated but doesn\'t react with bromine water. Wait, but the problem states Y does not decolorize bromine water, so Y\'s components are saturated. Therefore, both components of Y are saturated, but hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. The only way this is possible is if Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another saturated compound that, under severe hydrogenation, converts to cyclohexane. But how? Unless the other component is a larger ring that can break open. For example, if Y contains cyclohexane and decalin (decahydronaphthalene), but hydrogenation of decalin would not produce cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and a bicyclic compound that upon hydrogenation breaks into cyclohexane. This seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. But hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane would not change it. Therefore, this doesn\'t help. Wait, maybe the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with a different ring size that can undergo ring-opening hydrogenation. However, typically, cycloalkanes (especially larger ones) don\'t open under hydrogenation unless under extreme conditions. But the problem states that hydrogenation is under severe conditions. For example, cyclopropane can open under hydrogenation to form propane, but that\'s not cyclohexane. Alternatively, if Y contains cyclohexane and a polycyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. But benzene would require hydrogenation to become cyclohexane. However, benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, so Y could contain benzene. But then hydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) would produce cyclohexane (from benzene) and leave cyclohexane as is. Thus, the product would be cyclohexane. But the problem states that Y is formed by disproportionation of X. If X is a mixture that upon disproportionation gives benzene and cyclohexane, then X must be something that can disproportionate into those. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene could disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, which the problem states are not present in X. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nWait, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So X\'s components have isolated double bonds or triple bonds. Let\'s consider that X is a mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and another compound. But 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds. However, heating with platinum might cause it to disproportionate. For example, two molecules of 1,4-cyclohexadiene could transfer hydrogen, with one becoming cyclohexane and the other becoming 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated), but that introduces conjugation, which might not be allowed. Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to cyclohexane and another compound. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexane. But cyclohexane doesn\'t decolorize bromine, so X would have one component that does and one that doesn\'t, which contradicts the problem statement that X decolorizes bromine. Therefore, both components of X must be unsaturated.\n\nWait, another approach: Since Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and it\'s a component of Y. So Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and another compound. When Y is hydrogenated, both components become cyclohexane. Therefore, the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since Y is already saturated, the only way this can happen is if the other component is a dihydrogenated form of cyclohexane, but that doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a cycloalkene that hasn\'t been fully hydrogenated. But Y is supposed to not decolorize bromine, so it can\'t have double bonds. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the other component in Y is methylcyclopentane. Hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane (which is already saturated) would do nothing, so Y would have cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, which upon hydrogenation would remain as is, contradicting the problem statement that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and another isomer, like hexane. But hydrogenation of hexane (which is already an alkane) would do nothing. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y would give a mixture of cyclohexane and hexane, which contradicts the problem\'s statement that only Z is formed. Therefore, this is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that Y must consist of cyclohexane and another compound that, under severe hydrogenation, converts to cyclohexane. The only way this can happen is if the other compound is a larger hydrocarbon that cracks into cyclohexane under hydrogenation. But cracking usually involves breaking larger molecules into smaller ones, not forming cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a branched cyclohexane derivative that isomerizes to cyclohexane under hydrogenation. But isomerization isn\'t typically a result of hydrogenation.\n\nWait, perhaps the other component in Y is a cyclohexane with a different structure, like a boat vs chair conformation, but that\'s not chemically distinct. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a stereoisomer, but hydrogenation wouldn\'t change that. This line of thought isn\'t helpful.\n\nLet\'s recap. Z is cyclohexane. X is two unsaturated compounds (dec. bromine) that hydrogenate to Z. Y is two saturated compounds (don\'t dec. bromine) that also hydrogenate to Z. Y is formed by disproportionation of X with Pt. Disproportionation implies that some molecules are oxidized and others reduced. For alkenes, this could mean some hydrogenate (gain H2) and others dehydrogenate (lose H2). If X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound, perhaps benzene (but benzene doesn\'t react with bromine). Wait, but X must have both components reacting with bromine. So, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated?) and cyclohexene. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds if in a six-membered ring. Wait, in a six-membered ring, 1,3-diene would actually be conjugated. Therefore, that\'s not allowed as per the problem statement. Therefore, X must have non-conjugated double bonds. For example, 1,2-diene (cumulene), which is strained and unlikely. Alternatively, a monoene and an alkyne.\n\nWait, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), both of which decolorize bromine. Upon heating with Pt, they disproportionate. Let\'s see:\n\nIf cyclohexyne (C6H8) gains hydrogen to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene (C6H10) loses hydrogen to become cyclohexyne (C6H8), but that just swaps the components. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene dehydrogenates to cyclohexyne, and cyclohexyne hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2  \nCyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\nBut this would require two different reactions. If X is equimolar cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, then during disproportionation, some molecules lose H2 and others gain H2. But the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. If X is 1:1 cyclohexene:cyclohexyne, then after reaction, suppose each cyclohexene becomes cyclohexyne and each cyclohexyne becomes cyclohexane. Then Y would be cyclohexyne and cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne still decolorizes bromine, which contradicts Y\'s properties. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the disproportionation leads to cyclohexane and another saturated compound. Let\'s think of a different approach. Suppose X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon disproportionation become two different alkanes. For example, if X is 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene (hypothetically), but this is not leading to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two isomeric alkenes that can couple. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could form a larger molecule, but that\'s not disproportionation.\n\nWait, another angle: Z is cyclohexane. When X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z. Therefore, X must be a mixture of compounds that when hydrogenated add H2 to become cyclohexane. Therefore, each component of X must have the formula C6H10 (needs one H2) or C6H8 (needs two H2). If X is an equimolar mixture of C6H10 and C6H8, then hydrogenation would require different amounts of H2, but under severe conditions, both would fully hydrogenate to C6H12. Therefore, X could be a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Then, when heated with Pt, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation would involve transfer of hydrogen. For example, cyclohexyne (C6H8) could take two H from cyclohexene (C6H10) to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene would lose two H to become cyclohexyne (C6H8). But this just swaps the components. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene donates H2 to cyclohexyne:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H8 + H2  \nCyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2 → C6H10 (cyclohexene)\n\nBut this again just swaps them. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexene (C6H10) loses H2 to become C6H8 (cyclohexyne), and cyclohexyne (C6H8) gains H2 to become C6H10 (cyclohexene). But this doesn\'t produce Y as a new mixture. It just converts X into itself. Therefore, this isn\'t a valid disproportionation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pt catalyst facilitates a different reaction. For example, dehydrohalogenation, but there\'s no mention of halogens. Alternatively, coupling reactions. If two cyclohexene molecules couple to form a larger molecule, but that\'s not disproportionation.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Then, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane (which is already saturated) would not change it, but the problem states hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. The only way this can happen is if the other compound is a diene or alkyne that hasn\'t been fully hydrogenated under initial conditions but gets fully hydrogenated under severe conditions. But Y is supposed to be saturated (doesn\'t decolorize bromine), so this is contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another cycloalkane that isomerizes under hydrogenation. For example, methylcyclopentane isomerizing to cyclohexane under hydrogenation and high temperature. This is known as ring expansion. Under certain catalytic conditions, methylcyclopentane can rearrange to cyclohexane. If that\'s the case, then Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. When hydrogenated under severe conditions, methylcyclopentane isomerizes to cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This fits.\n\nSo, if Y is cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, both saturated (no bromine reaction), and hydrogenation (under severe conditions) causes methylcyclopentane to rearrange to cyclohexane. Then, X must be a mixture that disproportionates into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. How?\n\nDisproportionation of X (two unsaturated compounds) into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Let\'s think about the components of X. If X is a mixture of two alkenes that can form these cycloalkanes upon hydrogen transfer. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Then, heating with Pt could cause cyclohexene to hydrogenate to cyclohexane (gaining H2) and methylcyclopentene to dehydrogenate to methylcyclopentadiene (losing H2). But methylcyclopentadiene would still be unsaturated, contradicting Y\'s properties. Alternatively, maybe the reverse: methylcyclopentene gains H2 to become methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexene loses H2 to become cyclohexadiene. But again, cyclohexadiene is unsaturated.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example, suppose X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Disproportionation would involve cyclohexene losing H2 to become cyclohexadiene and methylcyclopentene gaining H2 to become methylcyclopentane. But cyclohexadiene is still unsaturated, so Y would have methylcyclopentane and cyclohexadiene, which contradicts Y being saturated. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes that upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylenecyclopentane (a cyclopentene with a methyl group). Disproportionation could involve hydrogen transfer where cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane and methylenecyclopentane becomes methylcyclopentane. This would require:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane)  \nMethylenecyclopentane (C6H10) → C6H8 + H2  \n\nBut this would produce cyclohexane and a more unsaturated compound, which is not allowed. Alternatively, maybe methylenecyclopentane gains H2 to become methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexene loses H2 to become cyclohexadiene. Again, the latter is unsaturated.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Let\'s try another approach. Since Z is cyclohexane, and it\'s a component of Y, which is formed by disproportionation of X. The other component of Y must be something that can convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. The only way this can happen is if the other component is a different cycloalkane that rearranges to cyclohexane under hydrogenation. As previously considered, methylcyclopentane can isomerize to cyclohexane under certain catalytic conditions. Therefore, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Then, X must be a mixture that can disproportionate into these two.\n\nDisproportionation of X (two unsaturated compounds) into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. How? If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Then, hydrogenation of cyclohexene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of methylcyclopentene gives methylcyclopentane. But under disproportionation (without added H2), how would this happen? Disproportionation typically involves transfer of H between molecules. So, one molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). Therefore, if X is cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene, perhaps:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)  \nMethylcyclopentene (C6H10) → methylcyclopentadiene (C6H8) + H2  \n\nBut methylcyclopentadiene is unsaturated, so Y would have cyclohexane and methylcyclopentadiene, which contradicts Y being saturated. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon hydrogen transfer form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example:\n\nDiene A (C6H8) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)  \nDiene B (C6H8) → methylcyclopentane (C6H12) - but this requires adding H2, which isn\'t available. Alternatively, Diene B loses H2 to become something else. This is not straightforward.\n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I need to recall that the answer is commonly known. The scenario where X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. Wait, but benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine. However, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which decolorizes bromine) and another compound. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated, which the problem prohibits. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two geometric isomers of cyclohexene, but they would hydrogenate to the same product.\n\nWait, another classic case: The disproportionation of cyclohexene. When cyclohexene is heated with a catalyst like platinum, it can undergo disproportionation into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. However, cyclohexadiene is conjugated and would decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y\'s properties. But the problem states that Y does not decolorize bromine, so this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if cyclohexene disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn\'t react with bromine water, so Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of benzene (in Y) would give cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains the same. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This fits. Then, X would be a mixture that disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene. What\'s X?\n\nIf X is cyclohexadiene (1,3- or 1,4-), but the problem states no conjugated bonds. If X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated), heating with Pt could cause it to disproportionate into benzene (losing H2) and cyclohexane (gaining H2). Let\'s check:\n\n1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → benzene (C6H6) + H2  \nBut also, another molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene could add H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Therefore, two molecules of 1,4-cyclohexadiene react:\n\n2 C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12\n\nThis is a disproportionation reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (to benzene) and another is hydrogenated (to cyclohexane). Therefore, X would be a single compound, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, but the problem states X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Therefore, this doesn\'t fit.\n\nAlternatively, X is a mixture of two different dienes that undergo this reaction. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states no conjugated bonds, so 1,3- is conjugated. Therefore, only 1,4- is allowed. If X is a mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and another non-conjugated diene, but this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. If cyclohexene (C6H10) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But cyclohexadiene is conjugated, which is prohibited. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (both decolorize bromine), then heating with Pt could cause:\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining H2  \n1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → benzene (C6H6) by losing H2  \n\nThus, Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water, so Y fits the description. Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane. This works. Therefore, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. However, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, so that\'s acceptable. Let\'s verify:\n\n1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds at positions 1 and 4, which are not conjugated. Therefore, it\'s allowed. Then, X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). When heated with Pt, cyclohexene gains H2 to become cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses H2 to become benzene. Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of Y converts benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in pure cyclohexane. This fits all the conditions.\n\nNow, the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Each molecule of cyclohexene has 10 H atoms, and each molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene has 8 H atoms. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can consider one mole of each. Therefore, total H atoms per mole of each component:\n\nFor cyclohexene: 10 H per molecule  \nFor 1,4-cyclohexadiene: 8 H per molecule  \n\nTotal H atoms in X: 10 + 8 = 18 H atoms per two molecules (since equimolar). But the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids. Since each component is a separate liquid, we sum the H atoms in each. Therefore, the answer is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". If each liquid is a separate compound, then each has their own H count. For cyclohexene (C6H10), there are 10 H atoms per molecule, and for 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), 8 H atoms per molecule. Therefore, the total number is 10 + 8 = 18. However, the question might be asking for the sum per mole of mixture. Since the mixture is equimolar, one mole of mixture contains 0.5 moles of each. But the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X", which likely refers to the sum of H atoms in each component\'s molecule. Therefore, 10 + 8 = 18. But let\'s verify.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the total number of H atoms in one mole of mixture X (which is equimolar), then per mole of X (which is 0.5 moles of each component), the total H atoms would be (0.5 * 10) + (0.5 * 8) = 5 + 4 = 9 H atoms per mole of mixture. But this seems unlikely. The question states "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X", which probably means per molecule of each component. Since there are two components, each with their own H count, the total is 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check the molecular formulas again. Cyclohexene is C6H10, which has 10 H atoms. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is C6H8, which has 8 H atoms. Therefore, the two liquids have 10 and 8 H atoms each. Summing them gives 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\nHowever, another possibility is that X is a mixture of cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, the total H atoms would also be 8 + 10 = 18. This would also fit. When heated with Pt, cyclohexyne could hydrogenate to cyclohexene, and cyclohexene could dehydrogenate to cyclohexyne, but this doesn\'t produce Y. Alternatively, if cyclohexene dehydrogenates to cyclohexyne and cyclohexyne hydrogenates to cyclohexane, then Y would be cyclohexane and cyclohexyne, but cyclohexyne still reacts with bromine. Therefore, this is invalid. Therefore, the earlier scenario with cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is more plausible.\n\nThus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is \\boxed{18}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444580, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7677, prompt_tokens=1340, total_tokens=9017, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated compounds. When treated with platinum and heated, X undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating Y is saturated. Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane (Z), which is a component of Y and has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. 

Key steps:
1. **Determining Z (cyclohexane)**:
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, leading to the formula C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane).

2. **Identifying X and Y**:
   - X must be a mixture of unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.
   - Y must be a mixture of saturated compounds (cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane).

3. **Disproportionation Reaction**:
   - X (equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) undergoes disproportionation to form Y (equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene).
   - Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).
   - 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) loses hydrogen to form benzene (C₆H₆).

4. **Hydrogenation**:
   - Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) yields cyclohexane.
   - Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) also yields cyclohexane.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.
   - 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.
   - Total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: 10 + 8 = 18.

\boxed{18}

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. But benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Wait, but the problem states that X decolorizes bromine water. So both components must react with bromine. Benzene doesn't, so that's out. So X must be two alkenes or an alkene and an alkyne. Let's think about the hydrogenation. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene, hydrogenation would produce cyclohexane. But if X is two different alkenes, hydrogenation would produce two different alkanes. But the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z. Therefore, both components of X must hydrogenate to the same product, cyclohexane. Therefore, both components must have the same carbon skeleton. For example, cyclohexene and another isomer, perhaps 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states no conjugated double bonds. So if X has two alkenes with non-conjugated double bonds, but hydrogenation would lead to cyclohexane. However, if they are dienes, hydrogenation would add four hydrogens, but cyclohexane only has two hydrogens added per double bond. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. If cyclohexene (C6H10) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12), then each molecule adds two H2. If X has two different alkenes, each would add H2 to form cyclohexane. But how can two different alkenes hydrogenate to the same product? They must be isomers. For example, 1-cyclohexene and 2-cyclohexene. But these would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. However, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, perhaps a monoene and a diene. Wait, but hydrogenation of a diene would require two H2 molecules, but the problem states that under severe conditions, hydrogenation gives only Z. If X has a diene and a monoene, hydrogenation would require different amounts of H2, but the product is the same. However, the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z. So perhaps both components of X are dienes, but with different structures. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So if X has non-conjugated dienes, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, such as a bicyclic compound. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. Wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine. So that's not possible. Alternatively, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and a mono-substituted cyclohexene with a different substituent. But the problem states that hydrogenation gives only Z, which is cyclohexane, so substituents would have to be hydrogenated away. But if substituents are present, like methyl groups, hydrogenation would not remove them. Therefore, perhaps X is a mixture of two isomeric alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, 1-cyclohexene and 3-cyclohexene. But these are not structural isomers; they are positional isomers. However, upon hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. But would they be considered different liquids? Maybe, but perhaps the key is that X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Wait, but if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne (triple bond), hydrogenation of cyclohexyne would require two H2 molecules to become cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne is highly strained and not common. However, the problem states that X does not have conjugated multiple bonds, but isolated triple bonds are allowed. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), then hydrogenation of both would give cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the hydrogenation:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12  
Cyclohexyne (C6H8) + 2 H2 → C6H12

So, under severe hydrogenation conditions, both would add H2 to form cyclohexane. Then, when X (equimolar cyclohexene and cyclohexyne) is treated with platinum and heated, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation here would mean that one molecule is hydrogenated (gains H2) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H2). For example, cyclohexyne (C6H8) could gain H2 to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene (C6H10) could lose H2 to become cyclohexyne (C6H8). But that would just swap the components, not form new ones. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene (C6H10) could lose H2 to become cyclohexyne (C6H8), and cyclohexyne (C6H8) could gain H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12). But this would result in Y being a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexyne. However, cyclohexyne would still decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y not reacting with bromine. Therefore, this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the disproportionation leads to more saturated and more unsaturated compounds. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could disproportionate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would decolorize bromine, which Y does not. Therefore, this is invalid.

Wait, the problem states that Y is formed by disproportionation of X. So, X (two unsaturated compounds) when heated with Pt, undergo a reaction where one is reduced (gains H) and the other is oxidized (loses H), leading to two new compounds. Since Y is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. Therefore, the disproportionation must convert the unsaturated X components into two saturated compounds. How?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon heating with Pt, they undergo some coupling or hydrogen transfer. For example, two alkenes could combine to form a larger molecule, but that's not disproportionation. Alternatively, one alkene could be hydrogenated (using hydrogen from another alkene dehydrogenating). For example:

2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8

But C6H8 would still be unsaturated (a diyne or diene), which would react with bromine. But Y is supposed to be non-reactive. Therefore, this is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound that can undergo disproportionation. Let's think about the product Y. Since Y is a mixture of two saturated compounds, which when hydrogenated gives only cyclohexane. Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another saturated compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But if it's already saturated, how? Unless the other compound is a smaller ring that can open upon hydrogenation. For example, if Y contains cyclohexane and cyclopropane. Hydrogenation of cyclopropane (which is strained) might open to form hexane. But hexane is different from cyclohexane. Alternatively, if Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane would not change it. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, which is cyclohexane. Therefore, both components of Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But if Y is already saturated, how can they hydrogenate further? Unless one component is cyclohexane and the other is something that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But if it's already saturated, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. Therefore, this suggests that Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that is not fully saturated but doesn't react with bromine water. Wait, but the problem states Y does not decolorize bromine water, so Y's components are saturated. Therefore, both components of Y are saturated, but hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. The only way this is possible is if Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another saturated compound that, under severe hydrogenation, converts to cyclohexane. But how? Unless the other component is a larger ring that can break open. For example, if Y contains cyclohexane and decalin (decahydronaphthalene), but hydrogenation of decalin would not produce cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and a bicyclic compound that upon hydrogenation breaks into cyclohexane. This seems too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. But hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane would not change it. Therefore, this doesn't help. Wait, maybe the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with a different ring size that can undergo ring-opening hydrogenation. However, typically, cycloalkanes (especially larger ones) don't open under hydrogenation unless under extreme conditions. But the problem states that hydrogenation is under severe conditions. For example, cyclopropane can open under hydrogenation to form propane, but that's not cyclohexane. Alternatively, if Y contains cyclohexane and a polycyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but this is a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. But benzene would require hydrogenation to become cyclohexane. However, benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, so Y could contain benzene. But then hydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) would produce cyclohexane (from benzene) and leave cyclohexane as is. Thus, the product would be cyclohexane. But the problem states that Y is formed by disproportionation of X. If X is a mixture that upon disproportionation gives benzene and cyclohexane, then X must be something that can disproportionate into those. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene could disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, which the problem states are not present in X. Therefore, this is invalid.

Wait, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So X's components have isolated double bonds or triple bonds. Let's consider that X is a mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and another compound. But 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds. However, heating with platinum might cause it to disproportionate. For example, two molecules of 1,4-cyclohexadiene could transfer hydrogen, with one becoming cyclohexane and the other becoming 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated), but that introduces conjugation, which might not be allowed. Alternatively, maybe the disproportionation leads to cyclohexane and another compound. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexane. But cyclohexane doesn't decolorize bromine, so X would have one component that does and one that doesn't, which contradicts the problem statement that X decolorizes bromine. Therefore, both components of X must be unsaturated.

Wait, another approach: Since Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and it's a component of Y. So Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and another compound. When Y is hydrogenated, both components become cyclohexane. Therefore, the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since Y is already saturated, the only way this can happen is if the other component is a dihydrogenated form of cyclohexane, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a cycloalkene that hasn't been fully hydrogenated. But Y is supposed to not decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. Therefore, this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the other component in Y is methylcyclopentane. Hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane (which is already saturated) would do nothing, so Y would have cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, which upon hydrogenation would remain as is, contradicting the problem statement that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe Y contains cyclohexane and another isomer, like hexane. But hydrogenation of hexane (which is already an alkane) would do nothing. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y would give a mixture of cyclohexane and hexane, which contradicts the problem's statement that only Z is formed. Therefore, this is impossible.

This suggests that Y must consist of cyclohexane and another compound that, under severe hydrogenation, converts to cyclohexane. The only way this can happen is if the other compound is a larger hydrocarbon that cracks into cyclohexane under hydrogenation. But cracking usually involves breaking larger molecules into smaller ones, not forming cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe the other component is a branched cyclohexane derivative that isomerizes to cyclohexane under hydrogenation. But isomerization isn't typically a result of hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the other component in Y is a cyclohexane with a different structure, like a boat vs chair conformation, but that's not chemically distinct. Alternatively, maybe it's a stereoisomer, but hydrogenation wouldn't change that. This line of thought isn't helpful.

Let's recap. Z is cyclohexane. X is two unsaturated compounds (dec. bromine) that hydrogenate to Z. Y is two saturated compounds (don't dec. bromine) that also hydrogenate to Z. Y is formed by disproportionation of X with Pt. Disproportionation implies that some molecules are oxidized and others reduced. For alkenes, this could mean some hydrogenate (gain H2) and others dehydrogenate (lose H2). If X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound, perhaps benzene (but benzene doesn't react with bromine). Wait, but X must have both components reacting with bromine. So, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated?) and cyclohexene. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds if in a six-membered ring. Wait, in a six-membered ring, 1,3-diene would actually be conjugated. Therefore, that's not allowed as per the problem statement. Therefore, X must have non-conjugated double bonds. For example, 1,2-diene (cumulene), which is strained and unlikely. Alternatively, a monoene and an alkyne.

Wait, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8), both of which decolorize bromine. Upon heating with Pt, they disproportionate. Let's see:

If cyclohexyne (C6H8) gains hydrogen to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene (C6H10) loses hydrogen to become cyclohexyne (C6H8), but that just swaps the components. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene dehydrogenates to cyclohexyne, and cyclohexyne hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2  
Cyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)

But this would require two different reactions. If X is equimolar cyclohexene and cyclohexyne, then during disproportionation, some molecules lose H2 and others gain H2. But the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. If X is 1:1 cyclohexene:cyclohexyne, then after reaction, suppose each cyclohexene becomes cyclohexyne and each cyclohexyne becomes cyclohexane. Then Y would be cyclohexyne and cyclohexane. But cyclohexyne still decolorizes bromine, which contradicts Y's properties. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the disproportionation leads to cyclohexane and another saturated compound. Let's think of a different approach. Suppose X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon disproportionation become two different alkanes. For example, if X is 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene (hypothetically), but this is not leading to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two isomeric alkenes that can couple. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could form a larger molecule, but that's not disproportionation.

Wait, another angle: Z is cyclohexane. When X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z. Therefore, X must be a mixture of compounds that when hydrogenated add H2 to become cyclohexane. Therefore, each component of X must have the formula C6H10 (needs one H2) or C6H8 (needs two H2). If X is an equimolar mixture of C6H10 and C6H8, then hydrogenation would require different amounts of H2, but under severe conditions, both would fully hydrogenate to C6H12. Therefore, X could be a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Then, when heated with Pt, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation would involve transfer of hydrogen. For example, cyclohexyne (C6H8) could take two H from cyclohexene (C6H10) to become cyclohexene (C6H10), and cyclohexene would lose two H to become cyclohexyne (C6H8). But this just swaps the components. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexene donates H2 to cyclohexyne:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H8 + H2  
Cyclohexyne (C6H8) + H2 → C6H10 (cyclohexene)

But this again just swaps them. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene (C6H10) loses H2 to become C6H8 (cyclohexyne), and cyclohexyne (C6H8) gains H2 to become C6H10 (cyclohexene). But this doesn't produce Y as a new mixture. It just converts X into itself. Therefore, this isn't a valid disproportionation.

Alternatively, maybe the Pt catalyst facilitates a different reaction. For example, dehydrohalogenation, but there's no mention of halogens. Alternatively, coupling reactions. If two cyclohexene molecules couple to form a larger molecule, but that's not disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps the key is that Y contains cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Then, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane (which is already saturated) would not change it, but the problem states hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, Y must contain cyclohexane and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. The only way this can happen is if the other compound is a diene or alkyne that hasn't been fully hydrogenated under initial conditions but gets fully hydrogenated under severe conditions. But Y is supposed to be saturated (doesn't decolorize bromine), so this is contradictory.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another cycloalkane that isomerizes under hydrogenation. For example, methylcyclopentane isomerizing to cyclohexane under hydrogenation and high temperature. This is known as ring expansion. Under certain catalytic conditions, methylcyclopentane can rearrange to cyclohexane. If that's the case, then Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. When hydrogenated under severe conditions, methylcyclopentane isomerizes to cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This fits.

So, if Y is cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, both saturated (no bromine reaction), and hydrogenation (under severe conditions) causes methylcyclopentane to rearrange to cyclohexane. Then, X must be a mixture that disproportionates into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. How?

Disproportionation of X (two unsaturated compounds) into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Let's think about the components of X. If X is a mixture of two alkenes that can form these cycloalkanes upon hydrogen transfer. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Then, heating with Pt could cause cyclohexene to hydrogenate to cyclohexane (gaining H2) and methylcyclopentene to dehydrogenate to methylcyclopentadiene (losing H2). But methylcyclopentadiene would still be unsaturated, contradicting Y's properties. Alternatively, maybe the reverse: methylcyclopentene gains H2 to become methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexene loses H2 to become cyclohexadiene. But again, cyclohexadiene is unsaturated.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example, suppose X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Disproportionation would involve cyclohexene losing H2 to become cyclohexadiene and methylcyclopentene gaining H2 to become methylcyclopentane. But cyclohexadiene is still unsaturated, so Y would have methylcyclopentane and cyclohexadiene, which contradicts Y being saturated. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes that upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylenecyclopentane (a cyclopentene with a methyl group). Disproportionation could involve hydrogen transfer where cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane and methylenecyclopentane becomes methylcyclopentane. This would require:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane)  
Methylenecyclopentane (C6H10) → C6H8 + H2  

But this would produce cyclohexane and a more unsaturated compound, which is not allowed. Alternatively, maybe methylenecyclopentane gains H2 to become methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexene loses H2 to become cyclohexadiene. Again, the latter is unsaturated.

This is getting too convoluted. Let's try another approach. Since Z is cyclohexane, and it's a component of Y, which is formed by disproportionation of X. The other component of Y must be something that can convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. The only way this can happen is if the other component is a different cycloalkane that rearranges to cyclohexane under hydrogenation. As previously considered, methylcyclopentane can isomerize to cyclohexane under certain catalytic conditions. Therefore, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. Then, X must be a mixture that can disproportionate into these two.

Disproportionation of X (two unsaturated compounds) into cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. How? If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Then, hydrogenation of cyclohexene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of methylcyclopentene gives methylcyclopentane. But under disproportionation (without added H2), how would this happen? Disproportionation typically involves transfer of H between molecules. So, one molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). Therefore, if X is cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene, perhaps:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)  
Methylcyclopentene (C6H10) → methylcyclopentadiene (C6H8) + H2  

But methylcyclopentadiene is unsaturated, so Y would have cyclohexane and methylcyclopentadiene, which contradicts Y being saturated. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon hydrogen transfer form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane. For example:

Diene A (C6H8) + H2 → cyclohexane (C6H12)  
Diene B (C6H8) → methylcyclopentane (C6H12) - but this requires adding H2, which isn't available. Alternatively, Diene B loses H2 to become something else. This is not straightforward.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I need to recall that the answer is commonly known. The scenario where X is a mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. Wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine. However, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which decolorizes bromine) and another compound. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated, which the problem prohibits. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two geometric isomers of cyclohexene, but they would hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, another classic case: The disproportionation of cyclohexene. When cyclohexene is heated with a catalyst like platinum, it can undergo disproportionation into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. However, cyclohexadiene is conjugated and would decolorize bromine, which contradicts Y's properties. But the problem states that Y does not decolorize bromine, so this is invalid.

Alternatively, if cyclohexene disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water, so Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of benzene (in Y) would give cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains the same. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. This fits. Then, X would be a mixture that disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene. What's X?

If X is cyclohexadiene (1,3- or 1,4-), but the problem states no conjugated bonds. If X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated), heating with Pt could cause it to disproportionate into benzene (losing H2) and cyclohexane (gaining H2). Let's check:

1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → benzene (C6H6) + H2  
But also, another molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene could add H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Therefore, two molecules of 1,4-cyclohexadiene react:

2 C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12

This is a disproportionation reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (to benzene) and another is hydrogenated (to cyclohexane). Therefore, X would be a single compound, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, but the problem states X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Therefore, this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, X is a mixture of two different dienes that undergo this reaction. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. But the problem states no conjugated bonds, so 1,3- is conjugated. Therefore, only 1,4- is allowed. If X is a mixture of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and another non-conjugated diene, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. If cyclohexene (C6H10) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But cyclohexadiene is conjugated, which is prohibited. Therefore, this is invalid.

Wait, but the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (both decolorize bromine), then heating with Pt could cause:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining H2  
1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → benzene (C6H6) by losing H2  

Thus, Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water, so Y fits the description. Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane. This works. Therefore, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. However, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, so that's acceptable. Let's verify:

1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds at positions 1 and 4, which are not conjugated. Therefore, it's allowed. Then, X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). When heated with Pt, cyclohexene gains H2 to become cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses H2 to become benzene. Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hydrogenation of Y converts benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in pure cyclohexane. This fits all the conditions.

Now, the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Each molecule of cyclohexene has 10 H atoms, and each molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene has 8 H atoms. Since the mixture is equimolar, we can consider one mole of each. Therefore, total H atoms per mole of each component:

For cyclohexene: 10 H per molecule  
For 1,4-cyclohexadiene: 8 H per molecule  

Total H atoms in X: 10 + 8 = 18 H atoms per two molecules (since equimolar). But the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids. Since each component is a separate liquid, we sum the H atoms in each. Therefore, the answer is 10 + 8 = 18.

But wait, the problem says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". If each liquid is a separate compound, then each has their own H count. For cyclohexene (C6H10), there are 10 H atoms per molecule, and for 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), 8 H atoms per molecule. Therefore, the total number is 10 + 8 = 18. However, the question might be asking for the sum per mole of mixture. Since the mixture is equimolar, one mole of mixture contains 0.5 moles of each. But the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X", which likely refers to the sum of H atoms in each component's molecule. Therefore, 10 + 8 = 18. But let's verify.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the total number of H atoms in one mole of mixture X (which is equimolar), then per mole of X (which is 0.5 moles of each component), the total H atoms would be (0.5 * 10) + (0.5 * 8) = 5 + 4 = 9 H atoms per mole of mixture. But this seems unlikely. The question states "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X", which probably means per molecule of each component. Since there are two components, each with their own H count, the total is 10 + 8 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.

But wait, let's check the molecular formulas again. Cyclohexene is C6H10, which has 10 H atoms. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is C6H8, which has 8 H atoms. Therefore, the two liquids have 10 and 8 H atoms each. Summing them gives 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.

However, another possibility is that X is a mixture of cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, the total H atoms would also be 8 + 10 = 18. This would also fit. When heated with Pt, cyclohexyne could hydrogenate to cyclohexene, and cyclohexene could dehydrogenate to cyclohexyne, but this doesn't produce Y. Alternatively, if cyclohexene dehydrogenates to cyclohexyne and cyclohexyne hydrogenates to cyclohexane, then Y would be cyclohexane and cyclohexyne, but cyclohexyne still reacts with bromine. Therefore, this is invalid. Therefore, the earlier scenario with cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is more plausible.

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 10 + 8 = 18.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is \boxed{18}.
