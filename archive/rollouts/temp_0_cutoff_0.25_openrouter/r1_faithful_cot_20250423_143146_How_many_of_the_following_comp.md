To determine the number of optically active compounds, we analyze each for chirality and the presence of symmetry (meso forms):

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   - No chiral centers. The double bond causes geometric isomerism (Z/E), not optical activity.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   - Multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured double bond. No symmetry.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   - Two stereocenters with opposite configurations (R,S). Internal plane of symmetry makes it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   - Two stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R). No symmetry.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   - C1 is a chiral center (four distinct substituents: -OH, C2, C6, H). The double bond breaks symmetry.  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   - Three stereocenters, but symmetric arrangement (1,3,5 positions) creates a plane of symmetry (meso).  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   - No chiral centers. The ketone carbon is spÂ² hybridized, and other carbons lack four distinct groups.  
   **Not optically active.**

**Optically active compounds**: 2, 4, 5.  
**Total**: 3 compounds.  

**Answer**: \boxed{3}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. If a compound has a chiral center (or any kind of chirality) and isn't a meso compound, then it should be optically active. So, I need to check each compound for chiral centers, possible planes of symmetry, and whether any of them are meso compounds. Let's go through them one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group attached. Wait, but the double bond is at 1-ene, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should write the structure properly. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting at position 1 (the first carbon) with Cl and position 2 with a methyl. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me count the carbons. But-1-ene is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting at C1 (the left end) with Cl and C2 with a methyl. So maybe it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But wait, the positions might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that would be but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl on C1 (the first CH2) would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be substituting a hydrogen on C1 with Cl. So ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and a CH2 group, and C2 has a methyl and a CH2 group? Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be C1: Cl, C(CH3); C2: =CH2CH3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the substituents. The molecule is (Z)-configured. So the groups on each carbon of the double bond are arranged in a specific way. But regardless of the structure, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has Cl, a methyl (from position 2?), and two other groups. Wait, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then C1 is connected to Cl, the double bond (two substituents: the other carbon and another group), and maybe a methyl. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3. No, the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), but with a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, C1 would be Cl-CH2- and then double bond to C2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the presence of a double bond can lead to geometric isomerism (cis/trans or Z/E), but does that affect optical activity? Wait, no, geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism. Unless the molecule has a chiral center. So, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then the adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) are each connected to two groups. For a chiral center, we need four different groups. Let's take C2. If C2 is connected to a methyl, a hydrogen, and two carbons (from the double bond and the adjacent carbon), maybe. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups. Wait, no. Each carbon in a double bond has three substituents. For example, in CH2=CH2, each CH2 has two H and one CH2. But in this compound, C1 is Cl-CH2- and then double bond to C2, which is CH(CH3). Wait, maybe C2 has substituents: methyl, two from the double bond (C1 and C3), and a hydrogen. So substituents would be CH3, C1 (Cl-CH2-), C3 (maybe CH2?), and H. Are all four different? If C1 is Cl-CH2-, then C2 is connected to Cl-CH2 (via double bond), CH3, H, and CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. If the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a methyl (from 2-methyl?), and C2 has a methyl and another group. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should move on and come back to this one. Let me check the other compounds first.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a mouthful. The presence of stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) suggests that there are multiple stereocenters and possibly a double bond with E configuration. Since it's specified as (3aR,7aS,E), that means there are at least two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and an E double bond. So this compound has multiple chiral centers and thus is optically active unless it's a meso compound. But given the complexity of the structure, it's unlikely to be meso. So this one is probably optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters are at C2 and C3. If the configuration is R and S, respectively, then we need to check if this is a meso compound. For succinic acid derivatives, if the two stereocenters are opposite (R and S), and there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. Let's see. The molecule would have two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, with configurations R and S. If there's a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it would be meso. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has R and S configurations with a plane of symmetry. So in this case, (2R,3S) could be meso. Let me visualize. The molecule is HOOC-C(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH. If there's a plane of symmetry that swaps the two carboxylic acid groups and the two methyl groups, then it would be meso. Yes, because the two carboxylic acids are on either end, and the methyl groups are on C2 and C3. If the configurations are R and S, then the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it meso. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. So the configurations are both R. In this case, there's no plane of symmetry because both methyl groups are in the same configuration. Therefore, this would be a chiral compound with two chiral centers and no internal plane of symmetry, so it should be optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. Now, cyclohexenol: the alcohol is on C1. The question is whether this carbon is a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The alcohol is on C1. So C1 is connected to the hydroxyl group, two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), and the ring. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents. Wait, C1 would have substituents: -OH, C2, C6, and the ring. But in a cyclohexene ring, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The presence of the double bond might affect the geometry. However, the key point is whether C1 has four different groups. Let's see: C1 has -OH, two CH2 groups (if the ring is in chair or another conformation), but wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups (since the double bond is between 3 and 4). Wait, no. In cyclohexene, the carbons adjacent to the double bond might have different substituents. Let me draw it. The cyclohexene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Double bond between 3 and 4. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. If the ring is in a chair-like structure, but with a double bond, which makes it more rigid. The C1 has an -OH group. So the substituents on C1 would be: -OH, C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), and the ring. Wait, but in reality, the ring is a conjugated system. Wait, maybe C1 has three substituents: -OH, C2, and C6, but since it's part of the ring, the fourth substituent is the ring itself. Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and two other groups. For C1, which is not part of the double bond, it's connected to C2 and C6 (both single bonds) and has two hydrogen atoms? Wait, no. In a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring with two single bonds and one double bond (for the double bond carbons). For C1, which is not part of the double bond, it's connected via single bonds to C2 and C6, and has two hydrogen atoms. Wait, but if there's an -OH group on C1, then the substituents would be -OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make three substituents: -OH, C2 (CH2), C6 (CH2), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that's four groups: -OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. Are the two CH2 groups different? If the ring is symmetric around C1, then maybe C2 and C6 are equivalent, making C1 not a chiral center. Wait, but the presence of the double bond might break the symmetry. Let's think. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the ring is not symmetric with respect to C1. For example, the substituents on C2 and C6 might be in different environments because of the double bond. So C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is part of the double bond), and C6 is adjacent to C5, which is not part of the double bond. Therefore, C2 and C6 are in different environments, making the two CH2 groups different. Therefore, C1 would have four different substituents: -OH, C2 (which is CH2 connected to C3, which is part of a double bond), C6 (CH2 connected to C5, which is a single bond), and a hydrogen. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and since the configuration is specified as R, this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait. If the ring is planar, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. But cyclohexene is not planar; it's a non-planar ring with a boat or chair-like conformation. However, the presence of the double bond would make it more rigid. But even so, the key is whether the substituents on C1 are all different. If C2 and C6 are in different environments due to the double bond, then yes. So I think this compound is chiral and optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration (s), but since the ring is symmetric, maybe this is a meso compound. Wait, let's think. If the hydroxyl groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, and all are in the same configuration (s), which would mean they are all either axial or equatorial. But in a cyclohexane ring, 1,3,5-triol with all hydroxyls in the same configuration would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if all are axial, then there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring. Similarly, if all are equatorial, there's also symmetry. Therefore, this compound would be meso, and thus not optically active. Wait, but wait. For a compound to be meso, it needs to have stereocenters but an internal plane of symmetry. So if the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically, then even though there are three stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is achiral. For example, in 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups in the same configuration, the molecule is achiral because of the symmetry. Similarly, here, if all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration (s), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, but butan-1-one is pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Butan-1-one would be CH3CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because ketones are named with the lowest possible number. Wait, but butan-1-one would be propan-2-one (acetone) if we follow the IUPAC rules. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check. Butan-1-one would be (R)C=O where the carbonyl is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. But that's not possible because the carbonyl in a ketone must be between two carbons. Therefore, butan-1-one is not a valid name. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be butan-2-one. But the question says 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would be a ketone, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be butan-2-one. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think. If it's butan-1-one, that would imply the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's pentan-2-one. Wait, I'm confused. Let me check the IUPAC nomenclature. For ketones, the carbonyl group is assigned the lowest possible number. So the correct name for (CH3)2CO is propan-2-one (acetone). For a four-carbon chain, butan-2-one would be CH2CH2COCH3. Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which is actually cyclopropane something? Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Butan-2-one would be CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is on C2. But the compound in question is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1 of butan-1-one. But that would require the carbonyl to be at the end of the chain, which is not possible for a ketone. Therefore, this must be an error. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be butan-2-one. Alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group. Wait, but the suffix -one indicates a ketone. So if it's butan-1-one, that would imply a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's actually pentan-2-one. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for that would be pentan-2-one, not butan-1-one. Therefore, there's a mistake in the name. But assuming the name is correct as given, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons with the ketone on the first carbon. So the structure would be:

O=C-(CH2)3-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one. The carbonyl is on the first carbon of the butan chain, which is attached to the cyclopentyl group. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, two CH2 groups, and a methyl. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon in a ketone must be connected to two other carbons. So if the carbonyl is on C1 of butan-1-one, then the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the carbonyl carbon here is connected to cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

C1: O=C-

C2: CH2-

C3: CH2-

C4: CH3

But that's impossible because the ketone must be between two carbons. Therefore, the correct name must be butan-2-one. So perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one. In that case, the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3). But regardless of the structure, the key is whether there's a chiral center. Let's assume the correct structure. If the carbonyl is at position 1 (even though that's not possible), but let's proceed. The carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl, oxygen, and two other groups. Wait, no, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two alkyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. So if it's butan-1-one, the carbonyl would be at the end, which is not possible. Therefore, this compound's name is likely incorrect. But assuming the structure is cyclopentyl attached to a ketone carbon which is also attached to a 3-methylbutan chain, then the carbonyl carbon would have three substituents: cyclopentyl, a methyl, and another group. Wait, but ketone carbons are spÂ² hybridized and can't be chiral. Therefore, even if there were substituents, the carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center. So the possible chiral centers would be elsewhere. Let's see. The 3-methylbutan-1-one part: if it's CH(CH3)-CH2-C(O)-cyclopentyl, then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C3) would be CH2, which isn't a chiral center. The methyl is on C3, which is CH(CH3). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it again. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and the rest is a butan chain with a methyl on C3. So:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's five carbons. Wait, but butan is four carbons. So maybe:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. That would be butan-1-one: four carbons with the ketone on C1. But again, the carbonyl can't be on the first carbon. Therefore, this compound's name is likely incorrect, but assuming it's a typo and should be butan-2-one, then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3). In that case, the carbonyl carbon is C3, and the adjacent carbons are CH2-cyclopentyl and CH(CH3). The carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center. The other carbons: the CH2 connected to cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3) would be C2 and C4. The C2 (connected to cyclopentyl) is CH2, so not chiral. The C4 is CH(CH3), connected to C3 (carbonyl) and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's butan-2-one, the structure is CH2-cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Then the carbonyl is at C2, connected to cyclopentyl-CH2, and CH2-CH3. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. The other carbons: the cyclopentyl is attached to a CH2 which is attached to the carbonyl. That CH2 is not a chiral center. The CH2-CH3 is also not a chiral center. The methyl is on the end. So there are no chiral centers in this molecule. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

But wait, the actual structure might have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and assuming the name is correct, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's three carbons after the carbonyl, making it pentan-2-one. I'm really confused by the naming here. Regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. If the carbonyl is in a position where the adjacent carbons have four different groups, but since the carbonyl carbon is spÂ² hybridized, it can't be a chiral center. The other carbons: the cyclopentyl group is a ring, which might have symmetry. If the cyclopentyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ketone, then that carbon (the one attached to cyclopentyl) would be a CH2 group (if it's butan-2-one), which isn't a chiral center. Therefore, this compound likely has no chiral centers and is not optically active.

Now, going back to the first compound. Let's try again. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is but-1-ene (CH2=CHCH2CH3) with a chlorine on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting a chlorine on C1 (the first CH2) would make it Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2CH3). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try numbering. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So 1-chloro would be substituting Cl on C1. But C1 is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. If it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, then CH2, then CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 would give Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that would make the structure Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. But that's impossible because if there's a double bond between C1 and C2, then C1 can't have a CH2 group. Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me look up the structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The correct structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a methyl (from 2-methyl?), but wait, the 2-methyl would be on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, but that's four carbons. Let me write it as Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. So C1: Cl, C(CH3); C2: =CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2, with C1 having Cl and CH3, and C2 having CH2CH3. So the groups on each double bond carbon are: C1 has Cl and CH3, and C2 has CH2CH3 and H. Wait, but for a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. So C1 would be Cl, CH3, and the double bond to C2. C2 would be CH2CH3, H, and the double bond to C1. So the configuration is Z, meaning the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's look at C2. C2 is connected to the double bond (C1), a hydrogen, and a CH2CH3 group. But wait, C2 in this structure would have three substituents: CH2CH3, H, and the double bond. So it's not a chiral center. C1 has Cl, CH3, and the double bond. Also not a chiral center. The other carbons: C3 and C4 are part of CH2CH3, which are not chiral. Therefore, this compound does not have any chiral centers and thus is not optically active. Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of axial chirality or allenes? No, this is a simple alkene. So no, this compound is not optically active.

So summarizing:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers â not active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Multiple chiral centers, not meso â active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound â not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral centers, not meso â active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center â active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso â not active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers â not active.

So the active compounds are numbers 2, 4, 5. That's three compounds. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. We determined that C1 is a chiral center. But wait, in some cases, even if there's a chiral center, the molecule could be meso. But in this case, the cyclohexene ring with an -OH on C1 and a double bond at C3-C4, there's no plane of symmetry. So yes, it's chiral.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. All three hydroxyls are in the same configuration. Since 1,3,5 are symmetrically placed, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso. So not active.

Compound 7: No chiral centers, so not active.

So total active: 2, 4, 5. That's three. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-... The question is whether this is a meso compound. But given the descriptors 3aR and 7aS, which are different, and the E configuration, it's unlikely to be meso. So yes, it's active.

Compound 3: (2R,3S) is meso, so not active.

Compound 4: (2R,3R) is not meso, so active.

Compound 5: Active.

So that's three compounds. But wait, the answer might be four. Did I miss something?

Wait, let me check compound 5 again. If the cyclohexene ring has a plane of symmetry, then even with a chiral center, it could be meso. But in this case, the substituents are not symmetric. The double bond is at 3-ene, so the ring is not symmetric with respect to the alcohol on C1. Therefore, there's no internal plane of symmetry, so the compound is chiral. So yes, active.

So total of three compounds: 2,4,5. But wait, let me count again:

1. No

2. Yes

3. No

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. No

7. No

So that's three. But wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 5. Let me confirm. If the cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a chiral center at C1, then even if the rest of the ring is asymmetric, the molecule would be chiral. Yes. So three compounds.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, even with a chiral center, if there's a plane of symmetry elsewhere, the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, the ring has a double bond which breaks the symmetry. So I think compound 5 is active.

Therefore, the answer should be 3 compounds. But let me check again.

Wait, the answer might be four. Let me check compound 6 again. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration (s), but since they are at positions 1,3,5, which are symmetrically equivalent, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have three hydroxyls all axial, then there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring. Similarly, if all are equatorial. Therefore, this compound is meso and not optically active. So that's correct.

Compound 7: No chiral centers, so not active.

So total active: 2,4,5 â three compounds. But wait, the answer might be four. Let me check the first compound again. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. We determined no chiral centers. But maybe there's a different type of chirality, like axial chirality. Wait, axial chirality occurs in allenes or biphenyls with restricted rotation. This is a mono-olefin, so no axial chirality. Therefore, no. So three compounds.

Wait, but I'm now recalling that sometimes, even if there's a double bond with different substituents, the molecule can be chiral. But in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The groups on C1 are Cl and CH3, and on C2 are CH2CH3 and H. For the double bond to cause chirality, there needs to be different groups on each carbon. But even so, the molecule itself isn't chiral because there's no chiral center. The double bond's geometry (Z or E) doesn't impart optical activity; it's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So the first compound is not optically active.

Therefore, the total number is three. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people get confused between geometric and optical isomerism. But according to the rules, only compounds with chiral centers (and not meso) or other sources of chirality like helicenes are optically active. So three compounds: 2,4,5.

Wait, but let me check the answer choices. The user didn't provide options, but the answer should be a number. Let me confirm once more.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 4: Yes.

Compound 5: Yes.

That's three. But wait, maybe I missed compound 6. If compound 6 is not meso, then it would be active. Let me think again. For a cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all three hydroxyls in the same configuration (s), is it meso?

Imagine the cyclohexane ring in a chair conformation. If all three hydroxyls are axial (s configuration), then each is pointing up. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Similarly, if all are equatorial, there's also symmetry. Therefore, it's meso. So compound 6 is not active.

Therefore, the answer is three compounds.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. If a compound has a chiral center (or any kind of chirality) and isn't a meso compound, then it should be optically active. So, I need to check each compound for chiral centers, possible planes of symmetry, and whether any of them are meso compounds. Let's go through them one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a chlorine and a methyl group attached. Wait, but the double bond is at 1-ene, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should write the structure properly. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting at position 1 (the first carbon) with Cl and position 2 with a methyl. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me count the carbons. But-1-ene is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting at C1 (the left end) with Cl and C2 with a methyl. So maybe it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But wait, the positions might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that would be but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl on C1 (the first CH2) would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be substituting a hydrogen on C1 with Cl. So ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and a CH2 group, and C2 has a methyl and a CH2 group? Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be C1: Cl, C(CH3); C2: =CH2CH3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the substituents. The molecule is (Z)-configured. So the groups on each carbon of the double bond are arranged in a specific way. But regardless of the structure, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has Cl, a methyl (from position 2?), and two other groups. Wait, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then C1 is connected to Cl, the double bond (two substituents: the other carbon and another group), and maybe a methyl. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3. No, the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), but with a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, C1 would be Cl-CH2- and then double bond to C2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the presence of a double bond can lead to geometric isomerism (cis/trans or Z/E), but does that affect optical activity? Wait, no, geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism. Unless the molecule has a chiral center. So, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. If the double bond is at C1-C2, then the adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) are each connected to two groups. For a chiral center, we need four different groups. Let's take C2. If C2 is connected to a methyl, a hydrogen, and two carbons (from the double bond and the adjacent carbon), maybe. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups. Wait, no. Each carbon in a double bond has three substituents. For example, in CH2=CH2, each CH2 has two H and one CH2. But in this compound, C1 is Cl-CH2- and then double bond to C2, which is CH(CH3). Wait, maybe C2 has substituents: methyl, two from the double bond (C1 and C3), and a hydrogen. So substituents would be CH3, C1 (Cl-CH2-), C3 (maybe CH2?), and H. Are all four different? If C1 is Cl-CH2-, then C2 is connected to Cl-CH2 (via double bond), CH3, H, and CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two other groups. If the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a methyl (from 2-methyl?), and C2 has a methyl and another group. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should move on and come back to this one. Let me check the other compounds first.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a mouthful. The presence of stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) suggests that there are multiple stereocenters and possibly a double bond with E configuration. Since it's specified as (3aR,7aS,E), that means there are at least two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and an E double bond. So this compound has multiple chiral centers and thus is optically active unless it's a meso compound. But given the complexity of the structure, it's unlikely to be meso. So this one is probably optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters are at C2 and C3. If the configuration is R and S, respectively, then we need to check if this is a meso compound. For succinic acid derivatives, if the two stereocenters are opposite (R and S), and there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. Let's see. The molecule would have two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, with configurations R and S. If there's a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it would be meso. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has R and S configurations with a plane of symmetry. So in this case, (2R,3S) could be meso. Let me visualize. The molecule is HOOC-C(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH. If there's a plane of symmetry that swaps the two carboxylic acid groups and the two methyl groups, then it would be meso. Yes, because the two carboxylic acids are on either end, and the methyl groups are on C2 and C3. If the configurations are R and S, then the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it meso. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active.

# Anthropic completion

I need to analyze which of these compounds are optically active. To do this, I'll check each structure for chiral centers, possible symmetry planes, and whether any are meso compounds, since optical activity requires chirality without being a meso compound.

For the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, I'm trying to properly visualize the structure. But-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2, with a total of four carbons. With the Z configuration, 1-chloro and 2-methyl substituents, I need to determine if there's a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. In alkenes, the double-bonded carbons each have three substituents, so I need to analyze whether any other carbon in this molecule has four different groups attached. I'm finding it challenging to definitively determine the structure and chiral centers for this compound, so I'll move on for now.

The second compound, (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, immediately shows multiple stereocenters with the (3aR,7aS) notation and an E-configured double bond. The specific stereochemical descriptors indicate this is likely optically active. Given its complex structure, it's highly improbable that it's a meso compound, so this one is almost certainly optically active.

For the third compound, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, I'm looking at a succinic acid backbone (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) with methyl groups at positions 2 and 3. So the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH with stereodescriptors R at C2 and S at C3. This arrangement likely creates a meso compound with an internal plane of symmetry that exchanges the two carboxylic acid groups and the two methyl groups. Since meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters, this compound would not be optically active.

The fourth compound appears to be cut off in the text.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine how many of these compounds are optically active. To start, I'll remember that optical activity requires the presence of a chiral center and the absence of meso compounds. Hence, I'll examine each compound for chiral centers, potential planes of symmetry, and check for the meso nature. Let's go through them one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. At C1, there's chlorine and a methyl group. But since it's at 1-ene, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm overthinking it. But-1-ene is structured as CH2=CHCH2CH3. So when chlorinating the first carbon and adding a methyl at the second, I get Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Let's count the carbons again. But-1-ene involves four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So with the double bond between C1 and C2, C1 should have Cl and C2 a methyl group. The resulting structure might be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Okay, I'm confused; it might be Cl attached to C1 of the double bond. Thus, Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 could be a structure but that's not aligning. Or is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond correct? Maybe I need another approach. As the compound is (Z)-configured, the groups on the double bond are arranged in specific orientations. But how does all this relate to a chiral center? If C1 and C2 are double-bonded, C1 has Cl, a methyl (from position 2), and other groups. But a chiral center requires four distinct substituents, and this isn't the case here. Maybe revisiting from another angle is necessary.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. This name indicates multiple stereocenters due to its stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) and perhaps an E-configured double bond. With these stereocenters, it's likely to be optically active unless it's a meso compound, which seems improbable given the complexity. Thus, this compound is likely optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, so 2,3-dimethyl translates to HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. There are stereocenters at C2 and C3. With R and S configuration respectively, we must determine if it's a meso compound. If these stereocenters display a plane of symmetry characterizing a meso compound, it won't exhibit optical activity. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form with R and S configurations possesses symmetry. Analyzing, the carboxyl groups at the ends and the opposing methyl groups make this compound likely meso. Hence, this compound is not optically active.

Here, both stereocenters are R. So the configurations are both R. In this case, there\'s no plane of symmetry because both methyl groups are in the same configuration. Therefore, this would be a chiral compound with two chiral centers and no internal symmetry, so it should be optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is specified as R. So the alcohol is on a chiral center. Let\'s confirm. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The carbon 1 in cyclohexene would have the hydroxyl group and three other substituents: two CH2 groups and the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. Carbon 1 would be connected to carbon 6 and carbon 2, and the hydroxyl group. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at 3, the structure is such that carbons 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So carbon 1 is adjacent to carbon 6 and 2. So the substituents on carbon 1 would be: -OH, two CH2 groups (from carbons 6 and 2), and the ring. Wait, but actually, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring. So carbon 1 is connected to carbon 2 and carbon 6, and has the hydroxyl group. The ring is not flat, but in a chair conformation, but regardless, the question is whether carbon 1 is a chiral center. For that, it needs four different substituents. The substituents would be: -OH, the two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but in a ring, the two adjacent carbons are part of the ring structure. So maybe the substituents are: -OH, two CH2 groups (if the ring is in a chair), but actually, in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons adjacent to the double bond might have different substituents. Wait, perhaps the double bond at 3-4 would affect the substituents on carbon 1. Alternatively, maybe the ring\'s structure causes carbon 1 to have four different groups. Let me think. Carbon 1 has:\n\n- The hydroxyl group (-OH)\n- Carbon 2 (which is part of the ring, connected to C3)\n- Carbon 6 (which is part of the ring, connected to C5)\n- And the rest of the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and two hydrogens (except the double bond carbons). Wait, no. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so those two carbons each have one double bond and two single bonds (to C2 and C5 for C3, and to C4 and C5 for C4? Wait, no. Let me number the cyclohexene properly. Cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the double bond is between 3 and 4, then the structure is 1-2-3=4-5-6-1. So carbon 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Carbon 2 is connected to 1 and 3. Carbon 3 is connected to 2 and 4 (double bond). Carbon 4 is connected to 3 and 5. Carbon 5 is connected to 4 and 6. Carbon 6 is connected to 5 and 1. So carbon 1 has substituents: -OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring (except the double bond carbons) would have two hydrogens. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons not in the double bond have two hydrogens each, while the double bond carbons have one hydrogen each. So carbon 1 would have two hydrogens. Wait, but if there\'s a hydroxyl group on carbon 1, then the substituents would be: -OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? No, wait. Carbon 1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has the -OH group. So the substituents are: -OH, C2 (which is part of the ring), C6 (part of the ring), and a hydrogen. Wait, but C2 and C6 are both part of the ring. Are they considered the same substituent? No, because they are connected to different parts of the ring. So carbon 1 would have four different groups: -OH, the two adjacent ring carbons (which are in different positions), and a hydrogen. Wait, but if the ring is symmetric around carbon 1, maybe not. Wait, but the presence of the double bond at 3-4 would break some symmetry. Let me try to visualize. If the hydroxyl is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, then the substituents on carbon 1 are:\n\n- -OH\n- A bond to C2 (which is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond)\n- A bond to C6 (which is connected to C5, which is connected to C4, part of the double bond)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nBut since the double bond is in a specific position, the environment around C1 might not be symmetrical. Therefore, carbon 1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Since the configuration is specified as R, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the hydroxyls are at 1,3,5 positions and all are in the same configuration (s), but since cyclohexane is symmetric, let\'s see. If all three hydroxyls are axial or equatorial, but the configurations are all s. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each hydroxyl\'s configuration (R or S) depends on the arrangement. However, if all three are in the same configuration and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be a meso compound. For example, if the triol is 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane with all three hydroxyls in the same configuration, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think. If the hydroxyls are all in the axial positions, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are all equatorial, but given the numbering 1,3,5, which are every other carbon, forming a trigonal symmetry. In such a case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having multiple stereocenters. For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane; even if all methyls are in the same configuration, the molecule is achiral due to symmetry. Similarly, if the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be meso. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three stereocenters, but due to the symmetry of the molecule, it would be a meso compound and thus not optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (3-methylbutan-1-one) with a cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So 3-methylbutan-1-one would be (R)C(O)CH(CH3)CH2. Wait, no. Butan-1-one is pentan-2-one, actually. Wait, maybe I\'m getting confused. Let me clarify. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one part means the ketone is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl group replacing the first carbon\'s substituents. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible because the carbonyl group can\'t be on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain without being a carboxylic acid derivative. Wait, maybe it\'s a typo, but assuming the name is correct, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the ketone at position 1, which is possible if it\'s (cyclopentyl)(3-methylbutyl)ketone. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a butanone. So the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, which would be: O=C-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already double-bonded to oxygen, so it can only have two other substituents. Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a three-carbon chain. Wait, but the name is 3-methylbutan-1-one. Butan-1-one is actually not possible because the carbonyl would be at the end, which would require a hydrogen, making it an aldehyde. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps it\'s butan-2-one, which is methyl isobutyl ketone. But the name given is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me check the IUPAC nomenclature. The longest chain must include the carbonyl group. For butan-1-one, the carbonyl is on carbon 1, which would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that\'s actually pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butyrophenone? No, butyrophenone is phenylacetone. Wait, maybe the correct structure is that the ketone is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, which would require the structure to be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that\'s pentan-2-one. I think there\'s a mistake in the naming here. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the carbonyl is at position 1, making the structure cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the carbonyl carbon can only have two substituents (the cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain). Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can have two other substituents. So if it\'s butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at the end, so the structure would be O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, I\'m getting confused. Let me try to draw it again. The name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The suffix -one indicates a ketone. The position of the ketone is at carbon 1 of the butane chain. So the butane chain has four carbons, with the ketone at position 1. That would mean the structure is (cyclopentyl)-(3-methylbutan-1-yl) ketone. Wait, but butan-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but with the ketone at position 1, it\'s O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, I\'m not getting this right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a butane chain. So the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would be pentan-3-one with a cyclopentyl group. I\'m really confused here. Maybe the key point is whether the carbonyl carbon is a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it\'s spÂ² hybridized and can\'t be a chiral center because it only has three substituents. Therefore, the compound can\'t have a chiral center here. The rest of the chain: the 3-methylbutan-1-one. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then the chain is O=C-R, where R is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So R would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that\'s a three-carbon chain. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. The rest of the molecule: the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 part. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) would have substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and the carbonyl group. Wait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The CH(CH3) carbon has substituents: two CH2 groups (one from the carbonyl and one from CH2CH3), a methyl, and the rest. Wait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nSo the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C(CH3)) has substituents: two CH2 groups (one leading to CH2CH3 and one from the carbonyl), a methyl group, and the rest. Wait, no. Let\'s break it down:\n\nCarbonyl carbon: O=C-\n\nNext carbon: C(CH3) connected to the carbonyl and to CH2CH3.\n\nSo the C(CH3) has:\n\n- One bond to the carbonyl carbon (O=C-)\n- One bond to CH2CH3\n- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. The structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the CH(CH3) is the second carbon (since the carbonyl is first). So the second carbon has:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A hydrogen\n- The carbonyl group (O=C-)\n- The CH2CH3 group\n\nWait, so four different substituents: O=C-, CH3, H, and CH2CH3. Therefore, this carbon (the second one) is a chiral center. But wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The "3-methyl" refers to the third carbon in the butan chain. Let me count again. Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the four carbons are: 1 (O=C), 2, 3, 4. If it\'s 3-methyl, then the third carbon (CH2) has a methyl branch. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. That\'s 3-methylbutan-1-one. Then attaching a cyclopentyl group to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already part of the ketone. Wait, no, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which implies that the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the carbonyl carbon attached to cyclopentyl, a CH(CH3), and a CH2CH3. But the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can only have two substituents. Therefore, this structure is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is part of the butan chain. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the third carbon of the butanone. But the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which suggests the cyclopentyl is on carbon 1, which is the carbonyl carbon. But that\'s not possible because the carbonyl carbon can\'t have a substituent other than the oxygen and two carbons. Therefore, I think there\'s a mistake in the naming, but assuming the name is correct, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the cyclopentyl is a substituent on the carbonyl carbon. However, since the carbonyl carbon is spÂ² hybridized and can only have two substituents (the oxygen and one carbon), attaching a cyclopentyl group there would require the carbonyl carbon to have three substituents, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound might not exist, but assuming it\'s a typo and the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one or something else, but given the information, I have to work with the given name. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me think differently. If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the "1" refers to the position of the cyclopentyl group, not the ketone. Wait, no, the suffix -one indicates the ketone position. So the ketone is at position 1 of the butan chain, and the cyclopentyl is also at position 1. This is conflicting. Therefore, I think there\'s a mistake in the name, but for the sake of the problem, I\'ll assume that the compound is correctly named and that the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the only possible chiral center would be the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. If that carbon has four different substituents, then it\'s a chiral center. Let\'s see. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has:\n\n- Cyclopentyl-C(=O)- group (as one substituent via the carbonyl)\n- Methyl (CH3)\n- Hydrogen\n- CH2CH3\n\nWait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is O=C-R, where R is CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the R group is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. But the carbonyl carbon can\'t have two substituents (O and R). Therefore, this structure is impossible. Therefore, I think the correct structure must be different. Maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, if it\'s 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1 as well. But that\'s not possible. Alternatively, maybe the name is 1-(cyclopentyl)-3-methylbutan-2-one. In that case, the carbonyl is at position 2, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1. Then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3. In this case, the carbonyl is at position 2, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1. Then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (position 3) would be CH(CH3), which has substituents: CH3, two CH2 groups (from the cyclopentyl and the carbonyl), and the rest. Wait, no. If the structure is cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2, then the carbon next to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. But I\'m getting too confused. Let\'s try to focus on whether there\'s a chiral center. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then the adjacent carbon (position 2) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. If that carbon has four different groups, then it\'s a chiral center. But in the structure O=C-CH(CH3)CH2CH3, the CH(CH3) carbon is attached to:\n\n- O=C-\n- CH3\n- CH2CH3\n- Hydrogen\n\nWait, yes! So that carbon would have four different substituents: the carbonyl group (O=C-), a methyl group (CH3), a hydrogen, and a CH2CH3 group. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. But wait, the compound\'s name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is already double-bonded to oxygen, that\'s impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Let\'s say the structure is CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl, but that doesn\'t fit the name. I\'m stuck. Let\'s assume that the compound does not have any chiral centers because the carbonyl carbon can\'t be one, and the other carbons don\'t have four different groups. Alternatively, if there is a chiral center at the CH(CH3) position, then it would be optically active. But given the confusion in the structure, maybe this compound is not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is on the same carbon as the methyl, making that carbon have four different groups. I think I need to make a decision here. If the compound has a chiral center, then it\'s optically active. If not, then not. Given the confusion in the structure, but assuming the name is correct and the carbonyl is at position 1 with a cyclopentyl group attached (which is impossible), but perhaps the actual structure allows for a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the compound is not chiral. I\'ll tentatively say that this compound is not optically active because the possible chiral center is not present due to the structure\'s constraints. But I\'m not sure. This one is tricky.\n\nNow, going back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let\'s try again. The structure is but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure becomes ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 (the first CH2) would give ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, that can\'t be right. Let me write the structure properly. For but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Now, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and C(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and CHCH3. Wait, no. Let me try numbering:\n\n1   2   3   4\nCl-C-CH2-CH3\nBut with a double bond between 1 and 2. So Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)? No. Alternatively, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH3, double bond between C1 and C2, and then CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, looking at C2 (the one with the methyl), which is part of the double bond. The substituents on C2 would be: CH3, Cl (from C1), and two CH2 groups (from the double bond and the adjacent carbon). Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. So C1 (Cl) is double-bonded to C2 (CH3), and C2 is connected to CH2CH3. So C2\'s substituents are: CH3, Cl (via double bond), and CH2CH3. But since it\'s a double bond, the actual substituents are arranged differently. However, for chirality, we need a carbon with four different groups. In this case, C2 is part of a double bond and cannot be a chiral center. C1 is also part of the double bond. The other carbons (C3 and C4) are CH2 and CH3, which are not chiral. Therefore, this compound does not have any chiral centers and thus is not optically active. Wait, but wait. The compound has a double bond, which can have geometric isomerism (Z/E), but that doesn\'t contribute to optical activity. So the first compound is not optically active.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers â not active.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Multiple chiral centers â active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso â not active.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral centers, not meso â active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center â active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3-5-triol: Meso â not active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Assuming no chiral center â not active. But earlier analysis was conflicting. If the CH(CH3) is a chiral center, then it would be active. But given the confusion in the structure, maybe it\'s not. Let\'s say it\'s not active.\n\nSo total active compounds: 2, 4, 5 â three compounds. Wait, but let\'s check again.\n\nWait, compound 7: If the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is impossible. But if the structure is different and there is a chiral center, then it would be active. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is that compound 7 is not active. So total of three active compounds. But let me verify each again.\n\n1. No.\n\n2. Yes.\n\n3. No (meso).\n\n4. Yes.\n\n5. Yes.\n\n6. No (meso).\n\n7. No.\n\nSo that\'s three. But wait, the seventh compound: if the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and the carbonyl is at position 1, then the adjacent carbon (position 2) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. If that carbon has four different groups, then it\'s a chiral center. Let\'s say the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is O=C-, which is double-bonded, so the adjacent carbon is CH(CH3). The substituents on CH(CH3) would be:\n\n- O=C-cyclopentyl (from the left)\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- CH2CH3 (ethyl)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nWait, but the CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the groups would be:\n\n- The rest of the chain (CH2CH3)\n- Methyl (CH3)\n- The carbonyl group (O=C-cyclopentyl)\n- A hydrogen.\n\nYes, four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is optically active. So that adds one more, making it four active compounds. But earlier I thought the structure was impossible, but if we accept the name as given and assume the carbonyl carbon can have the cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, then the adjacent carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is active. So total active compounds: 2,4,5,7 â four.\n\nBut wait, the initial analysis of compound 7 was conflicting because of the carbonyl carbon\'s substituents, but if we accept that the structure is possible and the adjacent carbon is a chiral center, then it\'s active. So now the count is four.\n\nBut let me confirm again. The structure would be:\n\nCyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (O=C-), which is also attached to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it\'s spÂ² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The next carbon (CH(CH3)) has four different groups: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is optically active.\n\nSo revised count: 2,4,5,7 â four compounds.\n\nBut earlier I thought compound 7 might not be, but upon re-evaluation, it is. Therefore, the answer is four.\n\nWait, but let\'s check the original compounds again:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes.\n\n3. (2R,3S): Meso â No.\n\n4. (2R,3R): Yes.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso â No.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes.\n\nSo that\'s four compounds: 2,4,5,7.\n\nBut wait, the seventh compound\'s name might still be problematic. Let me check the IUPAC rules. The correct name for a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end would require the chain to be numbered such that the carbonyl is at the lowest possible number. However, butan-1-one is not a valid IUPAC name because the carbonyl cannot be at the end of a four-carbon chain; the smallest ketone is propanone (acetone). Butan-1-one would imply a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is actually pentan-2-one. Therefore, the name given is incorrect, but assuming the intended structure is as we discussed, then the compound is chiral. However, if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn\'t have a chiral center, then it\'s not. But since we have to work with the given names, and assuming the structure is as named (even if chemically impossible), then the adjacent carbon would be a chiral center, making it active. Therefore, the answer is four.\n\nBut I\'m still uncertain. Let me check another approach. For a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is spÂ² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The chirality would have to be elsewhere. In the case of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl. Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) has four different groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, it\'s a chiral center. Hence, optically active.\n\nTherefore, the total number is four. But I need to confirm once more.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. No\n\n2. Yes\n\n3. No\n\n4. Yes\n\n5. Yes\n\n6. No\n\n7. Yes\n\nTotal: 4.\n\nBut wait, the seventh compound\'s analysis depends on the structure. If the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn\'t have a chiral center, then it\'s not. But given the problem statement, we have to assume the name is correct. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444274, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7588, prompt_tokens=2146, total_tokens=9734, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the number of optically active compounds, we analyze each for chirality (presence of chiral centers or other elements of chirality) and whether they are meso compounds. Here's the breakdown:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   - No chiral centers. The double bond causes geometric isomerism (Z/E), but this does not confer optical activity.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   - Contains multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured double bond. No symmetry elements make it meso.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   - The (2R,3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   - Both stereocenters are R, resulting in no internal symmetry.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   - The cyclohexene ring with an -OH group at position 1 creates a chiral center (four distinct substituents).  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   - The symmetric arrangement of three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 creates a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   - The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2) has four distinct substituents (cyclopentyl, methyl, ethyl, and hydrogen), forming a chiral center.  
   **Optically active.**

**Total optically active compounds: 4**  
(Compounds 2, 4, 5, and 7)

**Answer:** \boxed{4}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

opund: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. So the configurations are both R. In this case, there's no plane of symmetry because both methyl groups are in the same configuration. Therefore, this would be a chiral compound with two chiral centers and no internal symmetry, so it should be optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is specified as R. So the alcohol is on a chiral center. Let's confirm. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The carbon 1 in cyclohexene would have the hydroxyl group and three other substituents: two CH2 groups and the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. Carbon 1 would be connected to carbon 6 and carbon 2, and the hydroxyl group. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at 3, the structure is such that carbons 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So carbon 1 is adjacent to carbon 6 and 2. So the substituents on carbon 1 would be: -OH, two CH2 groups (from carbons 6 and 2), and the ring. Wait, but actually, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring. So carbon 1 is connected to carbon 2 and carbon 6, and has the hydroxyl group. The ring is not flat, but in a chair conformation, but regardless, the question is whether carbon 1 is a chiral center. For that, it needs four different substituents. The substituents would be: -OH, the two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. Wait, but in a ring, the two adjacent carbons are part of the ring structure. So maybe the substituents are: -OH, two CH2 groups (if the ring is in a chair), but actually, in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons adjacent to the double bond might have different substituents. Wait, perhaps the double bond at 3-4 would affect the substituents on carbon 1. Alternatively, maybe the ring's structure causes carbon 1 to have four different groups. Let me think. Carbon 1 has:

- The hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Carbon 2 (which is part of the ring, connected to C3)
- Carbon 6 (which is part of the ring, connected to C5)
- And the rest of the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and two hydrogens (except the double bond carbons). Wait, no. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so those two carbons each have one double bond and two single bonds (to C2 and C5 for C3, and to C4 and C5 for C4? Wait, no. Let me number the cyclohexene properly. Cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the double bond is between 3 and 4, then the structure is 1-2-3=4-5-6-1. So carbon 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Carbon 2 is connected to 1 and 3. Carbon 3 is connected to 2 and 4 (double bond). Carbon 4 is connected to 3 and 5. Carbon 5 is connected to 4 and 6. Carbon 6 is connected to 5 and 1. So carbon 1 has substituents: -OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring (except the double bond carbons) would have two hydrogens. Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons not in the double bond have two hydrogens each, while the double bond carbons have one hydrogen each. So carbon 1 would have two hydrogens. Wait, but if there's a hydroxyl group on carbon 1, then the substituents would be: -OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? No, wait. Carbon 1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has the -OH group. So the substituents are: -OH, C2 (which is part of the ring), C6 (part of the ring), and a hydrogen. Wait, but C2 and C6 are both part of the ring. Are they considered the same substituent? No, because they are connected to different parts of the ring. So carbon 1 would have four different groups: -OH, the two adjacent ring carbons (which are in different positions), and a hydrogen. Wait, but if the ring is symmetric around carbon 1, maybe not. Wait, but the presence of the double bond at 3-4 would break some symmetry. Let me try to visualize. If the hydroxyl is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, then the substituents on carbon 1 are:

- -OH
- A bond to C2 (which is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond)
- A bond to C6 (which is connected to C5, which is connected to C4, part of the double bond)
- And a hydrogen.

But since the double bond is in a specific position, the environment around C1 might not be symmetrical. Therefore, carbon 1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Since the configuration is specified as R, this compound is chiral and optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If the hydroxyls are at 1,3,5 positions and all are in the same configuration (s), but since cyclohexane is symmetric, let's see. If all three hydroxyls are axial or equatorial, but the configurations are all s. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each hydroxyl's configuration (R or S) depends on the arrangement. However, if all three are in the same configuration and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be a meso compound. For example, if the triol is 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane with all three hydroxyls in the same configuration, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think. If the hydroxyls are all in the axial positions, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are all equatorial, but given the numbering 1,3,5, which are every other carbon, forming a trigonal symmetry. In such a case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having multiple stereocenters. For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane; even if all methyls are in the same configuration, the molecule is achiral due to symmetry. Similarly, if the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be meso. Therefore, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three stereocenters, but due to the symmetry of the molecule, it would be a meso compound and thus not optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (3-methylbutan-1-one) with a cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So 3-methylbutan-1-one would be (R)C(O)CH(CH3)CH2. Wait, no. Butan-1-one is pentan-2-one, actually. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one part means the ketone is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl group replacing the first carbon's substituents. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible because the carbonyl group can't be on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain without being a carboxylic acid derivative. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but assuming the name is correct, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the ketone at position 1, which is possible if it's (cyclopentyl)(3-methylbutyl)ketone. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a butanone. So the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, which would be: O=C-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already double-bonded to oxygen, so it can only have two other substituents. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a three-carbon chain. Wait, but the name is 3-methylbutan-1-one. Butan-1-one is actually not possible because the carbonyl would be at the end, which would require a hydrogen, making it an aldehyde. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps it's butan-2-one, which is methyl isobutyl ketone. But the name given is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me check the IUPAC nomenclature. The longest chain must include the carbonyl group. For butan-1-one, the carbonyl is on carbon 1, which would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's actually pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butyrophenone? No, butyrophenone is phenylacetone. Wait, maybe the correct structure is that the ketone is on the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, which would require the structure to be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's pentan-2-one. I think there's a mistake in the naming here. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the carbonyl is at position 1, making the structure cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the carbonyl carbon can only have two substituents (the cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain). Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can have two other substituents. So if it's butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at the end, so the structure would be O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it again. The name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The suffix -one indicates a ketone. The position of the ketone is at carbon 1 of the butane chain. So the butane chain has four carbons, with the ketone at position 1. That would mean the structure is (cyclopentyl)-(3-methylbutan-1-yl) ketone. Wait, but butan-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but with the ketone at position 1, it's O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is part of a butane chain. So the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would be pentan-3-one with a cyclopentyl group. I'm really confused here. Maybe the key point is whether the carbonyl carbon is a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's spÂ² hybridized and can't be a chiral center because it only has three substituents. Therefore, the compound can't have a chiral center here. The rest of the chain: the 3-methylbutan-1-one. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then the chain is O=C-R, where R is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So R would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is O=C- attached to cyclopentyl and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. The rest of the molecule: the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 part. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) would have substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and the carbonyl group. Wait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The CH(CH3) carbon has substituents: two CH2 groups (one from the carbonyl and one from CH2CH3), a methyl, and the rest. Wait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C(CH3)) has substituents: two CH2 groups (one leading to CH2CH3 and one from the carbonyl), a methyl group, and the rest. Wait, no. Let's break it down:

Carbonyl carbon: O=C-

Next carbon: C(CH3) connected to the carbonyl and to CH2CH3.

So the C(CH3) has:

- One bond to the carbonyl carbon (O=C-)
- One bond to CH2CH3
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. The structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the CH(CH3) is the second carbon (since the carbonyl is first). So the second carbon has:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen
- The carbonyl group (O=C-)
- The CH2CH3 group

Wait, so four different substituents: O=C-, CH3, H, and CH2CH3. Therefore, this carbon (the second one) is a chiral center. But wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The "3-methyl" refers to the third carbon in the butan chain. Let me count again. Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the four carbons are: 1 (O=C), 2, 3, 4. If it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon (CH2) has a methyl branch. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. That's 3-methylbutan-1-one. Then attaching a cyclopentyl group to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is already part of the ketone. Wait, no, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which implies that the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the carbonyl carbon attached to cyclopentyl, a CH(CH3), and a CH2CH3. But the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it can only have two substituents. Therefore, this structure is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is part of the butan chain. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the third carbon of the butanone. But the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which suggests the cyclopentyl is on carbon 1, which is the carbonyl carbon. But that's not possible because the carbonyl carbon can't have a substituent other than the oxygen and two carbons. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the naming, but assuming the name is correct, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, where the cyclopentyl is a substituent on the carbonyl carbon. However, since the carbonyl carbon is spÂ² hybridized and can only have two substituents (the oxygen and one carbon), attaching a cyclopentyl group there would require the carbonyl carbon to have three substituents, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound might not exist, but assuming it's a typo and the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one or something else, but given the information, I have to work with the given name. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me think differently. If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the "1" refers to the position of the cyclopentyl group, not the ketone. Wait, no, the suffix -one indicates the ketone position. So the ketone is at position 1 of the butan chain, and the cyclopentyl is also at position 1. This is conflicting. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the name, but for the sake of the problem, I'll assume that the compound is correctly named and that the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the only possible chiral center would be the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. If that carbon has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. Let's see. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has:

- Cyclopentyl-C(=O)- group (as one substituent via the carbonyl)
- Methyl (CH3)
- Hydrogen
- CH2CH3

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is O=C-R, where R is CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the R group is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. But the carbonyl carbon can't have two substituents (O and R). Therefore, this structure is impossible. Therefore, I think the correct structure must be different. Maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1 as well. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the name is 1-(cyclopentyl)-3-methylbutan-2-one. In that case, the carbonyl is at position 2, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1. Then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3. In this case, the carbonyl is at position 2, and the cyclopentyl is at position 1. Then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (position 3) would be CH(CH3), which has substituents: CH3, two CH2 groups (from the cyclopentyl and the carbonyl), and the rest. Wait, no. If the structure is cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2, then the carbon next to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. But I'm getting too confused. Let's try to focus on whether there's a chiral center. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then the adjacent carbon (position 2) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. If that carbon has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. But in the structure O=C-CH(CH3)CH2CH3, the CH(CH3) carbon is attached to:

- O=C-
- CH3
- CH2CH3
- Hydrogen

Wait, yes! So that carbon would have four different substituents: the carbonyl group (O=C-), a methyl group (CH3), a hydrogen, and a CH2CH3 group. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. But wait, the compound's name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is already double-bonded to oxygen, that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl, but that doesn't fit the name. I'm stuck. Let's assume that the compound does not have any chiral centers because the carbonyl carbon can't be one, and the other carbons don't have four different groups. Alternatively, if there is a chiral center at the CH(CH3) position, then it would be optically active. But given the confusion in the structure, maybe this compound is not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is on the same carbon as the methyl, making that carbon have four different groups. I think I need to make a decision here. If the compound has a chiral center, then it's optically active. If not, then not. Given the confusion in the structure, but assuming the name is correct and the carbonyl is at position 1 with a cyclopentyl group attached (which is impossible), but perhaps the actual structure allows for a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the compound is not chiral. I'll tentatively say that this compound is not optically active because the possible chiral center is not present due to the structure's constraints. But I'm not sure. This one is tricky.

Now, going back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's try again. The structure is but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure becomes ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 (the first CH2) would give ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, that can't be right. Let me write the structure properly. For but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Now, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and C(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and CHCH3. Wait, no. Let me try numbering:

1   2   3   4
Cl-C-CH2-CH3
But with a double bond between 1 and 2. So Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)? No. Alternatively, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH3, double bond between C1 and C2, and then CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, looking at C2 (the one with the methyl), which is part of the double bond. The substituents on C2 would be: CH3, Cl (from C1), and two CH2 groups (from the double bond and the adjacent carbon). Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. So C1 (Cl) is double-bonded to C2 (CH3), and C2 is connected to CH2CH3. So C2's substituents are: CH3, Cl (via double bond), and CH2CH3. But since it's a double bond, the actual substituents are arranged differently. However, for chirality, we need a carbon with four different groups. In this case, C2 is part of a double bond and cannot be a chiral center. C1 is also part of the double bond. The other carbons (C3 and C4) are CH2 and CH3, which are not chiral. Therefore, this compound does not have any chiral centers and thus is not optically active. Wait, but wait. The compound has a double bond, which can have geometric isomerism (Z/E), but that doesn't contribute to optical activity. So the first compound is not optically active.

So summarizing:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers â not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Multiple chiral centers â active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso â not active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral centers, not meso â active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center â active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3-5-triol: Meso â not active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Assuming no chiral center â not active. But earlier analysis was conflicting. If the CH(CH3) is a chiral center, then it would be active. But given the confusion in the structure, maybe it's not. Let's say it's not active.

So total active compounds: 2, 4, 5 â three compounds. Wait, but let's check again.

Wait, compound 7: If the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is impossible. But if the structure is different and there is a chiral center, then it would be active. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is that compound 7 is not active. So total of three active compounds. But let me verify each again.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No (meso).

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No (meso).

7. No.

So that's three. But wait, the seventh compound: if the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, and the carbonyl is at position 1, then the adjacent carbon (position 2) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. If that carbon has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Let's say the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The carbonyl carbon is O=C-, which is double-bonded, so the adjacent carbon is CH(CH3). The substituents on CH(CH3) would be:

- O=C-cyclopentyl (from the left)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH3 (ethyl)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but the CH(CH3) is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the groups would be:

- The rest of the chain (CH2CH3)
- Methyl (CH3)
- The carbonyl group (O=C-cyclopentyl)
- A hydrogen.

Yes, four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is optically active. So that adds one more, making it four active compounds. But earlier I thought the structure was impossible, but if we accept the name as given and assume the carbonyl carbon can have the cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, then the adjacent carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is active. So total active compounds: 2,4,5,7 â four.

But wait, the initial analysis of compound 7 was conflicting because of the carbonyl carbon's substituents, but if we accept that the structure is possible and the adjacent carbon is a chiral center, then it's active. So now the count is four.

But let me confirm again. The structure would be:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (O=C-), which is also attached to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's spÂ² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The next carbon (CH(CH3)) has four different groups: O=C-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, compound 7 is optically active.

So revised count: 2,4,5,7 â four compounds.

But earlier I thought compound 7 might not be, but upon re-evaluation, it is. Therefore, the answer is four.

Wait, but let's check the original compounds again:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes.

3. (2R,3S): Meso â No.

4. (2R,3R): Yes.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso â No.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes.

So that's four compounds: 2,4,5,7.

But wait, the seventh compound's name might still be problematic. Let me check the IUPAC rules. The correct name for a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end would require the chain to be numbered such that the carbonyl is at the lowest possible number. However, butan-1-one is not a valid IUPAC name because the carbonyl cannot be at the end of a four-carbon chain; the smallest ketone is propanone (acetone). Butan-1-one would imply a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is actually pentan-2-one. Therefore, the name given is incorrect, but assuming the intended structure is as we discussed, then the compound is chiral. However, if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then it's not. But since we have to work with the given names, and assuming the structure is as named (even if chemically impossible), then the adjacent carbon would be a chiral center, making it active. Therefore, the answer is four.

But I'm still uncertain. Let me check another approach. For a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is spÂ² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The chirality would have to be elsewhere. In the case of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl. Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) has four different groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Hence, optically active.

Therefore, the total number is four. But I need to confirm once more.

Final list:

1. No

2. Yes

3. No

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. No

7. Yes

Total: 4.

But wait, the seventh compound's analysis depends on the structure. If the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then it's not. But given the problem statement, we have to assume the name is correct. Therefore, the answer is 4.

Let me check again. The fourth is (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. This configuration would not have an internal plane of symmetry. The two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, both with R configuration. Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, this would be a chiral compound and thus optically active.\n\nThe fifth compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The R configuration at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (C1) suggests a chiral center. However, cyclohexene rings can sometimes have ring-flipping, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. The ring flip would not necessarily create a plane of symmetry here. The hydroxyl group is on C1, which is adjacent to the bridgehead. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituent at C1 (the hydroxyl) would have a certain configuration. If the ring is not planar and there's no internal symmetry, then the R configuration would make this compound chiral. However, I need to consider if the molecule has any symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring allows for a plane of symmetry through the hydroxyl group and the double bond, but given the specific positions (3-en-1-ol), I think there's no such symmetry. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\nThe sixth compound is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. All three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S). However, cyclohexane is a symmetric ring. If the substituents are at positions 1,3,5 and all are S, but the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry (since 1,3,5 are every other carbon in the six-membered ring), this might lead to a situation where the molecule is achiral. For example, if the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically, even with each being S, the overall molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are all axial or equatorial in a way that creates symmetry. In such a case, the molecule might be meso. However, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all three substituents in the same configuration (S) would not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but 1,3,5-triol in a chair conformation: if each OH is axial, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are equatorial, same thing. Since each substituent is in the same configuration (S), but the positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetrically equivalent. However, each stereocenter is S, so the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5, each S configuration, the molecule would have a three-fold rotational axis but no reflection symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. Wait, but wait, if the substituents are arranged such that each is a mirror image of the others, but since all are S, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. For a molecule to be achiral, it must have a plane of symmetry. If the three substituents are all S, but the positions are 1,3,5, which are spaced 120 degrees apart, then any plane passing through one substituent and the opposite position would not reflect the others. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is meso, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, another way: if the three stereocenters are all S, but the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it would be meso. For example, if there's a plane that reflects one OH to another. But in a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at 1,3,5, each S, the molecule's symmetry would depend on their spatial arrangement. If the three OH groups are all on the same face (like all axial or all equatorial), then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. However, if the substituents alternate up and down, but in this case, all are S, which would mean they are all in the same configuration. Wait, the configuration (1s,3s,5s) refers to the stereochemistry. If each of the three OH groups is in the S configuration, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral and optically active. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe in this case, the molecule is actually meso. For example, if there's a plane that can invert the configuration of some centers. But since all three are S, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Wait, maybe if the molecule has a plane that passes through one OH and the opposite carbon, but since the other two OHs are at 120 degrees, their configurations would not be mirrored. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. Hmm, but I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me check another approach. For a molecule with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the stereocenters mirror images of each other, then it's a meso compound. But in this case, all three stereocenters are S. If the molecule has a three-fold axis, but no planes of symmetry, then it's chiral. For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups in the same configuration. That molecule is chiral. Similarly, 1,3,5-triol with all S configurations would be chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\nThe seventh compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's analyze this. The structure is a butanone (3-methylbutan-1-one) with a cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, butan-1-one is actually (butanone is typically 2-butanone, but 1-butanone would be methyl propanal? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be propanal with a ketone at position 1. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible because a ketone requires two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would be R-C(=O)-R', but for a ketone, both R and R' need to be alkyl groups. But in butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at the first carbon, which would require the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, that's actually pentan-2-one, but I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name again. The parent chain is butanone, with the ketone at position 1. So the structure would be cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1), then the rest of the butanone chain. So the carbonyl is at position 1, making the structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's actually pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be (1-oxobutane-3-yl) group. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl, followed by a 3-methylbutyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)(3-methylbutyl)ketone. But regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center here. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The adjacent carbons: the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the one in the butanone part) would be the next carbon. Let's see: the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:\n\nO=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nSo the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the first carbon of the butanone) is the one with the cyclopentyl group and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 1, followed by three more carbons. But in this case, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon (position 1) are a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group. Wait, but butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nBut that's a five-carbon chain? Wait, maybe the butan-1-one is a four-carbon chain with the ketone at the first position, which is impossible because a ketone requires two R groups on the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is that the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, but that would require the carbonyl to be at the end, which is not possible for a ketone. Therefore, this might be a typo, but assuming the name is correct, perhaps it's a typo for butan-2-one. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the carbonyl at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group attached. However, that would make the carbonyl carbon have two substituents: cyclopentyl and a butyl group. But in any case, the key is whether there's a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon can't be chiral. The next carbon (the one in the butan chain) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Let's look at that carbon. The substituents would be: the carbonyl group (as part of the chain), a methyl group, and two CH2CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it:\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nWait, but that would make the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) as C(CH3)(CH2CH3)(CO-C5H9). Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the chain. Let me try again. The parent chain is butanone, so four carbons with the ketone at position 1. But that's impossible because the first carbon can't be a ketone. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be:\n\nCH2(CH2CH(CH3)2)CO?\n\nNo, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the correct IUPAC name would place the ketone in a valid position. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the ketone at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group. But again, the ketone at position 1 would require two substituents on the carbonyl carbon, which is possible if one is cyclopentyl and the other is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and to a CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. Wait, but that would make the carbonyl carbon connected to two alkyl groups, making it a ketone. So the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nNow, looking at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the one with the methyl group), which is CH(CH3). The substituents on this carbon would be:\n\n- The carbonyl group (as part of the chain, so connected to the cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain)\n- A methyl group (-CH3)\n- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the next carbon, which is CH2-CH3)\n\nWait, no. Let's break it down:\n\nThe carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (let's call it C2) is connected to:\n\n- C1 (the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to cyclopentyl and C2)\n- A methyl group (-CH3)\n- Two CH2 groups: one leading to C3 (CH2) and then to C4 (CH3)\n\nWait, no. The structure is:\n\nC5H9-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nSo C2 (the carbon next to carbonyl) is C(CH3)(CH2CH3)(CO-C5H9). Wait, but that would mean three substituents: CO-C5H9, CH3, and CH2CH3. Therefore, this carbon (C2) has three substituents: a methyl group, an ethyl group, and the carbonyl group. Wait, but that's only three groups. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is connected to:\n\n- The carbonyl group (C=O)\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- Two CH2 groups? No, the structure is:\n\nC5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nSo the C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C=O, then to CH2-CH3. Therefore, the substituents on C2 are:\n\n- C=O (from C1)\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- CH2CH3 (ethyl)\n- And the hydrogen (since it's a tetrahedral carbon)\n\nWait, but wait, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) would have four substituents: the carbonyl group (as part of the chain), a methyl group, an ethyl group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, the substituents are: CO-C5H9, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. But wait, that's four different groups. Therefore, this carbon (C2) is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and would be optically active. However, we need to check if there's any other chiral centers or if there's a plane of symmetry. The rest of the molecule is a cyclopentyl group and the ethyl group. The cyclopentyl group itself is a ring, which might not contribute to chirality unless it's substituted. Since the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl, and the rest of the chain has a chiral center at C2, this compound would be chiral and thus optically active. Wait, but wait, the substituents on C2 are: CO-C5H9 (which is a cyclopentyl ketone), CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Are these all different? The CO-C5H9 is a large group, CH3 is methyl, CH2CH3 is ethyl, and H. Yes, all four substituents are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the compound optically active. Therefore, this seventh compound is optically active.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CHCl-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 and C2 would be:\n\nC1: Cl and CH2CH(CH3)CH3 (since it's but-1-ene, the chain is four carbons). Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, no. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we have 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the chlorine is on C1, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and CH(CH3) groups, and C2 has CH2CH3 and the double bond. Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly:\n\nBut-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then:\n\nPosition 1 (the first carbon) is CH2Cl, but since the double bond is between C1 and C2, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's number the but-1-ene chain as C1=C2-C3-C4. Then, 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the substituents on C1: Cl and C(CH3)=CHCH3. But that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4. So:\n\nC1 (Cl)=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, looking at the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and the double bond to C2. On C2, the substituents are CH3, the double bond to C1, and CH2CH3. The configuration is Z, meaning the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. The priority on C1 would be Cl (higher than CH2CH3?), and on C2, the priority would be CH3 vs. CH2CH3. Wait, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:\n\nC1: Cl and CH2CH2CH3 (from the rest of the chain)\nC2: CH3 and CH2CH3\n\nWait, no. Let's assign priorities properly. For C1 (double bond between C1 and C2):\n\nOn C1, the substituents are Cl and the double bond to C2. The other two substituents would be two hydrogens (since it's a double bond). Wait, no. Wait, in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. For C1 in but-1-ene, the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (the rest of the chain), and a hydrogen. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to draw the structure again.\n\nBut-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2, the structure becomes Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2, with C1 having Cl and C(CH3), and C2 having CH3 and CH2CH3. But that's not possible because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be but-2-ene. I'm getting stuck here. Let's approach this differently. For a compound to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center. In alkenes, the double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center unless there's a carbon adjacent to the double bond with four different substituents. Let's consider the structure of (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a methyl group (from 2-methyl), and C2 has a methyl and the rest of the chain. Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-2-methylpropene, not butene. Hmm. Alternatively, but-1-ene is four carbons: C1=C2-C3-C4. Adding a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. Now, looking at the carbons adjacent to the double bond. C1 has Cl, C(CH3), and two hydrogens (since it's a double bond). Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has three substituents. For C1: Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. For C2: CH3, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. Wait, but this would make C1 have substituents Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond. But that's three substituents. Similarly for C2. However, neither of these carbons would have four different substituents, so they can't be chiral centers. Now, looking at the other carbons in the molecule. The C3 (CH) and C4 (CH3) in the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. C3 is CH, connected to C2 (double bond) and C4 (CH3). So C3 has two CH3 groups and a hydrogen. Not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers and thus is not optically active. However, I need to confirm. Wait, if the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3, then the carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) have substituents:\n\nC1: Cl, CH(CH3), and two hydrogens (since it's a double bond, each carbon has three groups: two from the double bond and one substituent). Wait, no. In a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. For C1: Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. For C2: CH3, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. Wait, but CH2CH3 would be if the chain is longer. I'm really confused here. Let me try to write the correct structure again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding a chlorine at C1 and a methyl at C2 would give Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2 in but-1-ene. So the correct structure would be Cl-C(=CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct IUPAC name would be 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene. The structure would then be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene, which would have the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3. Wait, but CH2CH3 would be three carbons, making it a pentene. I'm getting stuck here. Let's consider that maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. If there are no chiral centers, then it's not optically active. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center elsewhere. For example, the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Let's say the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the carbon adjacent to the double bond (C3) would be CH2CH3, which isn't a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is on C3. I'm really not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps this compound does not have a chiral center and is not optically active. Therefore, among the seven compounds, the ones that are optically active are:\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (yes)\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso, no)\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (yes)\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (yes)\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol (yes)\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one (yes)\n\nAnd the first compound (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene (no).\n\nSo that's 5 optically active compounds. Wait, but let's count again:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no (0)\n\n2. Yes (1)\n\n3. No (0)\n\n4. Yes (2)\n\n5. Yes (3)\n\n6. Yes (4)\n\n7. Yes (5)\n\nSo total of 5. But wait, the sixth compound, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: I'm still a bit unsure. If all three stereocenters are S, and the molecule has a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. However, in some cases, molecules with multiple stereocenters arranged symmetrically can be meso. For example, if there's a plane that inverts the configuration, but since all are S, that's not possible. Therefore, it's chiral. So yes, optically active.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 compounds.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444613, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6136, prompt_tokens=596, total_tokens=6732, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the number of optically active compounds, we analyze each for chirality, considering stereocenters, symmetry, and meso forms:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   The double bond carbons (C1 and C2) have three substituents each, but no carbon in the molecule has four distinct groups. **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   Multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured double bond. No symmetry planes. **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Internal plane of symmetry makes it a meso compound. **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Both stereocenters are R; no internal symmetry. **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:

$\boxed{5}$

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, the user listed seven compounds. Let me check again. The fourth is (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. This configuration would not have an internal plane of symmetry. The two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, both with R configuration. Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, this would be a chiral compound and thus optically active.

The fifth compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The R configuration at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (C1) suggests a chiral center. However, cyclohexene rings can sometimes have ring-flipping, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. The ring flip would not necessarily create a plane of symmetry here. The hydroxyl group is on C1, which is adjacent to the bridgehead. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituent at C1 (the hydroxyl) would have a certain configuration. If the ring is not planar and there's no internal symmetry, then the R configuration would make this compound chiral. However, I need to consider if the molecule has any symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring allows for a plane of symmetry through the hydroxyl group and the double bond, but given the specific positions (3-en-1-ol), I think there's no such symmetry. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

The sixth compound is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. All three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S). However, cyclohexane is a symmetric ring. If the substituents are at positions 1,3,5 and all are S, but the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry (since 1,3,5 are every other carbon in the six-membered ring), this might lead to a situation where the molecule is achiral. For example, if the three hydroxyls are arranged symmetrically, even with each being S, the overall molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are all axial or equatorial in a way that creates symmetry. In such a case, the molecule might be meso. However, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all three substituents in the same configuration (S) would not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but 1,3,5-triol in a chair conformation: if each OH is axial, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are equatorial, same thing. Since each substituent is in the same configuration (S), but the positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetrically equivalent. However, each stereocenter is S, so the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5, each S configuration, the molecule would have a three-fold rotational axis but no reflection symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. Wait, but wait, if the substituents are arranged such that each is a mirror image of the others, but since all are S, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. For a molecule to be achiral, it must have a plane of symmetry. If the three substituents are all S, but the positions are 1,3,5, which are spaced 120 degrees apart, then any plane passing through one substituent and the opposite position would not reflect the others. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is meso, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, another way: if the three stereocenters are all S, but the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it would be meso. For example, if there's a plane that reflects one OH to another. But in a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at 1,3,5, each S, the molecule's symmetry would depend on their spatial arrangement. If the three OH groups are all on the same face (like all axial or all equatorial), then the molecule would have a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral. However, if the substituents alternate up and down, but in this case, all are S, which would mean they are all in the same configuration. Wait, the configuration (1s,3s,5s) refers to the stereochemistry. If each of the three OH groups is in the S configuration, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral and optically active. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe in this case, the molecule is actually meso. For example, if there's a plane that can invert the configuration of some centers. But since all three are S, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Wait, maybe if the molecule has a plane that passes through one OH and the opposite carbon, but since the other two OHs are at 120 degrees, their configurations would not be mirrored. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. Hmm, but I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me check another approach. For a molecule with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the stereocenters mirror images of each other, then it's a meso compound. But in this case, all three stereocenters are S. If the molecule has a three-fold axis, but no planes of symmetry, then it's chiral. For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups in the same configuration. That molecule is chiral. Similarly, 1,3,5-triol with all S configurations would be chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

The seventh compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's analyze this. The structure is a butanone (3-methylbutan-1-one) with a cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, butan-1-one is actually (butanone is typically 2-butanone, but 1-butanone would be methyl propanal? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be propanal with a ketone at position 1. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible because a ketone requires two carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would be R-C(=O)-R', but for a ketone, both R and R' need to be alkyl groups. But in butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at the first carbon, which would require the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, that's actually pentan-2-one, but I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe the correct structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name again. The parent chain is butanone, with the ketone at position 1. So the structure would be cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1), then the rest of the butanone chain. So the carbonyl is at position 1, making the structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's actually pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be (1-oxobutane-3-yl) group. Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl, followed by a 3-methylbutyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)(3-methylbutyl)ketone. But regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center here. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The adjacent carbons: the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the one in the butanone part) would be the next carbon. Let's see: the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:

O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the first carbon of the butanone) is the one with the cyclopentyl group and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 1, followed by three more carbons. But in this case, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon (position 1) are a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group. Wait, but butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

But that's a five-carbon chain? Wait, maybe the butan-1-one is a four-carbon chain with the ketone at the first position, which is impossible because a ketone requires two R groups on the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is that the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, but that would require the carbonyl to be at the end, which is not possible for a ketone. Therefore, this might be a typo, but assuming the name is correct, perhaps it's a typo for butan-2-one. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the carbonyl at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group attached. However, that would make the carbonyl carbon have two substituents: cyclopentyl and a butyl group. But in any case, the key is whether there's a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon can't be chiral. The next carbon (the one in the butan chain) would be CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Let's look at that carbon. The substituents would be: the carbonyl group (as part of the chain), a methyl group, and two CH2CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it:

The structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, but that would make the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) as C(CH3)(CH2CH3)(CO-C5H9). Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the chain. Let me try again. The parent chain is butanone, so four carbons with the ketone at position 1. But that's impossible because the first carbon can't be a ketone. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be:

CH2(CH2CH(CH3)2)CO?

No, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the correct IUPAC name would place the ketone in a valid position. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the ketone at position 1, with a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group. But again, the ketone at position 1 would require two substituents on the carbonyl carbon, which is possible if one is cyclopentyl and the other is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to cyclopentyl and to a CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. Wait, but that would make the carbonyl carbon connected to two alkyl groups, making it a ketone. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Now, looking at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the one with the methyl group), which is CH(CH3). The substituents on this carbon would be:

- The carbonyl group (as part of the chain, so connected to the cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain)
- A methyl group (-CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the next carbon, which is CH2-CH3)

Wait, no. Let's break it down:

The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (let's call it C2) is connected to:

- C1 (the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to cyclopentyl and C2)
- A methyl group (-CH3)
- Two CH2 groups: one leading to C3 (CH2) and then to C4 (CH3)

Wait, no. The structure is:

C5H9-C(=O)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So C2 (the carbon next to carbonyl) is C(CH3)(CH2CH3)(CO-C5H9). Wait, but that would mean three substituents: CO-C5H9, CH3, and CH2CH3. Therefore, this carbon (C2) has three substituents: a methyl group, an ethyl group, and the carbonyl group. Wait, but that's only three groups. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is connected to:

- The carbonyl group (C=O)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups? No, the structure is:

C5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So the C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C=O, then to CH2-CH3. Therefore, the substituents on C2 are:

- C=O (from C1)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH3 (ethyl)
- And the hydrogen (since it's a tetrahedral carbon)

Wait, but wait, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) would have four substituents: the carbonyl group (as part of the chain), a methyl group, an ethyl group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, the substituents are: CO-C5H9, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. But wait, that's four different groups. Therefore, this carbon (C2) is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and would be optically active. However, we need to check if there's any other chiral centers or if there's a plane of symmetry. The rest of the molecule is a cyclopentyl group and the ethyl group. The cyclopentyl group itself is a ring, which might not contribute to chirality unless it's substituted. Since the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl, and the rest of the chain has a chiral center at C2, this compound would be chiral and thus optically active. Wait, but wait, the substituents on C2 are: CO-C5H9 (which is a cyclopentyl ketone), CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Are these all different? The CO-C5H9 is a large group, CH3 is methyl, CH2CH3 is ethyl, and H. Yes, all four substituents are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the compound optically active. Therefore, this seventh compound is optically active.

Now, let's go back to the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CHCl-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 and C2 would be:

C1: Cl and CH2CH(CH3)CH3 (since it's but-1-ene, the chain is four carbons). Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. Wait, no. Let me try again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we have 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the chlorine is on C1, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. But wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and CH(CH3) groups, and C2 has CH2CH3 and the double bond. Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly:

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then:

Position 1 (the first carbon) is CH2Cl, but since the double bond is between C1 and C2, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's number the but-1-ene chain as C1=C2-C3-C4. Then, 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the substituents on C1: Cl and C(CH3)=CHCH3. But that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4. So:

C1 (Cl)=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Now, looking at the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and the double bond to C2. On C2, the substituents are CH3, the double bond to C1, and CH2CH3. The configuration is Z, meaning the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. The priority on C1 would be Cl (higher than CH2CH3?), and on C2, the priority would be CH3 vs. CH2CH3. Wait, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

C1: Cl and CH2CH2CH3 (from the rest of the chain)
C2: CH3 and CH2CH3

Wait, no. Let's assign priorities properly. For C1 (double bond between C1 and C2):

On C1, the substituents are Cl and the double bond to C2. The other two substituents would be two hydrogens (since it's a double bond). Wait, no. Wait, in a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. For C1 in but-1-ene, the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (the rest of the chain), and a hydrogen. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to draw the structure again.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we add a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2, the structure becomes Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2, with C1 having Cl and C(CH3), and C2 having CH3 and CH2CH3. But that's not possible because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be but-2-ene. I'm getting stuck here. Let's approach this differently. For a compound to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center. In alkenes, the double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center unless there's a carbon adjacent to the double bond with four different substituents. Let's consider the structure of (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a methyl group (from 2-methyl), and C2 has a methyl and the rest of the chain. Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would be 1-chloro-2-methylpropene, not butene. Hmm. Alternatively, but-1-ene is four carbons: C1=C2-C3-C4. Adding a chlorine to C1 and a methyl to C2 would give Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. Now, looking at the carbons adjacent to the double bond. C1 has Cl, C(CH3), and two hydrogens (since it's a double bond). Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has three substituents. For C1: Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. For C2: CH3, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. Wait, but this would make C1 have substituents Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond. But that's three substituents. Similarly for C2. However, neither of these carbons would have four different substituents, so they can't be chiral centers. Now, looking at the other carbons in the molecule. The C3 (CH) and C4 (CH3) in the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. C3 is CH, connected to C2 (double bond) and C4 (CH3). So C3 has two CH3 groups and a hydrogen. Not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers and thus is not optically active. However, I need to confirm. Wait, if the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3, then the carbons adjacent to the double bond (C1 and C2) have substituents:

C1: Cl, CH(CH3), and two hydrogens (since it's a double bond, each carbon has three groups: two from the double bond and one substituent). Wait, no. In a double bond, each carbon has three substituents. For C1: Cl, CH(CH3), and the double bond to C2. For C2: CH3, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. Wait, but CH2CH3 would be if the chain is longer. I'm really confused here. Let me try to write the correct structure again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding a chlorine at C1 and a methyl at C2 would give Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2 in but-1-ene. So the correct structure would be Cl-C(=CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct IUPAC name would be 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene. The structure would then be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene, which would have the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH3 and CH2CH3. Wait, but CH2CH3 would be three carbons, making it a pentene. I'm getting stuck here. Let's consider that maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. If there are no chiral centers, then it's not optically active. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center elsewhere. For example, the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Let's say the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the carbon adjacent to the double bond (C3) would be CH2CH3, which isn't a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is on C3. I'm really not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps this compound does not have a chiral center and is not optically active. Therefore, among the seven compounds, the ones that are optically active are:

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (yes)

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso, no)

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (yes)

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (yes)

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol (yes)

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one (yes)

And the first compound (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene (no).

So that's 5 optically active compounds. Wait, but let's count again:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no (0)

2. Yes (1)

3. No (0)

4. Yes (2)

5. Yes (3)

6. Yes (4)

7. Yes (5)

So total of 5. But wait, the sixth compound, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: I'm still a bit unsure. If all three stereocenters are S, and the molecule has a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. However, in some cases, molecules with multiple stereocenters arranged symmetrically can be meso. For example, if there's a plane that inverts the configuration, but since all are S, that's not possible. Therefore, it's chiral. So yes, optically active.

Therefore, the answer is 5 compounds.

Here's the analysis for each compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond are arranged in a Z configuration, but there are no chiral centers. **Not optically active**.\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) indicate multiple stereocenters and an E-configured double bond. These stereocenters make the compound chiral. **Optically active**.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has stereocenters at C2 and C3. The R and S configurations create a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. **Not optically active**.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Both stereocenters (C2 and C3) are in the R configuration. There is no plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. **Optically active**.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The R configuration at C1 indicates a chiral center. The cyclohexene ring does not introduce a plane of symmetry. **Optically active**.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: All three hydroxyl groups are in the S configuration.

Here, both stereocenters are R. This would be the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) form. Since there's no internal plane of symmetry, this compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1. The R configuration indicates a chiral center at C1. However, cyclohexene rings can have ring puckering, but the presence of a double bond (at 3-en) might restrict some movement. If the cyclohexenol has a chiral center that isn't part of a plane of symmetry, then it's optically active. Since it's specified as R configuration, it's a single enantiomer, so it should be optically active.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. All three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S). However, cyclohexane is a symmetric molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, even with three stereocenters, it might be a meso compound. For example, if the three hydroxyls are in a trigonal symmetric arrangement, like 1,3,5-triol in a chair conformation, but since all are S configurations, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (all S) would have a three-fold axis of symmetry but not a plane of symmetry. However, if the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image via this symmetry, it might be achiral. Alternatively, if the three stereocenters are arranged such that each is a mirror image of the others, leading to internal compensation. But I'm not sure. Let me think. For example, in 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all R configurations, would that be chiral? If the molecule has a three-fold axis but no planes of symmetry, it can still be chiral. However, in some cases, even with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. But here, with three stereocenters, each adjacent to each other, but in a cyclohexane ring, maybe the symmetry is different. Wait, 1,3,5 positions are all axial positions. If all three hydroxyls are axial and in the same configuration (S), then rotating the molecule 120 degrees would map each OH to the next, but that's a rotational symmetry, not a reflection symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. But wait, if the three stereocenters are all S, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. However, in some cases, even with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a center of inversion, it could be achiral. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if each OH is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, making it chiral. Alternatively, if the three stereocenters are arranged in a way that the molecule is meso. But I'm not certain. Let me check an example. For example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and same configuration. If the substituents are all R, would that be chiral? Yes, because there's no plane of symmetry. So (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would be chiral and thus optically active. Wait, but the configuration is given as (1s,3s,5s). Wait, the descriptors are lowercase 's', which is unusual. Normally, stereodescriptors are uppercase R/S. Maybe that's a typo, but assuming it's (1S,3S,5S), then the molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are in positions 1,3,5 and all are S, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine a plane cutting through the cyclohexane ring between positions 2 and 6, and 4 and 8 (if numbered around), but in a six-membered ring, 1,3,5 are every other position. If you have three substituents in those positions, each S, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. If you have three substituents in a trigonal symmetry, but each is S, then the mirror image would require each to be R. Therefore, the molecule would not be superimposable on its mirror image, hence chiral. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso due to a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the three stereocenters are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can be divided into mirror images. But in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are on the same face (say, all axial up), then there's a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would be chiral. So, I think this compound is optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's analyze. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2C(O)CH2. Wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3C(O)CH3? No, butan-1-one is butanone, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, butan-1-one is actually methyl propan-2-one? Wait, no. Butanone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would be pentan-2-one? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify. The correct IUPAC name for butan-1-one is butan-1-one, which is actually not possible because the carbonyl group can't be at the first position of a four-carbon chain. Wait, that's a problem. Because for a ketone, the carbonyl group must be between two carbon atoms. Therefore, butanone can only be butan-2-one. Therefore, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is impossible. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of a butanone. Let me think again. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, which would require the structure to be O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would make the carbonyl at the first carbon, which is only possible if there's a carbon before it, but butan-1-one would have four carbons with the ketone at position 1, which is impossible. Therefore, this might be a typo, but assuming the structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, which would have the cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But in that case, the ketone carbon is attached to cyclopentyl, a methyl (from CH(CH3)), and two other carbons. Wait, but the ketone carbon (C=O) must have two alkyl groups. So if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the ketone is at position 1, which is possible if the chain is longer. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe the correct name is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, which would be O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound's name might be incorrect. However, regardless of the naming, let's focus on the structure. If the ketone is at a position where the carbonyl carbon is attached to the cyclopentyl group and a methyl branch, but the rest of the chain. The key point is whether there's a chiral center. The ketone carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The adjacent carbons: the carbon next to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: a methyl group, a CH2CH3, and the ketone group. Wait, but the ketone is on the adjacent carbon. Let me try to draw it:\n\nStructure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbonyl is at the second carbon (if the chain is considered as starting from the cyclopentyl). The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) has substituents: two CH2 groups (from the chain), a methyl, and the carbonyl. Wait, no. Let's count the substituents. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) would be attached to:\n\n- The carbonyl group (C=O)\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the cyclopentyl and one leading to the next CH2?)\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon (C1), which is the carbonyl carbon (C=O). Then, the next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), followed by C3 (CH2) and C4 (CH3). So the structure is:\n\nC5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. In this case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to cyclopentyl, oxygen, and two other carbons (C2 and perhaps another?), but wait, carbonyl carbons are only bonded to two other atoms (the oxygen and one carbon). Wait, no. The carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: the oxygen (double bond), and two other carbons. Wait, no. Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one oxygen. For example, (R2)C=O. So in this case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is bonded to the cyclopentyl group (R1) and another carbon (R2). So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Here, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3) group. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to oxygen. The next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), which is attached to:\n\n- The carbonyl carbon (C1)\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- Two CH2 groups (one leading to CH2-CH3)\n\nWait, no. The structure is:\n\nC5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the C2 (CH(CH3)) is attached to:\n\n- C1 (carbonyl)\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- CH2-CH3 (two carbons in a chain)\n\nWait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no. The C2 would have:\n\n- C1 (C=O)\n- CH3\n- CH2CH3\n\nWait, that's three substituents. So the C2 is CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). But that's only three groups. Wait, but every carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:\n\nC5H9-C(=O)-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)2. No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one part is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. But that's impossible because the first carbon can't be a carbonyl. Therefore, this must be a typo, and the correct name might be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one or something else. However, assuming the name is correct as given, perhaps the structure is such that there's a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. But butanone is three carbons with the ketone in the middle. So maybe the structure is cyclopentyl-(CH2)3-C(=O)-CH3. But that would be 4-cyclopentylpentan-2-one. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the ketone at the first carbon, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound's name might be incorrect, but regardless, the key point is whether it has a chiral center. If the structure is as intended, perhaps there's a chiral center at the 3-methyl position. Let's assume the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. The carbon adjacent to the ketone (C2) would be connected to C1 (C=O), a methyl group (CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me count the bonds again. The C1 (carbonyl) is connected to cyclopentyl, double bond to O, and C2. C2 is connected to C1, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups (C3 and C4). Wait, that can't be. Each carbon must have four bonds. If C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), a methyl, and two CH2 groups, that's four bonds. So C2 would be CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). But that would make C2 a chiral center if all four substituents are different. Let's check:\n\nC2 substituents:\n\n- C1 (C=O)\n- CH3\n- CH2CH3\n- What's the fourth? Wait, maybe I'm missing a hydrogen. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 (C=O) and CH2CH3. Wait, that's three substituents. Where's the fourth? Oh, no, the C2 would be:\n\nC1 (C=O) - C(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3)? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure properly.\n\nIf the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the formula would be:\n\nCyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-2-one. In that case, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But even then, the carbonyl is at position 2. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (position 3) would be CH(CH3). Let's check for chirality. The carbonyl carbon (C2) is not chiral. The C3 (CH(CH3)) is attached to:\n\n- C2 (C=O)\n- CH3\n- Two CH2 groups (C4 and C1?)\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let's approach it differently. If the compound is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group and a methyl branch, the key is whether there's a carbon with four different substituents. Suppose the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) has:\n\n- Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-\n- Methyl (CH3)\n- CH2-CH3\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, no. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon is connected to:\n\n1. The carbonyl group (C=O)\n2. A methyl group (CH3)\n3. A CH2CH3 group\n4. A hydrogen?\n\nBut that would make four different groups: C=O, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon would be a chiral center, making the compound optically active. However, if the structure is different, maybe there's no chiral center. But given the confusion in the name, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbon has two identical groups, then it's not chiral. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)2-CH2, then the carbon would have two methyl groups and not be chiral. But given the name 3-methyl, it's likely only one methyl. Therefore, this compound might have a chiral center and be optically active. But I'm not entirely confident due to the naming ambiguity. However, given the information, I'll tentatively say it's optically active.\n\nNow, summarizing:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers, so not active.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Multiple stereocenters, active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, not active.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral, active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Assuming chiral, active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: If structure has a chiral center, active. But earlier confusion about the name might mean no chiral center. Wait, if the name is correct, but the structure is impossible, perhaps it's a typo and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the structure is as intended, then maybe it's active. But given the uncertainty, perhaps this compound is not optically active. Wait, let's re-examine. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has four different groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Hence, optically active. But if the name is incorrect and the structure doesn't have that, then maybe not. But given the information, I'll assume it's active.\n\nSo total active compounds: 2,4,5,6,7. That's five. But wait, let's check again:\n\n1. Not active.\n2. Active.\n3. Not active.\n4. Active.\n5. Active.\n6. Active.\n7. Active.\n\nThat's five. But wait, the sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three stereocenters are S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. But in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, each S, would there be a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the cyclohexane in a chair. If all three OH groups are axial, then there's a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. If they are equatorial, same. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, it's active. So sixth is active. Seventh is active. So total of 2,4,5,6,7: five compounds. But wait, the seventh compound: if the structure is as I thought, then yes. But if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then no. But given the name as provided, I'll proceed.\n\nWait, but the seventh compound's name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the ketone is at position 1, which is impossible, then maybe the structure is different. For example, if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one, then the adjacent carbon would have different groups. But without knowing, it's hard. However, given the original answer choices, perhaps the seventh compound is not optically active. Let me think again. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has substituents: C(=O)-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, optically active. So yes, active. So total of five.\n\nBut wait, the sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If the configurations are all S, then the molecule is chiral. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's meso. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. But with three substituents, each in S configuration, it's possible that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. For example, if you have three S configurations, the mirror image would have three R configurations, which would be a different compound. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, active. So sixth is active.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 5. But let me check again each compound:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Correct. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH2CH(CH3), and the double bond. C2 has CH3, CH2Cl, and the double bond. No tetrahedral centers. So not active. Correct.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has multiple stereocenters and E configuration. Active. Correct.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two stereocenters are R and S, leading to internal compensation. Not active. Correct.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Both R, no symmetry. Active. Correct.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1. Active. Correct.\n\n6. (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: All S configurations. No plane of symmetry. Active. Correct.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Assuming the structure has a chiral center at C3 (CH(CH3)), then active. Correct.\n\nSo total of 5 compounds. But wait, the seventh compound's structure might not have a chiral center. Let me confirm. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) has groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in reality, the carbonyl carbon is connected to the cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3) group. The CH(CH3) group is connected to the carbonyl carbon, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? No, the CH(CH3) would be connected to the carbonyl carbon, a methyl, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nThen the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) is connected to:\n\n- The carbonyl carbon (C=O)\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A CH2CH3 group\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, no. The CH(CH3) group is:\n\nThe carbon has four bonds: one to the carbonyl carbon, one to methyl, and two to CH2 groups? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nSo the CH(CH3) is connected to:\n\n- C=O (from the cyclopentyl-C=O)\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- CH2-CH3 (ethyl group)\n- And a hydrogen?\n\nWait, no. The CH(CH3) would have:\n\n- One bond to C=O\n- One bond to CH3\n- One bond to CH2CH3\n- And one bond to a hydrogen?\n\nBut that would require four substituents: C=O, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Hence, optically active. Therefore, the seventh compound is active.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 5. But wait, the sixth compound: (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If the molecule has a three-fold axis but no planes of symmetry, it's chiral. Therefore, active. So yes, five compounds.\n\nBut I recall that sometimes, even with multiple stereocenters, if there's a plane of symmetry, it's meso. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and same configuration, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine a chair conformation with all three OH groups in axial positions. If you rotate the chair 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a plane of symmetry? If you have a plane that cuts through the ring, passing through opposite edges, would that plane reflect the molecule onto itself? For example, a vertical plane cutting through C1 and C4 (assuming numbering 1,3,5), then the OH groups at 1,3,5 would be mirrored. But since all are S configurations, their mirror images would be R, which are not present. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, active.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5. But let me check the original list again:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not active.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Active.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not active.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Active.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Active.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Active.\n\nTotal: 2,4,5,6,7 â 5 compounds.\n\nBut wait, the seventh compound's name might be incorrect, leading to a different structure. If the name is actually 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one, then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3). In that case, the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: CH2-cyclopentyl, C=O, CH3, and a hydrogen. That would be four different groups, making it a chiral center. Hence, active. So regardless of the position, if there's a CH(CH3) next to the ketone, it's active. Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\nBut I need to confirm once more. The seventh compound's name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the ketone is at position 1 of butanone, which is impossible, then the structure might be different. However, in practice, such a name would likely be considered incorrect, and the actual structure would have the ketone in a valid position. Assuming the name is a mistake and the intended structure has the ketone at position 2, then the compound would have a chiral center. Therefore, the answer remains 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444890, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6678, prompt_tokens=833, total_tokens=7511, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers and the absence of internal planes of symmetry (meso compounds). Here's the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond are arranged in a Z configuration, but there are no chiral centers. **Not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS,E) indicate multiple stereocenters and an E-configured double bond. These stereocenters make the compound chiral. **Optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has stereocenters at C2 and C3. The R and S configurations create a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. **Not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Both stereocenters (C2 and C3) are in the R configuration. There is no plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. **Optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The R configuration at C1 indicates a chiral center. The cyclohexene ring does not introduce a plane of symmetry. **Optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: All three hydroxyl groups are in the S configuration. The molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry but no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. **Optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure likely has a chiral center at the carbon adjacent to the ketone group (CH(CH3)) with four different substituents. **Optically active**.

Summarizing the optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 

\boxed{5}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters are R. This would be the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) form. Since there's no internal plane of symmetry, this compound is chiral and thus optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1. The R configuration indicates a chiral center at C1. However, cyclohexene rings can have ring puckering, but the presence of a double bond (at 3-en) might restrict some movement. If the cyclohexenol has a chiral center that isn't part of a plane of symmetry, then it's optically active. Since it's specified as R configuration, it's a single enantiomer, so it should be optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. All three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all S). However, cyclohexane is a symmetric molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, even with three stereocenters, it might be a meso compound. For example, if the three hydroxyls are in a trigonal symmetric arrangement, like 1,3,5-triol in a chair conformation, but since all are S configurations, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all substituents in the same configuration (all S) would have a three-fold axis of symmetry but not a plane of symmetry. However, if the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image via this symmetry, it might be achiral. Alternatively, if the three stereocenters are arranged such that each is a mirror image of the others, leading to internal compensation. But I'm not sure. Let me think. For example, in 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all R configurations, would that be chiral? If the molecule has a three-fold axis but no planes of symmetry, it can still be chiral. However, in some cases, even with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. But here, with three stereocenters, each adjacent to each other, but in a cyclohexane ring, maybe the symmetry is different. Wait, 1,3,5 positions are all axial positions. If all three hydroxyls are axial and in the same configuration (S), then rotating the molecule 120 degrees would map each OH to the next, but that's a rotational symmetry, not a reflection symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral. But wait, if the three stereocenters are all S, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. However, in some cases, even with multiple stereocenters, if the molecule has a center of inversion, it could be achiral. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if each OH is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, making it chiral. Alternatively, if the three stereocenters are arranged in a way that the molecule is meso. But I'm not certain. Let me check an example. For example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and same configuration. If the substituents are all R, would that be chiral? Yes, because there's no plane of symmetry. So (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would be chiral and thus optically active. Wait, but the configuration is given as (1s,3s,5s). Wait, the descriptors are lowercase 's', which is unusual. Normally, stereodescriptors are uppercase R/S. Maybe that's a typo, but assuming it's (1S,3S,5S), then the molecule would be chiral. However, if the substituents are in positions 1,3,5 and all are S, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine a plane cutting through the cyclohexane ring between positions 2 and 6, and 4 and 8 (if numbered around), but in a six-membered ring, 1,3,5 are every other position. If you have three substituents in those positions, each S, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. If you have three substituents in a trigonal symmetry, but each is S, then the mirror image would require each to be R. Therefore, the molecule would not be superimposable on its mirror image, hence chiral. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso due to a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the three stereocenters are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can be divided into mirror images. But in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if all substituents are on the same face (say, all axial up), then there's a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would be chiral. So, I think this compound is optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's analyze. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2C(O)CH2. Wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3C(O)CH3? No, butan-1-one is butanone, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, butan-1-one is actually methyl propan-2-one? Wait, no. Butanone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would be pentan-2-one? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify. The correct IUPAC name for butan-1-one is butan-1-one, which is actually not possible because the carbonyl group can't be at the first position of a four-carbon chain. Wait, that's a problem. Because for a ketone, the carbonyl group must be between two carbon atoms. Therefore, butanone can only be butan-2-one. Therefore, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is impossible. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of a butanone. Let me think again. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1, which would require the structure to be O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that would make the carbonyl at the first carbon, which is only possible if there's a carbon before it, but butan-1-one would have four carbons with the ketone at position 1, which is impossible. Therefore, this might be a typo, but assuming the structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, which would have the cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But in that case, the ketone carbon is attached to cyclopentyl, a methyl (from CH(CH3)), and two other carbons. Wait, but the ketone carbon (C=O) must have two alkyl groups. So if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the ketone is at position 1, which is possible if the chain is longer. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe the correct name is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, which would be O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the carbonyl is at position 1 of a four-carbon chain, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound's name might be incorrect. However, regardless of the naming, let's focus on the structure. If the ketone is at a position where the carbonyl carbon is attached to the cyclopentyl group and a methyl branch, but the rest of the chain. The key point is whether there's a chiral center. The ketone carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. The adjacent carbons: the carbon next to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: a methyl group, a CH2CH3, and the ketone group. Wait, but the ketone is on the adjacent carbon. Let me try to draw it:

Structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbonyl is at the second carbon (if the chain is considered as starting from the cyclopentyl). The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (CH(CH3)) has substituents: two CH2 groups (from the chain), a methyl, and the carbonyl. Wait, no. Let's count the substituents. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) would be attached to:

- The carbonyl group (C=O)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the cyclopentyl and one leading to the next CH2?)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon (C1), which is the carbonyl carbon (C=O). Then, the next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), followed by C3 (CH2) and C4 (CH3). So the structure is:

C5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. In this case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to cyclopentyl, oxygen, and two other carbons (C2 and perhaps another?), but wait, carbonyl carbons are only bonded to two other atoms (the oxygen and one carbon). Wait, no. The carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: the oxygen (double bond), and two other carbons. Wait, no. Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one oxygen. For example, (R2)C=O. So in this case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is bonded to the cyclopentyl group (R1) and another carbon (R2). So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Here, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3) group. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to oxygen. The next carbon (C2) is CH(CH3), which is attached to:

- The carbonyl carbon (C1)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to CH2-CH3)

Wait, no. The structure is:

C5H9-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the C2 (CH(CH3)) is attached to:

- C1 (carbonyl)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2-CH3 (two carbons in a chain)

Wait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no. The C2 would have:

- C1 (C=O)
- CH3
- CH2CH3

Wait, that's three substituents. So the C2 is CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). But that's only three groups. Wait, but every carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

C5H9-C(=O)-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)2. No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one part is four carbons with the ketone at position 1. But that's impossible because the first carbon can't be a carbonyl. Therefore, this must be a typo, and the correct name might be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one or something else. However, assuming the name is correct as given, perhaps the structure is such that there's a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. But butanone is three carbons with the ketone in the middle. So maybe the structure is cyclopentyl-(CH2)3-C(=O)-CH3. But that would be 4-cyclopentylpentan-2-one. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would have the ketone at the first carbon, which is impossible. Therefore, this compound's name might be incorrect, but regardless, the key point is whether it has a chiral center. If the structure is as intended, perhaps there's a chiral center at the 3-methyl position. Let's assume the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. The carbon adjacent to the ketone (C2) would be connected to C1 (C=O), a methyl group (CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me count the bonds again. The C1 (carbonyl) is connected to cyclopentyl, double bond to O, and C2. C2 is connected to C1, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups (C3 and C4). Wait, that can't be. Each carbon must have four bonds. If C2 is connected to C1 (C=O), a methyl, and two CH2 groups, that's four bonds. So C2 would be CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). But that would make C2 a chiral center if all four substituents are different. Let's check:

C2 substituents:

- C1 (C=O)
- CH3
- CH2CH3
- What's the fourth? Wait, maybe I'm missing a hydrogen. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 (C=O) and CH2CH3. Wait, that's three substituents. Where's the fourth? Oh, no, the C2 would be:

C1 (C=O) - C(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3)? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure properly.

If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the formula would be:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-2-one. In that case, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2. But even then, the carbonyl is at position 2. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (position 3) would be CH(CH3). Let's check for chirality. The carbonyl carbon (C2) is not chiral. The C3 (CH(CH3)) is attached to:

- C2 (C=O)
- CH3
- Two CH2 groups (C4 and C1?)

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's approach it differently. If the compound is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group and a methyl branch, the key is whether there's a carbon with four different substituents. Suppose the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) has:

- Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-
- Methyl (CH3)
- CH2-CH3
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon is connected to:

1. The carbonyl group (C=O)
2. A methyl group (CH3)
3. A CH2CH3 group
4. A hydrogen?

But that would make four different groups: C=O, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon would be a chiral center, making the compound optically active. However, if the structure is different, maybe there's no chiral center. But given the confusion in the name, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbon has two identical groups, then it's not chiral. For example, if the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-C(CH3)2-CH2, then the carbon would have two methyl groups and not be chiral. But given the name 3-methyl, it's likely only one methyl. Therefore, this compound might have a chiral center and be optically active. But I'm not entirely confident due to the naming ambiguity. However, given the information, I'll tentatively say it's optically active.

Now, summarizing:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers, so not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Multiple stereocenters, active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, not active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral, active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Assuming chiral, active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: If structure has a chiral center, active. But earlier confusion about the name might mean no chiral center. Wait, if the name is correct, but the structure is impossible, perhaps it's a typo and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the structure is as intended, then maybe it's active. But given the uncertainty, perhaps this compound is not optically active. Wait, let's re-examine. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has four different groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. Hence, optically active. But if the name is incorrect and the structure doesn't have that, then maybe not. But given the information, I'll assume it's active.

So total active compounds: 2,4,5,6,7. That's five. But wait, let's check again:

1. Not active.
2. Active.
3. Not active.
4. Active.
5. Active.
6. Active.
7. Active.

That's five. But wait, the sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three stereocenters are S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. But in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, each S, would there be a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the cyclohexane in a chair. If all three OH groups are axial, then there's a three-fold axis but no plane of symmetry. If they are equatorial, same. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, it's active. So sixth is active. Seventh is active. So total of 2,4,5,6,7: five compounds. But wait, the seventh compound: if the structure is as I thought, then yes. But if the name is incorrect and the actual structure doesn't have a chiral center, then no. But given the name as provided, I'll proceed.

Wait, but the seventh compound's name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the ketone is at position 1, which is impossible, then maybe the structure is different. For example, if it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylpentan-2-one, then the adjacent carbon would have different groups. But without knowing, it's hard. However, given the original answer choices, perhaps the seventh compound is not optically active. Let me think again. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the CH(CH3) carbon has substituents: C(=O)-cyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, optically active. So yes, active. So total of five.

But wait, the sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If the configurations are all S, then the molecule is chiral. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's meso. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. But with three substituents, each in S configuration, it's possible that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. For example, if you have three S configurations, the mirror image would have three R configurations, which would be a different compound. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, active. So sixth is active.

Therefore, the total number is 5. But let me check again each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Correct. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, CH2CH(CH3), and the double bond. C2 has CH3, CH2Cl, and the double bond. No tetrahedral centers. So not active. Correct.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has multiple stereocenters and E configuration. Active. Correct.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two stereocenters are R and S, leading to internal compensation. Not active. Correct.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Both R, no symmetry. Active. Correct.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1. Active. Correct.

6. (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: All S configurations. No plane of symmetry. Active. Correct.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Assuming the structure has a chiral center at C3 (CH(CH3)), then active. Correct.

So total of 5 compounds. But wait, the seventh compound's structure might not have a chiral center. Let me confirm. If the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) has groups: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-, CH3, CH2CH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in reality, the carbonyl carbon is connected to the cyclopentyl and the CH(CH3) group. The CH(CH3) group is connected to the carbonyl carbon, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? No, the CH(CH3) would be connected to the carbonyl carbon, a methyl, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH(CH3)) is connected to:

- The carbonyl carbon (C=O)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- A CH2CH3 group
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) group is:

The carbon has four bonds: one to the carbonyl carbon, one to methyl, and two to CH2 groups? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So the CH(CH3) is connected to:

- C=O (from the cyclopentyl-C=O)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2-CH3 (ethyl group)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) would have:

- One bond to C=O
- One bond to CH3
- One bond to CH2CH3
- And one bond to a hydrogen?

But that would require four substituents: C=O, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Therefore, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Hence, optically active. Therefore, the seventh compound is active.

Therefore, the total number is 5. But wait, the sixth compound: (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If the molecule has a three-fold axis but no planes of symmetry, it's chiral. Therefore, active. So yes, five compounds.

But I recall that sometimes, even with multiple stereocenters, if there's a plane of symmetry, it's meso. For example, in 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same and same configuration, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine a chair conformation with all three OH groups in axial positions. If you rotate the chair 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a plane of symmetry? If you have a plane that cuts through the ring, passing through opposite edges, would that plane reflect the molecule onto itself? For example, a vertical plane cutting through C1 and C4 (assuming numbering 1,3,5), then the OH groups at 1,3,5 would be mirrored. But since all are S configurations, their mirror images would be R, which are not present. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Hence, active.

Therefore, the answer is 5. But let me check the original list again:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Active.

Total: 2,4,5,6,7 â 5 compounds.

But wait, the seventh compound's name might be incorrect, leading to a different structure. If the name is actually 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one, then the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3). In that case, the carbon adjacent to the ketone (CH(CH3)) would have substituents: CH2-cyclopentyl, C=O, CH3, and a hydrogen. That would be four different groups, making it a chiral center. Hence, active. So regardless of the position, if there's a CH(CH3) next to the ketone, it's active. Therefore, the answer is 5.

But I need to confirm once more. The seventh compound's name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If the ketone is at position 1 of butanone, which is impossible, then the structure might be different. However, in practice, such a name would likely be considered incorrect, and the actual structure would have the ketone in a valid position. Assuming the name is a mistake and the intended structure has the ketone at position 2, then the compound would have a chiral center. Therefore, the answer remains 5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
