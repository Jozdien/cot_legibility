# Original Question

Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$. Here, $\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?

To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by noting that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\) when projected along any unit vector. 

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) can be written as \( n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \). For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\). This can be shown by considering the property of Pauli matrices: \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues \(\lambda\) of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) must satisfy \(\lambda^2 = 1\), leading to \(\lambda = \pm 1\).

Since the Hamiltonian \(H\) is \(\varepsilon\) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To verify, consider specific cases such as \(\vec{n}\) along the x, y, or z-axis. In each case, the corresponding Pauli matrix (e.g., \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\), leading to the same result when scaled by \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Hmm, eigenvalues of Pauli matrices... I remember that Pauli matrices are related to spin-1/2 systems. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1/2, but maybe here it's scaled by ε. Wait, the Hamiltonian is given as ε times the dot product of σ and n. Let me think.

First, the Pauli vector σ is (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), and n is a unit vector (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Then H is ε times that sum. To find the eigenvalues of H, I need to diagonalize this matrix. But maybe there's a smarter way than computing the characteristic polynomial.

I recall that for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because the Pauli matrices are spin operators, and the component of spin in any direction can only be ±ℏ/2, but here we might be working in units where those constants are absorbed. Wait, actually, the eigenvalues of σ · n should be ±1 because the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Let me check that.

Take for example, if n is along the z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then σ · n = σ_z, which is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and its eigenvalues are indeed 1 and -1. Similarly, if n is along x or y, the eigenvalues are still ±1. So in general, for any direction n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, when we multiply by ε, the eigenvalues of H = ε σ · n should be ε * (±1) = ±ε. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

But wait, let me verify this more carefully. Suppose we have a general unit vector n. Let's parametrize it in spherical coordinates: n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Then σ · n would be:

sinθ cosφ σ_x + sinθ sinφ σ_y + cosθ σ_z

Which in matrix form is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ (cosφ - i sinφ) ],
  [sinθ (cosφ + i sinφ), -cosθ ] ]

Simplifying the off-diagonal terms using Euler's formula: cosφ - i sinφ = e^{-iφ}, and cosφ + i sinφ = e^{iφ}. So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ} ],
  [sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, we compute the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But H here is ε times this matrix. Wait, actually, H = ε (σ · n), so the matrix is ε multiplied by the above matrix. So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H has eigenvalues ±ε. Therefore, regardless of the direction n, the eigenvalues are ±ε. 

Alternatively, another approach: the Pauli matrices satisfy (σ · a)(σ · b) = a · b I + i σ · (a × b). So if we take (σ · n)^2, since n is a unit vector, this becomes (n · n) I + i σ · (n × n) = I + 0 = I. Therefore, (σ · n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = ε σ · n are ε * (±1) = ±ε. 

Yes, that seems to confirm it. So regardless of the direction of n, as long as it's a unit vector, the eigenvalues are ±ε. Therefore, the answer should be that the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. 

But just to be thorough, let me consider a specific example. Suppose n is in the x-direction. Then σ · n = σ_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenvalues of σ_x are found by solving det(σ_x - λI) = 0:

| -λ    1    |
| 1   -λ |  = λ^2 - 1 = 0 → λ = ±1. So eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Multiply by ε, get ±ε.

Similarly, if n is in some arbitrary direction, say θ = 45 degrees, φ = 45 degrees. Then n would have components (sin45 cos45, sin45 sin45, cos45). But regardless, when we compute the eigenvalues, they should still be ±1 for σ · n, hence ±ε for H. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the eigenvalues of H are ε and -ε. 

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by noting that the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) each have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is given by \(n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\).

For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) can be diagonalized. The key insight is that the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), regardless of the direction of \(\vec{n}\). This is because the Pauli matrices are components of a vector operator, and the projection of this operator onto any unit vector \(\vec{n}\) results in eigenvalues corresponding to the spin-1/2 system, which are \(\pm 1\).

To verify this, consider the characteristic equation for the matrix \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). For a general unit vector \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta \cos\phi, \sin\theta \sin\phi, \cos\theta)\), the matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta e^{-i\phi} \\
\sin\theta e^{i\phi} & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The characteristic polynomial is found by solving \(\det(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta - \lambda & \sin\theta e^{-i\phi} \\
\sin\theta e^{i\phi} & -\cos\theta - \lambda
\end{bmatrix} = 0
\]
Calculating the determinant:
\[
(\cos\theta - \lambda)(-\cos\theta - \lambda) - (\sin\theta e^{-i\phi})(\sin\theta e^{i\phi}) = 0
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-\cos^2\theta + \lambda^2 - \sin^2\theta = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm 1
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\). Multiplying by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

σ · n = [ [cosθ, sinθ (cosφ - i sinφ) ],
           [sinθ (cosφ + i sinφ), -cosθ ] ]

Simplifying the off-diagonal terms using Euler's formula: cosφ - i sinφ = e^{-iφ}, and cosφ + i sinφ = e^{iφ}. So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ} ],
  [sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, we compute the characteristic equation det(σ · n - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ e^{-iφ})(sinθ e^{iφ}) = 0

Calculating the first term: (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² = -cos²θ + λ²

The second term: sin²θ e^{-iφ} e^{iφ} = sin²θ (1) = sin²θ

So the determinant equation becomes: (-cos²θ + λ²) - sin²θ = 0

Simplify: λ² - cos²θ - sin²θ = 0 → λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1

Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n are indeed ±1. Therefore, when we multiply by ε, the eigenvalues of H = ε σ · n are ±ε. So regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues are ±ε. That seems consistent with the specific cases I checked earlier.

Therefore, the answer should be that the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by noting that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\) when projected along any unit vector. 

The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) can be written as \(n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). This operator has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\) because the Pauli matrices are spin-1/2 operators, and the component of spin in any direction can only be \(\pm 1\) (in units of \(\hbar/2\), but here we are considering the eigenvalues directly). 

To confirm this, we can diagonalize the matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Choosing a coordinate system where \(\vec{n}\) aligns with the z-axis simplifies the Hamiltonian to \(\varepsilon \sigma_z\), which has eigenvalues \(\pm \varepsilon\). Since the eigenvalues are independent of the direction of \(\vec{n}\) (as we can rotate the coordinate system without changing the eigenvalues), this result holds for any unit vector \(\vec{n}\).

Explicitly, the matrix form of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta e^{-i\phi} \\
\sin\theta e^{i\phi} & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The characteristic equation for this matrix is \(\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\), giving eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). Multiplying by \(\varepsilon\) scales these eigenvalues to \(\pm \varepsilon\).

the ℏ factor. If σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then multiplying by ε would scale them to ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H should be ±ε. Let me verify this.

Alternatively, I can approach this by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the unit vector n. In such a case, the Hamiltonian simplifies to H = ε σ_z, since n would be (0,0,1). The eigenvalues of σ_z are indeed ±1, so H would have eigenvalues ±ε. Since the eigenvalues are independent of the direction of n (as it's a unit vector and we can rotate the coordinate system without changing the eigenvalues), this result should hold for any n. Therefore, regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε.

Wait, but let me check this with another approach. The general expression for σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. Let's write it out explicitly. Let n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Then σ · n would be:

sinθ cosφ * σ_x + sinθ sinφ * σ_y + cosθ * σ_z

Calculating each term:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So σ · n becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ (cosφ - i sinφ)],
 [sinθ (cosφ + i sinφ), -cosθ]]

Simplifying the off-diagonal terms using Euler's formula: cosφ ± i sinφ = e^(±iφ)

So the matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ}],
 [sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ]]

To find the eigenvalues, we compute the characteristic equation:

det(H - λI) = 0

But H here is ε times σ · n, so the eigenvalues will be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Let's compute the eigenvalues of σ · n first.

The trace of σ · n is cosθ + (-cosθ) = 0. The determinant is (cosθ)(-cosθ) - (sinθ e^{-iφ})(sinθ e^{iφ}) = -cos²θ - sin²θ (e^{-iφ} e^{iφ}) = -cos²θ - sin²θ (1) = - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0 → λ² - 0*λ -1 = λ² -1 =0 → λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. This confirms my initial thought. Therefore, regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues are ±ε. 

Another way to see this is that the Pauli matrices are spin operators for spin-1/2 particles, and the component of spin in any direction can only take values ±ℏ/2. However, in this case, the Hamiltonian is written as ε times the spin component in the n-direction. If we take ε to be analogous to a magnetic field multiplied by the gyromagnetic ratio, then the energy eigenvalues would indeed be proportional to ±ε. Since the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, scaling by ε gives the energy eigenvalues as ±ε. 

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε σ · n are ε and -ε. 

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli spin matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by noting that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, scaled by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\).

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Pauli Matrices and Their Properties**: The Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) each have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) results in a matrix that is a combination of these Pauli matrices, scaled by the components of \(\vec{n}\).

2. **Matrix Representation**: For a unit vector \(\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)\), the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is given by:
   \[
   \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z
   \]
   This matrix is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues can be found by considering the trace and determinant.

3. **Trace and Determinant**: The trace of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is zero, and the determinant is \(-1\). This leads to the characteristic equation:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 1 = 0
   \]
   Solving this, we find the eigenvalues \(\lambda = \pm 1\).

4. **Scaling by \(\varepsilon\)**: Since the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), multiplying by \(\varepsilon\) scales these eigenvalues to \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves are usually defined without the 1/2 factor. For example, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so their eigenvalues are ±1. Therefore, σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1, and then multiplying by ε would scale them to ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H should be ±ε. Let me verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the matrix explicitly. Let's suppose n is in an arbitrary direction. Let me parametrize n in spherical coordinates. Let’s say n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Then, σ · n would be:

σ_x sinθ cosφ + σ_y sinθ sinφ + σ_z cosθ.

Substituting the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, σ · n becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ (cosφ - i sinφ)],
 [sinθ (cosφ + i sinφ), -cosθ]]

Simplify the off-diagonal terms. Note that cosφ - i sinφ = e^{-iφ} and cosφ + i sinφ = e^{iφ}. So, the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ e^{-iφ}],
 [sinθ e^{iφ}, -cosθ]]

This is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix. To find its eigenvalues, we can compute the trace and determinant. The trace is cosθ + (-cosθ) = 0. The determinant is (cosθ)(-cosθ) - (sinθ e^{-iφ})(sinθ e^{iφ}) = -cos²θ - sin²θ (e^{-iφ} e^{iφ}) = -cos²θ - sin²θ (1) = - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic equation λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = λ² - 0λ -1 = λ² -1 = 0. So, λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, and hence the eigenvalues of H = ε σ · n are ±ε. 

Therefore, regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ε and -ε. That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1, so scaling by ε just scales the eigenvalues. The direction of n doesn't affect the magnitude of the eigenvalues, only their corresponding eigenvectors. So, the answer should be that the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.
