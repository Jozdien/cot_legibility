# Original Question

Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

Note that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.

The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S₀ state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) due to Pauli statistics, with T(NN) = 0. Conservation of angular momentum and parity must also hold.

### Key Constraints:
1. **Parity Conservation**:  
   Initial parity (NN system): \( (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_{\text{initial}}} = +1 \).  
   Final parity: \( (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \cdot (-1)^{L_X + 1} = +1 \).  
   This implies \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv L_X + 1 \mod 2 \).

2. **Pauli Statistics**:  
   For T(NN) = 0, \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   Initial total angular momentum \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \).  
   Final angular momentum \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \), where \( J_{\text{final}} \) results from coupling \( S_{\text{final}} \) and \( L_{\text{final}} \).

### Analysis for Partial Waves:
- **Even \( L_X \) (e.g., s-wave \( L_X = 0 \), d-wave \( L_X = 2 \))**:  
  - Parity requires \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv L_X + 1 \mod 2 \), so \( L_{\text{final}} \) is odd.  
  - Pauli statistics require \( S_{\text{final}} = 0 \).  
  - Angular momentum conservation demands \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \), but \( J_{\text{final}} = L_{\text{final}} \) (since \( S_{\text{final}} = 0 \)).  
  - **Contradiction**: \( L_{\text{final}} \) is odd, but \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \) is even. **Even \( L_X \) are forbidden**.

- **Odd \( L_X \) (e.g., p-wave \( L_X = 1 \), f-wave \( L_X = 3 \))**:  
  - Parity requires \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv L_X + 1 \mod 2 \), so \( L_{\text{final}} \) is even.  
  - Pauli statistics require \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \).  
  - Angular momentum conservation allows \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \) via coupling \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \) and \( L_{\text{final}} \). **Odd \( L_X \) are allowed**.

### Conclusion:
Partial waves with **even angular momentum \( L_X \)** (e.g., **s-wave \( L_X = 0 \)** and **d-wave \( L_X = 2 \)**) are **not permitted**. If the options include these, the answer depends on the specific choices provided. However, the **s-wave (L=0)** is typically the lowest forbidden partial wave in such contexts.

**Answer:** The **s-wave (L=0)** is not permitted.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted when a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem states that due to Pauli statistics, the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And we know the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The question is asking which partial wave (angular momentum state of X) is not allowed, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

First, let me recall some basics. The initial state is two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation is L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. The emission of this particle will change the state of the two nucleons. The final NN state must have certain quantum numbers, and we need to check which partial wave (i.e., the angular momentum of the emitted particle X) is not allowed.

Parity conservation is important here. The initial parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons and the spatial parity. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has intrinsic parity +1. The spatial parity for orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the initial parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = 1*1*1 = +1.

After emitting particle X, the final state includes the two nucleons in some state and the emitted particle X. The total parity must still be conserved. The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the two nucleons, their spatial parity, and the intrinsic parity of particle X times its spatial parity.

Wait, but particle X is emitted, so the system after emission is the two nucleons plus the particle X. But since the problem is about the NN system after emission, maybe we need to consider the parity of the NN system and the parity of the X particle separately, and ensure that the product equals the initial parity.

Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial parity is that of the NN system, which is (+1)(+1)*(-1)^L_initial = 1*1*1 = +1. After emission, the parity should be the product of the parity of the final NN system and the parity of the emitted X particle. The parity of the X particle is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (i.e., the partial wave). Since the X particle is emitted, the process involves the NN system transitioning from the initial state to the final state, and emitting X with some angular momentum L_X. So the total parity conservation would require:

Initial parity = Final parity of NN * parity of X particle.

But the parity of the X particle is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^{L_X}. The intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So:

Initial parity (which is +1) = [Final NN parity] * [(-1) * (-1)^{L_X}]

So:

1 = [Final NN parity] * (-1)^{L_X + 1}

Therefore, solving for Final NN parity:

Final NN parity = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X + 1} ] = (-1)^{ - (L_X +1)} = (-1)^{L_X +1} (since (-1)^n is its own inverse)

But the parity of the final NN system is the product of their intrinsic parities (still +1 each) times their spatial parity, which is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state. So:

Final NN parity = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_final}

Therefore, equating the two expressions for Final NN parity:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}

Which implies:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => (-1)^{L_final - L_X -1} = 1

Therefore:

L_final - L_X -1 must be even, so L_final - L_X ≡ 1 mod 2 => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

So that's a relation between L_final (the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state) and L_X (the angular momentum of the emitted particle X). But we need to connect this with other quantum numbers.

Additionally, we have angular momentum conservation. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum L_X, and possibly some spin, but the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X". Wait, in the context of partial waves, the angular momentum state of the emitted particle is usually its orbital angular momentum. So perhaps here, the particle X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l (lowercase letter), which is L_X. So the total angular momentum of the system after emission must be the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum and the angular momentum of the emitted X.

But the initial angular momentum is J=0, so the total final angular momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the angular momentum of the final NN state (J_final) and the angular momentum of the emitted X (which is L_X, since if X is a spin-0 particle, then its total angular momentum is just L_X; but if X has spin, then it's the sum of its spin and orbital angular momentum. Wait, but the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X", which in partial waves typically refers to the orbital angular momentum. However, particles can have intrinsic spin as well. But the problem doesn't specify the spin of particle X. Hmm, this might be a missing piece. Wait, but maybe in the context of the problem, when they refer to the angular momentum state of X, they are considering the total angular momentum carried away by X. But usually, in emission processes, the angular momentum is split between the orbital angular momentum (between the NN system and X) and the intrinsic spin of X. However, if the problem is referring to the partial wave, which is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission, then L_X is the orbital angular momentum. But if X has spin, then the total angular momentum would be the combination of L_X and the spin of X. But since the problem doesn't specify the spin of X, maybe we can assume that X is a spin-0 particle? Or perhaps the problem is considering that the angular momentum of X is purely orbital. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and considering that the angular momentum of the emitted particle is just its orbital angular momentum, which is the partial wave. That seems plausible. So perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the angular momentum carried away by X is L_X, which is the orbital angular momentum. Therefore, the total angular momentum of the final state must be the combination of the final NN state's angular momentum and L_X. But since the initial angular momentum is zero, the total final angular momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the final NN state's angular momentum (J_final) and L_X must couple to zero. That is, J_final must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to L_X. But since angular momentum is a vector, but we're dealing with quantum numbers, the coupling is such that the total angular momentum J_total = J_final + L_X must be zero. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, quantum mechanically, the possible total angular momentum is |J_final - L_X| ≤ J_total ≤ J_final + L_X. But since J_total must be zero, the only possibility is that J_final = L_X and they are coupled to zero. Which requires that J_final = L_X and that they are in a state with total angular momentum zero. For two angular momenta J1 and J2 to couple to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which requires J1 = J2 and the state is a singlet with J=0. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. Wait, but J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system. The NN system in the final state will have some total angular momentum, which is the combination of their spin S(NN) and their orbital angular momentum L_final. The term symbol for the final NN state is (2S+1)L(J), so J_final is the total angular momentum, which is S(NN) combined with L_final. But the initial state had S=0, L=0, J=0. After emitting X, the final NN state will have some S', L', and J', and the emitted X has L_X. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J' + L_X (vectorially). Since J_initial is 0, then J' must be equal to -L_X, which in quantum terms means that J' and L_X must be equal in magnitude and coupled to give total J=0. Therefore, J' must equal L_X. So J' = L_X. But J' is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S(NN) and L_final. So J' = S(NN) + L_final. Therefore, the possible values of J' are |S(NN) - L_final| ≤ J' ≤ S(NN) + L_final. But since J' must equal L_X, we have that L_X must be in the range |S(NN) - L_final| ≤ L_X ≤ S(NN) + L_final. But this seems a bit involved. Let's try to approach this step by step.

First, the initial state: 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting X, the final NN state has some S', L', and J', and the emitted X has angular momentum L_X (assuming it's orbital, and X is spin-0 for simplicity). The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J' + L_X = 0. Therefore, J' = L_X in magnitude and direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, J' must equal L_X. So J' = L_X. But J' is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of S' and L'. So J' results from coupling S' and L'. Therefore, J' can take values |S' - L'| ≤ J' ≤ S' + L'. But J' must equal L_X. So L_X must be in that range. Also, since J' is a non-negative integer (or half-integer, but nucleons are fermions with spin 1/2, so S' can be 0 or 1, and L' is integer, so J' must be integer). Therefore, L_X must also be an integer.

Now, the parity conservation: as we derived earlier, (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}, so L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. Therefore, L_final and L_X must have opposite parity. If L_X is even, L_final is odd, and vice versa.

Additionally, the problem states that due to Pauli statistics, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Given that the final T(NN) =0, we have:

0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 => S(NN) + L(NN) ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S' + L' ≡1 mod 2. Since S' is the spin of the final NN state. For two nucleons, which are fermions, their total spin S' can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Similarly, their orbital angular momentum L' is an integer. So S' is either 0 or 1, and L' is integer. Therefore, S' + L' ≡1 mod 2. So if S'=0, then L' must be 1 mod 2 (odd). If S'=1, then L' must be 0 mod 2 (even).

Now, let's summarize the constraints:

1. Parity conservation: L' ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

2. Pauli statistics: S' + L' ≡1 mod 2.

3. Angular momentum conservation: J' = L_X, where J' is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S' and L'.

Our goal is to find which partial wave (L_X) is not permitted. The possible partial waves are probably given as options, but since the user hasn't provided them, I need to think in general. Wait, the user says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" But since the options aren't here, maybe I need to figure out the possible allowed L_X and see which one is excluded based on the constraints. Wait, but the original problem must have specific options, like s-wave (L_X=0), p-wave (L_X=1), d-wave (L_X=2), etc. The answer is one of these. Let me proceed.

Let's consider possible L_X values and check if they are allowed.

For each possible L_X, we need to find possible S' and L' that satisfy the constraints.

First, let's note that the initial state has J=0, so the final total angular momentum must be J' + L_X =0. Since angular momentum is quantized, this implies that J' = L_X and they are coupled to J_total=0. Therefore, J' must equal L_X. But J' is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of S' and L'. So J' can be |S' - L'| to S' + L' in integer steps. Therefore, L_X must be in that range. Also, since J' must equal L_X, we have that L_X must be a possible value of J' for some S' and L'.

Let's proceed step by step for possible L_X:

Case 1: L_X=0 (s-wave)

If L_X=0, then J' must be 0. So the final NN state must have J'=0. Also, from parity conservation: L' ≡0 +1=1 mod2, so L' must be odd. From Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' is odd, S' must be 0 (because 0 +1=1 mod2). So S'=0, L'=odd. Then J' is the combination of S'=0 and L'=odd. Since S'=0, J'=L'. But J' must be 0. Therefore, L' must be 0. But L' is supposed to be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=0 is not allowed.

Wait, but L' must be odd (from parity conservation: L'=L_X +1=0+1=1 mod2, so L' is odd). But J'=0, which must equal L_X=0. But J' is the combination of S'=0 and L'=odd. If S'=0, then J'=L'. But L' is odd, so J'=odd. But J' must be 0. Therefore, impossible. Hence, L_X=0 is not allowed. But wait, this seems like a possible conclusion. However, let's check other cases to see.

Case 2: L_X=1 (p-wave)

Then J'=1. From parity conservation: L' ≡1 +1=2≡0 mod2, so L' even. From Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' is even, S' must be 1. So S'=1, L'=even. Then J' is the combination of S'=1 and L'=even. The possible J' values are |1 - L'| to 1 + L'. Since L' is even, let's consider possible L' values. The smallest even L' is 0. If L'=0, then J'=1 (since S'=1 and L'=0). So J'=1, which matches L_X=1. So this is possible. Therefore, L_X=1 is allowed.

Case 3: L_X=2 (d-wave)

J'=2. Parity conservation: L' ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2, so L' odd. Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' is odd, S' must be 0. So S'=0, L'=odd. Then J'=L' (since S'=0). So J'=L'=odd. But J' must be 2. However, L' is odd, so L'=1,3,5,... but J'=2. Therefore, no solution. Wait, L' must be odd and J'=L'=2. But 2 is even. Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is not allowed? Wait, but let's check again.

Wait, J'=2, which must come from S'=0 and L'=odd. If S'=0, then J'=L'. So L'=2. But L' must be odd (from parity conservation). Therefore, L'=2 is even, which contradicts L' must be odd. Therefore, no solution. Hence, L_X=2 is not allowed.

Wait, but this seems conflicting. Let's check again.

Wait, for L_X=2:

Parity: L' ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2 → L' must be odd.

Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' is odd, S' must be 0 (0 +1=1). So S'=0, L'=odd.

Then J'=L' (since S'=0). But J' must equal L_X=2. Therefore, L'=2. But L' must be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is not allowed.

Case 4: L_X=3 (f-wave)

J'=3. Parity: L' ≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2 → L' even.

Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' even, S' must be 1.

So S'=1, L'=even. Then J' is the combination of S'=1 and L'=even. The possible J' values are |1 - L'| to 1 + L'. We need J'=3. So possible if L'=2: 1+2=3. So L'=2 (even), S'=1. Then J'=3. Yes, possible. Therefore, L_X=3 is allowed.

Similarly, L_X=4 (g-wave):

J'=4. Parity: L' ≡4 +1=5≡1 mod2 → L' odd.

Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2. Since L' odd, S'=0.

Then J'=L'=4. But L' must be odd. Contradiction. So L_X=4 is not allowed.

Wait, but this pattern suggests that even L_X are not allowed? Wait, for L_X even:

If L_X is even:

Parity: L'=L_X +1 mod2 → even +1=odd. So L' must be odd.

Pauli: S' + L' ≡1. Since L' is odd, S'=0.

Then J'=L' (since S'=0). But J'=L_X (even). But L' is odd. Contradiction. Therefore, for even L_X, no solution.

For odd L_X:

Parity: L'=L_X +1 mod2 → odd +1=even. So L' even.

Pauli: S' + L' ≡1. Since L' even, S'=1.

Then J' is combination of S'=1 and L' even. To get J'=L_X (odd), since L_X is odd, need to combine S'=1 and L' even to get J'=odd. Since S'=1 and L' even, their combination can give J'=odd. For example, L'=2 (even), S'=1: possible J'=1,2,3. If L_X=3 (odd), then J'=3 can be achieved with L'=2 and S'=1 (since 1+2=3). Similarly, L_X=1 can be achieved with L'=0 and S'=1 (J'=1). Therefore, odd L_X are allowed, even L_X are not.

But wait, in the case of L_X=0 (even? No, L_X=0 is even. Wait, 0 is even. So L_X=0 is even. Then as we saw earlier, L_X=0 is even, so L' must be odd (from parity). Pauli requires S'=0. Then J'=L'=0, but L' must be odd. Contradiction. So L_X=0 is even and not allowed. Similarly, L_X=2,4,... even, not allowed. Odd L_X=1,3,5,... allowed.

But the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. The possible answers are likely among s, p, d, f, etc. So s-wave (L=0) is not allowed, p-wave (L=1) allowed, d-wave (L=2) not allowed, etc.

But the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. We need to confirm that our analysis used this. Yes, because the Pauli condition T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod2, and T(NN)=0, leading to S' + L' ≡1 mod2. So our analysis already incorporated T(NN)=0.

Therefore, the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X: s (L=0), d (L=2), g (L=4), etc. But the problem is multiple choice, and since the user hasn't provided the options, but in typical such problems, the answer is s-wave or d-wave. But from our analysis, both s and d are even and thus forbidden. However, in the case of L_X=0, we saw that it's impossible because J'=0 would require L'=0, but L' must be odd. Similarly, L_X=2 requires L'=3? Wait, no. Wait for L_X=2:

Wait, L_X=2 (even), so L' must be odd (from parity). Pauli requires S'=0. Then J'=L' (since S'=0). But J'=L_X=2. Therefore, L'=2, but L' must be odd. Contradiction. So yes, even L_X are forbidden.

But the problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". If the options include, say, s-wave (L=0), p-wave (L=1), d-wave (L=2), etc., then both s and d are not permitted. But maybe the answer is s-wave? Or d-wave? Wait, but in the case of L_X=1 (p-wave), it's allowed. Similarly, L_X=3 (f-wave) is allowed. So the even ones are forbidden. Therefore, if the options are s, p, d, f, then s and d are forbidden. But the problem says "which of the following is not permitted", implying one answer. Maybe the options given are s, p, d, and the answer is s or d. But without the options, it's hard. However, in the original problem statement, the user might have specific options, but since they're not here, I need to infer.

Wait, but let's check again for L_X=0. The initial J=0, so after emitting L_X=0, the final NN must have J'=0. From parity, L'=1. From Pauli, S'=0. Then J'=L'=1, but needs to be 0. Contradiction. So L_X=0 is impossible. For L_X=2, similarly impossible. So both s and d waves are forbidden. But the problem might have options where only one of them is listed, and the other allowed. But given that the problem is from a physics exam, typically, the answer would be s-wave is forbidden. But wait, in our analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, maybe there's a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine the parity conservation. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is the parity of the NN system times the parity of the X particle. The parity of the X particle is (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}, since its intrinsic parity is -1 and spatial parity is (-1)^{L_X}. So total parity of X is (-1)^{L_X +1}. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L'}. So total parity after emission is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{L_X +1} = (-1)^{L' + L_X +1}. This must equal the initial parity of +1. Therefore:

(-1)^{L' + L_X +1} =1 → L' + L_X +1 must be even → L' + L_X ≡1 mod2.

But earlier, we had L' ≡ L_X +1 mod2. Let's check:

From parity: L' + L_X ≡1 mod2.

From Pauli: S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

But S' is 0 or 1. Let's see:

If we combine these two equations:

From parity: L' ≡1 - L_X mod2.

From Pauli: S' ≡1 - L' mod2.

Substitute L' from parity into Pauli:

S' ≡1 - (1 - L_X) ≡ L_X mod2.

So S' ≡ L_X mod2.

But S' can be 0 or 1. Therefore, if L_X is even (0,2,4,...), then S'=0. If L_X is odd (1,3,5,...), then S'=1.

Now, combining with angular momentum conservation: J' = L_X. But J' is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of S' and L'. So J' = |S' - L'| to S' + L'.

But we also have from parity: L' ≡1 - L_X mod2.

Let's proceed with this new relation S' ≡ L_X mod2.

Case L_X=0 (even):

S'=0 (since L_X even). From parity: L' ≡1 -0=1 mod2 (L' odd). From Pauli: S' + L' ≡0 +1=1 mod2, which matches T=0.

Now, J'=L_X=0. But J' is the combination of S'=0 and L'=odd. So J'=L' (since S'=0). Therefore, J'=L'=0. But L' is odd. Contradiction. Hence, L_X=0 impossible.

Case L_X=1 (odd):

S'=1. From parity: L' ≡1 -1=0 mod2 (L' even). From Pauli:1 +0=1 mod2, good.

J'=L_X=1. J' is combination of S'=1 and L' even. Let's take L'=0 (even). Then J'=1 (since S'=1 and L'=0). So possible. Therefore, allowed.

Case L_X=2 (even):

S'=0. From parity: L' ≡1 -2=1-0=1 mod2 (since 2 mod2=0, so 1-0=1). So L' odd. From Pauli:0 +1=1 mod2, good.

J'=L_X=2. J'=L' (since S'=0). So L'=2. But L' must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, L_X=2 impossible.

Case L_X=3 (odd):

S'=1. From parity: L' ≡1 -3=1-1=0 mod2 (since 3 mod2=1). So L' even. From Pauli:1 +0=1 mod2, good.

J'=3. J' is combination of S'=1 and L' even. Take L'=2 (even). Then possible J'=1,2,3. So J'=3 is possible. Hence, allowed.

Therefore, the pattern is that even L_X are forbidden, odd allowed. Therefore, the partial waves not permitted are those with even L_X: s (L=0), d (L=2), etc.

But the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". If the options are, for example, s, p, d, f, then s and d are not permitted. However, in typical notation, the partial waves are labeled by lowercase letters: s (L=0), p (1), d (2), f (3), etc. So if the options include d-wave (L=2), that's not permitted. Similarly, s-wave (L=0) is also not permitted. But the problem might have specific options. Since the user hasn't provided them, but in the original problem (which the user is referencing), the answer is likely the s-wave or d-wave. However, considering that in the case of L_X=0, the contradiction is more direct (can't have L'=0 and odd), but for L_X=2, you need L'=2 which is even, but L' must be odd. So both are impossible. But maybe the problem gives options where only one of them is present. For example, if the options are a) s, b) p, c) d, d) f, then both a and c are not permitted. But since the problem says "which of the following is not permitted", implying one answer, perhaps the answer is s-wave. But without the options, it's hard to say. However, in the original problem statement from where this is taken (probably a textbook or exam), the answer is likely the s-wave. But according to our analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, let's check again for L_X=0:

For L_X=0:

- S'=0 (since L_X even)

- L'=1 (from parity)

- J'=0 (from angular momentum conservation)

But J' is the combination of S'=0 and L'=1, which gives J'=1. But we need J'=0. Contradiction. Hence, impossible.

For L_X=2:

- S'=0

- L'=1 (from parity: L'=1 -2 mod2=1-0=1)

Wait, wait, parity equation is L' + L_X ≡1 mod2. For L_X=2 (even=0), L' +0 ≡1 → L'≡1. So L'=1.

Then J'=L_X=2. But J' is combination of S'=0 and L'=1, which gives J'=1. But need J'=2. Contradiction. Hence, impossible.

Similarly, L_X=4:

- S'=0

- L'=1 (from L' +4 ≡1 mod2 → L' +0 ≡1 → L'=1)

- J'=4, but J'=1. Contradiction.

Therefore, all even L_X are impossible. So the answer is any even partial wave (s, d, g, etc.) is not permitted. If the options include s and d, both are correct, but typically in such problems, the lowest forbidden one is asked, which is s-wave. However, the problem might have different options. But given that the user hasn't provided them, and the note says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X", which are s, p, d, etc., and the answer is likely s or d. But according to the analysis, both are forbidden. However, in the original problem statement from the user, it's possible that the answer is the s-wave. But I need to check the original problem's exact wording.

Wait, the problem says "the final NN state has T(NN) = 0". We used that in the Pauli condition. The key is that for T=0, the Pauli condition requires S + L ≡1 mod2. For the NN system, which is two nucleons (fermions), the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial (L), spin (S), and isospin (T) parts. For two nucleons, which are identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle requires that the total wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is:

Ψ_total = ψ_spatial * ψ_spin * ψ_isospin

Under exchange, the spatial part contributes (-1)^L, the spin part (-1)^{S+1} (since for spin S, the exchange symmetry is (-1)^{S+1}; for S=0 (singlet), it's symmetric (since (-1)^{0+1}= -1, but wait, the spin state for S=0 is antisymmetric, because the singlet state is antisymmetric. Similarly, for S=1 (triplet), symmetric. Similarly, the isospin part: T=0 is antisymmetric (since for two nucleons, T=0 is the singlet, antisymmetric; T=1 is symmetric).

Therefore, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric:

(-1)^L * (-1)^{S+1} * (-1)^{T+1} = -1

Because for fermions, exchange gives -1.

So:

(-1)^{L + S +1 + T +1} = -1

Simplify:

(-1)^{L + S + T +2} = (-1)^{L + S + T} = -1

Therefore:

L + S + T ≡1 mod2

Which is the given condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.

Given that T=0, we have 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2, which matches our earlier use.

So our analysis is correct.

Therefore, returning to the problem, the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X. If the options are, say, (a) s, (b) p, (c) d, (d) f, then both a and c are forbidden. But if the options are only s and d, then both. However, in typical multiple-choice questions, they might list s as an option, and the answer is s. But without seeing the options, it's hard. However, the user might have had specific options, and the answer is the s-wave. But according to the analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, in the process of emission, higher partial waves (like d) are less probable, but the question is about permission, not probability. So even though d-wave is higher angular momentum, it's still forbidden by the constraints, not just suppressed.

But let's check for L_X=1 (p-wave):

S'=1 (since L_X=1 is odd), L'=0 (from parity: L' +1 ≡1 mod2 → L'=0). Then J'=1 (from S'=1 and L'=0). Which matches L_X=1. So allowed.

Similarly, L_X=3 (f-wave):

S'=1, L'=2 (from parity: L' +3 ≡1 mod2 → L' +1 ≡1 → L'=0 mod2 → L'=2). Then J'=3 (1 +2=3). Allowed.

Therefore, the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X: 0,2,4,...

Given that, the answer is any even L_X. If the options are s (L=0), p (1), d (2), f (3), then s and d are forbidden. But the problem says "which of the following is not permitted", implying one answer. It's possible that in the original problem, the answer is the s-wave, but according to the analysis, d-wave is also forbidden. However, the user's note mentions that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), and the question is about the partial wave of X, which is the angular momentum state of X, i.e., L_X.

Given that, and the analysis, the answer is that even L_X are forbidden, so s (L=0) and d (L=2) are forbidden. If the options include both, but the problem might have a specific one. However, since the user hasn't provided the options, but in the context of such problems, the typical forbidden one in similar contexts is the s-wave because it's the lowest, but here both are forbidden. However, considering that the initial state is 1S0 (L=0), emitting a particle with L_X=0 would mean the final NN state has L'=1 (from parity), which would require a change in orbital angular momentum from 0 to 1, but with J'=0, which is impossible. Whereas for L_X=2, the final L'=1 (from parity), but J'=2, which is also impossible. So both are impossible. But without the options, I can't choose. However, the problem might have options where only s is forbidden, and the answer is s. But according to the analysis, both s and d are forbidden. Therefore, the answer is that the s-wave (L=0) is not permitted, and similarly the d-wave (L=2) is not permitted. But since the user's question is from a problem that likely has specific options, and given that in such problems often the lowest forbidden is the answer, I think the intended answer is the s-wave. However, based on the detailed analysis, both even L_X are forbidden. But since the user's original problem must have had specific options, and the answer is likely the s-wave, but to be precise, according to the analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, the problem might have only s as an option. But without seeing the options, I can't be certain. However, given the information, I'll conclude that the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X, so if the options include s (L=0) and d (L=2), both are forbidden. But since the problem asks for "which is not permitted", and if only one is to be chosen, perhaps s-wave is the answer intended by the problem author.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted when a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem states that due to Pauli statistics, the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And we know the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The question is asking which partial wave (angular momentum state of X) is not allowed, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

First, let me recall some basics. The initial state is two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation is L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. The emission of this particle will change the state of the two nucleons. The final NN state must have certain quantum numbers, and we need to check which partial wave (i.e., the angular momentum of the emitted particle X) is not allowed.

Parity conservation is important here. The initial parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons and the spatial parity. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has intrinsic parity +1. The spatial parity for orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the initial parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = 1*1*1 = +1.

After emitting particle X, the final state includes the two nucleons in some state and the emitted particle X. The total parity must still be conserved. The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the two nucleons, their spatial parity, and the intrinsic parity of particle X times its spatial parity.

Wait, but particle X is emitted, so the system after emission is the two nucleons plus the particle X. But since the problem is about the NN system after emission, maybe we need to consider the parity of the NN system and the parity of the X particle separately, and ensure that the product equals the initial parity.

Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial parity is that of the NN system, which is (+1)(+1)*(-1)^L_initial = 1*1*1 = +1. After emission, the parity should be the product of the parity of the final NN system and the parity of the emitted X particle. The parity of the X particle is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (i.e., the partial wave). Since the X particle is emitted, the process involves the NN system transitioning from the initial state to the final state, and emitting X with some angular momentum L_X. So the total parity conservation would require:

Initial parity = Final parity of NN * parity of X particle.

But the parity of the X particle is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^{L_X}. The intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So:

Initial parity (which is +1) = [Final NN parity] * [(-1) * (-1)^{L_X}]

So:

1 = [Final NN parity] * (-1)^{L_X + 1}

Therefore, solving for Final NN parity:

Final NN parity = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X + 1} ] = (-1)^{ - (L_X +1)} = (-1)^{L_X +1} (since (-1)^n is its own inverse)

But the parity of the final NN system is the product of their intrinsic parities (still +1 each) times their spatial parity, which is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state. So:

Final NN parity = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_final}

Therefore, equating the two expressions for Final NN parity:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}

Which implies:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => (-1)^{L_final - L_X -1} = 1

Therefore:

L_final - L_X -1 must be even, so L_final - L_X ≡ 1 mod 2 => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

So that's a relation between L_final (the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state) and L_X (the angular momentum of the emitted particle X). But we need to connect this with other quantum numbers.

Additionally, we have angular momentum conservation. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum L_X, and possibly some spin, but the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X". Wait, in the context of partial waves, the angular momentum state of the emitted particle is usually its orbital angular momentum. So perhaps here, the particle X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l (lowercase letter), which is L_X. So the total angular momentum of the system after emission must be the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum and the angular momentum of the emitted X.

But the initial angular momentum is J=0, so the total final angular momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the angular momentum of the final NN state (J_final) and the angular momentum of the emitted X (which is L_X, since if X is a spin-0 particle, then its total angular momentum is just L_X; but if X has spin, then it's the sum of its spin and orbital angular momentum. Wait, but the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X", which in partial waves typically refers to the orbital angular momentum. However, particles can have intrinsic spin as well. But the problem doesn't specify the spin of particle X. Hmm, this might be a missing piece. Wait, but maybe in the context of the problem, when they refer to the angular momentum state of X, they are considering the total angular momentum carried away by X. But usually, in emission processes, the angular momentum is split between the orbital angular momentum (between the NN system and X) and the intrinsic spin of X. However, if the problem is referring to the partial wave, which is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission, then L_X is the orbital angular momentum. But if X has spin, then the total angular momentum would be the combination of L_X and the spin of X. But since the problem doesn't specify the spin of X, maybe we can assume that X is a spin-0 particle? Or perhaps the problem is considering that the angular momentum of X is purely orbital. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and considering that the angular momentum of the emitted particle is just its orbital angular momentum, which is the partial wave. That seems plausible. So perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the angular momentum carried away by X is L_X, which is the orbital angular momentum. Therefore, the total angular momentum of the final state must be the combination of the final NN state's angular momentum and L_X. But since the initial angular momentum is zero, the total final angular momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the final NN state's angular momentum (J_final) and L_X must couple to zero. That is, J_final must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to L_X. But since angular momentum is a vector, but we're dealing with quantum numbers, the coupling is such that the total angular momentum J_total = J_final + L_X must be zero. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, quantum mechanically, the possible total angular momentu

I need to determine which partial wave is not allowed when a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. According to Pauli statistics, the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, with T(NN) = 0. The question asks which angular momentum state of X is forbidden when considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me analyze the initial state first. For a 1S0 state, we have S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation means L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

For parity considerations, the initial parity is the product of the nucleons' intrinsic parities and the spatial parity: (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1.

After emission, the total parity must be conserved. The final parity equals the product of the final NN system's parity and the emitted X particle's parity. Since X has intrinsic parity -1 and orbital angular momentum L_X (the partial wave), its parity contribution is (-1)(-1)^L_X = (-1)^(L_X+1).

So the parity conservation equation is:
Initial parity (+1) = Final NN parity × (-1)^(L_X+1)

The final NN parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^L_final = (-1)^L_final, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

Therefore:
1 = (-1)^L_final × (-1)^(L_X+1)
1 = (-1)^(L_final+L_X+1)

This means L_final+L_X+1 must be even, so L_final ≡ L_X+1 (mod 2).

Additionally, angular momentum must be conserved. Since the initial total angular momentum is J=0, the final NN state's angular momentum (J_final) and the angular momentum of X (L_X) must couple to zero. This means J_final must equal L_X in magnitude to satisfy vector addition to zero.

Given that the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 with T(NN) = 0, we can determine which partial wave of X is not permitted by considering all these constraints together.

I need to determine which partial wave is disallowed when a system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state releases a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem specifies that due to Pauli statistics, the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. It's known that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The question seeks to discover which partial wave (angular momentum state of X) is forbidden, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

To start, recall that the initial state involves two nucleons in a 1S0 state. Using the term symbol (2S+1)L(J), where 1S0 means S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (S notation implies L=0), and J=0. Hence, the initial state features spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Upon emitting particle X, which possesses intrinsic parity -1, the state of the nucleons is altered. The final NN state's quantum numbers must be evaluated to identify the unallowed partial wave of the emitted X.

Parity conservation is crucial here. The initial parity combines the intrinsic parities of the two nucleons and the spatial parity. Both nucleons (protons or neutrons) have intrinsic parity +1. The spatial parity, based on orbital angular momentum L, is (-1)^L. Therefore, the initial parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1.

Post-emission, the final state includes the two nucleons and X. Total parity conservation dictates that the product of the final NN system’s parity and X's parity must match the initial parity.

The parity of the X particle is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^L_X, where L_X is associated with its emission. Given X has intrinsic parity -1:

Initial parity = Final NN parity * [(-1) * (-1)^{L_X}]

This becomes:

1 = [Final NN parity] * (-1)^{L_X + 1}

Solving yields:

Final NN parity = (-1)^{L_X +1}

The final NN parity is the product of the nucleons’ intrinsic parities and their spatial parity, (-1)^{L_final}:

Final NN parity = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_final}

Equating gives:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}

Thus:

(-1)^{L_final - L_X -1} = 1

Implying:

L_final - L_X -1 must be even, or L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

Furthermore, conservation of angular momentum is required. Since J_initial = 0, X carries orbital angular momentum L_X. According to the problem statement, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X," likely referring to its orbital component.

For angular momentum to be conserved, the total final angular momentum, including the final NN state’s angular momentum and X's, should sum to zero. Thus, the final NN state's angular momentum and L_X must equal zero when combined. J_final must equal the magnitude of L_X, but in the opposite direction, if both are vectors. Quantum mechanically, these quantities must couple to maintain a total angular momentum of zero.

The problem invites exploration of how L_final and L_X relate to other quantum numbers, considering potential simplifications around the spin of X. Ultimately, the aim is to find the condition prohibiting a specific partial wave in the final state.

But since J_total must be zero, the only possibility is J_final = L_X and they are coupled to zero. But for two angular momenta to couple to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which requires that J_final = L_X. Wait, but if J_final and L_X are vectors, then their sum is zero only if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, when you add two angular momenta, the resulting total angular momentum can be from |j1 - j2| to j1 + j2. So if J_final and L_X are such that they can combine to give zero, then they must have the same magnitude. So J_final must equal L_X. Because if J_final is j and L_X is l, then |j - l| ≤ 0 ≤ j + l. The only way this is possible is if j = l and 0 is in the range, which requires j = l and 0 is between |j - l| and j + l. But |j - l| = 0 when j = l, so 0 must be in 0 to 2j. Since 0 is the lower bound, it\'s allowed. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X, and the coupling is such that J_total = 0. Therefore, J_final = L_X. So the angular momentum of the final NN state must be equal to the angular momentum carried away by the emitted particle X. \n\nBut the initial NN state has J_initial = 0, so the final NN state\'s J_final must be equal to L_X, and the total angular momentum J_total = J_final + L_X = 0. Wait, but if J_final is a vector and L_X is a vector, their sum is zero. So J_final = -L_X. But in quantum numbers, the magnitude is what matters. So the magnitude of J_final must equal the magnitude of L_X, and they must be able to couple to zero. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So J_final = L_X. Therefore, the angular momentum quantum number of the final NN state is equal to the angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n\nSo, in summary, from angular momentum conservation, we have that the total angular momentum of the final NN state (J_final) must be equal to the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (L_X). And from parity conservation, we have that (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}, which implies that L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.\n\nBut we also have the Pauli exclusion principle constraint given in the problem: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, then:\n\n0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 => S(NN) + L(NN) ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN state must be odd.\n\nBut the final NN state is a two-nucleon system. For two nucleons, which are fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial, spin, isospin, and other parts. Since we\'re dealing with isospin T(NN) = 0, which is antisymmetric (because for two nucleons, T=0 is the singlet state, which is antisymmetric, and T=1 is the triplet, symmetric). The spin state S(NN) can be 0 (antisymmetric singlet) or 1 (symmetric triplet). The spatial wavefunction has parity (-1)^{L(NN)}, so symmetric if L(NN) is even, antisymmetric if L(NN) is odd.\n\nThe total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So the product of spatial, spin, and isospin wavefunctions must be antisymmetric. Since the isospin is T=0 (antisymmetric), the product of spatial and spin must be symmetric (because antisymmetric * symmetric = antisymmetric). Therefore:\n\nSpatial * Spin = symmetric.\n\nSpatial symmetry is (-1)^{L(NN)} (since spatial wavefunction under exchange is (-1)^{L}, as exchanging the two particles is equivalent to reversing their relative position vector, which introduces a factor of (-1)^L). Spin symmetry is (-1)^{S(NN) +1} because for two spin-1/2 particles, the spin state is symmetric (triplet, S=1) if (-1)^{S+1} = +1, and antisymmetric (singlet, S=0) if (-1)^{S+1} = -1. Wait, let\'s check:\n\nFor two identical fermions, the spin state symmetry is:\n\n- For S=1 (triplet), the spin state is symmetric, because the triplet states are symmetric under exchange.\n\n- For S=0 (singlet), the spin state is antisymmetric.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry of the spin part is (-1)^{S+1}. Because for S=1: (-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = 1 (symmetric). For S=0: (-1)^{0+1} = -1 (antisymmetric). So yes, the spin part has symmetry (-1)^{S+1}.\n\nSimilarly, the spatial part has symmetry (-1)^L. So the product of spatial and spin parts must be symmetric because the isospin part is antisymmetric (T=0), so overall:\n\n(-1)^L * (-1)^{S+1} = +1 (symmetric)\n\nTherefore:\n\n(-1)^{L + S +1} = +1 => L + S +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 => L + S ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich matches the given condition in the problem: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, this gives 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 => S + L ≡1 mod 2. So that\'s consistent. So the Pauli condition here is already accounted for in the symmetry of the wavefunction.\n\nSo, given that, we have:\n\n1. From parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.\n\n2. From angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state. The total angular momentum J_final is the sum of the spin S_final and the orbital angular momentum L_final of the NN system. Wait, no. The total angular momentum J is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L and the spin S. But for the NN system, the total angular momentum J_final is the vector sum of their orbital angular momentum L_final and their spin S_final. However, in the term symbol (2S+1)L(J), J is the total angular momentum, which is L_final + S_final. So J_final can take values |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But earlier, we had from angular momentum conservation that J_final must equal L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of L_final and S_final.\n\nThis seems more complicated. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. After emitting a particle X with orbital angular momentum L_X, the final state consists of the NN system and the X particle. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so the sum of the NN system\'s angular momentum (J_final) and the X particle\'s angular momentum (which is L_X, assuming X is spinless or that we\'re only considering orbital angular momentum) must equal the initial angular momentum, which is 0. Therefore, J_final + L_X = 0. In quantum mechanics, this means that J_final and L_X must be able to couple to zero. For two angular momenta J_final and L_X to couple to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. Because when you add two angular momenta, the only way to get zero is if they are the same magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must be equal to L_X. So J_final = L_X.\n\nBut J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the vector sum of its spin (S_final) and orbital angular momentum (L_final). So J_final can range from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But we have J_final = L_X. So L_X must be in that range. However, since the problem doesn\'t specify the possible values of S_final and L_final, we need to relate them through the Pauli condition and the parity conservation.\n\nGiven that T(NN) = 0, we have S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2.\n\nFrom parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.\n\nFrom angular momentum: J_final = L_X, and J_final is the combination of L_final and S_final.\n\nSo let\'s consider possible values of S_final and L_final.\n\nSince the initial state is 1S0, which has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0. After emitting X, the final NN state will have some S_final, L_final, and J_final.\n\nBut the spin of the NN system, S_final, can be 0 or 1, since each nucleon has spin 1/2, so combining two spin-1/2 particles gives S=0 or S=1.\n\nSimilarly, the orbital angular momentum L_final can be 0,1,2,... but in practice, for low-energy processes, lower L values are more relevant.\n\nBut we need to find which partial wave (L_X) is not permitted. The possible partial waves are probably given as options, but since the user hasn\'t provided them, I need to think in general.\n\nWait, the problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" But the user hasn\'t provided the options. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was presented as a question to be answered, but in the current prompt, the user is asking me to simulate a thought process. Wait, no, the original problem is in the first paragraph, and the user is asking for a solution. Wait, the initial problem says:\n\n"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity."\n\nBut the user hasn\'t provided the options. Wait, maybe this is a transcription error. Wait, the original problem might have had options, but in the current prompt, they are missing. Hmm. Wait, the user\'s instruction is: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}." So perhaps the original problem had options like s-wave, p-wave, etc., but in the current prompt, they are missing. However, given that the user is from a Spanish-speaking country (judging by the email), maybe there was a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a known source where the options are standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a textbook or standard problem set where the options are known. For example, common partial waves are s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2), etc. Given that, the answer is likely one of these.\n\nBut since the options aren\'t given, I need to deduce which L_X is not allowed based on the constraints.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. T(NN) = 0 => S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2.\n\n2. Parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.\n\n3. Angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X, where J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of S_final and L_final.\n\nSo, J_final can be |L_final - S_final|, ..., L_final + S_final. But J_final must equal L_X.\n\nLet\'s consider possible values of S_final (0 or 1) and L_final, and see which L_X are possible.\n\nCase 1: S_final = 0.\n\nThen from T(NN) =0: 0 + L_final ≡1 mod 2 => L_final ≡1 mod 2. So L_final is odd.\n\nFrom parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, L_X +1 ≡1 mod 2 => L_X ≡0 mod 2. So L_X is even.\n\nFrom angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final=0 and L_final. Since S_final=0, J_final = L_final. Therefore, J_final = L_final = L_X. But L_final is odd and L_X is even. Contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, S_final cannot be 0.\n\nCase 2: S_final =1.\n\nFrom T(NN)=0: 1 + L_final ≡1 mod 2 => L_final ≡0 mod 2. So L_final is even.\n\nFrom parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is even, L_X +1 ≡0 mod 2 => L_X ≡1 mod 2. So L_X is odd.\n\nFrom angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final=1 and L_final (even). The possible values of J_final are |L_final -1| to L_final +1. Since L_final is even, let\'s denote L_final = 2k.\n\nSo J_final can be 2k -1, 2k, 2k +1. But J_final must equal L_X, which is odd. Therefore, J_final must be either 2k -1 or 2k +1. Both are odd. Since L_X is odd, this is possible.\n\nBut we need to check if there exists integers k such that L_X = J_final = 2k ±1, and L_final =2k.\n\nBut L_X must be equal to J_final, which is 2k ±1. However, L_X is also equal to J_final. So L_X = 2k ±1, and L_final =2k. But from parity conservation, L_final = L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is even and L_X is odd, L_final = L_X +1 mod 2 is satisfied because odd +1 = even.\n\nBut we need to ensure that J_final (which is L_X) can be obtained from combining S_final=1 and L_final=2k.\n\nFor example, take L_final=0 (k=0). Then J_final can be |0 -1| =1, 0, or 1. But L_final=0, S_final=1, so J_final can be 1. So J_final=1. Then L_X=1. So L_X=1 (p-wave). Is this possible?\n\nYes. Let\'s check:\n\nIf L_final=0 (even), S_final=1, then J_final=1. Then L_X=1. From parity conservation: L_final=0 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2 => 0 ≡1+1=2≡0 mod 2. Yes. So this works.\n\nAnother example: L_final=2 (k=1). Then J_final can be |2-1|=1, 2, or 3. So J_final=1,2,3. But J_final must equal L_X, which is odd. So J_final=1 or 3. Therefore, L_X=1 or 3. Then L_final=2, which is even. From parity conservation: 2 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. For L_X=1: 2 ≡1+1=2≡0 mod 2. 2 mod 2=0, 2 mod2=0. So 0≡0. Yes. For L_X=3: 2≡3+1=4≡0 mod2. 0≡0. Yes. So both L_X=1 and 3 are allowed when L_final=2.\n\nSimilarly, L_final=4 (k=2). J_final=3,4,5. L_X must be odd:3,5. Parity conservation:4≡3+1=4≡0 mod2, yes; 4≡5+1=6≡0 mod2, yes.\n\nSo in general, for S_final=1 and L_final even, the possible L_X are odd numbers such that L_X = J_final, which can be L_final ±1. However, L_X must be a non-negative integer. So for each even L_final, there are possible odd L_X.\n\nBut we need to find which L_X is not permitted. Since the problem is likely asking for the lowest possible partial waves, let\'s consider L_X=0,1,2, etc.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- If S_final=0: Impossible, leads to contradiction.\n\n- If S_final=1:\n\n    - L_final must be even.\n\n    - L_X must be odd (since L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2 => L_X odd).\n\n    - J_final = L_X must be in the range |L_final -1| to L_final +1.\n\nBut since L_final is even, let\'s consider possible L_final and L_X:\n\nFor L_final=0 (even):\n\n    J_final can be 1 (since S=1, L=0: J=1).\n\n    So L_X=1 (p-wave).\n\nFor L_final=2 (even):\n\n    J_final can be 1,2,3. But L_X must be odd, so J_final=1 or 3. Therefore, L_X=1 or 3 (p-wave or f-wave).\n\nFor L_final=4 (even):\n\n    J_final=3,4,5. L_X=3 or5 (f-wave or h-wave).\n\nBut the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. Since the allowed L_X are odd numbers (1,3,5,...), the even L_X (s-wave, d-wave, g-wave, etc.) are not permitted. However, the initial parity is +1, and the parity of the final state is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{L_X +1} = ... Wait, but we already used parity conservation to get L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. So if L_X is even, then L_final would be odd, but S_final + L_final must be 1 mod2. If L_X is even, then L_final = L_X +1 mod2 = even +1 = odd. Then S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2 => S_final ≡1 - L_final ≡1 -1=0 mod2. So S_final=0. But earlier, we saw that S_final=0 leads to a contradiction because J_final = L_final (which is odd) must equal L_X (which is even), which is impossible. Therefore, even L_X are not allowed.\n\nBut wait, in the case of S_final=1, L_final is even, and L_X is odd. So the allowed L_X are odd. Therefore, even L_X (s, d, g, etc.) are forbidden. However, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and we have to see which partial wave (L_X) is not permitted. If the options include, say, s-wave (L_X=0), d-wave (L_X=2), etc., those would be forbidden. If the options are, for example, s, p, d, f, then the forbidden ones are s, d, etc.\n\nBut since the problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", and given that in the absence of options, but based on standard notation, the likely answer is s-wave (L=0) is not permitted, but according to our analysis, even L_X are forbidden. However, in the case of S_final=1, L_X must be odd. Therefore, s-wave (L=0) is even, so forbidden. p-wave (L=1) is allowed, d-wave (L=2) forbidden, etc.\n\nBut the problem might have specific options. However, since the user hasn\'t provided them, but given the standard multiple-choice options, the most likely answer is s-wave (L=0) is not permitted. But wait, let\'s check again.\n\nWait, in the case of S_final=1 and L_final=0 (even), J_final=1. So L_X=1 (p-wave). So p-wave is allowed. If the question is which is not permitted, and the options include s-wave (L=0), then s-wave is not allowed because L_X must be odd. Similarly, d-wave (L=2) is even, also not allowed. But which one is the answer? The problem might have specific options, but since they are not given, we need to see if there\'s another constraint.\n\nWait, but the initial NN state is in 1S0, which is L_initial=0. When emitting a particle X, the orbital angular momentum L_X is the relative angular momentum between the NN system and the X particle. The change in angular momentum must be accounted for. But we already considered angular momentum conservation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a selection rule based on the possible values of L_X given the initial and final states.\n\nBut based on the analysis, the allowed L_X are odd numbers (1,3,5,...), and even L_X (0,2,4,...) are forbidden. Therefore, if the options include s-wave (L=0), d-wave (L=2), etc., those are forbidden. But the problem asks for "which is not permitted", so likely the answer is s-wave or d-wave, but without options, it\'s hard to say. However, considering that the problem mentions "partial waves", which are usually denoted by lowercase letters: s (L=0), p (L=1), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc. Given that, and the fact that even L_X are forbidden, the answer is either s or d. But in the lowest possible cases, the first forbidden one is s-wave (L=0). However, let\'s check with the specific constraints.\n\nSuppose L_X=0 (s-wave):\n\nThen from parity conservation: L_final ≡0 +1=1 mod2. So L_final is odd.\n\nFrom T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be 0.\n\nBut then, from angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X=0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final (since S_final=0). Therefore, J_final=odd. But J_final must equal L_X=0. Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=0 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, L_X=2 (d-wave):\n\nFrom parity conservation: L_final ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2. So L_final is odd.\n\nFrom T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be 0.\n\nThen J_final = L_X=2. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system: S_final=0, L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=2 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is also impossible.\n\nSimilarly, any even L_X leads to a contradiction. Therefore, all even L_X (s, d, g, etc.) are forbidden. The odd L_X (p, f, etc.) are allowed.\n\nBut the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". Since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but given that this is a standard problem, the most likely answer is the s-wave (L=0), as it\'s the lowest forbidden partial wave. However, in some contexts, the lowest allowed partial wave is the p-wave (L=1), and higher even L are also forbidden. But without options, it\'s ambiguous. However, in the original problem (from where this is taken), the answer is likely the s-wave.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check with the specific case where L_X=0 (s-wave):\n\nAs above, it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, s-wave is forbidden. Similarly, d-wave is forbidden. But if the options include both, but the problem says "which is not permitted", and given that in decay processes, lower L are more probable, the first forbidden one (s-wave) is the answer. However, the problem might have specific options. Since I don\'t have them, but given the thought process, the conclusion is that even L_X are forbidden, so the answer is the s-wave (L=0) if it\'s among the options, otherwise d-wave, etc.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s think again. The problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, S=0, J=0. The emission of X must result in a final NN state with T=0, which requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. The parity conservation gives L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. Angular momentum conservation gives J_final = L_X, and J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state (S_final and L_final combined).\n\nIf we try L_X=0 (s-wave):\n\n- Parity: L_final ≡0 +1=1 mod2 → L_final=1,3,5,...\n\n- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be 0.\n\n- Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=0. But J_final is the combination of S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=0 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=0 is impossible.\n\nIf L_X=1 (p-wave):\n\n- Parity: L_final ≡1 +1=2≡0 mod2 → L_final=0,2,4,...\n\n- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is even, S_final must be1.\n\n- Angular momentum: J_final =1. The final NN state has S_final=1 and L_final=even. The possible J_final are |L_final -1| to L_final +1. For example, if L_final=0, J_final=1. If L_final=2, J_final=1,2,3. So J_final=1 is possible when L_final=0 or 2. Therefore, possible. So L_X=1 is allowed.\n\nIf L_X=2 (d-wave):\n\n- Parity: L_final ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2 → L_final=1,3,5,...\n\n- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final=0.\n\n- Angular momentum: J_final=2. But J_final is combination of S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=2 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, L_X=3 (f-wave):\n\n- Parity: L_final ≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2 → L_final=0,2,4,...\n\n- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final even, S_final=1.\n\n- Angular momentum: J_final=3. The final NN state has S_final=1 and L_final=even. For example, L_final=2: J_final can be1,2,3. So J_final=3 is possible. Therefore, L_X=3 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X: 0,2,4,... So s-wave (L=0), d-wave (L=2), etc., are forbidden. The allowed ones are odd L_X: p-wave (L=1), f-wave (L=3), etc.\n\nSince the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", and given that the options are likely s, p, d, etc., the answer is either s or d. But in the context of the problem, if the options include s-wave, that\'s the answer. If both s and d are options, but the question is which is not permitted, and given that the lowest forbidden is s-wave, but the problem might have specific options. However, since the user hasn\'t provided them, but based on standard problems, the answer is likely the s-wave (L=0), which is not permitted.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check once more. The initial state is 1S0 (J=0). The emitted particle X has L_X. The final NN state must have J_final = L_X. For L_X=0, J_final=0. But the final NN state must have J_final=0. However, the final NN state has S_final=0 or1 and L_final. If J_final=0, then S_final and L_final must combine to 0. For S_final=0, L_final=0. But then T=0 requires S + L =0 +0=0≡1 mod2? No, 0≡1 mod2 is false. So impossible. For S_final=1 and L_final=1, then J_final can be 0,1,2. But J_final=0 is possible. But T=0 requires S + L =1 +1=2≡0 mod2, which contradicts T=0 requires S + L ≡1 mod2. Therefore, even if J_final=0 is possible, the Pauli condition would forbid it. Therefore, L_X=0 is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, the s-wave (L=0) is not permitted. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{s}.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{s}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446066, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7357, prompt_tokens=1863, total_tokens=9220, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) and has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave (angular momentum state of X) is not permitted.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The initial state is 1S0, which means S = 0, L = 0, and J = 0.
   - The parity of the initial state is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1.

2. **Parity Conservation**:
   - The parity of the final state must be conserved. The parity of the final NN system is (-1)^{L_final}, and the parity of particle X is (-1)^{L_X + 1} (since its intrinsic parity is -1).
   - Conservation of parity gives: (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}, leading to L_final ≡ L_X + 1 (mod 2).

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:
   - The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial angular momentum is 0, so the final angular momentum (J_final) of the NN system must equal the angular momentum of the emitted particle (L_X).

4. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:
   - For the final NN state with T(NN) = 0, we have S(NN) + L(NN) ≡ 1 (mod 2).

5. **Analysis of Possible Partial Waves**:
   - **Case 1 (S_final = 0)**:
     - L_final must be odd (from T(NN) = 0).
     - L_X must be even (from parity conservation).
     - Contradiction since J_final = L_final (odd) cannot equal L_X (even).
   - **Case 2 (S_final = 1)**:
     - L_final must be even (from T(NN) = 0).
     - L_X must be odd (from parity conservation).
     - J_final (combination of S_final = 1 and L_final) must equal L_X (odd), which is possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Even L_X (s-wave, d-wave, etc.) are forbidden because they lead to contradictions in angular momentum and parity conservation.
   - The s-wave (L = 0) is specifically forbidden as it results in a contradiction when considering the Pauli exclusion principle and angular momentum conservation.

\boxed{s}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

m is |J_final - L_X| ≤ J_total ≤ J_final + L_X. But since J_total must be zero, the only possibility is J_final = L_X and they are coupled to zero. But for two angular momenta to couple to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which requires that J_final = L_X. Wait, but if J_final and L_X are vectors, then their sum is zero only if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, when you add two angular momenta, the resulting total angular momentum can be from |j1 - j2| to j1 + j2. So if J_final and L_X are such that they can combine to give zero, then they must have the same magnitude. So J_final must equal L_X. Because if J_final is j and L_X is l, then |j - l| ≤ 0 ≤ j + l. The only way this is possible is if j = l and 0 is in the range, which requires j = l and 0 is between |j - l| and j + l. But |j - l| = 0 when j = l, so 0 must be in 0 to 2j. Since 0 is the lower bound, it's allowed. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X, and the coupling is such that J_total = 0. Therefore, J_final = L_X. So the angular momentum of the final NN state must be equal to the angular momentum carried away by the emitted particle X. 

But the initial NN state has J_initial = 0, so the final NN state's J_final must be equal to L_X, and the total angular momentum J_total = J_final + L_X = 0. Wait, but if J_final is a vector and L_X is a vector, their sum is zero. So J_final = -L_X. But in quantum numbers, the magnitude is what matters. So the magnitude of J_final must equal the magnitude of L_X, and they must be able to couple to zero. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So J_final = L_X. Therefore, the angular momentum quantum number of the final NN state is equal to the angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

So, in summary, from angular momentum conservation, we have that the total angular momentum of the final NN state (J_final) must be equal to the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (L_X). And from parity conservation, we have that (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1}, which implies that L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

But we also have the Pauli exclusion principle constraint given in the problem: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, then:

0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 => S(NN) + L(NN) ≡ 1 mod 2.

So the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN state must be odd.

But the final NN state is a two-nucleon system. For two nucleons, which are fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial, spin, isospin, and other parts. Since we're dealing with isospin T(NN) = 0, which is antisymmetric (because for two nucleons, T=0 is the singlet state, which is antisymmetric, and T=1 is the triplet, symmetric). The spin state S(NN) can be 0 (antisymmetric singlet) or 1 (symmetric triplet). The spatial wavefunction has parity (-1)^{L(NN)}, so symmetric if L(NN) is even, antisymmetric if L(NN) is odd.

The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So the product of spatial, spin, and isospin wavefunctions must be antisymmetric. Since the isospin is T=0 (antisymmetric), the product of spatial and spin must be symmetric (because antisymmetric * symmetric = antisymmetric). Therefore:

Spatial * Spin = symmetric.

Spatial symmetry is (-1)^{L(NN)} (since spatial wavefunction under exchange is (-1)^{L}, as exchanging the two particles is equivalent to reversing their relative position vector, which introduces a factor of (-1)^L). Spin symmetry is (-1)^{S(NN) +1} because for two spin-1/2 particles, the spin state is symmetric (triplet, S=1) if (-1)^{S+1} = +1, and antisymmetric (singlet, S=0) if (-1)^{S+1} = -1. Wait, let's check:

For two identical fermions, the spin state symmetry is:

- For S=1 (triplet), the spin state is symmetric, because the triplet states are symmetric under exchange.

- For S=0 (singlet), the spin state is antisymmetric.

Therefore, the symmetry of the spin part is (-1)^{S+1}. Because for S=1: (-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = 1 (symmetric). For S=0: (-1)^{0+1} = -1 (antisymmetric). So yes, the spin part has symmetry (-1)^{S+1}.

Similarly, the spatial part has symmetry (-1)^L. So the product of spatial and spin parts must be symmetric because the isospin part is antisymmetric (T=0), so overall:

(-1)^L * (-1)^{S+1} = +1 (symmetric)

Therefore:

(-1)^{L + S +1} = +1 => L + S +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 => L + S ≡ 1 mod 2.

Which matches the given condition in the problem: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, this gives 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 => S + L ≡1 mod 2. So that's consistent. So the Pauli condition here is already accounted for in the symmetry of the wavefunction.

So, given that, we have:

1. From parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

2. From angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state. The total angular momentum J_final is the sum of the spin S_final and the orbital angular momentum L_final of the NN system. Wait, no. The total angular momentum J is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L and the spin S. But for the NN system, the total angular momentum J_final is the vector sum of their orbital angular momentum L_final and their spin S_final. However, in the term symbol (2S+1)L(J), J is the total angular momentum, which is L_final + S_final. So J_final can take values |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But earlier, we had from angular momentum conservation that J_final must equal L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of L_final and S_final.

This seems more complicated. Let me try to clarify.

The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. After emitting a particle X with orbital angular momentum L_X, the final state consists of the NN system and the X particle. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so the sum of the NN system's angular momentum (J_final) and the X particle's angular momentum (which is L_X, assuming X is spinless or that we're only considering orbital angular momentum) must equal the initial angular momentum, which is 0. Therefore, J_final + L_X = 0. In quantum mechanics, this means that J_final and L_X must be able to couple to zero. For two angular momenta J_final and L_X to couple to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. Because when you add two angular momenta, the only way to get zero is if they are the same magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must be equal to L_X. So J_final = L_X.

But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the vector sum of its spin (S_final) and orbital angular momentum (L_final). So J_final can range from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But we have J_final = L_X. So L_X must be in that range. However, since the problem doesn't specify the possible values of S_final and L_final, we need to relate them through the Pauli condition and the parity conservation.

Given that T(NN) = 0, we have S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2.

From parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

From angular momentum: J_final = L_X, and J_final is the combination of L_final and S_final.

So let's consider possible values of S_final and L_final.

Since the initial state is 1S0, which has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0. After emitting X, the final NN state will have some S_final, L_final, and J_final.

But the spin of the NN system, S_final, can be 0 or 1, since each nucleon has spin 1/2, so combining two spin-1/2 particles gives S=0 or S=1.

Similarly, the orbital angular momentum L_final can be 0,1,2,... but in practice, for low-energy processes, lower L values are more relevant.

But we need to find which partial wave (L_X) is not permitted. The possible partial waves are probably given as options, but since the user hasn't provided them, I need to think in general.

Wait, the problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" But the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was presented as a question to be answered, but in the current prompt, the user is asking me to simulate a thought process. Wait, no, the original problem is in the first paragraph, and the user is asking for a solution. Wait, the initial problem says:

"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity."

But the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, maybe this is a transcription error. Wait, the original problem might have had options, but in the current prompt, they are missing. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction is: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." So perhaps the original problem had options like s-wave, p-wave, etc., but in the current prompt, they are missing. However, given that the user is from a Spanish-speaking country (judging by the email), maybe there was a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a known source where the options are standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is from a textbook or standard problem set where the options are known. For example, common partial waves are s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2), etc. Given that, the answer is likely one of these.

But since the options aren't given, I need to deduce which L_X is not allowed based on the constraints.

Let me proceed step by step.

Given:

1. T(NN) = 0 => S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2.

2. Parity conservation: (-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

3. Angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X, where J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of S_final and L_final.

So, J_final can be |L_final - S_final|, ..., L_final + S_final. But J_final must equal L_X.

Let's consider possible values of S_final (0 or 1) and L_final, and see which L_X are possible.

Case 1: S_final = 0.

Then from T(NN) =0: 0 + L_final ≡1 mod 2 => L_final ≡1 mod 2. So L_final is odd.

From parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, L_X +1 ≡1 mod 2 => L_X ≡0 mod 2. So L_X is even.

From angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final=0 and L_final. Since S_final=0, J_final = L_final. Therefore, J_final = L_final = L_X. But L_final is odd and L_X is even. Contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Therefore, S_final cannot be 0.

Case 2: S_final =1.

From T(NN)=0: 1 + L_final ≡1 mod 2 => L_final ≡0 mod 2. So L_final is even.

From parity conservation: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is even, L_X +1 ≡0 mod 2 => L_X ≡1 mod 2. So L_X is odd.

From angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final=1 and L_final (even). The possible values of J_final are |L_final -1| to L_final +1. Since L_final is even, let's denote L_final = 2k.

So J_final can be 2k -1, 2k, 2k +1. But J_final must equal L_X, which is odd. Therefore, J_final must be either 2k -1 or 2k +1. Both are odd. Since L_X is odd, this is possible.

But we need to check if there exists integers k such that L_X = J_final = 2k ±1, and L_final =2k.

But L_X must be equal to J_final, which is 2k ±1. However, L_X is also equal to J_final. So L_X = 2k ±1, and L_final =2k. But from parity conservation, L_final = L_X +1 mod 2. Since L_final is even and L_X is odd, L_final = L_X +1 mod 2 is satisfied because odd +1 = even.

But we need to ensure that J_final (which is L_X) can be obtained from combining S_final=1 and L_final=2k.

For example, take L_final=0 (k=0). Then J_final can be |0 -1| =1, 0, or 1. But L_final=0, S_final=1, so J_final can be 1. So J_final=1. Then L_X=1. So L_X=1 (p-wave). Is this possible?

Yes. Let's check:

If L_final=0 (even), S_final=1, then J_final=1. Then L_X=1. From parity conservation: L_final=0 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2 => 0 ≡1+1=2≡0 mod 2. Yes. So this works.

Another example: L_final=2 (k=1). Then J_final can be |2-1|=1, 2, or 3. So J_final=1,2,3. But J_final must equal L_X, which is odd. So J_final=1 or 3. Therefore, L_X=1 or 3. Then L_final=2, which is even. From parity conservation: 2 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2. For L_X=1: 2 ≡1+1=2≡0 mod 2. 2 mod 2=0, 2 mod2=0. So 0≡0. Yes. For L_X=3: 2≡3+1=4≡0 mod2. 0≡0. Yes. So both L_X=1 and 3 are allowed when L_final=2.

Similarly, L_final=4 (k=2). J_final=3,4,5. L_X must be odd:3,5. Parity conservation:4≡3+1=4≡0 mod2, yes; 4≡5+1=6≡0 mod2, yes.

So in general, for S_final=1 and L_final even, the possible L_X are odd numbers such that L_X = J_final, which can be L_final ±1. However, L_X must be a non-negative integer. So for each even L_final, there are possible odd L_X.

But we need to find which L_X is not permitted. Since the problem is likely asking for the lowest possible partial waves, let's consider L_X=0,1,2, etc.

From the above analysis:

- If S_final=0: Impossible, leads to contradiction.

- If S_final=1:

    - L_final must be even.

    - L_X must be odd (since L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2 => L_X odd).

    - J_final = L_X must be in the range |L_final -1| to L_final +1.

But since L_final is even, let's consider possible L_final and L_X:

For L_final=0 (even):

    J_final can be 1 (since S=1, L=0: J=1).

    So L_X=1 (p-wave).

For L_final=2 (even):

    J_final can be 1,2,3. But L_X must be odd, so J_final=1 or 3. Therefore, L_X=1 or 3 (p-wave or f-wave).

For L_final=4 (even):

    J_final=3,4,5. L_X=3 or5 (f-wave or h-wave).

But the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. Since the allowed L_X are odd numbers (1,3,5,...), the even L_X (s-wave, d-wave, g-wave, etc.) are not permitted. However, the initial parity is +1, and the parity of the final state is (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{L_X +1} = ... Wait, but we already used parity conservation to get L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. So if L_X is even, then L_final would be odd, but S_final + L_final must be 1 mod2. If L_X is even, then L_final = L_X +1 mod2 = even +1 = odd. Then S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2 => S_final ≡1 - L_final ≡1 -1=0 mod2. So S_final=0. But earlier, we saw that S_final=0 leads to a contradiction because J_final = L_final (which is odd) must equal L_X (which is even), which is impossible. Therefore, even L_X are not allowed.

But wait, in the case of S_final=1, L_final is even, and L_X is odd. So the allowed L_X are odd. Therefore, even L_X (s, d, g, etc.) are forbidden. However, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, and we have to see which partial wave (L_X) is not permitted. If the options include, say, s-wave (L_X=0), d-wave (L_X=2), etc., those would be forbidden. If the options are, for example, s, p, d, f, then the forbidden ones are s, d, etc.

But since the problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", and given that in the absence of options, but based on standard notation, the likely answer is s-wave (L=0) is not permitted, but according to our analysis, even L_X are forbidden. However, in the case of S_final=1, L_X must be odd. Therefore, s-wave (L=0) is even, so forbidden. p-wave (L=1) is allowed, d-wave (L=2) forbidden, etc.

But the problem might have specific options. However, since the user hasn't provided them, but given the standard multiple-choice options, the most likely answer is s-wave (L=0) is not permitted. But wait, let's check again.

Wait, in the case of S_final=1 and L_final=0 (even), J_final=1. So L_X=1 (p-wave). So p-wave is allowed. If the question is which is not permitted, and the options include s-wave (L=0), then s-wave is not allowed because L_X must be odd. Similarly, d-wave (L=2) is even, also not allowed. But which one is the answer? The problem might have specific options, but since they are not given, we need to see if there's another constraint.

Wait, but the initial NN state is in 1S0, which is L_initial=0. When emitting a particle X, the orbital angular momentum L_X is the relative angular momentum between the NN system and the X particle. The change in angular momentum must be accounted for. But we already considered angular momentum conservation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a selection rule based on the possible values of L_X given the initial and final states.

But based on the analysis, the allowed L_X are odd numbers (1,3,5,...), and even L_X (0,2,4,...) are forbidden. Therefore, if the options include s-wave (L=0), d-wave (L=2), etc., those are forbidden. But the problem asks for "which is not permitted", so likely the answer is s-wave or d-wave, but without options, it's hard to say. However, considering that the problem mentions "partial waves", which are usually denoted by lowercase letters: s (L=0), p (L=1), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc. Given that, and the fact that even L_X are forbidden, the answer is either s or d. But in the lowest possible cases, the first forbidden one is s-wave (L=0). However, let's check with the specific constraints.

Suppose L_X=0 (s-wave):

Then from parity conservation: L_final ≡0 +1=1 mod2. So L_final is odd.

From T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be 0.

But then, from angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X=0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final (since S_final=0). Therefore, J_final=odd. But J_final must equal L_X=0. Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=0 is impossible.

Similarly, L_X=2 (d-wave):

From parity conservation: L_final ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2. So L_final is odd.

From T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be 0.

Then J_final = L_X=2. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system: S_final=0, L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=2 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is also impossible.

Similarly, any even L_X leads to a contradiction. Therefore, all even L_X (s, d, g, etc.) are forbidden. The odd L_X (p, f, etc.) are allowed.

But the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". Since the user hasn't provided the options, but given that this is a standard problem, the most likely answer is the s-wave (L=0), as it's the lowest forbidden partial wave. However, in some contexts, the lowest allowed partial wave is the p-wave (L=1), and higher even L are also forbidden. But without options, it's ambiguous. However, in the original problem (from where this is taken), the answer is likely the s-wave.

But wait, let's check with the specific case where L_X=0 (s-wave):

As above, it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, s-wave is forbidden. Similarly, d-wave is forbidden. But if the options include both, but the problem says "which is not permitted", and given that in decay processes, lower L are more probable, the first forbidden one (s-wave) is the answer. However, the problem might have specific options. Since I don't have them, but given the thought process, the conclusion is that even L_X are forbidden, so the answer is the s-wave (L=0) if it's among the options, otherwise d-wave, etc.

But to confirm, let's think again. The problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, S=0, J=0. The emission of X must result in a final NN state with T=0, which requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. The parity conservation gives L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. Angular momentum conservation gives J_final = L_X, and J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state (S_final and L_final combined).

If we try L_X=0 (s-wave):

- Parity: L_final ≡0 +1=1 mod2 → L_final=1,3,5,...

- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be 0.

- Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=0. But J_final is the combination of S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=0 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=0 is impossible.

If L_X=1 (p-wave):

- Parity: L_final ≡1 +1=2≡0 mod2 → L_final=0,2,4,...

- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is even, S_final must be1.

- Angular momentum: J_final =1. The final NN state has S_final=1 and L_final=even. The possible J_final are |L_final -1| to L_final +1. For example, if L_final=0, J_final=1. If L_final=2, J_final=1,2,3. So J_final=1 is possible when L_final=0 or 2. Therefore, possible. So L_X=1 is allowed.

If L_X=2 (d-wave):

- Parity: L_final ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2 → L_final=1,3,5,...

- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S_final=0.

- Angular momentum: J_final=2. But J_final is combination of S_final=0 and L_final=odd. So J_final = L_final=odd. But J_final=2 (even). Contradiction. Therefore, L_X=2 is forbidden.

Similarly, L_X=3 (f-wave):

- Parity: L_final ≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2 → L_final=0,2,4,...

- T=0: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final even, S_final=1.

- Angular momentum: J_final=3. The final NN state has S_final=1 and L_final=even. For example, L_final=2: J_final can be1,2,3. So J_final=3 is possible. Therefore, L_X=3 is allowed.

Therefore, the forbidden partial waves are those with even L_X: 0,2,4,... So s-wave (L=0), d-wave (L=2), etc., are forbidden. The allowed ones are odd L_X: p-wave (L=1), f-wave (L=3), etc.

Since the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", and given that the options are likely s, p, d, etc., the answer is either s or d. But in the context of the problem, if the options include s-wave, that's the answer. If both s and d are options, but the question is which is not permitted, and given that the lowest forbidden is s-wave, but the problem might have specific options. However, since the user hasn't provided them, but based on standard problems, the answer is likely the s-wave (L=0), which is not permitted.

But wait, let's check once more. The initial state is 1S0 (J=0). The emitted particle X has L_X. The final NN state must have J_final = L_X. For L_X=0, J_final=0. But the final NN state must have J_final=0. However, the final NN state has S_final=0 or1 and L_final. If J_final=0, then S_final and L_final must combine to 0. For S_final=0, L_final=0. But then T=0 requires S + L =0 +0=0≡1 mod2? No, 0≡1 mod2 is false. So impossible. For S_final=1 and L_final=1, then J_final can be 0,1,2. But J_final=0 is possible. But T=0 requires S + L =1 +1=2≡0 mod2, which contradicts T=0 requires S + L ≡1 mod2. Therefore, even if J_final=0 is possible, the Pauli condition would forbid it. Therefore, L_X=0 is forbidden.

Therefore, the s-wave (L=0) is not permitted. Hence, the answer is \boxed{s}.


**Final Answer**

Parity_initial = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1.\n\n2. **Emission of X:** The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1 and carries away orbital angular momentum L_X. The parity of the X particle\'s contribution is (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^(L_X + 1).\n\n3. **Final NN State:** The final NN system will have some spin S_final, orbital angular momentum L_final, and total angular momentum J_final. The parity of the final NN system is (-1)^L_final.\n\n4. **Parity Conservation:** Parity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_X. So:\n   +1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1)^(L_X + 1)\n  => (-1)^(L_final + L_X + 1) = +1\n  => L_final + L_X + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2\n  => L_final ≡ (L_X + 1) mod 2.\n\n5. **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum before emission is J_initial = 0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of J_final (from the NN system) and L_X (from the emitted X). Since J_initial = 0, we must have J_final = L_X. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction. Since angular momentum is quantized, J_final must be equal to L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the vector sum of S_final and L_final. However, in the term symbol, J is the total angular momentum, so J_final = |S_final - L_final|, ..., S_final + L_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, we have that L_X must be in the range of possible J_final values given S_final and L_final.\n\n6. **Pauli Statistics Constraint:** The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, and T(NN) = 0. Therefore:\n   0 ≡ S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2\n   => S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo S_final and L_final must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n\nNow, let\'s consider possible partial waves (L_X) and see which ones are allowed or not.\n\nFirst, let\'s note that the possible values of L_X (the angular momentum of the emitted particle X) must satisfy J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is determined by S_final and L_final. Since the initial state has J=0, the emitted X\'s angular momentum L_X must exactly cancel the final NN\'s J_final. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So J_final = L_X.\n\nBut J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN system, which is the combination of S_final (spin) and L_final (orbital). So J_final can range from |S_final - L_final| to S_final + L_final in integer steps. However, since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific integer, we need to find possible S_final and L_final such that J_final = L_X, and also satisfy the Pauli constraint S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2, and the parity constraint L_final ≡ L_X + 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me consider possible L_X values (the partial waves) and check if they can satisfy all constraints.\n\nLet\'s list possible L_X values (the problem mentions "partial waves" which are denoted by lowercase letters, so s, p, d, f, etc., corresponding to L_X=0,1,2,3,...). The question is which of these is not permitted. Let\'s check each possible L_X.\n\nBut since the problem gives options, but they aren\'t listed here, I need to think through the possible cases. Wait, the user hasn\'t provided the options, but the original problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", but the user hasn\'t included the options. Wait, the original problem is as presented in the user\'s first paragraph. Wait, no, the user is asking me to answer based on the given problem. Wait, the problem says "Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" But the user hasn\'t provided the options. Wait, maybe the options are standard, but perhaps the user is expecting me to figure out possible L_X and see which is forbidden. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a standard source, but since the user hasn\'t provided the options, maybe I need to proceed with the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider possible L_X and determine which is not allowed. Let\'s proceed.\n\nLet me consider possible L_X values (s, p, d, f, etc.) and check for each if there\'s a possible S_final and L_final that satisfy all constraints.\n\nFor each L_X:\n\n1. **Case L_X = 0 (s-wave):**\n\n   - From parity constraint: L_final ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2 ⇒ L_final is odd (1,3,5...)\n   - From Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be even (0,2,4...)\n   - Angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X = 0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So J_final = 0. The possible combinations of S_final and L_final must allow for J_final = 0. Since L_final is odd and S_final is even, can they combine to J_final=0?\n\n   Let\'s take the smallest possible L_final=1 (since higher L_final would require higher S_final, but let\'s check if possible). If L_final=1, then S_final must be even (0,2,...). Let\'s take S_final=0. Then possible J_final values are |0-1| to 0+1 ⇒ J_final=1. But we need J_final=0. So this doesn\'t work. Next, S_final=2. Then possible J_final ranges from |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. Still no J_final=0. Similarly, higher S_final would not help. Therefore, with L_final=1 and S_final even, J_final can\'t be 0. If L_final=3, S_final even, then possible J_final ranges from |S_final -3| to S_final +3. For S_final=0, J_final=3; S_final=2, J_final=1 to 5; etc. Still no J_final=0. Therefore, for L_X=0, there\'s no possible S_final and L_final that satisfy J_final=0. Hence, L_X=0 (s-wave) is not allowed.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, if L_X=0, then J_final must be 0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final (spin) combined with L_final (orbital). So for J_final=0, we need that S_final and L_final can combine to 0. That requires S_final = L_final and their combination allows for J=0. For example, if S_final=1 and L_final=1, then possible J=0,1,2. But in our case, S_final must be even (since L_final is odd and S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2 ⇒ S_final even). So S_final=0,2,4... and L_final=1,3,5...\n\nIf S_final=0 and L_final=1, then J_final can only be 1. If S_final=2 and L_final=1, J_final can be 1,2,3. If S_final=0 and L_final=3, J_final=3. So no way to get J_final=0. Therefore, L_X=0 (s-wave) is not allowed. So s-wave is forbidden.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check other possibilities. Maybe higher L_final and S_final. But even if L_final=1 and S_final=0, J_final=1. So no. Therefore, L_X=0 is not allowed.\n\n2. **Case L_X=1 (p-wave):**\n\n   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡1 +1 ≡2 ≡0 mod 2 ⇒ L_final even (0,2,4...)\n   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final even, S_final must be odd (1,3,5...)\n   - Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=1. So the final NN state must have J_final=1.\n\n   Let\'s see possible S_final and L_final combinations where L_final is even and S_final is odd. Let\'s take the smallest L_final=0 (even). Then S_final must be odd (1,3...). If L_final=0, then J_final = S_final. So to have J_final=1, S_final=1. Then S_final=1, L_final=0. This works because S_final=1 (odd) and L_final=0 (even), so S_final + L_final=1+0=1 ≡1 mod 2, which satisfies the Pauli constraint. Then J_final=1 (since L_final=0, J_final=S_final=1). Therefore, this is possible. So L_X=1 (p-wave) is allowed.\n\n3. **Case L_X=2 (d-wave):**\n\n   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡2 +1=3 ≡1 mod 2 ⇒ L_final odd (1,3,5...)\n   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be even (0,2,4...)\n   - Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=2. So the final NN state must have J_final=2.\n\n   Let\'s take L_final=1 (smallest odd). Then S_final must be even. Let\'s try S_final=0. Then combining S_final=0 and L_final=1 gives J_final=1. Not 2. Next, S_final=2. Then possible J_final from |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. So J_final=1,2,3. So J_final=2 is possible. Therefore, S_final=2, L_final=1. Then S_final + L_final=2+1=3 ≡1 mod 2, which satisfies Pauli. So this works. Therefore, L_X=2 (d-wave) is allowed.\n\n4. **Case L_X=3 (f-wave):**\n\n   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡3 +1=4 ≡0 mod 2 ⇒ L_final even (0,2,4...)\n   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final even, S_final must be odd (1,3...)\n   - Angular momentum: J_final=3.\n\n   Let\'s take L_final=0 (even). Then S_final must be odd. If S_final=3, then J_final=3 (since L_final=0, J_final=S_final=3). Then S_final + L_final=3+0=3 ≡1 mod 2. This works. So L_X=3 (f-wave) is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, higher L_X can be checked, but the pattern continues. The key point is that for even L_X, L_final must be odd, and vice versa, and the Pauli constraint requires S_final and L_final to sum to 1 mod 2. Then, by choosing appropriate S_final and L_final, J_final can match L_X.\n\nBut in the case of L_X=0 (s-wave), there\'s no possible S_final and L_final that satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the forbidden partial wave is s-wave (L_X=0).\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. The emission of X must conserve angular momentum. The emitted X has angular momentum L_X, and the final NN system has J_final. Since the initial J=0, the total angular momentum after emission must be J_final + L_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so their vector sum must be zero. This implies that J_final and L_X must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The forbidden partial wave is the **s-wave** (L_X = 0). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial State (1S₀):**  
   - Spin \( S = 0 \), orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \), total angular momentum \( J = 0 \).  
   - Parity: \( (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Emission of Particle X:**  
   - Intrinsic parity of X: \( -1 \).  
   - Parity contribution from X: \( (-1) \times (-1)^{L_X} = (-1)^{L_X + 1} \).

3. **Final NN System Parity:**  
   - Parity: \( (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \), where \( L_{\text{final}} \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.  
   - Parity conservation:  
     \[
     1 = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \times (-1)^{L_X + 1} \implies L_{\text{final}} + L_X + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2.
     \]

4. **Pauli Statistics Constraint:**  
   - \( T(\text{NN}) = S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) + 1 \mod 2 \), with \( T(\text{NN}) = 0 \).  
   - Thus, \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).

5. **Angular Momentum Conservation:**  
   - Initial \( J = 0 \), so \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \).  
   - \( J_{\text{final}} \) must result from coupling \( S_{\text{final}} \) and \( L_{\text{final}} \).

6. **Forbidden Case (L_X = 0, s-wave):**  
   - Parity constraint: \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) (odd).  
   - Pauli constraint: \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \implies S_{\text{final}} \) even.  
   - Angular momentum: \( J_{\text{final}} = 0 \).  
   - No combination of even \( S_{\text{final}} \) and odd \( L_{\text{final}} \) can produce \( J_{\text{final}} = 0 \).  

**Conclusion:** The s-wave (L_X = 0) is not permitted. 

**Answer:** \boxed{s}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Let me break down the steps:

1. **Initial State (1S0):** S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0. Parity_initial = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1.

2. **Emission of X:** The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1 and carries away orbital angular momentum L_X. The parity of the X particle's contribution is (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^(L_X + 1).

3. **Final NN State:** The final NN system will have some spin S_final, orbital angular momentum L_final, and total angular momentum J_final. The parity of the final NN system is (-1)^L_final.

4. **Parity Conservation:** Parity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_X. So:
   +1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1)^(L_X + 1)
  => (-1)^(L_final + L_X + 1) = +1
  => L_final + L_X + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2
  => L_final ≡ (L_X + 1) mod 2.

5. **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum before emission is J_initial = 0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of J_final (from the NN system) and L_X (from the emitted X). Since J_initial = 0, we must have J_final = L_X. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction. Since angular momentum is quantized, J_final must be equal to L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the vector sum of S_final and L_final. However, in the term symbol, J is the total angular momentum, so J_final = |S_final - L_final|, ..., S_final + L_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, we have that L_X must be in the range of possible J_final values given S_final and L_final.

6. **Pauli Statistics Constraint:** The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, and T(NN) = 0. Therefore:
   0 ≡ S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2
   => S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S_final and L_final must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).

Now, let's consider possible partial waves (L_X) and see which ones are allowed or not.

First, let's note that the possible values of L_X (the angular momentum of the emitted particle X) must satisfy J_final = L_X. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is determined by S_final and L_final. Since the initial state has J=0, the emitted X's angular momentum L_X must exactly cancel the final NN's J_final. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So J_final = L_X.

But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN system, which is the combination of S_final (spin) and L_final (orbital). So J_final can range from |S_final - L_final| to S_final + L_final in integer steps. However, since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific integer, we need to find possible S_final and L_final such that J_final = L_X, and also satisfy the Pauli constraint S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2, and the parity constraint L_final ≡ L_X + 1 mod 2.

Let me consider possible L_X values (the partial waves) and check if they can satisfy all constraints.

Let's list possible L_X values (the problem mentions "partial waves" which are denoted by lowercase letters, so s, p, d, f, etc., corresponding to L_X=0,1,2,3,...). The question is which of these is not permitted. Let's check each possible L_X.

But since the problem gives options, but they aren't listed here, I need to think through the possible cases. Wait, the user hasn't provided the options, but the original problem says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted", but the user hasn't included the options. Wait, the original problem is as presented in the user's first paragraph. Wait, no, the user is asking me to answer based on the given problem. Wait, the problem says "Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" But the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, maybe the options are standard, but perhaps the user is expecting me to figure out possible L_X and see which is forbidden. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a standard source, but since the user hasn't provided the options, maybe I need to proceed with the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider possible L_X and determine which is not allowed. Let's proceed.

Let me consider possible L_X values (s, p, d, f, etc.) and check for each if there's a possible S_final and L_final that satisfy all constraints.

For each L_X:

1. **Case L_X = 0 (s-wave):**

   - From parity constraint: L_final ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 2 ⇒ L_final is odd (1,3,5...)
   - From Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be even (0,2,4...)
   - Angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X = 0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So J_final = 0. The possible combinations of S_final and L_final must allow for J_final = 0. Since L_final is odd and S_final is even, can they combine to J_final=0?

   Let's take the smallest possible L_final=1 (since higher L_final would require higher S_final, but let's check if possible). If L_final=1, then S_final must be even (0,2,...). Let's take S_final=0. Then possible J_final values are |0-1| to 0+1 ⇒ J_final=1. But we need J_final=0. So this doesn't work. Next, S_final=2. Then possible J_final ranges from |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. Still no J_final=0. Similarly, higher S_final would not help. Therefore, with L_final=1 and S_final even, J_final can't be 0. If L_final=3, S_final even, then possible J_final ranges from |S_final -3| to S_final +3. For S_final=0, J_final=3; S_final=2, J_final=1 to 5; etc. Still no J_final=0. Therefore, for L_X=0, there's no possible S_final and L_final that satisfy J_final=0. Hence, L_X=0 (s-wave) is not allowed.

Wait, but let me check again. Wait, if L_X=0, then J_final must be 0. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is S_final (spin) combined with L_final (orbital). So for J_final=0, we need that S_final and L_final can combine to 0. That requires S_final = L_final and their combination allows for J=0. For example, if S_final=1 and L_final=1, then possible J=0,1,2. But in our case, S_final must be even (since L_final is odd and S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2 ⇒ S_final even). So S_final=0,2,4... and L_final=1,3,5...

If S_final=0 and L_final=1, then J_final can only be 1. If S_final=2 and L_final=1, J_final can be 1,2,3. If S_final=0 and L_final=3, J_final=3. So no way to get J_final=0. Therefore, L_X=0 (s-wave) is not allowed. So s-wave is forbidden.

But wait, let's check other possibilities. Maybe higher L_final and S_final. But even if L_final=1 and S_final=0, J_final=1. So no. Therefore, L_X=0 is not allowed.

2. **Case L_X=1 (p-wave):**

   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡1 +1 ≡2 ≡0 mod 2 ⇒ L_final even (0,2,4...)
   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final even, S_final must be odd (1,3,5...)
   - Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=1. So the final NN state must have J_final=1.

   Let's see possible S_final and L_final combinations where L_final is even and S_final is odd. Let's take the smallest L_final=0 (even). Then S_final must be odd (1,3...). If L_final=0, then J_final = S_final. So to have J_final=1, S_final=1. Then S_final=1, L_final=0. This works because S_final=1 (odd) and L_final=0 (even), so S_final + L_final=1+0=1 ≡1 mod 2, which satisfies the Pauli constraint. Then J_final=1 (since L_final=0, J_final=S_final=1). Therefore, this is possible. So L_X=1 (p-wave) is allowed.

3. **Case L_X=2 (d-wave):**

   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡2 +1=3 ≡1 mod 2 ⇒ L_final odd (1,3,5...)
   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final is odd, S_final must be even (0,2,4...)
   - Angular momentum: J_final = L_X=2. So the final NN state must have J_final=2.

   Let's take L_final=1 (smallest odd). Then S_final must be even. Let's try S_final=0. Then combining S_final=0 and L_final=1 gives J_final=1. Not 2. Next, S_final=2. Then possible J_final from |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. So J_final=1,2,3. So J_final=2 is possible. Therefore, S_final=2, L_final=1. Then S_final + L_final=2+1=3 ≡1 mod 2, which satisfies Pauli. So this works. Therefore, L_X=2 (d-wave) is allowed.

4. **Case L_X=3 (f-wave):**

   - Parity constraint: L_final ≡3 +1=4 ≡0 mod 2 ⇒ L_final even (0,2,4...)
   - Pauli constraint: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod 2. Since L_final even, S_final must be odd (1,3...)
   - Angular momentum: J_final=3.

   Let's take L_final=0 (even). Then S_final must be odd. If S_final=3, then J_final=3 (since L_final=0, J_final=S_final=3). Then S_final + L_final=3+0=3 ≡1 mod 2. This works. So L_X=3 (f-wave) is allowed.

Similarly, higher L_X can be checked, but the pattern continues. The key point is that for even L_X, L_final must be odd, and vice versa, and the Pauli constraint requires S_final and L_final to sum to 1 mod 2. Then, by choosing appropriate S_final and L_final, J_final can match L_X.

But in the case of L_X=0 (s-wave), there's no possible S_final and L_final that satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the forbidden partial wave is s-wave (L_X=0).

But wait, let me check again. The problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. The emission of X must conserve angular momentum. The emitted X has angular momentum L_X, and the final NN system has J_final. Since the initial J=0, the total angular momentum after emission must be J_final + L_X = 0. But angular momentum is a vector, so their vector sum must be zero. This implies that J_final and L_X must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, J_final must equal L_X. So J_final = L_X.

But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN system, which is the combination of S_final and L_final (the orbital angular momentum between the two nucleons). So J_final can range from |S_final - L_final| to S_final + L_final. Therefore, for J_final to equal L_X, there must exist some S_final and L_final such that L_X is within that range. However, in the case of L_X=0, we saw that it's impossible because S_final and L_final can't combine to 0 given the constraints. Therefore, s-wave (L_X=0) is forbidden.

Thus, the answer should be the s-wave, which corresponds to L_X=0, denoted by the letter 's'. Therefore, the forbidden partial wave is s-wave.

The total wavefunction is the product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial = 0, S_initial = 0. The antisymmetry condition would then require the product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts to be antisymmetric. Since L_initial = 0 (symmetric spatial), S_initial = 0 (antisymmetric spin), the isospin must be symmetric (since (-1)^{L + S + T} = -1 for antisymmetry). Therefore, T_initial must be 1 (symmetric) because S=0 (antisymmetric) and L=0 (symmetric), so 0 + 0 + T_initial must be odd. Hence, T_initial = 1.\n\nBut after emission, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is 0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2, so S + L must be 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L of the final NN state must sum to an odd number.\n\nNow, the final NN state\'s spin S can be 0 or 1 (since two spin-1/2 particles can combine to S=0 or S=1). The orbital angular momentum L_final (from the NN system) must combine with S to form J_final. But the problem states that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so J is the total angular momentum, which is the combination of L and S. However, in the emission process, the X particle\'s angular momentum L_X must combine with the final NN state\'s J_final to give the initial J_initial = 0. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction. Since J_initial is 0, the vector sum of J_final and L_X must be zero. Hence, J_final = L_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude. So, L_X must equal J_final.\n\nBut J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So, J_final can range from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. However, since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific value, this imposes constraints on possible L_X.\n\nBut perhaps there\'s a simpler approach. Let\'s recap:\n\n1. Initial state: 1S0 => S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0, T_initial = 1 (from antisymmetry condition).\n2. Final state: T(NN) = 0. According to the given condition, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 => S + L = 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L of the final NN state must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n3. Parity conservation: Initial parity is +1. Final parity is (Final NN parity) * (X\'s parity). X\'s parity is (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} (intrinsic parity -1 and spatial parity (-1)^{L_X}).\n   So, 1 = [(-1)^{L_final}] * [(-1)^{L_X +1}]\n   => (-1)^{L_final + L_X +1} = 1\n   => L_final + L_X +1 ≡ 0 mod 2\n   => L_final + L_X ≡ 1 mod 2\n4. Angular momentum conservation: The initial angular momentum is 0. The total angular momentum after emission is the vector sum of the final NN state\'s J_final and the X\'s angular momentum L_X. Since J_initial = 0, we must have J_final + L_X = 0. Therefore, J_final = L_X in magnitude and direction. But quantum mechanically, the coupling of J_final and L_X must result in a total of 0. This implies that J_final and L_X must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, in terms of quantum numbers, the possible J_final must be such that there\'s a coupling with L_X to give 0. This is only possible if J_final = L_X, and their coupling (as vectors) cancels. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So, L_X must be equal to J_final. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN system, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So, J_final can take values |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific integer (since angular momentum is quantized), this imposes constraints.\n\nBut perhaps we can approach this step by step. Let\'s consider possible final states of the NN system. Since T(NN) = 0, and from the Pauli condition S + L must be odd. So possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: S = 0, L = 1 (since 0 +1 =1, which is odd)\nCase 2: S =1, L =0 (1 +0 =1, odd)\nCase 3: S=1, L=2 (1+2=3, odd)\nCase 4: S=0, L=3 (0+3=3, odd)\nEtc. But we need to consider possible L and S values. Since the nucleons are in a state with some L_final and S_final, and J_final is the combination of those. Then, the possible J_final for each (S_final, L_final) would be from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, which is the angular momentum of the emitted particle, we can check possible L_X values.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to look at the possible partial waves (L_X) and see which one is forbidden. The possible partial waves are labeled by lowercase letters: s (L=0), p (L=1), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc. The question is which of these is not permitted.\n\nLet\'s consider each possible final NN state (S_final, L_final) that satisfies S + L odd, and then check if the corresponding L_X (which must equal J_final) is possible, considering parity and angular momentum conservation.\n\nFirst, possible (S_final, L_final) pairs:\n\n1. S=0, L=1: Then J_final can be 1 (since |1-0| to 1+0). So J_final=1. Therefore, L_X must be 1 (p-wave). Then check parity: From parity conservation, L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. Here, L_final=1, L_X=1. 1 +1=2 ≡0 mod 2. But we need L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. So this would violate parity. Wait, but let\'s check again.\n\nWait, parity equation: L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. So if L_final=1 and L_X=1, 1+1=2≡0 mod2. Which is not 1. So this combination would not satisfy parity. Therefore, this case is not allowed. But wait, but J_final=1 and L_X=1. So this would require that the parity condition is violated. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Therefore, if the final NN state is S=0, L=1, then L_X=1 (p-wave) is not allowed. But wait, but maybe there\'s a mistake here.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the parity condition. The parity conservation equation was:\n\n(-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{L_X +1} =1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-1)^{L_final + L_X +1} =1\n\nTherefore, L_final + L_X +1 must be even, so L_final + L_X must be odd. So L_final + L_X ≡1 mod2. Therefore, if L_final=1 and L_X=1, sum is 2≡0 mod2, which is not 1. Hence, parity is violated. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Therefore, if the final NN state is S=0, L=1, then L_X=1 (p-wave) is not allowed. But J_final=1, so L_X must be 1. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, the final NN state cannot be S=0, L=1. But wait, but the problem is about the allowed partial waves of X. So if the final state requires L_X=1, but parity forbids it, then p-wave is forbidden. But we need to check all possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider the other possible (S_final, L_final) pairs.\n\nCase 2: S=1, L=0. Then J_final can be 1 (since |0-1|=1 to 0+1=1). So J_final=1. Therefore, L_X=1 (p-wave). Now check parity: L_final=0, L_X=1. Sum 0+1=1≡1 mod2. So parity is satisfied. Therefore, this combination is allowed. So p-wave is allowed in this case.\n\nCase3: S=1, L=2. Then J_final can be |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. So possible J_final=1,2,3. Therefore, L_X can be 1,2,3. Let\'s check each possibility.\n\nIf J_final=1, L_X=1. Then L_final=2, L_X=1. Sum 2+1=3≡1 mod2. Parity satisfied. So allowed.\n\nIf J_final=2, L_X=2. Sum 2+2=4≡0 mod2. Parity violated. So not allowed.\n\nIf J_final=3, L_X=3. Sum 2+3=5≡1 mod2. Parity satisfied. So allowed.\n\nBut the possible L_X here would be 1,3. So d-wave (L=2) would not be allowed here. But wait, J_final=2 would require L_X=2, which is d-wave, but parity is violated. So d-wave would be forbidden in this case. But this is only one possible scenario. However, we need to check all possible (S_final, L_final) pairs and see which L_X is impossible in all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p-wave, but in the first case, p-wave was forbidden, but in the second case, p-wave was allowed. So it\'s possible for p-wave to be allowed in some cases. Therefore, the forbidden partial wave must be one that cannot occur in any allowed scenario.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider all possible (S_final, L_final) pairs with S + L odd, and see which L_X are possible.\n\nPossible S_final and L_final:\n\n- S=0, L=1: J_final=1. L_X=1. Parity: 1+1=2≡0≠1. Forbidden.\n- S=1, L=0: J_final=1. L_X=1. Parity:0+1=1≡1. Allowed. So p-wave allowed here.\n- S=1, L=2: J_final=1,2,3. L_X=1,2,3. Parity for L_X=1: 2+1=3≡1. Allowed. L_X=2: 2+2=4≡0. Forbidden. L_X=3:2+3=5≡1. Allowed.\n- S=0, L=3: J_final=3. L_X=3. Parity:3+3=6≡0. Forbidden.\n- S=1, L=4: J_final=3,4,5. L_X=3,4,5. Parity:4+3=7≡1, 4+4=8≡0, 4+5=9≡1. So L_X=3 and 5 allowed, 4 forbidden.\n\nBut the problem is likely considering lower partial waves. The possible options given in the problem are likely among s, p, d, f, etc. But since the problem doesn\'t list the options, but the user asks to provide the answer, perhaps the answer is d-wave (L=2). But let\'s check.\n\nWait, in the case of S=1, L=2, J_final=2 would require L_X=2 (d-wave), but parity is violated. So d-wave is forbidden in that scenario. However, in other scenarios, like S=1, L=0, J_final=1 (L_X=1, p-wave allowed). So d-wave is forbidden in some cases but allowed in others? Wait, but if there\'s no scenario where d-wave is allowed, then it\'s forbidden. But in the case of S=1, L=2, J_final=3, L_X=3 (f-wave), which is allowed. But d-wave (L=2) is forbidden here. However, if there\'s another scenario where d-wave is allowed, then it\'s not universally forbidden. But perhaps there\'s no scenario where d-wave is allowed.\n\nWait, let\'s check another possible (S_final, L_final) pair. For example, S=0, L=1: J_final=1, L_X=1 (p-wave), but parity forbids it. S=1, L=0: J_final=1, L_X=1 (p-wave allowed). S=1, L=2: J_final=1,3 (L_X=1,3 allowed), J_final=2 (L_X=2 forbidden). S=0, L=3: J_final=3, L_X=3 (forbidden). S=1, L=4: J_final=3,5 (allowed), J_final=4 (forbidden). So in all cases, even L_X (d-wave, L=2; g-wave, L=4) are forbidden when combined with even L_final. But for d-wave (L=2), the only scenario where L_X=2 is when J_final=2, which requires S=1, L=2. But in that case, parity is violated. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden in that scenario and there\'s no other scenario where L_X=2 is allowed. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe s-wave (L=0). Let\'s check. For L_X=0 (s-wave), what\'s required?\n\nIf L_X=0, then from parity condition: L_final +0 ≡1 mod2 => L_final ≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. Also, from angular momentum conservation, J_final must equal L_X=0. Therefore, J_final=0. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So J_final=0 can only occur if S_final and L_final can combine to 0. For example, S=0 and L=0, but S + L must be odd (from T=0 condition). S=0, L=0 would sum to 0, which is even, violating the T=0 condition. Alternatively, S=1 and L=1. Then S + L =2, which is even, also violating T=0. Wait, but T=0 requires S + L odd. So if L_final is odd, then S_final must be even (0) to make S + L odd. Wait, S_final can be 0 or 1. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be 0 (since 0 + odd = odd). So S_final=0, L_final=1,3,5,... Then J_final must be 0. But S=0 and L_final=1: J_final=1. So J_final=1, but L_X=0. Therefore, angular momentum conservation requires J_final = L_X=0. But J_final=1 ≠0. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, s-wave (L_X=0) is impossible because there\'s no way to have J_final=0. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.\n\nWait, this is a new angle. Let\'s check this.\n\nIf X is emitted in s-wave (L_X=0), then J_final must be 0 (since J_initial=0). But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. To have J_final=0, we need S_final and L_final to combine to 0. This requires S_final = L_final and they couple to J=0. For example, S=1 and L=1 can couple to J=0 (but that\'s possible only if they are anti-aligned). However, S=1 and L=1 can give J=0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. But let\'s check the T=0 condition. T=0 requires S + L ≡1 mod2. If S=1 and L=1, sum is 2≡0 mod2, which violates T=0. Therefore, this combination is forbidden. Alternatively, S=0 and L=0. Then J=0. But S + L =0≡0 mod2, which violates T=0. Therefore, there\'s no way to have J_final=0 with T=0. Therefore, s-wave (L_X=0) is impossible. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.\n\nBut earlier, we considered that p-wave (L_X=1) is allowed in some cases. Similarly, d-wave (L_X=2) is forbidden in some cases but maybe allowed in others. Wait, but according to this analysis, s-wave is forbidden. But the problem states that the answer is one of the partial waves, and the options likely include s, p, d, etc. But the user hasn\'t provided the options, but the original problem (from an exam) probably lists them. However, since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but asks to provide the answer, I need to deduce which is forbidden.\n\nFrom the above analysis, s-wave (L=0) is forbidden because there\'s no possible final NN state with J_final=0 that satisfies T=0 and the parity condition. Similarly, d-wave (L=2) might be forbidden in some cases but allowed in others. However, let\'s verify.\n\nWait, let\'s check if d-wave (L_X=2) is possible. For L_X=2, J_final must be 2. Then, from angular momentum conservation, J_final=2. The final NN state must have J_final=2, which is a combination of S_final and L_final. Also, T=0 requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Let\'s see possible combinations:\n\nCase: J_final=2. Possible (S_final, L_final) pairs:\n\n- S=0, L=2: J=2. But S + L =0+2=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=1: Can couple to J=0,1,2. If J=2, then S=1, L=1. S + L=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=3: Can couple to J=2 (since |3-1|=2 to 3+1=4). So J=2 is possible. S + L=1+3=4≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.\n- S=0, L=2: Already checked.\n- S=1, L=2: Can couple to J=1,2,3. If J=2, then S=1, L=2. S + L=3≡1 mod2, satisfying T=0. So this is allowed. Then, L_final=2, S_final=1. Then check parity: L_final + L_X ≡1 mod2. L_final=2, L_X=2. 2+2=4≡0 mod2. Not 1. Parity violated. Therefore, this combination is forbidden. Therefore, even though the T=0 condition is satisfied, parity is violated. Hence, d-wave (L_X=2) is forbidden in this case.\n\nAlternatively, is there another (S_final, L_final) pair that allows J_final=2 and satisfies T=0?\n\nS=1, L=3: J=2 is possible. S + L=4≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.\n\nS=0, L=3: J=3. Not 2. Disregard.\n\nS=1, L=2: J=2 is possible, but parity violated.\n\nTherefore, there\'s no allowed (S_final, L_final) pair that allows J_final=2 (L_X=2) with T=0 and parity conservation. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that s-wave is also forbidden. So which one is the answer?\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine s-wave. For L_X=0, J_final=0. To have J_final=0, the final NN state must have S_final and L_final combining to 0. Possible only if S_final=0 and L_final=0 (since S=0 and L=0 gives J=0). But S + L=0+0=0≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Alternatively, S=1 and L=1, coupling to J=0. But S + L=2≡0 mod2, also violating T=0. Therefore, no possible way to have J_final=0 with T=0. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, d-wave (L_X=2) is also forbidden. But the problem states "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying only one answer. This suggests that perhaps the answer is s-wave. But I need to check the parity condition again for s-wave.\n\nIf L_X=0, then parity condition: L_final +0 ≡1 mod2 => L_final≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. But J_final=0 requires that S_final and L_final combine to 0. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be odd (since S_final can be 0 or 1). If L_final is odd and S_final=1, then S + L=1 + odd= even, violating T=0. If S_final=0, then S + L=0 + odd= odd, satisfying T=0. But S_final=0 and L_final=odd. Then, J_final would be L_final (since S=0). So J_final= L_final. But J_final must be 0 (since L_X=0). Therefore, L_final=0. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, for d-wave (L_X=2), we saw that it\'s also impossible. But perhaps the answer is s-wave. However, in some textbooks, the 1S0 state emitting a particle might have selection rules. Wait, but the problem states that the emitted particle has intrinsic parity -1. The key is to combine all the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is s-wave. Because in the case of s-wave emission (L_X=0), the parity conservation would require:\n\nFinal NN parity * (-1)^{0 +1} =1 => Final NN parity * (-1) =1 => Final NN parity = -1.\n\nBut the final NN parity is (-1)^{L_final}. So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 => L_final must be odd. But J_final must be 0 (since L_X=0). So J_final=0 can only come from S_final=0 and L_final=0 (which is even, contradicting L_final odd), or S_final=1 and L_final=1 coupling to J=0. But S=1 and L=1 gives S + L=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Hence, impossible. Therefore, s-wave is forbidden.\n\nFor p-wave (L_X=1), possible. As in the case S=1, L=0, J_final=1, which allows L_X=1. Parity: L_final=0, L_X=1. Sum 0+1=1≡1 mod2. Satisfies parity. T=0: S=1, L=0. Sum 1+0=1≡1 mod2. Satisfies T=0. Hence, allowed.\n\nFor d-wave (L_X=2), as discussed, no allowed scenarios. But wait, let\'s check another possibility. Suppose S=1, L=2, J_final=3. Then L_X=3. Parity: L_final=2, L_X=3. Sum 2+3=5≡1 mod2. Satisfies parity. T=0: S=1, L=2. Sum 3≡1 mod2. Satisfies T=0. So f-wave (L_X=3) is allowed. But d-wave (L_X=2) is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for L_X=4 (g-wave), possible in higher combinations. But the problem likely asks among lower partial waves. If the options include s, p, d, f, then s and d are forbidden. But the problem states "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying one answer. However, based on the analysis, both s and d are forbidden, but this contradicts. Therefore, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, let\'s re-express the parity condition. The initial parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1. The final parity is (Final NN parity) * (X\'s parity). X\'s parity is (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}. Therefore, Final NN parity = (+1) / [(-1) * (-1)^{L_X}] = (-1)^{L_X +1}. But Final NN parity is also (-1)^{L_final}. Therefore:\n\n(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2.\n\nSo L_final and L_X must have opposite parity. If L_X is even, L_final must be odd, and vice versa.\n\nFrom the T=0 condition: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2.\n\nAlso, angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So possible combinations:\n\nFor each L_X, possible J_final = L_X. Then, possible (S_final, L_final) such that S_final and L_final can combine to J_final = L_X, and S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2, and L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2.\n\nLet\'s consider possible L_X:\n\nCase 1: L_X=0 (s-wave)\n\nThen J_final=0. So S_final and L_final must combine to 0. Possible only if S_final=0 and L_final=0, or S_final=1 and L_final=1 (with J=0). But:\n\n- S=0, L=0: S + L=0≡0 mod2 (violates T=0). Also, L_final=0, which must ≡0 +1=1 mod2 (since L_X=0). Contradiction. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=1: S + L=2≡0 mod2 (violates T=0). Also, L_final=1≡0 +1=1 mod2. This satisfies L_final parity. But T=0 violated. Disallowed.\n\nThus, s-wave forbidden.\n\nCase 2: L_X=1 (p-wave)\n\nJ_final=1. Possible (S_final, L_final):\n\n- S=0, L=1: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=1≡1 +1=0 mod2? Wait, L_final must ≡ L_X +1=1+1=2≡0 mod2. But L_final=1≡1 mod2. Contradiction. Therefore, parity violated. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=0: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=0≡1 +1=0 mod2. Satisfies parity. Allowed.\n\nThus, p-wave allowed.\n\nCase3: L_X=2 (d-wave)\n\nJ_final=2. Possible (S_final, L_final):\n\n- S=0, L=2: J=2. S + L=2≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=1: Can J=2? S=1, L=1 can give J=0,1,2. So yes. S + L=2≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=2: J=2. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=2≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2. But L_final=2≡0 mod2. Contradiction. Parity violated. Disallowed.\n- S=0, L=3: J=3. Not 2. Disregard.\n- S=1, L=3: J=2 possible. S + L=4≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.\n\nThus, d-wave forbidden.\n\nCase4: L_X=3 (f-wave)\n\nJ_final=3. Possible (S_final, L_final):\n\n- S=0, L=3: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=3≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2. But L_final=3≡1 mod2. Contradiction. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=2: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=2≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2. L_final=2≡0 mod2. Satisfies parity. Allowed.\n\nThus, f-wave allowed.\n\nTherefore, the forbidden partial waves are s (L=0) and d (L=2). But the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying one answer. However, in typical scenarios, the lowest forbidden partial wave would be s-wave. But according to the analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, considering the problem\'s context and possible options, the answer is likely the s-wave. But wait, in the case of d-wave, there\'s no allowed scenario, while for s-wave also none. But the problem might have options where both are present, but the user hasn\'t provided them. However, based on the detailed analysis, both s and d are forbidden. But this contradicts the problem\'s implication of a single answer. Therefore, perhaps there\'s an error in the analysis.\n\nWait, let\'s recheck the parity condition for d-wave (L_X=2). If L_X=2, then L_final must be L_X +1 mod2=2+1=3≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. Also, T=0 requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be even (0) to sum to 1. So S_final=0, L_final=odd. Then, J_final= L_X=2. But S_final=0, so J_final= L_final. Therefore, L_final=2. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, no solution. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, for s-wave, L_X=0, L_final must be 1 mod2 (odd). T=0 requires S_final + L_final=1 mod2. If L_final is odd, S_final must be 0. Then J_final= L_final. But J_final=0 (since L_X=0). Therefore, L_final=0. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, s-wave forbidden.\n\nThus, both s and d are forbidden. But the problem likely expects one answer. This suggests a possible mistake in the analysis. Let\'s revisit the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is T=1 (since for two nucleons, which are fermions, the wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The spatial part is symmetric (L=0), spin part is antisymmetric (S=0), so isospin must be symmetric (T=1). After emission, the final NN state has T=0. The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. With T=0, this implies S + L ≡1 mod2.\n\nThe key is that the final NN state must have S + L odd. The parity conservation gives L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. Angular momentum conservation gives J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So for each possible L_X, we need to see if there exists S_final and L_final such that:\n\n1. S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2\n2. L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2\n3. The combination of S_final and L_final can produce J_final = L_X.\n\nLet\'s check for each L_X:\n\nL_X=0 (s-wave):\n\n1. S + L ≡1 mod2\n2. L ≡0 +1=1 mod2\n3. J_final=0. So S=0, L=0 (but L must be 1 mod2) → impossible. Or S=1, L=1 (J=0 possible). But S + L=2≡0 mod2 → violates condition 1. Hence, impossible.\n\nL_X=1 (p-wave):\n\n1. S + L ≡1 mod2\n2. L ≡1 +1=0 mod2\n3. J_final=1. Possible combinations:\n\n- S=0, L=1: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2. L=1≡0 mod2? No, 1≡1. Violates condition 2. Disallowed.\n- S=1, L=0: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2. L=0≡0 mod2.

However, based on the detailed analysis, both s and d are forbidden.

The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S₀ state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin T(NN) = 0, and Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Conservation of angular momentum and parity must be considered to determine the forbidden partial wave of X.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **Initial State (1S₀):**  
   - Spin: \( S_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), Orbital Angular Momentum: \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), Total Angular Momentum: \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \).  
   - Parity: Nucleons have intrinsic parity +1, and spatial parity \((-1)^{L_{\text{initial}}} = +1\). Total initial parity: \( +1 \).

2. **Final State Constraints:**  
   - **Parity Conservation:**  
     Final parity = (NN parity) \(\times\) (X parity).  
     X parity: \(-1 \times (-1)^{L_X}\).  
     Initial parity = Final parity:  
     \[
     1 = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \times (-1)^{L_X + 1} \implies L_{\text{final}} + L_X \equiv 1 \mod 2.
     \]
   - **Pauli Statistics (T(NN) = 0):**  
     \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).  
   - **Angular Momentum Conservation:**  
     \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X \), where \( J_{\text{final}} \) is the total angular momentum of the final NN state (combination of \( S_{\text{final}} \) and \( L_{\text{final}} \)).

3. **Forbidden Partial Waves:**  
   - **s-wave (L_X = 0):**  
     - \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \) (from parity).  
     - \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \implies S_{\text{final}} = 0 \).  
     - \( J_{\text{final}} = L_X = 0 \implies L_{\text{final}} = 0 \), contradicting \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).  
     **→ s-wave forbidden.**

   - **d-wave (L_X = 2):**  
     - \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv 3 \mod 2 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).  
     - \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \implies S_{\text{final}} = 0 \).  
     - \( J_{\text{final}} = 2 \implies L_{\text{final}} = 2 \), contradicting \( L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).  
     **→ d-wave forbidden.**

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Both s-wave (L_X = 0) and d-wave (L_X = 2) are forbidden. However, in typical scenarios involving pion-like emission (negative parity), **s-wave emission is classically forbidden due to parity mismatch**, making it the primary answer.

**Answer:**  
\boxed{s}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

The problem also mentions Pauli statistics, which for nucleons (fermions) require the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial = 0, S_initial = 0. The antisymmetry condition would then require the product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts to be antisymmetric. Since L_initial = 0 (symmetric spatial), S_initial = 0 (antisymmetric spin), the isospin must be symmetric (since (-1)^{L + S + T} = -1 for antisymmetry). Therefore, T_initial must be 1 (symmetric) because S=0 (antisymmetric) and L=0 (symmetric), so 0 + 0 + T_initial must be odd. Hence, T_initial = 1.

But after emission, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is 0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2, so S + L must be 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L of the final NN state must sum to an odd number.

Now, the final NN state's spin S can be 0 or 1 (since two spin-1/2 particles can combine to S=0 or S=1). The orbital angular momentum L_final (from the NN system) must combine with S to form J_final. But the problem states that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so J is the total angular momentum, which is the combination of L and S. However, in the emission process, the X particle's angular momentum L_X must combine with the final NN state's J_final to give the initial J_initial = 0. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude and direction. Since J_initial is 0, the vector sum of J_final and L_X must be zero. Hence, J_final = L_X. But since angular momentum is quantized, J_final must equal L_X in magnitude. So, L_X must equal J_final.

But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So, J_final can range from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. However, since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific value, this imposes constraints on possible L_X.

But perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's recap:

1. Initial state: 1S0 => S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0, T_initial = 1 (from antisymmetry condition).
2. Final state: T(NN) = 0. According to the given condition, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 => S + L = 1 mod 2. Therefore, S and L of the final NN state must be of opposite parity (one even, one odd).
3. Parity conservation: Initial parity is +1. Final parity is (Final NN parity) * (X's parity). X's parity is (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} (intrinsic parity -1 and spatial parity (-1)^{L_X}).
   So, 1 = [(-1)^{L_final}] * [(-1)^{L_X +1}]
   => (-1)^{L_final + L_X +1} = 1
   => L_final + L_X +1 ≡ 0 mod 2
   => L_final + L_X ≡ 1 mod 2
4. Angular momentum conservation: The initial angular momentum is 0. The total angular momentum after emission is the vector sum of the final NN state's J_final and the X's angular momentum L_X. Since J_initial = 0, we must have J_final + L_X = 0. Therefore, J_final = L_X in magnitude and direction. But quantum mechanically, the coupling of J_final and L_X must result in a total of 0. This implies that J_final and L_X must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, in terms of quantum numbers, the possible J_final must be such that there's a coupling with L_X to give 0. This is only possible if J_final = L_X, and their coupling (as vectors) cancels. Therefore, J_final must equal L_X. So, L_X must be equal to J_final. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN system, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. So, J_final can take values |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, which is a specific integer (since angular momentum is quantized), this imposes constraints.

But perhaps we can approach this step by step. Let's consider possible final states of the NN system. Since T(NN) = 0, and from the Pauli condition S + L must be odd. So possible combinations:

Case 1: S = 0, L = 1 (since 0 +1 =1, which is odd)
Case 2: S =1, L =0 (1 +0 =1, odd)
Case 3: S=1, L=2 (1+2=3, odd)
Case 4: S=0, L=3 (0+3=3, odd)
Etc. But we need to consider possible L and S values. Since the nucleons are in a state with some L_final and S_final, and J_final is the combination of those. Then, the possible J_final for each (S_final, L_final) would be from |L_final - S_final| to L_final + S_final. But since J_final must equal L_X, which is the angular momentum of the emitted particle, we can check possible L_X values.

But perhaps the key is to look at the possible partial waves (L_X) and see which one is forbidden. The possible partial waves are labeled by lowercase letters: s (L=0), p (L=1), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc. The question is which of these is not permitted.

Let's consider each possible final NN state (S_final, L_final) that satisfies S + L odd, and then check if the corresponding L_X (which must equal J_final) is possible, considering parity and angular momentum conservation.

First, possible (S_final, L_final) pairs:

1. S=0, L=1: Then J_final can be 1 (since |1-0| to 1+0). So J_final=1. Therefore, L_X must be 1 (p-wave). Then check parity: From parity conservation, L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. Here, L_final=1, L_X=1. 1 +1=2 ≡0 mod 2. But we need L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. So this would violate parity. Wait, but let's check again.

Wait, parity equation: L_final + L_X ≡1 mod 2. So if L_final=1 and L_X=1, 1+1=2≡0 mod2. Which is not 1. So this combination would not satisfy parity. Therefore, this case is not allowed. But wait, but J_final=1 and L_X=1. So this would require that the parity condition is violated. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Therefore, if the final NN state is S=0, L=1, then L_X=1 (p-wave) is not allowed. But wait, but maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, let's re-examine the parity condition. The parity conservation equation was:

(-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^{L_X +1} =1

Which simplifies to:

(-1)^{L_final + L_X +1} =1

Therefore, L_final + L_X +1 must be even, so L_final + L_X must be odd. So L_final + L_X ≡1 mod2. Therefore, if L_final=1 and L_X=1, sum is 2≡0 mod2, which is not 1. Hence, parity is violated. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Therefore, if the final NN state is S=0, L=1, then L_X=1 (p-wave) is not allowed. But J_final=1, so L_X must be 1. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, the final NN state cannot be S=0, L=1. But wait, but the problem is about the allowed partial waves of X. So if the final state requires L_X=1, but parity forbids it, then p-wave is forbidden. But we need to check all possible cases.

Alternatively, let's consider the other possible (S_final, L_final) pairs.

Case 2: S=1, L=0. Then J_final can be 1 (since |0-1|=1 to 0+1=1). So J_final=1. Therefore, L_X=1 (p-wave). Now check parity: L_final=0, L_X=1. Sum 0+1=1≡1 mod2. So parity is satisfied. Therefore, this combination is allowed. So p-wave is allowed in this case.

Case3: S=1, L=2. Then J_final can be |2-1|=1 to 2+1=3. So possible J_final=1,2,3. Therefore, L_X can be 1,2,3. Let's check each possibility.

If J_final=1, L_X=1. Then L_final=2, L_X=1. Sum 2+1=3≡1 mod2. Parity satisfied. So allowed.

If J_final=2, L_X=2. Sum 2+2=4≡0 mod2. Parity violated. So not allowed.

If J_final=3, L_X=3. Sum 2+3=5≡1 mod2. Parity satisfied. So allowed.

But the possible L_X here would be 1,3. So d-wave (L=2) would not be allowed here. But wait, J_final=2 would require L_X=2, which is d-wave, but parity is violated. So d-wave would be forbidden in this case. But this is only one possible scenario. However, we need to check all possible (S_final, L_final) pairs and see which L_X is impossible in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is p-wave, but in the first case, p-wave was forbidden, but in the second case, p-wave was allowed. So it's possible for p-wave to be allowed in some cases. Therefore, the forbidden partial wave must be one that cannot occur in any allowed scenario.

Alternatively, let's consider all possible (S_final, L_final) pairs with S + L odd, and see which L_X are possible.

Possible S_final and L_final:

- S=0, L=1: J_final=1. L_X=1. Parity: 1+1=2≡0≠1. Forbidden.
- S=1, L=0: J_final=1. L_X=1. Parity:0+1=1≡1. Allowed. So p-wave allowed here.
- S=1, L=2: J_final=1,2,3. L_X=1,2,3. Parity for L_X=1: 2+1=3≡1. Allowed. L_X=2: 2+2=4≡0. Forbidden. L_X=3:2+3=5≡1. Allowed.
- S=0, L=3: J_final=3. L_X=3. Parity:3+3=6≡0. Forbidden.
- S=1, L=4: J_final=3,4,5. L_X=3,4,5. Parity:4+3=7≡1, 4+4=8≡0, 4+5=9≡1. So L_X=3 and 5 allowed, 4 forbidden.

But the problem is likely considering lower partial waves. The possible options given in the problem are likely among s, p, d, f, etc. But since the problem doesn't list the options, but the user asks to provide the answer, perhaps the answer is d-wave (L=2). But let's check.

Wait, in the case of S=1, L=2, J_final=2 would require L_X=2 (d-wave), but parity is violated. So d-wave is forbidden in that scenario. However, in other scenarios, like S=1, L=0, J_final=1 (L_X=1, p-wave allowed). So d-wave is forbidden in some cases but allowed in others? Wait, but if there's no scenario where d-wave is allowed, then it's forbidden. But in the case of S=1, L=2, J_final=3, L_X=3 (f-wave), which is allowed. But d-wave (L=2) is forbidden here. However, if there's another scenario where d-wave is allowed, then it's not universally forbidden. But perhaps there's no scenario where d-wave is allowed.

Wait, let's check another possible (S_final, L_final) pair. For example, S=0, L=1: J_final=1, L_X=1 (p-wave), but parity forbids it. S=1, L=0: J_final=1, L_X=1 (p-wave allowed). S=1, L=2: J_final=1,3 (L_X=1,3 allowed), J_final=2 (L_X=2 forbidden). S=0, L=3: J_final=3, L_X=3 (forbidden). S=1, L=4: J_final=3,5 (allowed), J_final=4 (forbidden). So in all cases, even L_X (d-wave, L=2; g-wave, L=4) are forbidden when combined with even L_final. But for d-wave (L=2), the only scenario where L_X=2 is when J_final=2, which requires S=1, L=2. But in that case, parity is violated. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden in that scenario and there's no other scenario where L_X=2 is allowed. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.

Alternatively, maybe s-wave (L=0). Let's check. For L_X=0 (s-wave), what's required?

If L_X=0, then from parity condition: L_final +0 ≡1 mod2 => L_final ≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. Also, from angular momentum conservation, J_final must equal L_X=0. Therefore, J_final=0. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So J_final=0 can only occur if S_final and L_final can combine to 0. For example, S=0 and L=0, but S + L must be odd (from T=0 condition). S=0, L=0 would sum to 0, which is even, violating the T=0 condition. Alternatively, S=1 and L=1. Then S + L =2, which is even, also violating T=0. Wait, but T=0 requires S + L odd. So if L_final is odd, then S_final must be even (0) to make S + L odd. Wait, S_final can be 0 or 1. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be 0 (since 0 + odd = odd). So S_final=0, L_final=1,3,5,... Then J_final must be 0. But S=0 and L_final=1: J_final=1. So J_final=1, but L_X=0. Therefore, angular momentum conservation requires J_final = L_X=0. But J_final=1 ≠0. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, s-wave (L_X=0) is impossible because there's no way to have J_final=0. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.

Wait, this is a new angle. Let's check this.

If X is emitted in s-wave (L_X=0), then J_final must be 0 (since J_initial=0). But J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which is the combination of S_final and L_final. To have J_final=0, we need S_final and L_final to combine to 0. This requires S_final = L_final and they couple to J=0. For example, S=1 and L=1 can couple to J=0 (but that's possible only if they are anti-aligned). However, S=1 and L=1 can give J=0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. But let's check the T=0 condition. T=0 requires S + L ≡1 mod2. If S=1 and L=1, sum is 2≡0 mod2, which violates T=0. Therefore, this combination is forbidden. Alternatively, S=0 and L=0. Then J=0. But S + L =0≡0 mod2, which violates T=0. Therefore, there's no way to have J_final=0 with T=0. Therefore, s-wave (L_X=0) is impossible. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.

But earlier, we considered that p-wave (L_X=1) is allowed in some cases. Similarly, d-wave (L_X=2) is forbidden in some cases but maybe allowed in others. Wait, but according to this analysis, s-wave is forbidden. But the problem states that the answer is one of the partial waves, and the options likely include s, p, d, etc. But the user hasn't provided the options, but the original problem (from an exam) probably lists them. However, since the user hasn't provided the options, but asks to provide the answer, I need to deduce which is forbidden.

From the above analysis, s-wave (L=0) is forbidden because there's no possible final NN state with J_final=0 that satisfies T=0 and the parity condition. Similarly, d-wave (L=2) might be forbidden in some cases but allowed in others. However, let's verify.

Wait, let's check if d-wave (L_X=2) is possible. For L_X=2, J_final must be 2. Then, from angular momentum conservation, J_final=2. The final NN state must have J_final=2, which is a combination of S_final and L_final. Also, T=0 requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. Let's see possible combinations:

Case: J_final=2. Possible (S_final, L_final) pairs:

- S=0, L=2: J=2. But S + L =0+2=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=1: Can couple to J=0,1,2. If J=2, then S=1, L=1. S + L=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=3: Can couple to J=2 (since |3-1|=2 to 3+1=4). So J=2 is possible. S + L=1+3=4≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.
- S=0, L=2: Already checked.
- S=1, L=2: Can couple to J=1,2,3. If J=2, then S=1, L=2. S + L=3≡1 mod2, satisfying T=0. So this is allowed. Then, L_final=2, S_final=1. Then check parity: L_final + L_X ≡1 mod2. L_final=2, L_X=2. 2+2=4≡0 mod2. Not 1. Parity violated. Therefore, this combination is forbidden. Therefore, even though the T=0 condition is satisfied, parity is violated. Hence, d-wave (L_X=2) is forbidden in this case.

Alternatively, is there another (S_final, L_final) pair that allows J_final=2 and satisfies T=0?

S=1, L=3: J=2 is possible. S + L=4≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Disallowed.

S=0, L=3: J=3. Not 2. Disregard.

S=1, L=2: J=2 is possible, but parity violated.

Therefore, there's no allowed (S_final, L_final) pair that allows J_final=2 (L_X=2) with T=0 and parity conservation. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.

But earlier, we saw that s-wave is also forbidden. So which one is the answer?

Wait, let's re-examine s-wave. For L_X=0, J_final=0. To have J_final=0, the final NN state must have S_final and L_final combining to 0. Possible only if S_final=0 and L_final=0 (since S=0 and L=0 gives J=0). But S + L=0+0=0≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Alternatively, S=1 and L=1, coupling to J=0. But S + L=2≡0 mod2, also violating T=0. Therefore, no possible way to have J_final=0 with T=0. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.

Similarly, d-wave (L_X=2) is also forbidden. But the problem states "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying only one answer. This suggests that perhaps the answer is s-wave. But I need to check the parity condition again for s-wave.

If L_X=0, then parity condition: L_final +0 ≡1 mod2 => L_final≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. But J_final=0 requires that S_final and L_final combine to 0. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be odd (since S_final can be 0 or 1). If L_final is odd and S_final=1, then S + L=1 + odd= even, violating T=0. If S_final=0, then S + L=0 + odd= odd, satisfying T=0. But S_final=0 and L_final=odd. Then, J_final would be L_final (since S=0). So J_final= L_final. But J_final must be 0 (since L_X=0). Therefore, L_final=0. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, impossible. Hence, s-wave is forbidden.

Similarly, for d-wave (L_X=2), we saw that it's also impossible. But perhaps the answer is s-wave. However, in some textbooks, the 1S0 state emitting a particle might have selection rules. Wait, but the problem states that the emitted particle has intrinsic parity -1. The key is to combine all the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is s-wave. Because in the case of s-wave emission (L_X=0), the parity conservation would require:

Final NN parity * (-1)^{0 +1} =1 => Final NN parity * (-1) =1 => Final NN parity = -1.

But the final NN parity is (-1)^{L_final}. So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 => L_final must be odd. But J_final must be 0 (since L_X=0). So J_final=0 can only come from S_final=0 and L_final=0 (which is even, contradicting L_final odd), or S_final=1 and L_final=1 coupling to J=0. But S=1 and L=1 gives S + L=2≡0 mod2, violating T=0. Hence, impossible. Therefore, s-wave is forbidden.

For p-wave (L_X=1), possible. As in the case S=1, L=0, J_final=1, which allows L_X=1. Parity: L_final=0, L_X=1. Sum 0+1=1≡1 mod2. Satisfies parity. T=0: S=1, L=0. Sum 1+0=1≡1 mod2. Satisfies T=0. Hence, allowed.

For d-wave (L_X=2), as discussed, no allowed scenarios. But wait, let's check another possibility. Suppose S=1, L=2, J_final=3. Then L_X=3. Parity: L_final=2, L_X=3. Sum 2+3=5≡1 mod2. Satisfies parity. T=0: S=1, L=2. Sum 3≡1 mod2. Satisfies T=0. So f-wave (L_X=3) is allowed. But d-wave (L_X=2) is not allowed.

Similarly, for L_X=4 (g-wave), possible in higher combinations. But the problem likely asks among lower partial waves. If the options include s, p, d, f, then s and d are forbidden. But the problem states "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying one answer. However, based on the analysis, both s and d are forbidden, but this contradicts. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, let's re-express the parity condition. The initial parity is (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1. The final parity is (Final NN parity) * (X's parity). X's parity is (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}. Therefore, Final NN parity = (+1) / [(-1) * (-1)^{L_X}] = (-1)^{L_X +1}. But Final NN parity is also (-1)^{L_final}. Therefore:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{L_X +1} => L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2.

So L_final and L_X must have opposite parity. If L_X is even, L_final must be odd, and vice versa.

From the T=0 condition: S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2.

Also, angular momentum conservation: J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So possible combinations:

For each L_X, possible J_final = L_X. Then, possible (S_final, L_final) such that S_final and L_final can combine to J_final = L_X, and S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2, and L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2.

Let's consider possible L_X:

Case 1: L_X=0 (s-wave)

Then J_final=0. So S_final and L_final must combine to 0. Possible only if S_final=0 and L_final=0, or S_final=1 and L_final=1 (with J=0). But:

- S=0, L=0: S + L=0≡0 mod2 (violates T=0). Also, L_final=0, which must ≡0 +1=1 mod2 (since L_X=0). Contradiction. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=1: S + L=2≡0 mod2 (violates T=0). Also, L_final=1≡0 +1=1 mod2. This satisfies L_final parity. But T=0 violated. Disallowed.

Thus, s-wave forbidden.

Case 2: L_X=1 (p-wave)

J_final=1. Possible (S_final, L_final):

- S=0, L=1: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=1≡1 +1=0 mod2? Wait, L_final must ≡ L_X +1=1+1=2≡0 mod2. But L_final=1≡1 mod2. Contradiction. Therefore, parity violated. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=0: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=0≡1 +1=0 mod2. Satisfies parity. Allowed.

Thus, p-wave allowed.

Case3: L_X=2 (d-wave)

J_final=2. Possible (S_final, L_final):

- S=0, L=2: J=2. S + L=2≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.
- S=1, L=1: Can J=2? S=1, L=1 can give J=0,1,2. So yes. S + L=2≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.
- S=1, L=2: J=2. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=2≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2. But L_final=2≡0 mod2. Contradiction. Parity violated. Disallowed.
- S=0, L=3: J=3. Not 2. Disregard.
- S=1, L=3: J=2 possible. S + L=4≡0 mod2 (T=0 violated). Disallowed.

Thus, d-wave forbidden.

Case4: L_X=3 (f-wave)

J_final=3. Possible (S_final, L_final):

- S=0, L=3: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=3≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2. But L_final=3≡1 mod2. Contradiction. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=2: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2 (T=0 satisfied). L_final=2≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2. L_final=2≡0 mod2. Satisfies parity. Allowed.

Thus, f-wave allowed.

Therefore, the forbidden partial waves are s (L=0) and d (L=2). But the problem asks "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," implying one answer. However, in typical scenarios, the lowest forbidden partial wave would be s-wave. But according to the analysis, both s and d are forbidden. However, considering the problem's context and possible options, the answer is likely the s-wave. But wait, in the case of d-wave, there's no allowed scenario, while for s-wave also none. But the problem might have options where both are present, but the user hasn't provided them. However, based on the detailed analysis, both s and d are forbidden. But this contradicts the problem's implication of a single answer. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in the analysis.

Wait, let's recheck the parity condition for d-wave (L_X=2). If L_X=2, then L_final must be L_X +1 mod2=2+1=3≡1 mod2. So L_final must be odd. Also, T=0 requires S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2. If L_final is odd, then S_final must be even (0) to sum to 1. So S_final=0, L_final=odd. Then, J_final= L_X=2. But S_final=0, so J_final= L_final. Therefore, L_final=2. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, no solution. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.

Similarly, for s-wave, L_X=0, L_final must be 1 mod2 (odd). T=0 requires S_final + L_final=1 mod2. If L_final is odd, S_final must be 0. Then J_final= L_final. But J_final=0 (since L_X=0). Therefore, L_final=0. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, s-wave forbidden.

Thus, both s and d are forbidden. But the problem likely expects one answer. This suggests a possible mistake in the analysis. Let's revisit the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which is T=1 (since for two nucleons, which are fermions, the wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The spatial part is symmetric (L=0), spin part is antisymmetric (S=0), so isospin must be symmetric (T=1). After emission, the final NN state has T=0. The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. With T=0, this implies S + L ≡1 mod2.

The key is that the final NN state must have S + L odd. The parity conservation gives L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2. Angular momentum conservation gives J_final = L_X. But J_final is the combination of S_final and L_final. So for each possible L_X, we need to see if there exists S_final and L_final such that:

1. S_final + L_final ≡1 mod2
2. L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2
3. The combination of S_final and L_final can produce J_final = L_X.

Let's check for each L_X:

L_X=0 (s-wave):

1. S + L ≡1 mod2
2. L ≡0 +1=1 mod2
3. J_final=0. So S=0, L=0 (but L must be 1 mod2) → impossible. Or S=1, L=1 (J=0 possible). But S + L=2≡0 mod2 → violates condition 1. Hence, impossible.

L_X=1 (p-wave):

1. S + L ≡1 mod2
2. L ≡1 +1=0 mod2
3. J_final=1. Possible combinations:

- S=0, L=1: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2. L=1≡0 mod2? No, 1≡1. Violates condition 2. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=0: J=1. S + L=1≡1 mod2. L=0≡0 mod2. Satisfies all. Allowed.

L_X=2 (d-wave):

1. S + L ≡1 mod2
2. L ≡2 +1=3≡1 mod2
3. J_final=2. Possible combinations:

- S=0, L=2: J=2. S + L=2≡0 mod2. Violates condition 1. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=1: J=2. S + L=2≡0 mod2. Violates condition 1. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=2: J=2. S + L=3≡1 mod2. L=2≡0 mod2. Violates condition 2. Disallowed.
- S=0, L=3: J=3. Not 2. Disregard.
- S=1, L=3: J=2 possible. S + L=4≡0 mod2. Violates condition 1. Disallowed.

Thus, no allowed combinations. Hence, d-wave forbidden.

L_X=3 (f-wave):

1. S + L ≡1 mod2
2. L ≡3 +1=4≡0 mod2
3. J_final=3. Possible combinations:

- S=0, L=3: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2. L=3≡1 mod2. But condition 2 requires L≡0 mod2. Disallowed.
- S=1, L=2: J=3. S + L=3≡1 mod2. L=2≡0 mod2. Satisfies all. Allowed.

Thus, f-wave allowed.

Therefore, both s-wave (L=0) and d-wave (L=2) are forbidden. However, the problem likely expects one answer. Given that, perhaps the answer is s-wave. But in the context of typical exam questions, the forbidden partial wave in such scenarios is often the s-wave due to angular momentum conservation (since initial J=0, emitting s-wave (L=0) would require final J=0, which might not be possible). However, based on the detailed analysis, both s and d are forbidden. But since the problem states "which of the following partial waves is not permitted," and given that the user hasn't provided options, but the original problem likely had specific choices, the answer is probably s-wave. However, according to the analysis, d-wave is also forbidden. This suggests a possible error in the reasoning.

Wait, but the problem mentions "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." If the options are s, p, d, f, and the analysis shows both s and d are forbidden, but the problem expects one answer, there might be a miscalculation. Let's check the parity condition again for d-wave.

For L_X=2 (d-wave):

Parity condition: L_final ≡ L_X +1 mod2 → L_final ≡3 mod2 → L_final=1,3,5,...

T=0 condition: S + L_final ≡1 mod2. Since L_final is odd, S must be 0 (even) to sum to 1.

Thus, S=0, L_final=1,3,5,...

J_final must be L_X=2. But S=0, so J_final=L_final. Therefore, L_final=2. But L_final must be odd. Contradiction. Hence, impossible. Therefore, d-wave is forbidden.

Similarly, for s-wave, impossible. Therefore, the answer must include both, but since the problem asks for one, perhaps the answer is s-wave. However, given the detailed analysis, the correct answer is s-wave and d-wave. But since the user hasn't provided options, and the problem is from a standard source, the likely answer is s-wave. However, in particle physics, pion emission (which has negative parity) in s-wave is often forbidden due to parity considerations, which aligns with this analysis. Therefore, the answer is s-wave.

But wait, in the case of pion emission (which has negative intrinsic parity), s-wave emission is forbidden because it would require a parity change that's not possible. This matches our analysis. Therefore, the answer is s-wave (L=0), which is not permitted.
