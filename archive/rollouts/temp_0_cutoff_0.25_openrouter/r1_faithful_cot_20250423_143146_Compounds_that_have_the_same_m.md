# Original Question

Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).

**Answer:**

**A) Compound that does not show tautomerism: Benzoquinone**  
Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone) lacks alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups because the carbons bonded to the carbonyls are part of an aromatic benzene ring. Tautomerism (e.g., keto-enol) requires alpha hydrogens to enable hydrogen shifts, and disrupting the aromaticity of the ring to form an enol is highly unfavorable. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple alpha hydrogens (on carbons 2, 4, and 6) adjacent to its three ketone groups, allowing for stabilized enol tautomers through conjugation, making tautomerism feasible.

**B) Compound that shows optical isomerism: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon (C2), which is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This asymmetry enables the existence of enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, exhibits geometric (E/Z) isomerism due to its trans double bond but lacks any chiral centers, as the double-bond carbons are each bonded to identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), precluding optical isomerism. 

**Final Answer:**  
A) Benzoquinone  
B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and then determine whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what tautomerism and optical isomerism are.

Tautomerism is when a compound can exist in two or more structures that are interconvertible by the movement of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it needs to have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen). The enol form has a double bond (ene) and an alcohol group (ol), hence enol.

So, looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone can exist in different forms, but the common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. Wait, but the question just says benzoquinone. Maybe it's referring to the para isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone. Let me check the structure. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. If it's 1,4, then the two ketones are opposite each other. Now, can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism? For that, there needs to be an alpha hydrogen. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The alpha positions would be the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which are each bonded to a hydrogen. So maybe there are alpha hydrogens here. But wait, in the keto form, the carbonyl is a double bond to oxygen. For keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha hydrogen would be on the carbon next to the carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl is directly attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Each of those carbons has a hydrogen. So maybe those hydrogens are alpha hydrogens. If that's the case, then benzoquinone could potentially undergo keto-enol tautomerism, where the hydrogen from the adjacent carbon moves to the oxygen, forming an enol. But wait, the ring is aromatic. If the enol form disrupts the aromaticity, that would make it less favorable. Let me think. In the keto form, the ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds. If a hydrogen moves to form an enol, that would create a conjugated dienol, but would that disrupt the aromaticity? The benzene ring would lose its aromaticity if the conjugation is broken. So maybe the enol form is not favored here because it would break the aromatic stabilization. Therefore, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form is not stable.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So each carbonyl group is separated by one carbon. Let's visualize this. The cyclohexane ring has three carbonyl groups at every other carbon. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's 1,3,5-trione, then the carbonyls are at positions 1, 3, and 5, so the carbons in between (positions 2,4,6) are each between two carbonyls. So each of those carbons (2,4,6) would have two adjacent carbonyl groups. Therefore, each of those carbons (2,4,6) would have alpha hydrogens. For example, carbon 2 is between carbonyls at 1 and 3. So the hydrogens on carbon 2 are alpha to both carbonyl groups. Therefore, there are alpha hydrogens available. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form would involve the hydrogen from carbon 2 (or 4 or 6) moving to the adjacent carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol. Moreover, because there are three carbonyl groups, there might be multiple sites for tautomerism. Additionally, the enol form might be stabilized by conjugation between the three carbonyl groups. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic triketone. The presence of three ketone groups in a symmetrical arrangement might allow for extensive conjugation in the enol form, leading to stabilization. For example, if two adjacent carbonyl groups undergo enolization, forming conjugated double bonds, which could be more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more likely to exhibit tautomerism compared to benzoquinone, which might not because of aromaticity disruption.

So, the answer for part A (the compound that does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or another form of chirality, such as a non-planar structure with a stereogenic axis, etc. Let's look at both compounds.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, let's draw it. The propanoate part is three carbons: COOCH3 is the ester group. The parent acid is propanoic acid, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, maybe better written as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon of the propanoate) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, then the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoate? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but actually, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3. But wait, that's 3-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Let's number the carbons in propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid is carbon 1. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH: carbon 1 (COOH), carbon 2 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the hydroxyl group is on carbon 2. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- Carbon 1: COOCH3 (since the COOH is esterified)
- Carbon 3: CH2(OH)
Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the carboxylic acid ester)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, maybe I need to draw it properly. The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is:

COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, when esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the ester is COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the ester group is on the first carbon, hydroxyl on the second, and a methyl on the third. Wait, but that would make the central carbon (carbon 2) attached to:

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH (on carbon 2)
- CH3 (on carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen (since it's a four-valent carbon)

Wait, but carbon 2 would have four substituents: COOCH3 (from carbon 1?), OH, CH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, maybe the structure is:

The propanoate is three carbons: the first carbon is the ester (COOCH3), the second carbon has the hydroxyl (CH(OH)), and the third carbon is a methyl (CH3). So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH (on carbon 2)
- CH3 (on carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen (since it's a tetrahedral carbon)

Therefore, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. That would make it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, let me confirm. If the groups are COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H, then yes, all four are different. So this compound would have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a trans double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the structure is trans-butenedioic acid. When esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
   C=C
   |
O-C-OCH3
||
O

But the double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Each carbon of the double bond is attached to an ester group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is:

CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (trans). The ester would replace the H with CH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. But since it's trans, the hydrogens are on opposite sides. So each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. But for a chiral center, a carbon must have four different groups. However, the double bond carbons are each attached to two identical groups (each has COOCH3 and H, but in the trans configuration). Wait, but the double bond itself is a source of stereoisomerism (geometric isomerism), but not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires chirality, which is different from geometric isomerism.

So dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond, which is a geometric isomer (E/Z isomerism), but does it have a chiral center? Let's check each carbon. The carbons in the double bond are each bonded to COOCH3 and H. So each of those carbons has two substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. But since they are sp² hybridized, they don't have a chiral center. The other carbons are in the ester groups. The ester groups are OCH3, which are attached to carbonyl carbons. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen, so they are not chiral. The oxygen in the ester is connected to a methyl group and the carbonyl. So no chiral centers there. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. However, it does have geometric isomerism (as fumarate is the trans form, and the cis form would be maleate). But the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers or another form of chirality like a helicene. Since dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, as it has a chiral center (the second carbon with four different groups), leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but let me double-check methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-? Wait, maybe I messed up the structure. Let me write it again. The correct IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So the full structure is: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that would make carbon 2 attached to:

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH
- CH3 (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen (since it's a tetrahedral carbon)

Yes, so four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. Hence, this compound has optical isomerism. Therefore, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So summarizing:

A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Okay, so I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and then determine whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what tautomerism and optical isomerism are.

Tautomerism is when a compound can exist in two or more structures that are interconvertible by the movement of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it needs to have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen). The enol form has a double bond (ene) and an alcohol group (ol), hence enol.

So, looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone can exist in different forms, but the common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. Wait, but the question just says benzoquinone. Maybe it's referring to the para isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone. Let me check the structure. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. If it's 1,4, then the two ketones are opposite each other. Now, can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism? For that, there needs to be an alpha hydrogen. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The alpha positions would be the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which are each bonded to a hydrogen. So maybe there are alpha hydrogens here. But wait, in the keto form, the carbonyl is a double bond to oxygen. For keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha hydrogen would be on the carbon next to the carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl is directly attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Each of those carbons has a hydrogen. So maybe those hydrogens are alpha hydrogens. If that's the case, then benzoquinone could potentially undergo keto-enol tautomerism, where the hydrogen from the adjacent carbon moves to the oxygen, forming an enol. But wait, the ring is aromatic. If the enol form disrupts the aromaticity, that would make it less favorable. Let me think. In the keto form, the ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds. If a hydrogen moves to form an enol, that would create a conjugated dienol, but would that disrupt the aromaticity? The benzene ring would lose its aromaticity if the conjugation is broken. So maybe the enol form is not favored here because it would break the aromatic stabilization. Therefore, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form is not stable.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So each carbonyl group is separated by one carbon. Let's visualize this. The cyclohexane ring has thr

I need to determine which compound doesn't exhibit tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and then identify whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate displays optical isomerism. Let me start by reviewing the concepts of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in multiple structural forms that interconvert through the migration of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. Keto-enol tautomerism is the most prevalent type, requiring a carbonyl group adjacent to a carbon bearing a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen). The enol form features a double bond (ene) and an alcohol group (ol), hence the name "enol."

Examining benzoquinone first: This compound typically exists as either 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone, though the question likely refers to the para isomer (1,4-benzoquinone). Benzoquinone contains two ketone groups on a benzene ring. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, alpha hydrogens are necessary. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups connect directly to the aromatic ring, with the structure O=C6H4=O. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic system and each bonds to one hydrogen. These might function as alpha hydrogens, potentially enabling benzoquinone to undergo keto-enol tautomerism where the hydrogen from the adjacent carbon transfers to the oxygen, creating an enol form. However, this transformation would disrupt the ring's aromaticity. In the keto form, the ring maintains full conjugation with alternating double bonds. Converting to an enol would produce a conjugated dienol but might compromise the aromatic stabilization. This suggests benzoquinone might not exhibit tautomerism because the enol form would be unstable.

Now for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This consists of a cyclohexane ring featuring three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, meaning each carbonyl group is separated by a single carbon atom. Let's visualize this structure. The cyclohexane ring has thr

Alright, so I need to identify which compound does not display tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and then determine whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism. I'll start by revisiting the definitions of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can exist in multiple structures that interconvert through the movement of a hydrogen atom and a double bond, with keto-enol tautomerism being the most common form. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or aldehyde) next to a carbon with a hydrogen (an alpha hydrogen). The enol form contains a double bond (ene) and an alcohol group (ol).

Now, considering benzoquinone: it can exist in different forms, with 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone being the common ones. However, the term “benzoquinone” might refer to the para isomer, 1,4-benzoquinone. Let me analyze its structure. Benzoquinone features two ketone groups on a benzene ring. If it’s 1,4, the ketones are positioned opposite each other. Can it show keto-enol tautomerism? This requires an alpha hydrogen. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is linked to the benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic structure. The alpha positions would be the carbons next to the carbonyls, but in a benzene ring, each carbon binds one hydrogen. In benzoquinone, the carbonyls attach directly to the ring, giving the structure O=C6H4=O. The carbons next to the carbonyls are in the aromatic ring, each bonded with a hydrogen. These might be alpha hydrogens. But in the keto form, the carbonyl features a double bond to oxygen. For keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha hydrogen should be on the carbon next to the carbonyl, yet in benzoquinone, the carbonyl attaches directly to the benzene ring. The proximate carbons are part of the ring, each linked with one hydrogen, so these could be alpha hydrogens. If so, benzoquinone might undergo keto-enol tautomerism, with the hydrogen from the adjacent carbon moving to the oxygen, creating an enol. However, if the enol form disrupts aromaticity, it becomes less favorable. In the keto form, the ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds. If a hydrogen shifts to form an enol, creating a conjugated dienol, would aromaticity be disrupted? The benzene ring would lose its aromatic nature if conjugation is broken, making the enol form potentially unfavorable due to the loss of aromatic stabilization. Thus, benzoquinone might not exhibit tautomerism because the enol form lacks stability.

Moving to cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, this consists of a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions, so each carbonyl is one carbon apart. Let’s visualize the cyclohexane ring with three carbonyls...

Each carbonyl group is adjacent to two carbons that are part of the ring. Each of those adjacent carbons would have a hydrogen (alpha hydrogens). So, for each ketone group, there are alpha hydrogens. Now, can this molecule undergo keto-enol tautomerism? If one of the alpha hydrogens moves to the oxygen, forming an enol. But since there are three ketone groups, maybe multiple tautomerism possibilities. However, the key is whether the enol form is stabilized. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, if one of the ketone groups undergoes tautomerism, the resulting enol could form a conjugated system with adjacent ketone groups. For example, if the enol forms between two ketones, creating a conjugated enol that might be stabilized by resonance. Wait, the positions are 1,3,5. So each ketone is two carbons apart. If one ketone at position 1 becomes an enol, the adjacent ketone is at position 3. The enol would be between positions 1 and 2. Then, the conjugated system could extend from position 1 to 3? Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe the enol can form a conjugated system within the ring. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form a more stable structure through tautomerism. For example, if three enol groups form, creating a fully conjugated system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of multiple ketone groups allows for more extensive conjugation in the enol form, making it more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might be able to undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot because of the loss of aromaticity. Therefore, the answer for part A (the compound that does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.\n\nNow, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate first. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure would be: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl ester group (OCH3), a carboxylic acid group (but esterified as COOCH3?), wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified as the methyl ester, the carboxylic acid group becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: -CH3 (from the first carbon), -OH, -COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, let me count the groups. Carbon 2: attached to:\n\n- Carbon 1: which is CH3,\n\n- Hydroxyl (OH),\n\n- Carbonyl group (COOCH3),\n\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nSo the four groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are all four groups different? CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Yes, all four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, sometimes esters can have restricted rotation, but in this case, the ester group is on the third carbon. The chiral center is on the second carbon. So, the presence of four different groups would mean it's chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have enantiomers.\n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond between the two central carbons, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a central trans double bond. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's look at the structure. Each ester group is on either end of the double bond. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Each carbon adjacent to the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) is attached to two identical groups: on carbon 2, one side is COOCH3 and the other is CH (from the double bond) and a hydrogen. Wait, carbon 2 is CH=CH, with one COOCH3 and one H. Wait, no. Let me draw it properly. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let's see: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. The double bond is between the two CH groups. Each of those CH groups is attached to a carbonyl group (COOCH3) and a hydrogen. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. But since the double bond is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? A chiral center requires four different groups. The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each attached to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond). Wait, each of those carbons is part of the double bond, so their bonding is: C(=O)OCH3, CH (double bond), and H. So each of those carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond). But since the double bond is between two carbons, each of those carbons is bonded to two other carbons (the adjacent ones in the chain). Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's number the carbons:\n\n1: OCH3-O-C(=O)-\n\n2: CH-\n\n3: CH-\n\n4: O-C(=O)-OCH3\n\nBut the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 is bonded to COOCH3, double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen. Similarly, carbon 3 is bonded to COOCH3, double bond to carbon 2, and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. But the double bond counts as a single substituent? Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. Carbon 2: attached to COOCH3, H, and two bonds to carbon 3 (double bond). But in terms of groups, each carbon in the double bond has three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other carbon (as a double bond). But since the double bond is a planar structure, those carbons are sp² hybridized. However, for a chiral center, we need four different groups. Here, each of the double bond carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and two single bonds to the adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

To determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B), we analyze the given compounds:

### Part A: Tautomerism
- **Benzoquinone**: This compound has a benzene ring with two ketone groups (1,4-benzoquinone). The adjacent carbons to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring. Tautomerism would require the movement of an alpha hydrogen to form an enol, which would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring. This makes the enol form unstable, so benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone group has alpha hydrogens, and the enol form can be stabilized by resonance with adjacent ketone groups. This allows for tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Optical Isomerism
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The second carbon (chiral center) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This chiral center allows for optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl Fumarate**: The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with a trans double bond. The molecule is symmetrical and does not have any chiral centers, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{A} benzoquinone, and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{B} methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

ice ketone groups at every other carbon. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to two carbons that are part of the ring. Each of those adjacent carbons would have a hydrogen (alpha hydrogens). So, for each ketone group, there are alpha hydrogens. Now, can this molecule undergo keto-enol tautomerism? If one of the alpha hydrogens moves to the oxygen, forming an enol. But since there are three ketone groups, maybe multiple tautomerism possibilities. However, the key is whether the enol form is stabilized. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, if one of the ketone groups undergoes tautomerism, the resulting enol could form a conjugated system with adjacent ketone groups. For example, if the enol forms between two ketones, creating a conjugated enol that might be stabilized by resonance. Wait, the positions are 1,3,5. So each ketone is two carbons apart. If one ketone at position 1 becomes an enol, the adjacent ketone is at position 3. The enol would be between positions 1 and 2. Then, the conjugated system could extend from position 1 to 3? Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe the enol can form a conjugated system within the ring. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form a more stable structure through tautomerism. For example, if three enol groups form, creating a fully conjugated system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of multiple ketone groups allows for more extensive conjugation in the enol form, making it more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might be able to undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot because of the loss of aromaticity. Therefore, the answer for part A (the compound that does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate first. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure would be: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl ester group (OCH3), a carboxylic acid group (but esterified as COOCH3?), wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified as the methyl ester, the carboxylic acid group becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: -CH3 (from the first carbon), -OH, -COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, let me count the groups. Carbon 2: attached to:

- Carbon 1: which is CH3,

- Hydroxyl (OH),

- Carbonyl group (COOCH3),

- And a hydrogen.

So the four groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are all four groups different? CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Yes, all four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, sometimes esters can have restricted rotation, but in this case, the ester group is on the third carbon. The chiral center is on the second carbon. So, the presence of four different groups would mean it's chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have enantiomers.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. So, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond between the two central carbons, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a central trans double bond. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's look at the structure. Each ester group is on either end of the double bond. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Each carbon adjacent to the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) is attached to two identical groups: on carbon 2, one side is COOCH3 and the other is CH (from the double bond) and a hydrogen. Wait, carbon 2 is CH=CH, with one COOCH3 and one H. Wait, no. Let me draw it properly. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let's see: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. The double bond is between the two CH groups. Each of those CH groups is attached to a carbonyl group (COOCH3) and a hydrogen. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. But since the double bond is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? A chiral center requires four different groups. The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each attached to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond). Wait, each of those carbons is part of the double bond, so their bonding is: C(=O)OCH3, CH (double bond), and H. So each of those carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond). But since the double bond is between two carbons, each of those carbons is bonded to two other carbons (the adjacent ones in the chain). Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's number the carbons:

1: OCH3-O-C(=O)-

2: CH-

3: CH-

4: O-C(=O)-OCH3

But the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 is bonded to COOCH3, double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen. Similarly, carbon 3 is bonded to COOCH3, double bond to carbon 2, and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. But the double bond counts as a single substituent? Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. Carbon 2: attached to COOCH3, H, and two bonds to carbon 3 (double bond). But in terms of groups, each carbon in the double bond has three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other carbon (as a double bond). But since the double bond is a planar structure, those carbons are sp² hybridized. However, for a chiral center, we need four different groups. Here, each of the double bond carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and two single bonds to the adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe there's no chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. The molecule is symmetrical. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, even if there were a chiral center, the symmetry would make it a meso compound. But in this case, there are no chiral centers. The central part is a trans double bond, which doesn't create chirality. The molecule is planar and symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism.

Therefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, as it has a chiral center (the second carbon with four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H), leading to optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a symmetrical trans diastereomer (but not a chiral molecule), does not have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, fumarate itself is a trans isomer, and maleate is the cis. But dimethyl maleate would have a different structure. However, dimethyl fumarate, being trans, is not a chiral molecule because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, creating a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no chiral centers. So yes, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the one with optical isomerism.

So to recap:

A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because converting to enol would disrupt aromaticity, making it unstable. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism as the enol form is stabilized.

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

**Final Answer**
The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{A} benzoquinone, and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{B} methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The presence of multiple alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups makes cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione a candidate for keto-enol tautomerism.

Therefore, benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism.\n\nMoving to part B: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. Let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The parent acid is lactic acid (CH3CHOHCOOH), and the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, let me draw this. The structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-. Wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons. The correct structure is: the ester group is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. So, the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (from CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and another CH3 (from the first carbon). Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nPropanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoate? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Let me check. The correct IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy derivative would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the second carbon (from the left) is CH2(OH), the third is CH2, and the COOCH3 is on the third carbon. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. Therefore, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the second carbon (the one adjacent to the COOCH3) is CH2(OH). So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has groups: two CH2 groups (one connected to COOCH3 and one to OH), but wait, no. Let me structure it again:\n\nPropanoic acid: Carboxylic acid group on carbon 1: COOH. Then, carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be: carbon 1: COOH, carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: CH3. So, structure: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3: CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl oxygen (O from COOCH3), and another carbon (the one connected to COOCH3). Wait, the actual substituents on carbon 2 would be: -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me count again. Carbon 2 in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:\n\nThe parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH(OH), connected to carbon 1 (CH2COOCH3) and carbon 3 (CH3). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's consider that. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-, then the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would require four substituents. If the central carbon is CH(OH)(COOCH3)CH2-? No. Let me try to draw it properly.\n\nPropanoate has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is:\n\nCOOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl group), then the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group, and the third carbon is another methyl? Wait, maybe:\n\nThe correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to COOCH3, a hydroxyl, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me check the IUPAC nomenclature. The longest chain must include the carboxylic acid (or ester) group. For propanoic acid, the chain is three carbons with COOH on carbon 1. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. In this structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: two oxygen atoms (from the ester and hydroxyl?), but wait, no. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to carbon 1 (which is OOC-CH3) and carbon 3 (CH3). So, the substituents on carbon 2 are: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon would be a chiral center, making the compound capable of optical isomerism. However, wait, if the structure is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:\n\n- COOCH3 (from the left)\n- OH (on the central carbon)\n- CH3 (from the right)\n- And a hydrogen (since it's a CH group). Wait, but CH(OH) would have two hydrogens? Wait, no. If the central carbon is CH(OH), then it's attached to:\n\n- One bond to COOCH3 (carbon 1)\n- One bond to OH\n- One bond to CH3 (carbon 3)\n- And one hydrogen. So, the four substituents are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center with four different groups, leading to optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid) would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is trans-butenedioic acid. The structure would be CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration. The molecule is symmetrical, with ester groups on both ends of the trans double bond. The central part is CH=CH in trans. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The carbons in the double bond are each connected to two oxygen atoms (from the ester groups) and two carbons. However, each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two identical groups: one ester group (OCH3) and one CH2OOCCH3. Wait, no. Let me structure it again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the trans configuration. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is actually O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a carbonyl group (OCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me correct. Fumarate is the trans isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylate. The correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. However, in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each connected to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), but wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:\n\n- One COOCH3 group\n- One H\n- And two carbons (the other carbon in the double bond and the adjacent carbonyl carbon). Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the double bond (C=C) is bonded to:\n\n- One COOCH3 group (through a single bond)\n- One H\n- And the other carbon in the double bond.\n\nBut since the double bond is present, each of these carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and the adjacent carbon (with a double bond). However, double bonds don't count as substituents for chirality. Chirality requires four different groups around a carbon. The carbons in the double bond each have three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two bonds to the adjacent carbon (due to the double bond). Therefore, these carbons are not chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism. However, there's another possibility: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate, being trans, has a plane of symmetry between the two ester groups, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B) has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTo recap:\n\nA) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because converting to the enol form would disrupt aromaticity, making it unstable. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to multiple alpha hydrogens and resonance stabilization in the enol form.\n\nB) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the second carbon with four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H), so it shows optical isomerism.

ice the carbonyl groups, each adjacent to two carbons. Each of these adjacent carbons (positions 2, 4, 6) would have two hydrogens (since the ring is saturated). These hydrogens are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, each of these positions could potentially lose a hydrogen to form an enol. The presence of multiple alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups makes cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione a candidate for keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form would involve conjugated double bonds across the ring, possibly leading to stabilization through resonance. Since there are three carbonyl groups, the enol form might be more stabilized here compared to benzoquinone, allowing tautomerism to occur.

Comparing the two, benzoquinone's potential enol form disrupts aromaticity, making it less favorable, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione's enol form could be resonance-stabilized. Therefore, benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism.

Moving to part B: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. Let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The parent acid is lactic acid (CH3CHOHCOOH), and the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, let me draw this. The structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-. Wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons. The correct structure is: the ester group is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. So, the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (from CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and another CH3 (from the first carbon). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoate? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Let me check. The correct IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy derivative would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the second carbon (from the left) is CH2(OH), the third is CH2, and the COOCH3 is on the third carbon. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. Therefore, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this structure, the second carbon (the one adjacent to the COOCH3) is CH2(OH). So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has groups: two CH2 groups (one connected to COOCH3 and one to OH), but wait, no. Let me structure it again:

Propanoic acid: Carboxylic acid group on carbon 1: COOH. Then, carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be: carbon 1: COOH, carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: CH3. So, structure: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3: CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl oxygen (O from COOCH3), and another carbon (the one connected to COOCH3). Wait, the actual substituents on carbon 2 would be: -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me count again. Carbon 2 in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH(OH), connected to carbon 1 (CH2COOCH3) and carbon 3 (CH3). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's consider that. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-, then the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would require four substituents. If the central carbon is CH(OH)(COOCH3)CH2-? No. Let me try to draw it properly.

Propanoate has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl group), then the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group, and the third carbon is another methyl? Wait, maybe:

The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to COOCH3, a hydroxyl, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me check the IUPAC nomenclature. The longest chain must include the carboxylic acid (or ester) group. For propanoic acid, the chain is three carbons with COOH on carbon 1. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. In this structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: two oxygen atoms (from the ester and hydroxyl?), but wait, no. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to carbon 1 (which is OOC-CH3) and carbon 3 (CH3). So, the substituents on carbon 2 are: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon would be a chiral center, making the compound capable of optical isomerism. However, wait, if the structure is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (from the left)
- OH (on the central carbon)
- CH3 (from the right)
- And a hydrogen (since it's a CH group). Wait, but CH(OH) would have two hydrogens? Wait, no. If the central carbon is CH(OH), then it's attached to:

- One bond to COOCH3 (carbon 1)
- One bond to OH
- One bond to CH3 (carbon 3)
- And one hydrogen. So, the four substituents are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center with four different groups, leading to optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid) would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is trans-butenedioic acid. The structure would be CH2OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration. The molecule is symmetrical, with ester groups on both ends of the trans double bond. The central part is CH=CH in trans. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The carbons in the double bond are each connected to two oxygen atoms (from the ester groups) and two carbons. However, each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two identical groups: one ester group (OCH3) and one CH2OOCCH3. Wait, no. Let me structure it again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the trans configuration. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is actually O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a carbonyl group (OCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me correct. Fumarate is the trans isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylate. The correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans. Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. However, in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each connected to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), but wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And two carbons (the other carbon in the double bond and the adjacent carbonyl carbon). Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the double bond (C=C) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group (through a single bond)
- One H
- And the other carbon in the double bond.

But since the double bond is present, each of these carbons has three groups: COOCH3, H, and the adjacent carbon (with a double bond). However, double bonds don't count as substituents for chirality. Chirality requires four different groups around a carbon. The carbons in the double bond each have three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two bonds to the adjacent carbon (due to the double bond). Therefore, these carbons are not chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism. However, there's another possibility: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate, being trans, has a plane of symmetry between the two ester groups, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B) has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

To recap:

A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because converting to the enol form would disrupt aromaticity, making it unstable. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to multiple alpha hydrogens and resonance stabilization in the enol form.

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the second carbon with four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H), so it shows optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and lacks chiral centers, so it doesn't.

The enol form would involve a hydrogen from an alpha carbon moving to the oxygen, forming a double bond. However, given the symmetry of the molecule, perhaps multiple enol forms are possible. Moreover, the conjugation across the ring might stabilize the enol form. For example, if two enol groups form conjugated double bonds, creating a more stable structure. Alternatively, the presence of three ketone groups might allow for more extensive conjugation in the enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more likely to exhibit tautomerism compared to benzoquinone.\n\nSo, the answer for part A (the compound that does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.\n\nNow, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center (stereocenter) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nLooking at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate first. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The parent acid is lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which has a chiral center at the second carbon (the hydroxy-bearing carbon). When esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH3C(OH)COOCH3.

So, the carbon chain is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from the original propanoic acid's CH3), a COOCH3 group, and a hydrogen. Wait, let's count:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (from the carboxylic acid part, which is now an ester)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nCOOCH3 is the ester group. The parent chain is propanoate, so:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3\n|\nCH(OH)CH3\n\nWait, no. Wait, the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:\n\n- CH3 (from the first carbon)\n- OH (hydroxyl)\n- COOCH3 (ester group)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nWait, but that would be four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

The structure is:\n\nThe propanoate is three carbons. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nWait, no.

So carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which is CH2-)\n- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)\n- OH\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nBut the substituents on carbon 2 are: CH2COOCH3 (as a chain?), OH, H, and another group.

So:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)\nCarbon 2: C(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)\n- Carbon 3: COOCH3\n- Two hydrogens.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then carbon 2 is CH2, connected to carbon 1 (CH2(OH)) and carbon 3 (COOCH3). So carbon 2 has two CH2 groups and two hydrogens. That can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as lactic acid. Its structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the propanoic acid has three carbons: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Therefore, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A hydroxyl group (OH)\n- A COOCH3 group\n- And a hydrogen atom.\n\nYes, that's four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate capable of optical isomerism. However, wait, in the case of lactic acid, the free acid has a chiral center and exists as two enantiomers. When esterified, the ester would retain the chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nNow, looking at dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is trans-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. The structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a double bond with the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans configuration). Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is:\n\nO\n||\nCH3O-C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. So, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, both -OH groups of the carboxylic acids are replaced by -OCH3. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a trans double bond. The structure is:\n\nO\n||\nCH3O-C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3\n\nBut the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOH (or COOCH3) group. So, the structure is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans configuration. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. If the structure is CH2=CH with COOCH3 groups, but fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two carboxylic acid groups are on either end of the double bond. So, the ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two COOH groups on carbons 1 and 4. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3) with the double bond in the middle. But actually, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COO- with methyl esters. So, the actual structure is:\n\nO\n||\nCH3O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OCH3\n       |       |\n       O       O\n       ||      ||\n       CH3     CH3\n\nWait, no. Let me correct. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the ester groups on carbons 1 and 4. Each of the double-bonded carbons (2 and 3) is connected to a hydrogen and a COOCH3 group. However, in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule is planar around the double bond. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The double bond itself is a site of geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but not optical isomerism. For optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or another chiral element. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. But since the molecule is symmetrical, there's no chiral center. The central part is the double bond with trans substituents, but the molecule as a whole doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The structure is (E)-dimethyl butenedioate. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetric. If you imagine the double bond as the central axis, the two ester groups are mirror images across that axis. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral. It has a plane of symmetry, so it's not optically active.\n\nTherefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist as two enantiomers, showing optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a trans diastereomer with a plane of symmetry, does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nSo, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nTo recap:\n\nA) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\nB) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\nI need to confirm once more about benzoquinone. If benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, then it could tautomerize. However, in the case of benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. When a hydrogen is abstracted from the ring carbon next to the carbonyl, forming an enol, the ring would lose aromaticity, making the enol form highly unstable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the enol form would disrupt the aromatic ring, which is energetically unfavorable. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a non-aromatic compound with three ketone groups. Each ketone has alpha hydrogens, and the enol form can be stabilized through conjugation across the ring, possibly forming conjugated double bonds that delocalize electrons, making the enol form more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone cannot.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The aromatic stabilization in benzoquinone is a key factor preventing tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, being non-aromatic, allows for tautomerism.\n\nSo, final answers:\n\nA) Benzoquinone\n\nB) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444339, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3539, prompt_tokens=792, total_tokens=4331, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Each carbonyl is separated by a single methylene group. For each ketone group, the adjacent carbons (alpha carbons) have hydrogens. For example, the carbonyl at position 1 has adjacent carbons at positions 2 and 6. Each of these has two hydrogens. So, each ketone group has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form would involve a hydrogen from an alpha carbon moving to the oxygen, forming a double bond. However, given the symmetry of the molecule, perhaps multiple enol forms are possible. Moreover, the conjugation across the ring might stabilize the enol form. For example, if two enol groups form conjugated double bonds, creating a more stable structure. Alternatively, the presence of three ketone groups might allow for more extensive conjugation in the enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more likely to exhibit tautomerism compared to benzoquinone.

So, the answer for part A (the compound that does not show tautomerism) would be benzoquinone.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center (stereocenter) or another form of chirality like a plane or axis. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Looking at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate first. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The parent acid is lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which has a chiral center at the second carbon (the hydroxy-bearing carbon). When esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH3C(OH)COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is connected to: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl ester group (COOCH3), a methyl group (CH3), and a hydrogen. Wait, let me draw this. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH3 (the ester group)
|
CH3-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO−, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the carbon chain is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from the original propanoic acid's CH3), a COOCH3 group, and a hydrogen. Wait, let's count:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the carboxylic acid part, which is now an ester)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is the ester group. The parent chain is propanoate, so:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would be four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. However, wait, let me confirm. The structure is:

The propanoate is three carbons. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So:

Carbon 1: CH2
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOH

But when esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- CH2 group (from carbon 1)
- OH group
- COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's four different groups: CH2 (which is actually a -CH2- connecting to carbon 1), but wait, carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (which is CH2-)
- Carbon 3 (which is COOCH3)
- OH
- And a hydrogen.

But in reality, the actual groups attached to carbon 2 are:

- One bond to CH2 (which is part of a chain, so maybe considered as a -CH2- group, but in terms of substituents, it's a single bond to a CH2 group leading to carbon 1, which is a methyl group? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: C(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3

But carbon 1 is connected to carbon 2 and two hydrogens. So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (which is CH2-)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- And a hydrogen.

But the substituents on carbon 2 are: CH2COOCH3 (as a chain?), OH, H, and another group. Wait, perhaps I need to draw it properly.

The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
CH2-C(OH)-CO-OCH3

Wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)
Carbon 2: C(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, that can't be. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In this case, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, no. Wait, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then carbon 2 is CH2, connected to carbon 1 (CH2(OH)) and carbon 3 (COOCH3). So carbon 2 has two CH2 groups and two hydrogens. That can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as lactic acid. Its structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the propanoic acid has three carbons: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Therefore, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- A COOCH3 group
- And a hydrogen atom.

Yes, that's four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate capable of optical isomerism. However, wait, in the case of lactic acid, the free acid has a chiral center and exists as two enantiomers. When esterified, the ester would retain the chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, looking at dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is trans-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. The structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a double bond with the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans configuration). Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
CH3O-C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in trans configuration. So, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, both -OH groups of the carboxylic acids are replaced by -OCH3. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a trans double bond. The structure is:

O
||
CH3O-C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

But the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOH (or COOCH3) group. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in trans configuration. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, no. If the structure is CH2=CH with COOCH3 groups, but fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two carboxylic acid groups are on either end of the double bond. So, the ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two COOH groups on carbons 1 and 4. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3) with the double bond in the middle. But actually, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COO- with methyl esters. So, the actual structure is:

O
||
CH3O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OCH3
       |       |
       O       O
       ||      ||
       CH3     CH3

Wait, no. Let me correct. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the ester groups on carbons 1 and 4. Each of the double-bonded carbons (2 and 3) is connected to a hydrogen and a COOCH3 group. However, in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule is planar around the double bond. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The double bond itself is a site of geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but not optical isomerism. For optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or another chiral element. The molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. But since the molecule is symmetrical, there's no chiral center. The central part is the double bond with trans substituents, but the molecule as a whole doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The structure is (E)-dimethyl butenedioate. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetric. If you imagine the double bond as the central axis, the two ester groups are mirror images across that axis. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral. It has a plane of symmetry, so it's not optically active.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist as two enantiomers, showing optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a trans diastereomer with a plane of symmetry, does not have a chiral center and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

To recap:

A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

I need to confirm once more about benzoquinone. If benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, then it could tautomerize. However, in the case of benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. When a hydrogen is abstracted from the ring carbon next to the carbonyl, forming an enol, the ring would lose aromaticity, making the enol form highly unstable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the enol form would disrupt the aromatic ring, which is energetically unfavorable. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a non-aromatic compound with three ketone groups. Each ketone has alpha hydrogens, and the enol form can be stabilized through conjugation across the ring, possibly forming conjugated double bonds that delocalize electrons, making the enol form more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone cannot.

Yes, that makes sense. The aromatic stabilization in benzoquinone is a key factor preventing tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, being non-aromatic, allows for tautomerism.

So, final answers:

A) Benzoquinone

B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
