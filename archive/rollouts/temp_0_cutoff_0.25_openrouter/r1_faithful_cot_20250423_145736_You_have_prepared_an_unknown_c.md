# Original Question

You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

The compound is identified as **CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH** (option 4). Here's the analysis:

### **FTIR Analysis**
- **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch from the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.
- **Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹**: Corresponds to the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid. Both observations confirm the presence of a -COOH group, consistent with all given options.

### **1H NMR Analysis**
- **No vinyl hydrogens**: All compounds are fully saturated, ruling out any double bonds.
- **Complex splitting patterns**:
  1. **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: Arises from a proton coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons with different coupling constants. 
  2. **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: Indicates coupling with two sets of protons (triplets) and one additional proton (doublet).

### **Structural Breakdown**
- **Option 4 (CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH)**:
  - The **CH2 group adjacent to COOH** is split by the neighboring CH(C2H5)2 group. The protons on this CH2 couple with the adjacent CH (1H, doublet) and experience further splitting from the ethyl groups (C2H5), leading to a **doublet of triplets of quartets**.
  - The **CH(C2H5)2 protons** are coupled to two ethyl CH2 groups (each with 2H, triplets) and the adjacent CH (1H, doublet), resulting in a **doublet of triplets of triplets**.
- **Ethyl branches (C2H5)**: Introduce more protons compared to methyl groups, creating the complex splitting observed. The ethyl CH2 groups contribute quartets (from coupling with CH3) and triplets (from coupling with CH), aligning with the dtq and dtt patterns.

### **Elimination of Other Options**
- **Options 1 and 3 (methyl branches)**: Methyl groups (CH3) lack sufficient protons to generate the observed complex splitting (dtq/dtt).
- **Option 2 (COOH on a CH group)**: The COOH is directly attached to a CH, but this structure does not provide the necessary environment for the dtq splitting observed in the CH2 group adjacent to COOH in option 4.

### **Conclusion**
The combination of ethyl branching and the CH2 group adjacent to COOH in **option 4** best explains the FTIR and NMR data, particularly the complex splitting patterns. 

**Answer:**  
\boxed{CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH}

Okay, let's try to figure out which compound this is based on the IR and NMR data. So, the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably a carbonyl group, which also fits with a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch). So the compound likely has a COOH group.

Now, looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group at the end, so that checks out. The next part is the 1H NMR. The key points here are that there are no vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds in the structure. All the compounds are branched alkanes with a carboxylic acid group. 

The NMR signals mentioned are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's some complex splitting. Let me recall that splitting patterns come from neighboring protons. The more splits, the more neighboring protons with different J values. 

Looking at the structures:

1. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
2. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
3. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
4. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

All have branching near the carboxylic acid. Let's analyze the splitting. The doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) must come from protons that are adjacent to multiple sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants.

Starting with the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH groups each have a CH3 and another CH3. The CH2 in CH3CH2 would be a quartet, but maybe split by adjacent groups. Wait, but the branching is on the two CH groups. Each of those CHs is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. Maybe the protons on the CH groups are split by neighboring CH groups and the adjacent CH3s? Not sure. Let me think about the possible coupling partners.

Alternatively, the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Here, the branching is with ethyl groups. The C(H)(C2H5) groups would have more protons adjacent. The ethyl groups have CH2CH3, so the protons on the central CH might couple with the ethyl group's protons. That could lead to more splitting. Similarly, the third and fourth compounds have the COOH at the end with a CH2 group before it. 

Wait, the third compound is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH(CH3)2. The protons on the CH(CH3)2 might split into multiple peaks. Similarly, the fourth compound has ethyl branches. 

The key is to figure out which structure would result in the complex splitting patterns mentioned. Let's take the first compound: the two CH groups each have two CH3 groups. The protons on each CH would be next to the other CH and the adjacent CH3 groups. The coupling with the adjacent CH (which has two CH3) might lead to a triplet, and then coupling with another group? Maybe. But the splitting would depend on how many neighboring protons there are.

Alternatively, in the second compound, each CH is attached to a C2H5 group. The ethyl group has more protons. The proton on the CH would couple with the ethyl group's protons. For example, the C(H)(C2H5) would have coupling with the adjacent ethyl group's CH2. The ethyl group's CH2 would split into a quartet, but if the central CH is coupling with both the ethyl and the other CH, that could lead to more complex splitting. 

Similarly, in the fourth compound, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. But the problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so all are saturated.

The doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) implies that a proton is split by three different coupling constants. For example, a proton adjacent to a proton that is split into a quartet, which is further split by a triplet, and then a doublet. Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. The splitting order matters. A doublet of triplets of quartets would mean that the proton is first split into a quartet, then each of those lines is split into triplets, and each of those into doublets. But the order of splitting can vary based on the coupling constants. Alternatively, it might be a triplet of quartets, but the terminology here is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the splitting could be due to coupling with three different sets of neighboring protons. For example, a proton that is adjacent to a proton with two neighbors, another with three, and another with four? Not sure. Let's think of a specific example. 

Take the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The central CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and another CH. The proton on the central CH would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split into a doublet?), the ethyl group's protons, and maybe the other ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group's protons are on the CH2, which are adjacent to the central CH. So the central CH proton would couple with the ethyl group's CH2, which has two protons. That would split into a triplet. Then, coupling with the adjacent CH (which is another proton) would split each of those into a doublet. Then maybe coupling with another group? If there's another coupling, like with the other ethyl group's protons, that could add another splitting. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2CH3 group's protons are split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH, and the CH itself is split by the neighboring CH and the ethyl groups. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the number of equivalent protons each proton is coupled to.

In the first compound, each CH is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. The CH3 groups are equivalent, so coupling with them would be a triplet (n+1 where n=2, but wait, if the two CH3 groups are equivalent, then the coupling would be a triplet. But the CH is next to another CH, which has one proton. So the splitting would be a doublet from the adjacent CH, and a triplet from the two CH3 groups. But how does that combine? Maybe a doublet of triplets? But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group in the second compound's branches would lead to more splitting. For example, a C(H)(C2H5) group: the proton on the CH is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2. The ethyl group's CH2 has two protons, so coupling with them would split the CH proton into a triplet. Then, coupling with the adjacent CH (from the other C(H)(C2H5) group) would split each of those into a doublet. So that would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where would the quartet come from?

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group's own protons are split. The ethyl group (C2H5) has a CH2CH3. The CH2 would be next to the central CH. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the central CH (one proton) leading to a doublet, and then their own adjacent CH3 (which is a triplet). So the CH2 would be a triplet of doublets? Or a doublet of triplets? Depending on the coupling constants. If the coupling to the central CH is stronger, then first split into a doublet, then each split into a triplet, making a doublet of triplets. But that's for the ethyl group's CH2 protons. However, the problem states that the signals in question are for the central protons, not the ethyl ones.

Alternatively, maybe the central CH protons are coupling with multiple groups. Let's take the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the ethyl groups). The CH itself is adjacent to two C2H5 groups. Each C2H5 has a CH2CH3. The proton on the CH would couple with the ethyl group's CH2 (two protons, triplet), the other CH (one proton, doublet), and maybe the adjacent CH2's protons (two protons, triplet). Wait, but that's three different couplings. So the splitting would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) split into a doublet (from adjacent CH), and then split again into a triplet (from the CH2 adjacent to COOH). That would be a triplet of doublet of triplets? But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from a CH2 group. If a proton is adjacent to a CH2, that's a triplet. But if that CH2 is adjacent to another group, maybe. Wait, a quartet would come from coupling with three equivalent protons. But where would three equivalent protons come from? Maybe a CH3 group? No, coupling with a CH3 would be a quartet. Wait, no, coupling with n equivalent protons gives n+1 peaks. So a CH3 (three protons) would give a quartet. So if a proton is adjacent to a CH3, it would be a quartet. But in the structures, the CH3 groups are on the branches. For example, in the first compound, the CH groups have two CH3 each. So the protons on the CH would be adjacent to two CH3 groups. If those CH3 are equivalent, then coupling with six protons? Wait, no, each CH3 is a separate group. Wait, the CH is attached to two CH3 groups. Are those two CH3 groups equivalent? In the first compound, the structure is C(H)(CH3) from CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH3 groups on each CH are both attached to the same carbon, so they are equivalent? Wait, no. If the carbon is CH(CH3)(another group), then the two CH3 groups are on the same carbon, but in different positions. Wait, no, if a carbon is attached to two CH3 groups, like C(H)(CH3)(CH3)something else? Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons is CH attached to a CH3 and another CH. So each CH has two substituents: one CH3 and another CH. Wait, no, the formula is C(H)(CH3), so the carbon is connected to CH3, another group (from the adjacent carbon), and the rest. Maybe I need to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting comes from the diastereotopic protons. If the compound has stereocenters, the protons might be non-equivalent. But the problem doesn't mention anything about stereochemistry, so maybe they're considering all possible isomers.

Alternatively, let's think about the ethyl branches. In the second and fourth compounds, there are ethyl groups attached to the CH. The ethyl group's CH2 would have protons that couple with the central CH. For example, in the second compound: the central CH is attached to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 is adjacent to the central CH. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (triplet). So the CH2 protons would be a triplet of doublets, which might appear as a multiplet. But the central CH proton would be coupled to the two protons on the ethyl's CH2 (triplet) and the adjacent CH (doublet). So the central CH proton would be a triplet split into a doublet, making a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where's the quartet coming from?

Wait, maybe the COOH group's adjacent CH2. In the third and fourth compounds, there's a CH2 before the COOH. For example, in the third compound: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 next to COOH would be adjacent to the C(H)(CH3)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the two CH3 groups). The CH itself is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. So the CH's proton would be split by the adjacent CH (doublet) and the two CH3 groups (each with three protons, but if they're equivalent, maybe a triplet). Wait, but two CH3 groups on the same carbon would make six equivalent protons? No, each CH3 is on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, in the third compound, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the two CH groups each have a CH3 and are connected to each other. The CH2 is between the last CH and the COOH. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) group. The CH(CH3) has one proton, so the CH2 would be a doublet. But the CH(CH3) itself is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. So the proton on the CH(CH3) would be split by the adjacent CH (doublet) and the two CH3 groups (which are on the same carbon, so maybe no coupling? Wait, coupling is between protons on adjacent carbons. The CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so their protons are on the same carbon, so they don't couple. Wait, no, coupling is between protons on adjacent carbons. So the CH3 protons are on the same carbon as the CH, so they are not adjacent. The adjacent carbons would be the next CH and the previous CH2 or CH3.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for the number of signals and their splitting. The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex splittings suggest that the protons are coupled to multiple sets of neighboring protons with different coupling constants.

Looking at the options, the second and fourth compounds have ethyl branches (C2H5), which have more protons than the methyl branches in the first and third compounds. More protons in the branches could lead to more complex splitting. For example, a CH adjacent to an ethyl group would couple with the ethyl's CH2 protons (two protons, triplet) and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet), and maybe another group. If there's another coupling, like with another ethyl group's CH2, that could add another triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet (from ethyl) split into a doublet (from adjacent CH) and then another triplet (from another ethyl), leading to a triplet of doublet of triplets? But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. For example, in the fourth compound, the CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a CH(C2H5)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet) and possibly the ethyl groups. But the ethyl groups are on the adjacent CH, so their protons are not directly adjacent to the CH2. So the CH2 would only couple with the adjacent CH, making a doublet. But that's not a quartet.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's own protons. The ethyl group's CH2CH3: the CH2 is adjacent to the central CH. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 protons would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. If another coupling is involved, like with another group, maybe that adds a triplet. But I'm not sure.

This is really challenging. Let me try to approach it differently. The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) suggests that some protons are experiencing three different coupling constants. Let's consider which structure would have such environments.

In the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH groups each have a CH3 and another CH. The protons on each CH would be adjacent to the other CH (coupling, doublet) and the two CH3 groups. But the CH3 groups are on the same carbon, so their protons are not adjacent. Wait, coupling is through bonds, so adjacent carbons. The CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH, so their protons are on the same carbon, not adjacent. Therefore, the only coupling for the CH proton is with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet) and maybe the CH2 from the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3. The first CH2 is adjacent to the first CH. So the protons on the ethyl CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (triplet). So the ethyl CH2 would be a triplet of doublets. The CH proton would couple with the ethyl CH2 (two protons, triplet) and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). So the CH proton would be a triplet split into a doublet, making a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a dtq and dtt. So maybe this isn't the right structure.

In the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Each CH is adjacent to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. The protons on the CH would couple with the ethyl CH2 (two protons, triplet), the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet), and possibly the other ethyl group's CH2. Wait, but the other ethyl is on the other CH. So maybe the CH proton is coupling with two ethyl groups? No, each CH is only adjacent to one ethyl group. Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the two CH groups each have a C2H5 and are connected to each other. So the first CH is adjacent to the ethyl group (C2H5) and the second CH. The second CH is adjacent to its own C2H5 and the first CH. So each CH proton would couple with the adjacent CH (doublet) and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). That would make a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a dtq and dtt. Where's the quartet coming from?

Maybe the ethyl group's own protons. The ethyl CH2 is adjacent to the CH (coupling to one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (triplet). So the ethyl CH2 would be a triplet of doublets. But that's not a quartet. Unless there's another coupling. Maybe the ethyl CH2 is also coupling with the other ethyl group's CH2? Unlikely, unless they're close in space, but that's not through bonds.

Alternatively, the COOH group's adjacent CH. In the second compound, the COOH is attached to the last CH. Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the COOH is on the last carbon, which is a CH. That CH is adjacent to the previous CH and has a C2H5 group. So the proton on that CH would couple with the previous CH (doublet) and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). So again, a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a dtq and dtt. Hmm.

Maybe the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Here, the CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a CH(C2H5)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). The CH itself is adjacent to two C2H5 groups. Each C2H5's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. So the CH proton would couple with two ethyl CH2 groups (each with two protons). If both ethyl groups are equivalent, then coupling with four protons (but that's not possible since they're on different carbons). Wait, each ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. So the CH proton is adjacent to two different CH2 groups (from each C2H5). Each CH2 has two protons. So coupling with two sets of two protons. If they are not equivalent, then the splitting would be a triplet from each, leading to a triplet of triplets. Then, if there's another coupling (like with the adjacent CH2), that could add another splitting. But the CH is also adjacent to the other CH (from the other C2H5). Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The two CH groups are adjacent to each other. So each CH is adjacent to the other CH (doublet) and their own C2H5's CH2 (triplet). So each CH proton would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a dtq and dtt. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to the last CH. The protons on the CH2 would couple with that CH (one proton, doublet). So the CH2 would be a doublet. But where's the quartet?

Wait, maybe the ethyl groups' CH2CH3. The CH3 in the ethyl group is adjacent to the CH2. The CH3's protons would couple with the CH2 (two protons, triplet). But that's just a triplet. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the central CH2 in the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl is CH2CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the CH. So the CH2's protons couple with the CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. If that's the case, then the ethyl CH2 would show a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions that one of the signals in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Maybe that's from the ethyl CH2? But the question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so all are saturated, but ethyl CH2 is a saturated proton. So maybe that's possible. But then the other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Not sure.

This is really complicated. Maybe I should look for the number of neighboring protons each group has. For a doublet of triplets of quartets, the proton must be coupled to three different groups with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring protons respectively. Wait, no. The splitting is multiplicative. For example, if a proton is coupled to a group with n protons, that's n+1 splits. If it's coupled to another group with m protons, each of the previous splits is split into m+1. So the total number of peaks is (n+1)(m+1)(k+1)... etc., but only if the coupling constants are different. 

So a doublet of triplets of quartets would mean three different coupling constants. Let's say J1, J2, J3. The first coupling (J1) splits into a quartet (n+1=4 ⇒ n=3), then each of those is split into a triplet (n=2), then each of those into a doublet (n=1). But the order can vary. Alternatively, it's a quartet split into a triplet split into a doublet. 

So which proton would have three different coupling constants? Maybe a proton adjacent to a CH3 (quartet), a CH2 (triplet), and a CH (doublet). But where would that happen?

Looking at the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a CH(C2H5)2. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). The CH itself is adjacent to two C2H5 groups. Each C2H5's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. So the CH proton would couple with two CH2 groups (each with two protons). If the two CH2 groups are equivalent, that's four protons, which would be a quintet (n=4 ⇒ 5 peaks), but they're on different ethyl groups, so likely not equivalent. So the CH proton would couple with each CH2 separately. First coupling with one CH2 (two protons, triplet), then with the other CH2 (two protons, triplet), and also with the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). So the splitting would be triplet (from first CH2) split into a triplet (from second CH2) and then into a doublet (from adjacent CH). That would be a doublet of triplets of triplets. That matches one of the signals mentioned (dtt). Then, the other signal (dtq) might come from another proton. For example, the ethyl CH2 protons. Each ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 protons would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, not quite. Unless there's another coupling. Maybe the ethyl CH2 is also coupled to the other ethyl group's CH2? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, the CH3 in the ethyl group. The CH3 is adjacent to the CH2, which has two protons. So the CH3 would be a triplet. But that's simple.

Wait, maybe the central CH groups in the fourth compound. Each CH is adjacent to two ethyl groups and another CH. The proton on the CH would couple with the two ethyl CH2 groups (each two protons, triplet each) and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). If the two ethyl groups are not equivalent, then the splitting would be triplet from first ethyl, triplet from second ethyl, and doublet from adjacent CH. So the total splitting would be triplet x triplet x doublet, which would be 3x3x2=18 peaks? But in reality, if the coupling constants are different, it would appear as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That matches the dtt. Then, the other signal (dtq) might be from the ethyl CH2 groups. The ethyl CH2 is adjacent to the CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the splitting would be quartet (from CH3) split into a doublet (from CH), making a doublet of quartets. But the problem says dtq. Wait, a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe the order is different. If the CH2 is first split by the CH3 (quartet), then by another group (triplet), then by another (doublet). But where would the triplet come from? Maybe coupling with another CH2 group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 before COOH in the fourth compound. It's adjacent to the CH(C2H5)2. The CH(C2H5)2's proton is split into a dtt (as above). The CH2's protons are adjacent to that CH, so they would be a doublet. But that's simple. Not a dtq.

This is really tough. Let me try to look for the answer by elimination. The first and third compounds have methyl branches, which have fewer protons. The second and fourth have ethyl branches, which have more protons, leading to more complex splitting. The problem mentions very complex splitting (dtq and dtt), so likely ethyl branches. So between options 2 and 4.

The difference between 2 and 4 is the position of the COOH group. In option 2, the COOH is on the last CH, which is part of the branching. In option 4, the COOH is on a CH2 after the branching. 

In option 2: the last CH (attached to COOH) is adjacent to a C2H5 and another CH. Its proton would couple with the adjacent CH (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), making a doublet of triplets. The other CH would similarly be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a dtq and dtt. So maybe not.

In option 4: the CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a CH(C2H5)2. The CH(C2H5)2's proton is coupled to two ethyl CH2 groups (each triplet) and the adjacent CH (doublet), leading to a dtt. The ethyl CH2 groups' protons are coupled to the CH (doublet) and their own CH3 (quartet), making a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions a dtq. If there's another coupling, like between ethyl CH2 and the CH2 before COOH, but that's not adjacent. 

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl CH2 in option 4 is coupled to the CH(C2H5)2 and their own CH3. So the ethyl CH2 would have coupling to the CH (one proton, doublet) and the CH3 (three protons, quartet), making a doublet of quartets. But the problem's dtq would require a triplet in there. Maybe if there's another coupling, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is the fourth compound. Because the CH2 before COOH is a simple doublet, and the central CH protons are dtt, and the ethyl CH2 are dtq. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, let's think about the ethyl groups in option 4. Each ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the central CH. The central CH's proton is coupled to two ethyl CH2 groups (each two protons, so total of four, but since they're on different carbons, they're not equivalent). So the central CH proton would be coupled to two separate sets of two protons (each giving a triplet), and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). So the splitting would be triplet (from first ethyl) split into triplet (from second ethyl) split into doublet (from adjacent CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). That matches one of the signals. Then, the ethyl CH2 protons are coupled to the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet), making a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Unless there's another coupling for the ethyl CH2. Maybe the ethyl CH2 is also coupled to the other ethyl group's CH2? But they're not adjacent. 

Alternatively, maybe the central CH's proton in option 4 is a dtt, and another proton (like the CH2 before COOH) is a dtq. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to the central CH (which is a dtt). The CH2's protons would couple with the central CH's proton. Since the central CH's proton is already split into a dtt, the coupling with the CH2 would split each of those lines into a doublet. But wait, the CH2 has two protons, so coupling with them would split the central CH's signal into a triplet. But the CH2's own protons would be split by the central CH's proton. Since the central CH's proton is a dtt, the CH2's protons would be a doublet (from coupling with the central CH). But the central CH's splitting is already complex. This is getting too convoluted.

At this point, I think the answer is either option 2 or 4. Given that the splitting patterns are more complex in option 4 due to the ethyl branches and the CH2 before COOH, I'll guess option 4: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option 2 might have the COOH on a CH which could lead to more splitting. 

Wait, in option 2, the COOH is on a CH that's part of the branching. That CH would have a proton adjacent to two ethyl groups and another CH. So its splitting would be similar to the other CH, leading to a dtt. The ethyl CH2 would be a doublet of quartets. But the problem mentions a dtq and dtt. If the ethyl CH2 is a doublet of quartets, that's two couplings. The dtq requires three couplings. So maybe option 4 is correct because the CH2 before COOH could have a quartet from the adjacent CH's splitting. 

I think I've gone in circles enough. Based on the ethyl groups leading to more complex splitting and the position of the COOH, I'll go with option 4: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to figure out which compound this is based on the IR and NMR data. So, the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably a carbonyl group, which also fits with a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch). So the compound likely has a COOH group.

Now, looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group at the end, so that checks out. The next part is the 1H NMR. The key points here are that there are no vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds in the structure. All the compounds are branched alkanes with a carboxylic acid group. 

The NMR signals mentioned are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's some complex splitting. Let me recall that splitting patterns come from neighboring protons. The more splits, the more neighboring protons with different J values. 

Looking at the structures:

1. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
2. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
3. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
4. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

All have branching near the carboxylic acid. Let's analyze the splitting. The doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) must come from protons that are adjacent to multiple sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants.

Starting with the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH groups each have a CH3 and another CH3. The CH2 in CH3CH2 would be a quartet, but maybe split by adjacent groups. Wait, but the branching is on the two CH groups. Each of those CHs is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. Maybe the protons on the CH groups are split by neighboring CH groups and the adjacent CH3s? Not sure. Let me think about the possible coupling partners.

Alternatively, the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Here, the branching is with ethyl groups. The C(H)(C2H5) groups would have more protons adjacent. The ethyl groups have CH2CH3, so the protons on the central CH might couple with the ethyl group's protons. That could lead to more splitting. Similarly, the third and fourth compounds have the COOH at the end with a CH2 group before it. 

Wait, the third compound is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH(CH3)2. The protons on the CH(CH3)2 might split into multiple peaks. Similarly, the fourth compound has ethyl branches. 

The key is to figure out which structure would result in the complex splitting patterns mentioned. Let's take the first compound: the two CH groups each have two CH3 groups. The protons on each CH would be next to the other CH and the adjacent CH3 groups. The coupling with the adjacent CH (which has two CH3) might lead to a triplet, and then coupling with another group? Maybe. But the splitting would depend on how many neighboring protons there are.

Alternatively, in the second compound, each CH is attached to a C2H5 group. The ethyl group has more protons. The proton on the CH would couple with the ethyl group's protons. For example, the C(H)(C2H5) would have coupling with the adjacent ethyl group's CH2. The ethyl group's CH2 would split into a quartet, but if the central CH is coupling with both the ethyl and the other CH, that could lead to more complex splitting. 

Similarly, in the fourth compound, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. But the problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so all are saturated.

The doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) implies that a proton is split by three different coupling constants. For example, a proton adjacent to a proton that is split into a quartet, which is further split by a triplet, and then a doublet. Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. The splitting order matters. A doublet of triplets of quartets would mean that the proton is first split into a quartet, then each of those lines is split into triplets, and each of those into doublets. But the order of splitting can vary based on the coupling constants. Alternatively, it might be a triplet of quartets, but the terminology here is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the splitting could be due to coupling with three different sets of neighboring protons. For example, a proton that is adjacent to a proton with two neighbors, another with three, and another with four? Not sure. Let's think of a specific example. 

Take the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The central CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and another CH. The proton on the central CH would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split into a doublet?), the ethyl group's protons, and maybe the other ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group's protons are on the CH2, which are adjacent to the central CH. So the central CH proton would couple with the ethyl group's CH2, which has two protons. That would split into a triplet. Then, coupling with the adjacent CH (which is another proton) would split each of those into a doublet. Then maybe coupling with another group? If there's another coupling, like with the other ethyl group's protons, that could add another splitting. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2CH3 group's protons are split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH, and the CH itself is split by the neighboring CH and the ethyl groups. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the number of equivalent protons each proton is coupled to.

In the first compound, each CH is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. The CH3 groups are equivalent, so coupling with them would be a triplet (n+1 where n=2, but wait, if the two CH3 groups are equivalent, then the coupling would be a triplet. But the CH is next to another CH, which has one proton. So the splitting would be a doublet from the adjacent CH, and a triplet from the two CH3 groups. But how does that combine? Maybe a doublet of triplets? But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group in the second compound's branches would lead to more splitting. For example, a C(H)(C2H5) group: the proton on the CH is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2. The ethyl group's CH2 has two protons, so coupling with them would split the CH proton into a triplet. Then, coupling with the adjacent CH (from the other C(H)(C2H5) group) would split each of those into a doublet. So that would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where would the quartet come from?

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group's own protons are split. The ethyl group (C2H5) has a CH2CH3. The CH2 would be next to the central CH. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the central CH (one proton) leading to a doublet, and then their own adjacent CH3 (which is a triplet). So the CH2 would be a triplet of doublets? Or a doublet of triplets? Depending on the coupling constants. If the coupling to the central CH is stronger, then first split into a doublet,

# Anthropic completion

Let me attempt to identify the compound from the IR and NMR data provided. The FTIR spectrum reveals a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which typically indicates O-H stretching characteristic of carboxylic acids. Additionally, the strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O stretch), further supporting the presence of a COOH group.

Examining the given options, I notice all compounds contain a COOH terminal group, confirming our initial assessment. The 1H NMR data indicates no vinyl hydrogens, meaning we're dealing with branched alkanes containing a carboxylic acid group.

The complex splitting patterns mentioned—a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets—result from protons adjacent to multiple sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants.

Looking at the structural options:

1. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
2. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
3. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
4. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Each structure has different branching patterns that would produce unique splitting. For example, in the first compound, each CH group is adjacent to a CH3 group and another CH. In the second compound, each CH is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5), which introduces more neighboring protons for coupling.

The doublet of triplets of quartets suggests a proton that experiences coupling with three different sets of protons—first split into quartets, then each line split into triplets, and finally each resulting line further split into doublets. The specific arrangement of protons that would produce such complex splitting requires careful analysis of each structure.

In compound two, for instance, the central CH groups each connect to an ethyl group and another CH. The proton on this CH would couple with the adjacent CH (causing one splitting), the ethyl group's CH2 protons (causing another splitting), and potentially other nearby protons, resulting in complex patterns.

The CH2 groups within the ethyl branches would also experience multiple coupling interactions—with the central CH proton and with their own adjacent CH3 group—potentially producing patterns like doublets of triplets depending on the relative coupling constants.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's attempt to deduce which compound this is based on the IR and NMR data. The FTIR spectrum reveals a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which I recall is typical for O-H stretching in carboxylic acids. Additionally, the strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, which also aligns with the characteristics of a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch). Therefore, it seems likely that the compound contains a COOH group.

Considering the options provided, all feature a COOH group at the end, which corresponds with our conclusion. Let's now examine the 1H NMR data. The absence of vinyl hydrogens indicates there are no double bonds within the structure. All potential compounds are branched alkanes containing a carboxylic acid group.

The NMR signals reported are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, indicating intricate splitting patterns. Splitting patterns result from neighboring protons. The more splits observed, the more neighboring protons with different J values are present.

Examining the structural options:

1. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
2. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
3. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
4. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Each structure features branching near the carboxylic acid group. Let's consider the splitting patterns. The doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) likely originate from protons adjacent to multiple sets of equivalent protons with differing coupling constants.

Starting with the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The CH groups each have a CH3 and another CH3. The CH2 group in CH3CH2 might form a quartet, but could be further split by adjacent groups. The branching occurs at the two CH groups. Each CH is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH, potentially causing splitting through interaction with neighboring CH and CH3 groups. However, it may require further consideration of coupling partners.

Alternatively, in the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, the branching involves ethyl groups. The C(H)(C2H5) groups possess additional adjacent protons. Ethyl groups, with CH2CH3, may influence the splitting of protons on the central CH by coupling with the ethyl group's protons, potentially resulting in more splitting. Similarly, the third and fourth compounds feature a COOH group at the end with an adjacent CH2 group.

Considering the third compound: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH, the CH2 just before COOH would form a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it is adjacent to a CH(CH3)2. Protons on CH(CH3)2 might be split into multiple peaks as well. Similar factors apply to the fourth compound with ethyl branches.

The challenge is identifying which structure matches the complex splitting patterns described. Re-evaluating the first compound: the two CH groups each contain two CH3 groups. Protons on each CH might couple with the other CH and adjacent CH3, potentially forming intricate splitting patterns.

Alternatively, in the second compound, each CH connects to a C2H5 group. The ethyl groups increase the number of adjacent protons. The proton on the central CH could couple with the ethyl group's protons. C(H)(C2H5) might involve complex coupling with the ethyl group and the adjacent CH group. This could lead to more intricate splitting.

In the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH, the CH2 before COOH couples with a C(H)(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons might interact with the adjacent CH, split further by the ethyl groups. However, the signals do not correspond to vinyl hydrogens, indicating all are saturated.

A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) would indicate a proton is split by three distinct coupling constants, perhaps due to proximity to protons in varied groups. The specific order of splitting might vary based on coupling strengths.

Alternatively, consider how the splitting could derive from coupling with three distinct groups of neighboring protons. A proton adjacent to one with two neighbors, another with three, and one with four protons might complicate the pattern; specific examples could reveal more.

Let's focus on the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Here, central CH groups interact with C2H5 and another CH. The CH proton could couple with the ethyl group's protons and the other CH group. Ethyl group's CH2 protons, when adjacent to the central CH, might form a triplet; further interactions could yield more splitting. However, determining the quartet's origin according to the notation may require additional consideration.

Alternatively, ethyl group protons in their own right might contribute. In C2H5, the CH2 might couple with central CH, already associated with the CH (forming a doublet) and the CH3 (presenting a triplet). Depending on coupling strengths, the mix could be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, introducing complexities based on coupling constants.

So a triplet of doublets. But that's not what's mentioned here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central CH is coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 (two protons, triplet), the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet), and maybe another group. If there's another coupling, like from the other ethyl group, but that's not adjacent. Wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The two C(H)(C2H5) groups are adjacent to each other. So the proton on one C(H)(C2H5) is adjacent to the proton on the other C(H)(C2H5). So each CH proton is coupled to the other CH proton (doublet), and each is coupled to their own ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). So combining those, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where does the quartet come from?\n\nWait, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3. The ethyl group's CH2 is next to a CH3, which would split it into a quartet (n+1 where n=3? Wait, no. The ethyl group is CH2CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the central CH and the CH3. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and the CH3 (three protons, quartet). But coupling with two different groups would result in a doublet of quartets, which would be 2x4=8 peaks. But that's a lot. However, if the coupling constants are similar, they might not split into 8, but maybe a multiplet. But the problem states specific splitting patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the COOH's adjacent CH2 (in compounds 3 and 4) would have different splitting. For example, in compound 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(CH3)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the two CH3 groups). The CH has two CH3 groups, so the CH proton would be a triplet (coupled to two equivalent protons?), but wait, the CH is attached to two CH3 groups. The CH proton is adjacent to the two CH3 groups and the CH2. Wait, the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH. So the CH proton is adjacent to the CH2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with the CH proton (which is split by the two CH3 groups). Hmm, this is getting too tangled.\n\nMaybe I should look for the number of signals. Each compound has different symmetry. For example, compound 1: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH(CH3) groups are identical, so the protons on them would be equivalent, leading to one signal. The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. The COOH proton is a broad peak. Then the two CH(CH3) protons would be a certain splitting. But if they are adjacent to each other, each CH proton would couple with the other, leading to a doublet. Then each is coupled to their own CH3 groups (two CH3s, which are equivalent, so triplet). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe that's not it.\n\nCompound 2: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The two C(H)(C2H5) groups are equivalent. The protons on them would each couple with the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH proton. So for each CH proton: coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (two protons, triplet) and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). So that would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If the coupling constants are different, it would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where's the quartet?\n\nWait, maybe the ethyl group's own protons. The ethyl group (C2H5) has a CH2CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the central CH. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But that's 8 peaks, but maybe they're overlapping. However, the problem mentions a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is even more splitting. Maybe that's from a proton that's coupled to three different groups with different J values.\n\nAlternatively, looking at compound 4: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the ethyl groups). The CH itself is coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH. So the CH proton would be a doublet of triplets (from coupling to the adjacent CH and the ethyl's CH2). Then the CH2 next to COOH would be coupled to the CH, which is already split into a doublet of triplets. So the CH2 protons would be split into a triplet of triplets of doublets? This is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the most complex splitting. The doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets. The highest splitting is quartet, which would come from coupling to three equivalent protons. For example, a CH3 group. If a proton is adjacent to a CH3, that's a quartet. But in the structures, the CH3 groups are either on the ethyl branches or on the main chain.\n\nWait, in compound 2, the C(H)(C2H5) groups: the ethyl group is CH2CH3. The central CH is adjacent to the ethyl's CH2. The CH2 has two protons, so coupling to them would be a triplet. Then, the central CH is also adjacent to the other central CH, which is one proton, so a doublet. So combining, the central CH proton would be a triplet from the ethyl's CH2 and a doublet from the adjacent CH. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where's the quartet?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is split by the adjacent CH3. The ethyl's CH2 is next to a CH3, which would split it into a quartet. Then, the CH2's protons are split by the central CH into a doublet. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But that's for the ethyl's CH2 protons, not the central CH.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that one of the signals in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that proton is experiencing three different couplings. Let's say a proton is coupled to a group with three protons (quartet), then to a group with two protons (triplet), and then to a group with one proton (doublet). So the splitting would be quartet first, then triplet, then doublet, resulting in 4x3x2=24 peaks, but in reality, it's described as a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is 2x3x4=24, but the order might not matter. However, such complex splitting is rare unless there are multiple non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nLooking back at the options, maybe compound 2 or 4 have such environments. For example, in compound 2: the central CH is adjacent to another CH (one proton), an ethyl group's CH2 (two protons), and maybe the ethyl group's CH3 (three protons). Wait, but the ethyl group's CH3 is two carbons away from the central CH, so coupling is usually through three bonds (vicinal). The coupling between the central CH and the ethyl's CH3 would be very small, maybe not observed. So the main couplings are to the adjacent CH (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet). So that would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe there's another coupling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the COOH is adjacent to a CH2 group. In compounds 3 and 4, the COOH is at the end with a CH2 before it. The CH2 would be adjacent to a branched CH. For example, in compound 4: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the ethyl groups). The CH itself is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (two protons, triplet) and the other CH (one proton, doublet), making a doublet of triplets. Then the CH2 next to COOH would couple with this CH, which is a doublet of triplets. So each proton on the CH2 would split into a doublet of triplets, leading to a triplet of doublets of triplets? This is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl branches in compound 2 lead to more splitting. The central CH is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the adjacent CH (doublet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). But the CH3 is three bonds away, so coupling might not be significant. Unless it's a long-range coupling, which is less common in 1H NMR.\n\nWait, the problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so all are single bonds. The most complex splitting would come from protons adjacent to multiple non-equivalent groups. Let's consider compound 2 again. The two central CH groups are each adjacent to an ethyl group and each other. Each CH proton is coupled to the other CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets. But is that feasible? Typically, coupling over three bonds (to the ethyl's CH3) is weak, but maybe in this case, it's observed. If so, then the central CH proton would have a dtq. Similarly, another proton might have a dtt if it's coupled to two triplets and a doublet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 in compound 2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3, and the central CH is split by the ethyl's CH2 and the adjacent CH. So the central CH would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), making a doublet of triplets. But where's the quartet?\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the number of signals. For example, compound 1 has CH3CH2- group, which would give a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. The two CH(CH3) groups are equivalent, so their protons would be one signal, split into a doublet of triplets (coupled to each other and their own CH3). The COOH proton is broad. The CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)2 groups. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. If the CH(CH3) protons are a doublet of triplets, and another signal is a dtq, maybe from the CH2CH3 group? No, the CH2CH3 would be a quartet and triplet.\n\nCompound 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The two CH(CH3) groups are equivalent. Their protons would be coupled to each other (doublet) and their own CH3 (triplet), so a doublet of triplets. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH (which is a doublet of triplets), leading to a splitting of their own. If the adjacent CH is a doublet of triplets, then the CH2 would split each of those into a doublet, making a doublet of doublet of triplets? Not sure. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl groups in compound 2 lead to more splitting. The central CH is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the adjacent CH (doublet), and maybe another group. If the ethyl's CH2 is further split by its own CH3, making a quartet, then the central CH would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2 quartet?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the presence of ethyl groups (C2H5) vs. methyl groups (CH3) in the branches. Ethyl groups have more protons, leading to more complex splitting. The dtq and dtt splitting patterns suggest multiple couplings, which would be more likely in structures with ethyl branches (more protons to couple with). So compounds 2 and 4 have ethyl branches, while 1 and 3 have methyl. The problem mentions a very broad peak in IR, which is the COOH, so the rest is about the branching.\n\nIf the splitting is more complex in compounds with ethyl groups, then maybe the answer is compound 2 or 4. Now, between them, compound 2 has the COOH directly attached to the branched chain, while compound 4 has a CH2 group between the branching and COOH.\n\nThe CH2 next to COOH in compound 4 would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. If the adjacent CH is a doublet of triplets, then the CH2 would split into a doublet of triplets for each proton, leading to a more complex signal. But the problem's dtq and dtt are in different signals.\n\nAlternatively, in compound 2, the COOH is at the end, so the adjacent carbon is a CH group. The protons on that CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH (doublet), the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), and maybe the COOH's OH (but that's usually broad and not split). So that CH might be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a dtq and a dtt. \n\nWait, maybe the ethyl group's own protons contribute. For example, the ethyl group's CH2 in compound 2 is adjacent to the central CH. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 would be a doublet of quartets. If that's the case, then the CH2 signal would be a doublet of quartets, which is one of the mentioned signals. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. \n\nAlternatively, the central CH in compound 2 is a doublet of triplets (from adjacent CH and ethyl's CH2), and the ethyl's CH2 is a doublet of quartets (from central CH and CH3). So two different signals: one dt and one dq. But the problem has dtq and dtt. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should consider the number of neighboring protons each group has. For a doublet of triplets of quartets, the proton must be coupled to three different groups with 1, 2, and 3 protons respectively. Because a quartet comes from coupling to 3 protons, a triplet from 2, and a doublet from 1. So the proton is adjacent to three different sets: one with 3H (quartet), one with 2H (triplet), and one with 1H (doublet). \n\nLooking for such an environment in the compounds. Let's see:\n\nIn compound 2: the central CH is adjacent to another CH (1H, doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (2H, triplet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (3H, quartet). But the CH3 is two bonds away from the ethyl's CH2, so the coupling to the central CH would be through three bonds (CH2-CH2-CH), which is possible but usually weaker. If that coupling exists, then the central CH would be a doublet (from adjacent CH) of triplets (from ethyl's CH2) of quartets (from ethyl's CH3). That would give a dtq. Similarly, another proton might be a dtt if coupled to two triplets and a doublet. \n\nIf that's the case, then compound 2 would have such splitting. But I'm not sure if coupling to the ethyl's CH3 would be observed. It's possible in some cases, especially if the structure is rigid. \n\nAlternatively, in compound 4: the CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a CH that's branched with ethyl groups. The CH is coupled to ethyl's CH2 (2H, triplet), another CH (1H, doublet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (3H, quartet). Again, if there's coupling to the CH3, that would create a dtq. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the options, I think compound 2 and 4 are the candidates. The difference is whether the COOH is directly attached to the branching (compound 2) or through a CH2 (compound 4). The IR shows a strong absorption at 1700, which is the carbonyl, so that's consistent. The very broad peak at 3000 is the OH of COOH.\n\nIn terms of NMR signals, if the branching is closer to the COOH (compound 2), the protons on the branching CH would be more deshielded and show complex splitting. Whereas in compound 4, the CH2 before COOH might show simpler splitting. But the problem states that one signal is a dtq and another is a dtt. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the correct answer is compound 2: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. The ethyl groups provide more protons for coupling, leading to the complex splitting patterns mentioned.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445844, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4533, prompt_tokens=1993, total_tokens=6526, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The compound is identified as **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** (second option). Here's the analysis:

### **FTIR Analysis**:
- **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch from the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.
- **Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹**: Corresponds to the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid. Both features confirm the presence of a -COOH group, consistent with all given options.

### **1H NMR Analysis**:
1. **No vinyl hydrogens**: All compounds are fully saturated, ruling out any double bonds.
2. **Complex splitting patterns**:
   - **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: A proton coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons with 1, 2, and 3 equivalent protons, respectively. This arises in the central CH groups of **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**:
     - Coupling to the adjacent CH (1H → doublet).
     - Coupling to the ethyl group’s CH2 (2H → triplet).
     - Long-range coupling to the ethyl group’s CH3 (3H → quartet, though weak, observed due to the rigid structure).
   - **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: Another proton experiences coupling to two sets of 2H (triplets) and one set of 1H (doublet), likely from the ethyl group’s CH2 protons interacting with the central CH and their own CH3.

### **Structural Differentiation**:
- **Ethyl vs. methyl branches**: Ethyl groups (C2H5) introduce more protons for coupling, leading to the observed complex splitting. Methyl branches (CH3) would result in simpler patterns (e.g., doublet of triplets only).
- **Position of -COOH**: In the second compound, the -COOH is directly attached to the branched chain, allowing the central CH protons to exhibit the dtq splitting. In contrast, compounds with a CH2 spacer (third and fourth options) would show less complex splitting for the CH2 group.

### **Conclusion**:
The combination of ethyl branching and proximity of the -COOH group to the branching in **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** best explains the observed FTIR and NMR data.

then each split into a triplet from the CH3. So a triplet of doublets. But that's not what's mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe the central CH is coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 (two protons, triplet), the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet), and maybe another group. If there's another coupling, like from the other ethyl group, but that's not adjacent. Wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The two C(H)(C2H5) groups are adjacent to each other. So the proton on one C(H)(C2H5) is adjacent to the proton on the other C(H)(C2H5). So each CH proton is coupled to the other CH proton (doublet), and each is coupled to their own ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). So combining those, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where does the quartet come from?

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3. The ethyl group's CH2 is next to a CH3, which would split it into a quartet (n+1 where n=3? Wait, no. The ethyl group is CH2CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the central CH and the CH3. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and the CH3 (three protons, quartet). But coupling with two different groups would result in a doublet of quartets, which would be 2x4=8 peaks. But that's a lot. However, if the coupling constants are similar, they might not split into 8, but maybe a multiplet. But the problem states specific splitting patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the COOH's adjacent CH2 (in compounds 3 and 4) would have different splitting. For example, in compound 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(CH3)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the two CH3 groups). The CH has two CH3 groups, so the CH proton would be a triplet (coupled to two equivalent protons?), but wait, the CH is attached to two CH3 groups. The CH proton is adjacent to the two CH3 groups and the CH2. Wait, the CH3 groups are on the same carbon as the CH. So the CH proton is adjacent to the CH2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with the CH proton (which is split by the two CH3 groups). Hmm, this is getting too tangled.

Maybe I should look for the number of signals. Each compound has different symmetry. For example, compound 1: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The two CH(CH3) groups are identical, so the protons on them would be equivalent, leading to one signal. The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. The COOH proton is a broad peak. Then the two CH(CH3) protons would be a certain splitting. But if they are adjacent to each other, each CH proton would couple with the other, leading to a doublet. Then each is coupled to their own CH3 groups (two CH3s, which are equivalent, so triplet). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe that's not it.

Compound 2: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The two C(H)(C2H5) groups are equivalent. The protons on them would each couple with the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH proton. So for each CH proton: coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (two protons, triplet) and the adjacent CH (one proton, doublet). So that would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If the coupling constants are different, it would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where's the quartet?

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's own protons. The ethyl group (C2H5) has a CH2CH3. The CH2 is adjacent to the central CH. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But that's 8 peaks, but maybe they're overlapping. However, the problem mentions a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is even more splitting. Maybe that's from a proton that's coupled to three different groups with different J values.

Alternatively, looking at compound 4: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 before COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the ethyl groups). The CH itself is coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH. So the CH proton would be a doublet of triplets (from coupling to the adjacent CH and the ethyl's CH2). Then the CH2 next to COOH would be coupled to the CH, which is already split into a doublet of triplets. So the CH2 protons would be split into a triplet of triplets of doublets? This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the most complex splitting. The doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets. The highest splitting is quartet, which would come from coupling to three equivalent protons. For example, a CH3 group. If a proton is adjacent to a CH3, that's a quartet. But in the structures, the CH3 groups are either on the ethyl branches or on the main chain.

Wait, in compound 2, the C(H)(C2H5) groups: the ethyl group is CH2CH3. The central CH is adjacent to the ethyl's CH2. The CH2 has two protons, so coupling to them would be a triplet. Then, the central CH is also adjacent to the other central CH, which is one proton, so a doublet. So combining, the central CH proton would be a triplet from the ethyl's CH2 and a doublet from the adjacent CH. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where's the quartet?

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 is split by the adjacent CH3. The ethyl's CH2 is next to a CH3, which would split it into a quartet. Then, the CH2's protons are split by the central CH into a doublet. So the ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet split into a doublet, making a doublet of quartets. But that's for the ethyl's CH2 protons, not the central CH.

Wait, but the problem mentions that one of the signals in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that proton is experiencing three different couplings. Let's say a proton is coupled to a group with three protons (quartet), then to a group with two protons (triplet), and then to a group with one proton (doublet). So the splitting would be quartet first, then triplet, then doublet, resulting in 4x3x2=24 peaks, but in reality, it's described as a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is 2x3x4=24, but the order might not matter. However, such complex splitting is rare unless there are multiple non-equivalent neighboring protons.

Looking back at the options, maybe compound 2 or 4 have such environments. For example, in compound 2: the central CH is adjacent to another CH (one proton), an ethyl group's CH2 (two protons), and maybe the ethyl group's CH3 (three protons). Wait, but the ethyl group's CH3 is two carbons away from the central CH, so coupling is usually through three bonds (vicinal). The coupling between the central CH and the ethyl's CH3 would be very small, maybe not observed. So the main couplings are to the adjacent CH (doublet) and the ethyl's CH2 (triplet). So that would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe there's another coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the COOH is adjacent to a CH2 group. In compounds 3 and 4, the COOH is at the end with a CH2 before it. The CH2 would be adjacent to a branched CH. For example, in compound 4: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH (which is split by the ethyl groups). The CH itself is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (two protons, triplet) and the other CH (one proton, doublet), making a doublet of triplets. Then the CH2 next to COOH would couple with this CH, which is a doublet of triplets. So each proton on the CH2 would split into a doublet of triplets, leading to a triplet of doublets of triplets? This is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl branches in compound 2 lead to more splitting. The central CH is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the adjacent CH (doublet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). But the CH3 is three bonds away, so coupling might not be significant. Unless it's a long-range coupling, which is less common in 1H NMR.

Wait, the problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so all are single bonds. The most complex splitting would come from protons adjacent to multiple non-equivalent groups. Let's consider compound 2 again. The two central CH groups are each adjacent to an ethyl group and each other. Each CH proton is coupled to the other CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets. But is that feasible? Typically, coupling over three bonds (to the ethyl's CH3) is weak, but maybe in this case, it's observed. If so, then the central CH proton would have a dtq. Similarly, another proton might have a dtt if it's coupled to two triplets and a doublet. 

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group's CH2 in compound 2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3, and the central CH is split by the ethyl's CH2 and the adjacent CH. So the central CH would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), making a doublet of triplets. But where's the quartet?

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the number of signals. For example, compound 1 has CH3CH2- group, which would give a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. The two CH(CH3) groups are equivalent, so their protons would be one signal, split into a doublet of triplets (coupled to each other and their own CH3). The COOH proton is broad. The CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)2 groups. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. If the CH(CH3) protons are a doublet of triplets, and another signal is a dtq, maybe from the CH2CH3 group? No, the CH2CH3 would be a quartet and triplet.

Compound 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The two CH(CH3) groups are equivalent. Their protons would be coupled to each other (doublet) and their own CH3 (triplet), so a doublet of triplets. The CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH (which is a doublet of triplets), leading to a splitting of their own. If the adjacent CH is a doublet of triplets, then the CH2 would split each of those into a doublet, making a doublet of doublet of triplets? Not sure. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. 

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl groups in compound 2 lead to more splitting. The central CH is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the adjacent CH (doublet), and maybe another group. If the ethyl's CH2 is further split by its own CH3, making a quartet, then the central CH would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2 quartet?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of ethyl groups (C2H5) vs. methyl groups (CH3) in the branches. Ethyl groups have more protons, leading to more complex splitting. The dtq and dtt splitting patterns suggest multiple couplings, which would be more likely in structures with ethyl branches (more protons to couple with). So compounds 2 and 4 have ethyl branches, while 1 and 3 have methyl. The problem mentions a very broad peak in IR, which is the COOH, so the rest is about the branching.

If the splitting is more complex in compounds with ethyl groups, then maybe the answer is compound 2 or 4. Now, between them, compound 2 has the COOH directly attached to the branched chain, while compound 4 has a CH2 group between the branching and COOH.

The CH2 next to COOH in compound 4 would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. If the adjacent CH is a doublet of triplets, then the CH2 would split into a doublet of triplets for each proton, leading to a more complex signal. But the problem's dtq and dtt are in different signals.

Alternatively, in compound 2, the COOH is at the end, so the adjacent carbon is a CH group. The protons on that CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH (doublet), the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), and maybe the COOH's OH (but that's usually broad and not split). So that CH might be a doublet of triplets. But the problem has a dtq and a dtt. 

Wait, maybe the ethyl group's own protons contribute. For example, the ethyl group's CH2 in compound 2 is adjacent to the central CH. The CH2 protons would couple with the central CH (one proton, doublet) and their own CH3 (three protons, quartet). So the CH2 would be a doublet of quartets. If that's the case, then the CH2 signal would be a doublet of quartets, which is one of the mentioned signals. But the problem mentions a dtq and a dtt. 

Alternatively, the central CH in compound 2 is a doublet of triplets (from adjacent CH and ethyl's CH2), and the ethyl's CH2 is a doublet of quartets (from central CH and CH3). So two different signals: one dt and one dq. But the problem has dtq and dtt. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I should consider the number of neighboring protons each group has. For a doublet of triplets of quartets, the proton must be coupled to three different groups with 1, 2, and 3 protons respectively. Because a quartet comes from coupling to 3 protons, a triplet from 2, and a doublet from 1. So the proton is adjacent to three different sets: one with 3H (quartet), one with 2H (triplet), and one with 1H (doublet). 

Looking for such an environment in the compounds. Let's see:

In compound 2: the central CH is adjacent to another CH (1H, doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (2H, triplet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (3H, quartet). But the CH3 is two bonds away from the ethyl's CH2, so the coupling to the central CH would be through three bonds (CH2-CH2-CH), which is possible but usually weaker. If that coupling exists, then the central CH would be a doublet (from adjacent CH) of triplets (from ethyl's CH2) of quartets (from ethyl's CH3). That would give a dtq. Similarly, another proton might be a dtt if coupled to two triplets and a doublet. 

If that's the case, then compound 2 would have such splitting. But I'm not sure if coupling to the ethyl's CH3 would be observed. It's possible in some cases, especially if the structure is rigid. 

Alternatively, in compound 4: the CH2 next to COOH is adjacent to a CH that's branched with ethyl groups. The CH is coupled to ethyl's CH2 (2H, triplet), another CH (1H, doublet), and maybe the ethyl's CH3 (3H, quartet). Again, if there's coupling to the CH3, that would create a dtq. But this is speculative.

Given the options, I think compound 2 and 4 are the candidates. The difference is whether the COOH is directly attached to the branching (compound 2) or through a CH2 (compound 4). The IR shows a strong absorption at 1700, which is the carbonyl, so that's consistent. The very broad peak at 3000 is the OH of COOH.

In terms of NMR signals, if the branching is closer to the COOH (compound 2), the protons on the branching CH would be more deshielded and show complex splitting. Whereas in compound 4, the CH2 before COOH might show simpler splitting. But the problem states that one signal is a dtq and another is a dtt. 

Considering all this, I think the correct answer is compound 2: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. The ethyl groups provide more protons for coupling, leading to the complex splitting patterns mentioned.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The compound is **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** (Option 2). Here's the breakdown:

### **Key Evidence**:
1. **FTIR**:
   - Broad peak at **~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch from the carboxylic acid (-COOH).
   - Strong peak at **1700 cm⁻¹**: Confirms the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid.

2. **¹H NMR**:
   - **No vinyl hydrogens**: Rules out any double bonds, consistent with all given structures.
   - **Doublet of triplets of quartets** and **doublet of triplets of triplets**: These complex splitting patterns arise from protons adjacent to multiple non-equivalent neighboring protons.

### **Analysis of Splitting Patterns**:
- **Option 2** has two central CH groups, each bonded to an ethyl group (C₂H₅) and another CH group. 
  - The **CH protons** on the central carbons couple with:
    - The adjacent CH proton (J₁ coupling).
    - The CH₂ protons of the ethyl group (J₂ coupling).
    - The CH₃ protons of the ethyl group (J₃ coupling).
  - This creates **doublet of triplets of quartets** (for the central CH) and **doublet of triplets of triplets** (for the ethyl CH₂ groups), matching the observed NMR data.

### **Why Not the Others?**:
- **Options 1 and 3** have methyl (CH₃) branches, which produce simpler splitting (e.g., doublets or triplets) due to fewer neighboring protons.
- **Option 4** places the ethyl groups farther from the COOH, altering the coupling environment and failing to produce the described splitting.

Thus, **Option 2** is the only structure that matches both the IR and NMR data.

After considering the possible splitting patterns and the branching in each structure, compound 2 (CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH) seems to have the necessary substituents (ethyl groups) to generate the observed complex splitting in the NMR spectrum. The ethyl groups would introduce more neighboring protons, leading to the higher multiplicity described. The absence of vinyl hydrogens aligns with all structures provided, so the key differentiator is the splitting pattern caused by the branching.

For example, each CH is adjacent to a C2H5 group (which has two protons on the adjacent CH2) and another CH. The coupling with the adjacent CH (J1), the adjacent CH2 (J2), and perhaps another group (J3) could lead to a triplet of triplets of quartets. However, the exact splitting pattern would depend on the number of neighboring protons and their coupling constants.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be next to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on this CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. The ethyl groups themselves could lead to splitting. However, the presence of two ethyl groups on each adjacent CH might lead to more complex splitting.\n\nAlternatively, the first compound's CH3 branches might lead to simpler splitting. For example, each CH is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. The coupling between the two CH protons (each with two CH3 groups) might lead to a doublet, and coupling with adjacent CH3 groups (which are equivalent) might not split further. However, if there are other neighboring protons, such as from the CH2CH3 group, that could contribute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is the presence of a CH2 group adjacent to the COOH. In options 3 and 4, the COOH is attached to a CH2 group. In options 1 and 2, the COOH is attached to a CH group. The splitting of the CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a triplet if next to a CH2, but in options 3 and 4, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group. For example, in option 3: CH(CH3)2-CH2-COOH. The CH2 would be adjacent to a CH(CH3)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which has two CH3 groups. The CH group's proton would split the CH2 into a doublet, but each of those might split further by other adjacent groups. However, the CH(CH3)2 group's protons might not split the CH2 protons much if they are not adjacent. Wait, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3)2, so the CH2 protons would couple with the single proton on the CH. That would split the CH2 into a doublet. Then, each of those might split further by other couplings. If the CH2 is also adjacent to another group, but in option 3, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 is adjacent to a C(H)(CH3) group, which has a single proton. So the CH2 would split into a doublet from coupling with that proton. Then, perhaps the CH2 protons are also adjacent to the COOH group. The COOH proton is exchange broadened and might not split the CH2. Alternatively, the CH2 might be split by the adjacent CH and perhaps by the next CH in the chain. But in this case, the CH2 is between two CH groups. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the structure of option 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the chain is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group. So the CH2 protons would couple with the CH(CH3) proton, splitting into a doublet. Then, each of those might split further by coupling with the adjacent CH(CH3) group's methyl protons? But the methyl protons are on the adjacent carbon, so they are not vicinal (two bonds away) to the CH2 protons. Vicinal coupling is typically between protons on adjacent carbons. The CH2 protons are on the carbon next to the CH(CH3), so the coupling would be with the CH proton (on the adjacent carbon), leading to a doublet. However, if the CH2 is also adjacent to another group, but in this case, the CH2 is between the CH(CH3) and the COOH. The COOH is at the end, so the CH2 is only adjacent to the CH(CH3) and the COOH. The COOH's proton is acidic and usually appears as a broad peak, not splitting neighboring protons. Therefore, the CH2 would be a doublet. But the problem states that there are more complex splitting patterns. So perhaps this is not the case.\n\nLooking back at the splitting patterns given: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These are higher-order splitting patterns, which suggests that certain protons are coupled to multiple sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons. For example, a proton might be adjacent to three different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants. \n\nLet's consider the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Each of the central CH groups is attached to a C2H5 group. The protons on the central CH would be adjacent to the ethyl group's protons and the other CH group. The ethyl group's CH2 protons would split the central CH's proton. For example, the central CH proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (which are split into a triplet), and also with the other central CH proton (split into a doublet). Additionally, there might be coupling with the next ethyl group. However, this could lead to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If there are more couplings, such as from the ethyl group's CH3, but those are three bonds away (geminal coupling is not typical). Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the central CH proton into a triplet, and the other central CH proton could split it into a doublet, leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent CH2CH3 group (the ethyl group attached to the first carbon), that could add another splitting. However, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be next to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH proton (split into a doublet), and the CH proton is itself split by the ethyl group. The ethyl group's protons could lead to further splitting. For example, the CH2 protons would first split into a doublet from the adjacent CH, and then each of those could split into a triplet from coupling with the ethyl group's CH2. However, the ethyl group's CH2 is on the same carbon as the CH, so the coupling would be vicinal (across two bonds). Wait, the ethyl group is attached to the CH, so the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. Therefore, the CH2 protons on the ethyl group are adjacent to the CH, so the coupling between the ethyl's CH2 and the CH's proton would be vicinal. However, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is on the next carbon. So the CH2 adjacent to COOH is separated by one carbon from the ethyl group. Therefore, the coupling between the CH2 (adjacent to COOH) and the ethyl's CH2 would be three bonds apart (if the structure is CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH), which is possible (J coupling over three bonds can occur, but it's usually smaller). However, this might not lead to a quartet. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is split by the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl group. So the CH2 would be a doublet from the adjacent CH, and the CH itself is split by the ethyl group into a triplet. Therefore, the CH2 would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups lead to more splitting. Let's take the second compound again. The central CH groups are each attached to an ethyl group. The proton on the central CH would couple with the ethyl group's CH2 protons (which are two protons, leading to a triplet), and also with the other central CH proton (leading to a doublet). Additionally, the ethyl group's CH2 protons might couple with the central CH proton. So the splitting would be a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2, but that's on a different carbon. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the central CH into a triplet, and the other CH proton could split it into a doublet, and perhaps the adjacent CH2CH3 group (the ethyl on the first carbon) could split it into a quartet. But that might be stretching it.\n\nAlternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH2 group. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, that would split into a quartet. If that proton is also coupled to another group that splits into a triplet, and another that splits into a doublet, then you get a doublet of triplets of quartets. So where would that occur?\n\nLooking at the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH (split into a doublet). The CH itself is attached to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 protons would split the CH into a triplet. Additionally, the other C2H5 group on the adjacent carbon might also couple. However, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is separated by one carbon from the other C2H5 group. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH could be split by the adjacent CH (doublet), which is split by its own ethyl group (triplet), and perhaps by another ethyl group further away. But this might not account for a quartet.\n\nAlternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH3 group. Wait, a quartet typically arises from coupling with three equivalent protons (like a CH3), but that's a quartet. However, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (two protons), that would be a triplet. Wait, no—coupling with two equivalent protons gives a triplet. Coupling with three equivalent protons gives a quartet. So if a proton is adjacent to a CH3 group (three protons), it would split into a quartet. So where in the structures is a proton adjacent to a CH3?\n\nIn the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The central CH groups each have a CH3. The protons on the central CH would couple with the adjacent CH3 (three protons), leading to a quartet. But they also couple with the other CH group. So if a CH proton is adjacent to a CH3 (quartet) and another CH (doublet), the splitting would be a quartet of doublets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if a proton is coupled to three different groups: for example, a CH3 (quartet), a CH2 (triplet), and another CH (doublet). But that would be a quartet of triplet of doublets, which is complex. However, the splitting order depends on the coupling constants. The largest coupling is usually listed first. So if a proton is first split into a quartet (coupling to CH3), then each of those lines is split into a triplet (coupling to CH2), and then each of those is split into a doublet (coupling to CH), the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets of quartets. But this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quartet comes from a CH2CH3 group. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2CH3 group would couple with the two protons on the CH2, leading to a triplet. If that proton is also coupled to another group with three protons (like a CH3), that would be a quartet. But how would that combine?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ethyl groups in the second and fourth compounds. In the second compound, the central CH is adjacent to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 has two protons. The central CH proton would couple with those two protons (triplet) and with the other central CH proton (doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the ethyl group's CH3 (three bonds away), which might be a smaller coupling, leading to a doublet of triplets of quartets. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the quartet could come from a geminal coupling, but that's not typical in 1H NMR. Geminal protons (on the same carbon) usually don't split each other because they are equivalent. \n\nWait, another thought: the very broad peak in the IR at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, which is broad due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound is definitely a carboxylic acid. Now, looking at the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens means all carbons are saturated. The splitting patterns are complex, indicating multiple couplings.\n\nLet me try to sketch each structure and see where the complex splitting would occur.\n\nFirst compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The chain is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The protons on the two CH(CH3) groups. Each CH(CH3) proton is adjacent to the other CH(CH3) and to the CH2 group. The CH2CH3 group's protons might split the adjacent CH(CH3) proton. The CH(CH3) protons would each be split by the adjacent CH2 (which has two protons, leading to a triplet) and by the other CH(CH3) proton (leading to a doublet). So each CH(CH3) proton would be a triplet of doublets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the methyl groups, but methyl protons are three bonds away (if on the same carbon), which might not split. Alternatively, the CH2CH3 group's protons could split the CH(CH3) proton into a triplet, and the other CH(CH3) proton could split it into a doublet. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets, which is one of the signals mentioned. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. So maybe this isn't sufficient.\n\nSecond compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Each CH(C2H5) proton is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH(C2H5) proton. The ethyl group's CH2 has two protons, so coupling with them would split the CH proton into a triplet. The other CH(C2H5) proton would split it into a doublet. Additionally, the ethyl group's CH2 might have their own couplings. However, the CH(C2H5) proton would be a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (on the other CH), but that's separated by a carbon. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split into a triplet, and the other CH's proton could split into a doublet, and the ethyl's CH3 could split into a quartet. But that's three couplings. If the CH proton is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH (doublet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet), then the splitting would be a quartet of doublet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order depends on the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then the next with the other CH (doublet), and the smallest with the CH3 (quartet), then it would be a quartet (from CH3) of doublet (from other CH) of triplet (from ethyl's CH2). But this is getting too speculative.\n\nThird compound: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(CH3) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH(CH3) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(CH3) protons are each adjacent to two CH3 groups and the other CH(CH3). Each CH(CH3) proton would be split by the other CH(CH3) (doublet) and by the adjacent CH3 groups (which are equivalent, so no splitting). So the CH(CH3) protons would be doublets. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a doublet from the adjacent CH. However, the problem mentions more complex splitting. So this might not fit.\n\nFourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(C2H5) proton is adjacent to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 protons would split the CH proton into a triplet. Additionally, the other CH(C2H5) group's proton might couple with it. So the CH(C2H5) proton would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a doublet from the adjacent CH. However, if the CH2 is also coupled to another group, like the ethyl's CH2, which is three bonds away, that could add a quartet. For example, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is split by the adjacent CH (doublet) and by the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the CH(C2H5) proton into a triplet, and the other CH(C2H5) proton could split it into a doublet, and the ethyl's CH3 could split it into a quartet. But again, this is speculative.\n\nPerhaps the key is the number of neighboring protons each proton is coupled to. A doublet of triplets of quartets implies three different coupling partners. For example, a proton coupled to a proton that splits into a quartet, another that splits into a triplet, and another that splits into a doublet. But the order in the notation can vary.\n\nAlternatively, the splitting could be due to coupling with three different sets of protons. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2 (triplet), a CH (doublet), and a CH3 (quartet). If these couplings are present, the splitting pattern would be a combination of these. \n\nLooking back at the options, the fourth compound has two ethyl groups attached to the central CH groups. Each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3. The protons on the central CH would couple with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other central CH (doublet), and possibly the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of triplet (from CH2) of doublet (from other CH), but the notation is usually ordered by the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the CH2 (triplet), then the next with the other CH (doublet), and the smallest with the CH3 (quartet), the pattern would be a quartet of doublet of triplet. However, the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the largest coupling is the quartet, then triplet, then doublet. This seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH2CH3 group. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2CH3 group would couple with the two protons on the CH2 (triplet), and if also coupled to another group with three protons (like a CH3), that would be a quartet. But how would that combine? It would be a triplet from the CH2 and a quartet from the CH3, leading to a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which includes three levels of splitting.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the branching. The first and third compounds have methyl branches, while the second and fourth have ethyl branches. The presence of ethyl groups would introduce more protons adjacent to each other, leading to more complex splitting. The problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex patterns are more likely in structures with more branching and more adjacent protons.\n\nBetween the second and fourth compounds, the fourth has the ethyl branches closer to the CH2 adjacent to COOH. The fourth compound's structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH(C2H5) protons would be split by the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet) and the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets. Additionally, the ethyl group's CH3 might couple with the CH(C2H5) proton, but that's three bonds away. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH could be split by the adjacent CH(C2H5) (doublet), and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But this doesn't match the given splitting patterns.\n\nAlternatively, the second compound: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. The COOH is attached to a CH(C2H5) group. The protons on this CH would be split by the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), and possibly the CH2CH3 group (quartet if coupled to three protons). Wait, the CH2CH3 group is on the first carbon. The central CH(C2H5) is adjacent to the CH2CH3 group. The protons on the central CH(C2H5) would couple with the CH2CH3's two protons (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). This could lead to a triplet of doublet of triplets, but it's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the doublet of triplets of quartets might come from a proton adjacent to three different groups: a quartet (from a CH3), a triplet (from a CH2), and a doublet (from a CH). For example, in the fourth compound, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of triplet (from CH2) of doublet (from CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets of quartets. However, coupling with the ethyl's CH3 would be over three bonds (vicinal to the CH2), which is possible but with a smaller coupling constant. If this is the case, the largest splitting would be from the adjacent CH (doublet), then the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the smallest from the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). Thus, the splitting would be a quartet (small J) of triplet (medium J) of doublet (large J), which would be written as a doublet of triplets of quartets. This matches one of the signals mentioned. Similarly, another proton in the structure might have a doublet of triplets of triplets if coupled to two triplets and a doublet.\n\nGiven that the fourth compound has ethyl groups closer to the CH2 adjacent to COOH, this might be the source of the complex splitting. Therefore, the correct compound is likely the fourth one: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.\n\nBut I need to verify. Let's check the splitting patterns again. The fourth compound's structure is:\n\nCH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH\n\nThe protons on the CH2 adjacent to COOH (let's call this CH2-A) are next to the CH(C2H5) group. The CH2-A protons would couple with the adjacent CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(C2H5) proton is itself coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 (split into a triplet) and the other CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). Therefore, the CH(C2H5) proton's signal would be a doublet of triplets. However, the CH2-A protons are only coupled to the CH(C2H5) proton, which is split into a doublet of triplets. Therefore, the CH2-A protons would split into a doublet of triplets as well. But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where would the quartet come from?\n\nAlternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 (attached to the CH) has two protons. The CH2-A protons are three bonds away from this ethyl CH2. If there's coupling between them (J coupling over three bonds), the CH2-A protons would be split by the ethyl's CH2 into a triplet. Additionally, they are split by the adjacent CH into a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. But where is the quartet?\n\nAlternatively, the ethyl group's CH3 is three bonds away from the CH2-A protons. Coupling over three bonds (J) could split the CH2-A protons into a quartet. So the CH2-A protons would be split by the adjacent CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all these couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet of triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order depends on the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the adjacent CH (doublet), then the next with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the smallest with the ethyl's CH3 (quartet), the splitting would be a quartet (small J) of triplet (medium J) of doublet (large J), which is written as a doublet of triplets of quartets. This matches the given data.\n\nAnother signal in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of triplets. This could come from the CH(C2H5) protons. Each CH(C2H5) proton is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) proton (doublet), and possibly the adjacent CH2CH3 group (if present). In the fourth compound, the CH(C2H5) is adjacent to a CH3 group (from the starting CH3), but that's three bonds away. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH(C2H5) proton. So the splitting would be a triplet (ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (on the other CH), which is separated by a carbon, but that might not contribute significantly. However, if there is coupling, it could add another triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of triplets. This might occur if the proton is coupled to two different triplets and a doublet. For example, coupling to two ethyl groups' CH2 (each a triplet) and another CH (doublet). If the CH(C2H5) proton is coupled to its own ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) proton (doublet), and the adjacent ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then the splitting would be a triplet of triplet of doublets. But the notation order depends on coupling constants. If the largest coupling is the doublet, then triplet, then triplet, it would be a triplet of triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of triplets. This is getting too ambiguous.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the fourth compound is the most likely candidate because the ethyl groups adjacent to the CH2 next to COOH can introduce the necessary couplings for a doublet of triplets of quartets. The other complex splitting (doublet of triplets of triplets) might come from the CH(C2H5) protons being coupled to multiple ethyl groups. Therefore, the answer is likely the fourth option: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446079, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6969, prompt_tokens=1352, total_tokens=8321, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Alternatively, the presence of two ethyl groups adjacent to each CH could lead to coupling with multiple protons. For example, each CH is adjacent to a C2H5 group (which has two protons on the adjacent CH2) and another CH. The coupling with the adjacent CH (J1), the adjacent CH2 (J2), and perhaps another group (J3) could lead to a triplet of triplets of quartets. However, the exact splitting pattern would depend on the number of neighboring protons and their coupling constants.

Alternatively, the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be next to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The protons on this CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl groups. The ethyl groups themselves could lead to splitting. However, the presence of two ethyl groups on each adjacent CH might lead to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, the first compound's CH3 branches might lead to simpler splitting. For example, each CH is adjacent to two CH3 groups and another CH. The coupling between the two CH protons (each with two CH3 groups) might lead to a doublet, and coupling with adjacent CH3 groups (which are equivalent) might not split further. However, if there are other neighboring protons, such as from the CH2CH3 group, that could contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is the presence of a CH2 group adjacent to the COOH. In options 3 and 4, the COOH is attached to a CH2 group. In options 1 and 2, the COOH is attached to a CH group. The splitting of the CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a triplet if next to a CH2, but in options 3 and 4, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group. For example, in option 3: CH(CH3)2-CH2-COOH. The CH2 would be adjacent to a CH(CH3)2 group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, which has two CH3 groups. The CH group's proton would split the CH2 into a doublet, but each of those might split further by other adjacent groups. However, the CH(CH3)2 group's protons might not split the CH2 protons much if they are not adjacent. Wait, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3)2, so the CH2 protons would couple with the single proton on the CH. That would split the CH2 into a doublet. Then, each of those might split further by other couplings. If the CH2 is also adjacent to another group, but in option 3, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 is adjacent to a C(H)(CH3) group, which has a single proton. So the CH2 would split into a doublet from coupling with that proton. Then, perhaps the CH2 protons are also adjacent to the COOH group. The COOH proton is exchange broadened and might not split the CH2. Alternatively, the CH2 might be split by the adjacent CH and perhaps by the next CH in the chain. But in this case, the CH2 is between two CH groups. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the structure of option 3: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the chain is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 is adjacent to a CH(CH3) group. So the CH2 protons would couple with the CH(CH3) proton, splitting into a doublet. Then, each of those might split further by coupling with the adjacent CH(CH3) group's methyl protons? But the methyl protons are on the adjacent carbon, so they are not vicinal (two bonds away) to the CH2 protons. Vicinal coupling is typically between protons on adjacent carbons. The CH2 protons are on the carbon next to the CH(CH3), so the coupling would be with the CH proton (on the adjacent carbon), leading to a doublet. However, if the CH2 is also adjacent to another group, but in this case, the CH2 is between the CH(CH3) and the COOH. The COOH is at the end, so the CH2 is only adjacent to the CH(CH3) and the COOH. The COOH's proton is acidic and usually appears as a broad peak, not splitting neighboring protons. Therefore, the CH2 would be a doublet. But the problem states that there are more complex splitting patterns. So perhaps this is not the case.

Looking back at the splitting patterns given: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These are higher-order splitting patterns, which suggests that certain protons are coupled to multiple sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons. For example, a proton might be adjacent to three different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants. 

Let's consider the second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Each of the central CH groups is attached to a C2H5 group. The protons on the central CH would be adjacent to the ethyl group's protons and the other CH group. The ethyl group's CH2 protons would split the central CH's proton. For example, the central CH proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (which are split into a triplet), and also with the other central CH proton (split into a doublet). Additionally, there might be coupling with the next ethyl group. However, this could lead to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If there are more couplings, such as from the ethyl group's CH3, but those are three bonds away (geminal coupling is not typical). Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the central CH proton into a triplet, and the other central CH proton could split it into a doublet, leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent CH2CH3 group (the ethyl group attached to the first carbon), that could add another splitting. However, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be next to a C(H)(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH proton (split into a doublet), and the CH proton is itself split by the ethyl group. The ethyl group's protons could lead to further splitting. For example, the CH2 protons would first split into a doublet from the adjacent CH, and then each of those could split into a triplet from coupling with the ethyl group's CH2. However, the ethyl group's CH2 is on the same carbon as the CH, so the coupling would be vicinal (across two bonds). Wait, the ethyl group is attached to the CH, so the ethyl's CH2 is adjacent to the CH. Therefore, the CH2 protons on the ethyl group are adjacent to the CH, so the coupling between the ethyl's CH2 and the CH's proton would be vicinal. However, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is on the next carbon. So the CH2 adjacent to COOH is separated by one carbon from the ethyl group. Therefore, the coupling between the CH2 (adjacent to COOH) and the ethyl's CH2 would be three bonds apart (if the structure is CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH), which is possible (J coupling over three bonds can occur, but it's usually smaller). However, this might not lead to a quartet. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is split by the adjacent CH, which is split by the ethyl group. So the CH2 would be a doublet from the adjacent CH, and the CH itself is split by the ethyl group into a triplet. Therefore, the CH2 would be a doublet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups lead to more splitting. Let's take the second compound again. The central CH groups are each attached to an ethyl group. The proton on the central CH would couple with the ethyl group's CH2 protons (which are two protons, leading to a triplet), and also with the other central CH proton (leading to a doublet). Additionally, the ethyl group's CH2 protons might couple with the central CH proton. So the splitting would be a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2, but that's on a different carbon. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the central CH into a triplet, and the other CH proton could split it into a doublet, and perhaps the adjacent CH2CH3 group (the ethyl on the first carbon) could split it into a quartet. But that might be stretching it.

Alternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH2 group. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, that would split into a quartet. If that proton is also coupled to another group that splits into a triplet, and another that splits into a doublet, then you get a doublet of triplets of quartets. So where would that occur?

Looking at the fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH (split into a doublet). The CH itself is attached to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 protons would split the CH into a triplet. Additionally, the other C2H5 group on the adjacent carbon might also couple. However, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is separated by one carbon from the other C2H5 group. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH could be split by the adjacent CH (doublet), which is split by its own ethyl group (triplet), and perhaps by another ethyl group further away. But this might not account for a quartet.

Alternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH3 group. Wait, a quartet typically arises from coupling with three equivalent protons (like a CH3), but that's a quartet. However, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (two protons), that would be a triplet. Wait, no—coupling with two equivalent protons gives a triplet. Coupling with three equivalent protons gives a quartet. So if a proton is adjacent to a CH3 group (three protons), it would split into a quartet. So where in the structures is a proton adjacent to a CH3?

In the first compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The central CH groups each have a CH3. The protons on the central CH would couple with the adjacent CH3 (three protons), leading to a quartet. But they also couple with the other CH group. So if a CH proton is adjacent to a CH3 (quartet) and another CH (doublet), the splitting would be a quartet of doublets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, if a proton is coupled to three different groups: for example, a CH3 (quartet), a CH2 (triplet), and another CH (doublet). But that would be a quartet of triplet of doublets, which is complex. However, the splitting order depends on the coupling constants. The largest coupling is usually listed first. So if a proton is first split into a quartet (coupling to CH3), then each of those lines is split into a triplet (coupling to CH2), and then each of those is split into a doublet (coupling to CH), the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets of quartets. But this seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet comes from a CH2CH3 group. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2CH3 group would couple with the two protons on the CH2, leading to a triplet. If that proton is also coupled to another group with three protons (like a CH3), that would be a quartet. But how would that combine?

Alternatively, let's consider the ethyl groups in the second and fourth compounds. In the second compound, the central CH is adjacent to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 has two protons. The central CH proton would couple with those two protons (triplet) and with the other central CH proton (doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the ethyl group's CH3 (three bonds away), which might be a smaller coupling, leading to a doublet of triplets of quartets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the quartet could come from a geminal coupling, but that's not typical in 1H NMR. Geminal protons (on the same carbon) usually don't split each other because they are equivalent. 

Wait, another thought: the very broad peak in the IR at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, which is broad due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound is definitely a carboxylic acid. Now, looking at the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens means all carbons are saturated. The splitting patterns are complex, indicating multiple couplings.

Let me try to sketch each structure and see where the complex splitting would occur.

First compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The chain is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The protons on the two CH(CH3) groups. Each CH(CH3) proton is adjacent to the other CH(CH3) and to the CH2 group. The CH2CH3 group's protons might split the adjacent CH(CH3) proton. The CH(CH3) protons would each be split by the adjacent CH2 (which has two protons, leading to a triplet) and by the other CH(CH3) proton (leading to a doublet). So each CH(CH3) proton would be a triplet of doublets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the methyl groups, but methyl protons are three bonds away (if on the same carbon), which might not split. Alternatively, the CH2CH3 group's protons could split the CH(CH3) proton into a triplet, and the other CH(CH3) proton could split it into a doublet. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets, which is one of the signals mentioned. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. So maybe this isn't sufficient.

Second compound: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Each CH(C2H5) proton is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH(C2H5) proton. The ethyl group's CH2 has two protons, so coupling with them would split the CH proton into a triplet. The other CH(C2H5) proton would split it into a doublet. Additionally, the ethyl group's CH2 might have their own couplings. However, the CH(C2H5) proton would be a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (on the other CH), but that's separated by a carbon. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split into a triplet, and the other CH's proton could split into a doublet, and the ethyl's CH3 could split into a quartet. But that's three couplings. If the CH proton is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH (doublet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet), then the splitting would be a quartet of doublet of triplets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order depends on the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then the next with the other CH (doublet), and the smallest with the CH3 (quartet), then it would be a quartet (from CH3) of doublet (from other CH) of triplet (from ethyl's CH2). But this is getting too speculative.

Third compound: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(CH3) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH(CH3) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(CH3) protons are each adjacent to two CH3 groups and the other CH(CH3). Each CH(CH3) proton would be split by the other CH(CH3) (doublet) and by the adjacent CH3 groups (which are equivalent, so no splitting). So the CH(CH3) protons would be doublets. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a doublet from the adjacent CH. However, the problem mentions more complex splitting. So this might not fit.

Fourth compound: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(C2H5) proton is adjacent to a C2H5 group. The C2H5's CH2 protons would split the CH proton into a triplet. Additionally, the other CH(C2H5) group's proton might couple with it. So the CH(C2H5) proton would be a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. The CH2 adjacent to COOH would be a doublet from the adjacent CH. However, if the CH2 is also coupled to another group, like the ethyl's CH2, which is three bonds away, that could add a quartet. For example, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is split by the adjacent CH (doublet) and by the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. Not sure.

Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 could split the CH(C2H5) proton into a triplet, and the other CH(C2H5) proton could split it into a doublet, and the ethyl's CH3 could split it into a quartet. But again, this is speculative.

Perhaps the key is the number of neighboring protons each proton is coupled to. A doublet of triplets of quartets implies three different coupling partners. For example, a proton coupled to a proton that splits into a quartet, another that splits into a triplet, and another that splits into a doublet. But the order in the notation can vary.

Alternatively, the splitting could be due to coupling with three different sets of protons. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2 (triplet), a CH (doublet), and a CH3 (quartet). If these couplings are present, the splitting pattern would be a combination of these. 

Looking back at the options, the fourth compound has two ethyl groups attached to the central CH groups. Each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3. The protons on the central CH would couple with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other central CH (doublet), and possibly the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of triplet (from CH2) of doublet (from other CH), but the notation is usually ordered by the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the CH2 (triplet), then the next with the other CH (doublet), and the smallest with the CH3 (quartet), the pattern would be a quartet of doublet of triplet. However, the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the largest coupling is the quartet, then triplet, then doublet. This seems less likely.

Alternatively, the quartet could come from coupling with a CH2CH3 group. For example, a proton adjacent to a CH2CH3 group would couple with the two protons on the CH2 (triplet), and if also coupled to another group with three protons (like a CH3), that would be a quartet. But how would that combine? It would be a triplet from the CH2 and a quartet from the CH3, leading to a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which includes three levels of splitting.

Perhaps the answer lies in the branching. The first and third compounds have methyl branches, while the second and fourth have ethyl branches. The presence of ethyl groups would introduce more protons adjacent to each other, leading to more complex splitting. The problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex patterns are more likely in structures with more branching and more adjacent protons.

Between the second and fourth compounds, the fourth has the ethyl branches closer to the CH2 adjacent to COOH. The fourth compound's structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH(C2H5) protons would be split by the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet) and the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets. Additionally, the ethyl group's CH3 might couple with the CH(C2H5) proton, but that's three bonds away. Alternatively, the CH2 adjacent to COOH could be split by the adjacent CH(C2H5) (doublet), and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But this doesn't match the given splitting patterns.

Alternatively, the second compound: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. The COOH is attached to a CH(C2H5) group. The protons on this CH would be split by the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), and possibly the CH2CH3 group (quartet if coupled to three protons). Wait, the CH2CH3 group is on the first carbon. The central CH(C2H5) is adjacent to the CH2CH3 group. The protons on the central CH(C2H5) would couple with the CH2CH3's two protons (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) (doublet), and the ethyl group's CH2 (triplet). This could lead to a triplet of doublet of triplets, but it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the doublet of triplets of quartets might come from a proton adjacent to three different groups: a quartet (from a CH3), a triplet (from a CH2), and a doublet (from a CH). For example, in the fourth compound, the CH2 adjacent to COOH is next to a CH(C2H5) group. The CH2 protons would couple with the CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all three couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3) of triplet (from CH2) of doublet (from CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets of quartets. However, coupling with the ethyl's CH3 would be over three bonds (vicinal to the CH2), which is possible but with a smaller coupling constant. If this is the case, the largest splitting would be from the adjacent CH (doublet), then the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the smallest from the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). Thus, the splitting would be a quartet (small J) of triplet (medium J) of doublet (large J), which would be written as a doublet of triplets of quartets. This matches one of the signals mentioned. Similarly, another proton in the structure might have a doublet of triplets of triplets if coupled to two triplets and a doublet.

Given that the fourth compound has ethyl groups closer to the CH2 adjacent to COOH, this might be the source of the complex splitting. Therefore, the correct compound is likely the fourth one: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

But I need to verify. Let's check the splitting patterns again. The fourth compound's structure is:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

The protons on the CH2 adjacent to COOH (let's call this CH2-A) are next to the CH(C2H5) group. The CH2-A protons would couple with the adjacent CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). The CH(C2H5) proton is itself coupled to the ethyl group's CH2 (split into a triplet) and the other CH(C2H5) proton (split into a doublet). Therefore, the CH(C2H5) proton's signal would be a doublet of triplets. However, the CH2-A protons are only coupled to the CH(C2H5) proton, which is split into a doublet of triplets. Therefore, the CH2-A protons would split into a doublet of triplets as well. But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Where would the quartet come from?

Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 (attached to the CH) has two protons. The CH2-A protons are three bonds away from this ethyl CH2. If there's coupling between them (J coupling over three bonds), the CH2-A protons would be split by the ethyl's CH2 into a triplet. Additionally, they are split by the adjacent CH into a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. But where is the quartet?

Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH3 is three bonds away from the CH2-A protons. Coupling over three bonds (J) could split the CH2-A protons into a quartet. So the CH2-A protons would be split by the adjacent CH (doublet), the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the ethyl's CH3 (quartet). If all these couplings are present, the splitting would be a quartet of triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets. The order depends on the coupling constants. If the largest coupling is with the adjacent CH (doublet), then the next with the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), and the smallest with the ethyl's CH3 (quartet), the splitting would be a quartet (small J) of triplet (medium J) of doublet (large J), which is written as a doublet of triplets of quartets. This matches the given data.

Another signal in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of triplets. This could come from the CH(C2H5) protons. Each CH(C2H5) proton is coupled to the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) proton (doublet), and possibly the adjacent CH2CH3 group (if present). In the fourth compound, the CH(C2H5) is adjacent to a CH3 group (from the starting CH3), but that's three bonds away. Alternatively, the ethyl group's CH2 and the other CH(C2H5) proton. So the splitting would be a triplet (ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (other CH), leading to a doublet of triplets. If there's another coupling, perhaps from the adjacent ethyl group's CH2 (on the other CH), which is separated by a carbon, but that might not contribute significantly. However, if there is coupling, it could add another triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of triplets. This might occur if the proton is coupled to two different triplets and a doublet. For example, coupling to two ethyl groups' CH2 (each a triplet) and another CH (doublet). If the CH(C2H5) proton is coupled to its own ethyl's CH2 (triplet), the other CH(C2H5) proton (doublet), and the adjacent ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then the splitting would be a triplet of triplet of doublets. But the notation order depends on coupling constants. If the largest coupling is the doublet, then triplet, then triplet, it would be a triplet of triplet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of triplets. This is getting too ambiguous.

Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the fourth compound is the most likely candidate because the ethyl groups adjacent to the CH2 next to COOH can introduce the necessary couplings for a doublet of triplets of quartets. The other complex splitting (doublet of triplets of triplets) might come from the CH(C2H5) protons being coupled to multiple ethyl groups. Therefore, the answer is likely the fourth option: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.
