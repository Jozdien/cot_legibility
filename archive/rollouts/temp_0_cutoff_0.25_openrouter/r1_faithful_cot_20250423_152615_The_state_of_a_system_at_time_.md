# Original Question

The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

To find the probability of getting 0 for observable \( P \) and then -1 for observable \( Q \) when measuring them one after the other, we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvectors of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix for \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing this, we get \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)**:
   - The initial state is \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing this, we get \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The inner product \( \langle p_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is \( \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after collapsing to \( |p_0\rangle \)**:
   - The collapsed state \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The probability of measuring -1 is the square of the third component of \( |p_0\rangle \):
     \[
     \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

4. **Total probability**:
   - Multiply the probabilities: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when measuring them one after the other. Hmm, let me recall how measurement works in quantum mechanics. 

First, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable, right? The probability of collapsing into a particular eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenstate. So, if I first measure P, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P with the corresponding eigenvalue. Then, immediately after, when I measure Q, the system is now in an eigenstate of P, but I need to express this eigenstate in terms of the eigenstates of Q to compute the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but first, I need to make sure I have the matrices for P and Q correctly. Let me write them down.

The operator P is given by the matrix:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, in matrix form, that's:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And operator Q is:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. That makes sense; Q is already diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3.

But for P, since it's not diagonal, I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The question mentions measuring P and getting 0. So, 0 is one of the eigenvalues of P. Therefore, I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 for P. Then, the state collapses into that eigenvector after the measurement of P, and then we use that eigenvector to compute the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.

So, step by step:

1. Find the eigenvalues of P, particularly the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
2. The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). But wait, when we measure P, the system is in this state. So the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the square of the norm of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector(s) of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to that eigenvector (normalized). Then, measure Q on this collapsed state, and find the probability of getting -1.

But the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So, the total probability is the probability of first measuring 0 for P multiplied by the probability of measuring -1 for Q given that the state collapsed to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the steps are:

a) Find the eigenvector(s) of P with eigenvalue 0.

b) Project the initial state onto this eigenvector(s) and compute the probability (the squared norm of the projection).

c) The collapsed state after measurement is the normalized projection.

d) Express this collapsed state in terms of the eigenbasis of Q (which is the standard basis since Q is diagonal), and find the probability of getting -1 (which corresponds to the third basis vector e3 = (0,0,1)).

e) Multiply the probabilities from steps b) and d) to get the total probability.

Okay, let's start with step a: finding the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0.

To find the eigenvalues of P, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But since we are specifically looking for eigenvalue 0, we can set λ = 0 and solve (P - 0I)v = Pv = 0.

So, solving Pv = 0.

Let me write out the equations. Let v = (v1, v2, v3)^T.

From the first row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3.

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0.

So, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are vectors where v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3. So, they are of the form (a, 0, -a)^T where a is a scalar. Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since it's defined by two conditions, v2=0 and v1=-v3, in a 3D space, so the dimension is 1). Wait, actually, in 3D space, two independent equations would reduce the dimension by 2, so 3 - 2 = 1. So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional. So, the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1)^T multiplied by any scalar. But we need to normalize it.

So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T. Let's check its norm: 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Wait, but let me confirm by applying P to this vector.

P * (1, 0, -1)^T:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

So, yes, P*(1,0,-1)^T = 0. So, that's correct. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So, the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Now, step b: the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let's denote this as |ψ>.

We need to compute the projection of |ψ> onto |p0>, then the probability is the squared magnitude of this projection.

First, compute the inner product <p0|ψ>.

<p0|ψ> = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2.

So, the projection of |ψ> onto |p0> is (-√2)|p0>, because the projection is <p0|ψ> * |p0>.

But the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection, which is |<p0|ψ>|^2 = (-√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. The probability can't be greater than 1. So, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, the inner product is -√2, but the norm squared is |inner product|^2, which is 2. But the total probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is 2? That's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, this must mean I made a mistake in the normalization of the eigenvector.

Wait, let's check again. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1)^T. The norm of this vector is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. So, that's correct.

But when I compute <p0|ψ>, which is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. So, the inner product is -√2, and the squared magnitude is (√2)^2 = 2. But the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's check the norm of the initial state. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state is not normalized. Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". But in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized. So, is this state already normalized? Let's check.

Norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T. But the problem didn't mention normalization. Wait, maybe in this problem, they are considering the state as given, even if it's not normalized. But in that case, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize it.

Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, perhaps we need to consider that this is the state vector, not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So, maybe the problem assumes that the vector is already normalized? But 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T. But the problem didn't specify, which is confusing. Wait, maybe in some contexts, especially in problems, they give the state as a vector without normalizing, and you have to normalize it when computing probabilities. So, perhaps I need to proceed with the given vector, but normalize it first.

So, let's clarify. If the state is given as a column vector, but it's not normalized, then when we compute probabilities, we have to normalize it. So, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T, with norm squared 6. Therefore, the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T.

Therefore, when we compute the probability of measuring P=0, we need to take the inner product of |ψ_normalized> with |p0>, then square the magnitude.

So, let's recalculate <p0|ψ_normalized>:

= (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) * (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)

= (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1/√2 - 1/√2) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/√2)

= (1/sqrt(6)) * (-√2)

= (-√2)/sqrt(6) = (-1)/sqrt(3)

Therefore, the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = 1/3.

So, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 corresponding to the standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the collapsed state in the e3 direction.

The collapsed state is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. The third component is -1/√2. Therefore, the amplitude for e3 is -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after collapsing to |p0> is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, normalization of the initial state: yes, the norm squared was 6, so normalized by 1/sqrt(6). Then, inner product with |p0> gave -1/sqrt(3), squared is 1/3. Then, the collapsed state is |p0>, which when expressed in the standard basis (which is the eigenbasis of Q), has components (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The third component is -1/√2, so the probability for Q=-1 is indeed (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply them: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/6.

Wait, but let me check again the collapsed state. After measuring P=0, the state becomes |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. Then, when measuring Q, which is diagonal, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1 with probabilities equal to the square of the absolute values of the components. So, the component corresponding to -1 is the third component, which is -1/√2. So, the probability is indeed (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So, yes, 1/2.

Therefore, multiplying the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

But let me just confirm once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the inner product.

Original state normalized: ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

Eigenvector |p0>: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 )

Inner product:

(-1/sqrt(6))(1/√2) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/√2)

= [ -1/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ -1/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) ]

= -2/(sqrt(12)) = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3)

Yes, that's correct. So squared is 1/3.

Then, the collapsed state is |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The Q measurement: the third component is -1/√2, so probability 1/2. So, 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when measuring them one after the other. Hmm, let me recall how measurement works in quantum mechanics.

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, in matrix form, that's:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],

I need to determine the probability of obtaining a measurement of 0 for observable P followed by -1 for observable Q. In quantum mechanics, measuring an observable causes the system to collapse into one of the observable's eigenstates, with the probability being the squared amplitude of the state vector in that eigenstate. So for this sequential measurement, I first need to find the probability of the system collapsing to an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, and then from that new state, calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Let me examine the matrices for P and Q:

P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],
     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
     [0, 1/√2, 0]]

Q = [[1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, -1]]

Q is already diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, corresponding to the standard basis vectors e₁, e₂, and e₃.

However, P is not diagonal, so I need to find its eigenvectors, particularly those with eigenvalue 0. Once I identify these eigenvectors, I can project the initial state (-1, 2, 1) onto them to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. After this measurement, the state collapses to the normalized eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then I'll express this collapsed state in terms of Q's eigenbasis to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Therefore, the total probability I'm seeking is the product of:
a) The probability of measuring 0 for P (which is the squared norm of projecting the initial state onto P's eigenspace with eigenvalue 0)
b) The probability of measuring -1 for Q given that the system is now in the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0

Alright, I need to calculate the probability of first obtaining 0 for observable P and then -1 for observable Q when they are measured consecutively. Let's review the quantum measurement process.

Initially, when an observable is measured, the system collapses into one of its eigenstates. The likelihood of collapsing into a specific eigenstate is determined by the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenstate. Therefore, if P is measured first, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P that corresponds to its eigenvalue. Subsequently, when measuring Q, the system, now in an eigenstate of P, must be expressed in terms of Q's eigenstates to compute the probability of obtaining -1.

Before proceeding, I should verify the matrices for P and Q by noting them.

The matrix representation of operator P is:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0  

In matrix form:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],  
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],  
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Meanwhile, operator Q is represented as:

First row: 1, 0, 0  
Second row: 0, 0, 0  
Third row: 0, 0, -1  

Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 on its diagonal corresponding to the standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3.

Since P is not diagonal, I must determine its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The task specifies that measuring P yields 0, indicating it is one of P's eigenvalues. Hence, I need to find the eigenvector(s) related to this eigenvalue. Once P is measured, the system collapses into this eigenvector. We then use this eigenvector to compute the likelihood of obtaining -1 when measuring Q.

The process is as follows:

1. Determine the eigenvalues of P and, specifically, the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue 0.
2. The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). When P is measured, the probability of obtaining 0 is the square of the projection's norm of this initial state onto the eigenvector(s) of P with eigenvalue 0. After measurement, the state collapses into this (normalized) eigenvector. Subsequently, measure Q on this collapsed state to find the probability of achieving -1.

The question requires the probability of obtaining 0 from P followed by -1 from Q. Therefore, the overall probability is the product of the probability of first measuring 0 for P and the probability of measuring -1 for Q given the collapse to the P eigenstate with eigenvalue 0.

The steps to be undertaken are:

a) Identify the eigenvector(s) of P with eigenvalue 0.

b) Project the ini...

Let\'s compute P multiplied by this eigenvector:\n\nP * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0\n\nThird component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0\n\nSo, yes, it gives the zero vector. Therefore, that\'s correct. So the eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nSo, step a) done.\n\nStep b): Project the initial state onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P.\n\nThe initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let\'s denote this as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector is |φ> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.\n\nThe projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is the inner product <φ|ψ>, which is:\n\n(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that can\'t be. The probability can\'t be greater than 1. Wait, that must mean I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. So the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is | -√2 |^2 = 2. But probabilities can\'t exceed 1. So that\'s a problem. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Is this state normalized? Let\'s check its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is √6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. In quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but sometimes problems give non-normalized vectors. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. But here, the given vector is not normalized. So, does that mean we need to normalize it first before computing probabilities?\n\nWait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P", so the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). But when you perform a measurement, the probabilities are calculated using the squared amplitudes divided by the norm squared. Wait, actually, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2 if ψ is not normalized. Wait, but in standard quantum mechanics, the state is supposed to be a unit vector. If it\'s not, then the probabilities are calculated by |<φ|ψ>|^2 divided by ||ψ||^2. But in this problem, maybe the state is given as a vector, and we are to assume that it\'s the state vector, even if not normalized. Wait, but in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. So, perhaps the problem expects us to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn\'t specify whether it\'s normalized. Hmm. But in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors. So, perhaps the given vector is the state vector, and we need to normalize it first. Let me check the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the normalized state would be (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Therefore, perhaps we need to use this normalized state for the calculations. Otherwise, the probabilities would be greater than 1, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it\'s not. So, maybe the problem is in error, or perhaps we need to proceed without normalizing. Wait, but the answer would be 2, which is greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must expect us to use the normalized state. Therefore, I need to normalize the initial state first.\n\nTherefore, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Then, the projection onto |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is:\n\n<φ|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/√12 = (-2)/√12 = (-1)/√3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, so the probability is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3.\n\nOkay, that\'s a valid probability. So, the probability of measuring P and getting 0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after the measurement, the state collapses to the eigenstate |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Because when you measure an observable and get a particular eigenvalue, the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector, normalized. Since we already normalized the eigenvector, the collapsed state is |φ>.\n\nNow, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the state |φ> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). To find the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q, we need to express |φ> in terms of the eigenstates of Q. Since Q\'s eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, the components of |φ> directly give the amplitudes for each eigenvalue.\n\nSpecifically, the third component corresponds to eigenvalue -1. The third component of |φ> is -1/√2. Therefore, the amplitude is -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |^2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring -1 for Q after having measured 0 for P is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure.\n\nFirst, initial state: (-1, 2, 1). Norm squared is 6, so normalized is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).\n\nProjection onto P\'s eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):\n\nInner product: (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1 -1)/√12 = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/√3. So squared magnitude is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen, post-measurement state is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, measuring Q: the third component is -1/√2, so probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, 1/6 is the answer.\n\nBut let me just verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem does not require normalization of the initial state. Let\'s see what happens if we don\'t normalize.\n\nOriginal state: (-1, 2, 1). Projection onto (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is (-1)(1/√2) + 0 + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. Then, the probability is (√2)^2 = 2. But since the state wasn\'t normalized, the actual probability would be 2 divided by the norm squared of the initial state, which is 6. So 2/6 = 1/3. Which is the same as before. So whether you normalize the state first or compute the probability as |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2, you get the same result. So, in this case, since the initial state is not normalized, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2 = (2)/6 = 1/3. Then, the post-measurement state is |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), as before. Then, the probability for Q is 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So either way, the answer is 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447376, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3316, prompt_tokens=916, total_tokens=4232, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the probability of getting 0 for observable \( P \) and then -1 for observable \( Q \) when measuring them one after the other, we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvectors of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix for \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Probability of measuring 0 for \( P \)**:
   - The initial state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing this state gives \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The projection of the normalized initial state onto the eigenvector of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0 is:
     \[
     \left\langle \phi \middle| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is \( \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Post-measurement state**:
   - After measuring 0 for \( P \), the state collapses to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

4. **Probability of measuring -1 for \( Q \)**:
   - The matrix for \( Q \) is:
     \[
     Q = \begin{pmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & -1
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - The post-measurement state \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \) has a third component corresponding to eigenvalue -1. The probability is \( \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).

5. **Total probability**:
   - The total probability is the product of the two probabilities: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \).

The probability of getting 0 for \( P \) and -1 for \( Q \) is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ital state onto this eigenvector(s) to find the probability of measuring 0 for P.

c) Normalize the projected eigenvector to get the post-measurement state.

d) Express this post-measurement state in terms of the eigenstates of Q (which are the standard basis vectors since Q is diagonal).

e) The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the amplitude of the component corresponding to eigenvalue -1 (which is the third component, since Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 for the first, second, third components respectively).

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the probabilities from step b) and step e).

So let's start with step a): Find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0.

To find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, we need to solve (P - 0*I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.

So, writing out the equations for Pv = 0:

First row: (1/√2)v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Third row: (1/√2)v2 = 0

From the first and third equations: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

From the second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So, they are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), since the norm of (1, 0, -1) is √(1 + 0 + 1) = √2.

So, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 for P is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Wait, but let me verify this. Let's compute P multiplied by this eigenvector:

P * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T

First component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0

Third component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0

So, yes, it gives the zero vector. Therefore, that's correct. So the eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So, step a) done.

Step b): Project the initial state onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P.

The initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The eigenvector is |φ> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

The projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is the inner product <φ|ψ>, which is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, but that can't be. The probability can't be greater than 1. Wait, that must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, the inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. So the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is | -√2 |^2 = 2. But probabilities can't exceed 1. So that's a problem. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, but the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Is this state normalized? Let's check its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is √6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. In quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but sometimes problems give non-normalized vectors. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. But here, the given vector is not normalized. So, does that mean we need to normalize it first before computing probabilities?

Wait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P", so the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). But when you perform a measurement, the probabilities are calculated using the squared amplitudes divided by the norm squared. Wait, actually, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2 if ψ is not normalized. Wait, but in standard quantum mechanics, the state is supposed to be a unit vector. If it's not, then the probabilities are calculated by |<φ|ψ>|^2 divided by ||ψ||^2. But in this problem, maybe the state is given as a vector, and we are to assume that it's the state vector, even if not normalized. Wait, but in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. So, perhaps the problem expects us to normalize the state first.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't specify whether it's normalized. Hmm. But in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors. So, perhaps the given vector is the state vector, and we need to normalize it first. Let me check the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the normalized state would be (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Therefore, perhaps we need to use this normalized state for the calculations. Otherwise, the probabilities would be greater than 1, which is impossible.

Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not. So, maybe the problem is in error, or perhaps we need to proceed without normalizing. Wait, but the answer would be 2, which is greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must expect us to use the normalized state. Therefore, I need to normalize the initial state first.

Therefore, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Then, the projection onto |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is:

<φ|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/√12 = (-2)/√12 = (-1)/√3.

Therefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, so the probability is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3.

Okay, that's a valid probability. So, the probability of measuring P and getting 0 is 1/3.

Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to the eigenstate |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Because when you measure an observable and get a particular eigenvalue, the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector, normalized. Since we already normalized the eigenvector, the collapsed state is |φ>.

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3 respectively.

Therefore, the state |φ> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). To find the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q, we need to express |φ> in terms of the eigenstates of Q. Since Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, the components of |φ> directly give the amplitudes for each eigenvalue.

Specifically, the third component corresponds to eigenvalue -1. The third component of |φ> is -1/√2. Therefore, the amplitude is -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of measuring -1 for Q after having measured 0 for P is 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

Wait, but let me check again to make sure.

First, initial state: (-1, 2, 1). Norm squared is 6, so normalized is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

Projection onto P's eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):

Inner product: (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1 -1)/√12 = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/√3. So squared magnitude is 1/3. Correct.

Then, post-measurement state is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, measuring Q: the third component is -1/√2, so probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Correct.

Therefore, total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, 1/6 is the answer.

But let me just verify once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem does not require normalization of the initial state. Let's see what happens if we don't normalize.

Original state: (-1, 2, 1). Projection onto (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is (-1)(1/√2) + 0 + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. Then, the probability is (√2)^2 = 2. But since the state wasn't normalized, the actual probability would be 2 divided by the norm squared of the initial state, which is 6. So 2/6 = 1/3. Which is the same as before. So whether you normalize the state first or compute the probability as |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2, you get the same result. So, in this case, since the initial state is not normalized, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2 = (2)/6 = 1/3. Then, the post-measurement state is |φ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), as before. Then, the probability for Q is 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So either way, the answer is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

So the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But in quantum mechanics, when you have a state vector, it\'s usually assumed to be normalized. However, the problem states "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". If this is not normalized, then we need to normalize it first before computing probabilities. But the problem might be considering the state as given, even if not normalized. Wait, but in standard QM, the state must be a unit vector. So perhaps the problem assumes that the given vector is already normalized. Let\'s check:\n\n||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is √6. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But the problem says "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so maybe they are not normalized. However, in that case, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize. So the probability is |<p₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². Wait, but actually, the standard formula is that the probability is |<p₀|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ> if |ψ> is not normalized. But in the problem statement, if they just give the state as a column vector, it\'s possible that they are considering it as a vector in Hilbert space, not necessarily normalized. However, in that case, the probabilities would be |<p₀|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||². But the problem might be expecting us to assume that the state is already normalized. Wait, but the given vector has a norm squared of 6, so it\'s not normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in error, or perhaps they just want us to proceed with the given vector, even if it\'s not normalized. But in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using non-normalized vectors, but that\'s non-standard. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn\'t mention normalization, so perhaps we need to proceed with the given vector as the state, even if it\'s not normalized. But in that case, the probabilities would be calculated as |<p₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². However, the problem might be expecting us to use the given vector as the state vector, and compute the probabilities without normalization. But that would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the state is given as a vector, and we can assume that it\'s already normalized. But in this case, the norm is √6, so unless they are using a different convention, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the vector as is, but then the probabilities would be greater than 1. That can\'t be. Therefore, I think the problem expects us to normalize the state vector first. So let\'s proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Then, the inner product <p₀|ψ> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) • ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ) = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3. The squared magnitude is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but if the initial state is normalized, then the probability is 1/3. Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to |p₀> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector e₃ = (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |p₀> onto e₃.\n\nThe projection is <e₃|p₀> = (0, 0, 1) • (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2. The squared magnitude is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step again to make sure.\n\nFirst, confirm the initial state normalization: yes, the given vector has norm √6, so normalized to 1/√6.\n\nThen, the inner product with |p₀>:\n\n|p₀> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The inner product with |ψ> normalized is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) -1/(√12) = -2/(√12) = -1/√3. Squared is 1/3. Correct.\n\nAfter measurement, the state is |p₀>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is |<e₃|p₀>|² = | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/6.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0.

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for observable \( P \) followed by -1 for observable \( Q \), we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:
   - The matrix for \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are found to be 0, 1, and -1.
   - For eigenvalue 0, the eigenvector is found to be \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \).

2. **Probability of Measuring 0 for \( P \)**:
   - The initial state is given as \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), which has a norm of \( \sqrt{6} \). The normalized state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \).
   - The inner product of the normalized state with the eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is calculated as:
     \[
     \left\langle p_0 \middle| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1/\sqrt{6}) + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1/\sqrt{6}) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - The probability is the squared magnitude of this inner product: \( \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Probability of Measuring -1 for \( Q \) After Collapse**:
   - After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \).
   - The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvector corresponding to -1 is \( e_3 = (0, 0, 1) \).
   - The inner product of the collapsed state with \( e_3 \) is:
     \[
     \left\langle e_3 \middle| p_0 \right\rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The probability is the squared magnitude of this inner product: \( \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the product of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

The probability of getting 0 for \( P \) and -1 for \( Q \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).

(which is the squared norm of projecting this eigenstate onto Q's eigenspace with eigenvalue -1)

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λI is:

[[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
 [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
 [0, 1/√2, -λ]]

The characteristic equation is:

|P - λI| = -λ [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2)[(1/√2)(-λ) - 0] + 0[...] = 0

Calculating the determinant:

First term: -λ [λ² - (1/2)]
Second term: - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (λ)/2
Third term is 0.

So the determinant is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ = -λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Therefore, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. Therefore, there is an eigenvalue 0. Now, we need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ = 0.

For λ = 0, solve (P - 0I)v = 0:

Pv = 0

So:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, v2 = 0

Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize this vector. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So, the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 for P is |p₀> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). To find the probability of measuring P=0, we compute the inner product of |ψ> with |p₀>, then take the squared magnitude.

Compute <p₀|ψ>:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2

The squared magnitude is | -√2 |² = 2. But wait, this can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, the inner product is -√2, but the squared magnitude is 2. However, the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's check its norm:

||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But in quantum mechanics, when you have a state vector, it's usually assumed to be normalized. However, the problem states "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". If this is not normalized, then we need to normalize it first before computing probabilities. But the problem might be considering the state as given, even if not normalized. Wait, but in standard QM, the state must be a unit vector. So perhaps the problem assumes that the given vector is already normalized. Let's check:

||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is √6. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But the problem says "the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)", so maybe they are not normalized. However, in that case, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize. So the probability is |<p₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². Wait, but actually, the standard formula is that the probability is |<p₀|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ> if |ψ> is not normalized. But in the problem statement, if they just give the state as a column vector, it's possible that they are considering it as a vector in Hilbert space, not necessarily normalized. However, in that case, the probabilities would be |<p₀|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||². But the problem might be expecting us to assume that the state is already normalized. Wait, but the given vector has a norm squared of 6, so it's not normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in error, or perhaps they just want us to proceed with the given vector, even if it's not normalized. But in that case, the probabilities would not sum to 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using non-normalized vectors, but that's non-standard. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't mention normalization, so perhaps we need to proceed with the given vector as the state, even if it's not normalized. But in that case, the probabilities would be calculated as |<p₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||². However, the problem might be expecting us to use the given vector as the state vector, and compute the probabilities without normalization. But that would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the state is given as a vector, and we can assume that it's already normalized. But in this case, the norm is √6, so unless they are using a different convention, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the vector as is, but then the probabilities would be greater than 1. That can't be. Therefore, I think the problem expects us to normalize the state vector first. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Then, the inner product <p₀|ψ> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) • ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ) = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3. The squared magnitude is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but if the initial state is normalized, then the probability is 1/3. Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to |p₀> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector e₃ = (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |p₀> onto e₃.

The projection is <e₃|p₀> = (0, 0, 1) • (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2. The squared magnitude is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But let me verify this step by step again to make sure.

First, confirm the initial state normalization: yes, the given vector has norm √6, so normalized to 1/√6.

Then, the inner product with |p₀>:

|p₀> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The inner product with |ψ> normalized is (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) -1/(√12) = -2/(√12) = -1/√3. Squared is 1/3. Correct.

After measurement, the state is |p₀>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Then, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is |<e₃|p₀>|² = | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/6.

But let me check if there's another eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0. Wait, when we solved for λ=0, we found that the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiples). Therefore, the projection is unique. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, if the eigenspace were multi-dimensional, we would have to project onto the entire eigenspace, but in this case, it's one-dimensional. So the process is correct.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6. So the answer is 1/6, which is 1/6. So boxed, it's \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

Then, after collapsing into that eigenstate, we measure Q. The probability of getting -1 is the square of the norm of the projection of the collapsed state onto the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.\n\nBut first, let\'s find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo, solving (P - 0*I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix equation is:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0] [v1]   [0]  \n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2] [v2] = [0]  \n[0, 1/√2, 0] [v3]   [0]\n\nWhich gives the equations:\n\n(1/√2)v2 = 0  \n(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  \n(1/√2)v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we get v2 = 0. Then, substituting into the second equation: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 = -v3. Therefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1) (since a can be any scalar, but normalized, we can take a = 1/√2 to make it a unit vector). Wait, but let\'s check.\n\nWait, if the eigenvector is (a, 0, -a), then the norm is sqrt(a² + 0 + a²) = sqrt(2a²) = |a|√2. Therefore, to normalize, set |a|√2 = 1 => |a| = 1/√2. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). But let\'s confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Let\'s check the rank of matrix P.\n\nCompute the rank of P. Let\'s see:\n\nP = [0, 1/√2, 0;  \n     1/√2, 0, 1/√2;  \n     0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nIf we perform row operations:\n\nRow 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  \nRow 1: 0, 1/√2, 0  \nRow 3: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nRows 1 and 3 are identical. So, subtract row 1 from row 3: row3 becomes 0,0,0. Then, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/√2, 0  \nRow2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  \nRow3: 0, 0, 0\n\nThen, swap row1 and row2:\n\nRow1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  \nRow2: 0, 1/√2, 0  \nRow3: 0, 0, 0\n\nSo, two pivots, so rank 2. Therefore, the null space (eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0) has dimension 3 - 2 = 1. So, only one eigenvector. Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1) or normalized as (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nTherefore, the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let\'s confirm this by applying P to it:\n\nP * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0  \nSecond component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0  \nThird component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0  \nSo, yes, it is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nNow, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). To find the probability of measuring P and getting 0, we compute the inner product of |ψ> with |p0>, then take the square of the absolute value.\n\nFirst, compute the inner product:\n\n< p0 | ψ > = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2. Wait, but that can\'t be, since probabilities can\'t exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. The inner product is correct, but the problem is that the eigenvector |p0> is normalized. Let\'s check the norm of |p0>:\n\n| |p0> |² = (1/√2)^2 + 0 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, it\'s normalized. Then, the inner product is -√2, which has a magnitude squared of 2. But the total probability can\'t be 2. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let\'s recalculate the inner product:\n\n|ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, the inner product is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2. So, same result. But the square is 2. But that\'s impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the eigenvector is wrong, or the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let\'s check its norm:\n\n| |ψ> |² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state is not normalized. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Wait, but the problem states "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but perhaps in this problem, they are not. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state. Wait, but the problem says "the state of a system", so perhaps it\'s already normalized. Wait, but (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So, the norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But the problem didn\'t mention normalization. Hmm. This is a critical point. If the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are calculated by the square of the projection divided by the norm squared of the state. However, in quantum mechanics, states are typically given as normalized. But the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, perhaps they are not normalized, and we need to compute probabilities without normalizing? But that would lead to probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the state is normalized. Wait, but 6 is the norm squared, so the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is given as a vector, not necessarily normalized, and we need to normalize it first. But the problem says "the state of a system", which in quantum mechanics is a vector up to a scalar multiple, but when given numerically, it\'s usually assumed to be normalized. However, in this case, the vector is not normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given vector as the state, and compute probabilities without normalizing. But that would lead to probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector.\n\nWait, let\'s check again the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0. Let\'s solve the equation Pv = 0.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n(1/√2)v2 = 0  \n(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  \n(1/√2)v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first and third equations, v2 = 0. Then, the second equation gives v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3. Therefore, the general solution is (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. Then, normalized, it\'s (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the inner product of the initial state (-1, 2, 1) with |p0> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = -√2. The square is 2, but since the state is not normalized, the actual probability is |<p0|ψ>|² / |ψ|² = 2 / 6 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nAh, that\'s the key. The initial state is not normalized, so we need to normalize it when calculating probabilities. Therefore, the probability is |<p0|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ>. The norm squared of |ψ> is 6, so 2 / 6 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after the measurement, the state collapses to |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector e3 = (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the collapsed state in the e3 direction.\n\nSo, the collapsed state is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The amplitude for e3 is the third component, which is -1/√2. Therefore, the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step.\n\nFirst, confirm the initial state normalization. The initial state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But when we compute the inner product with |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), the inner product is:\n\n(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, so the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3. So, that\'s correct. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after the measurement, the state is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, to measure Q, which is diagonal. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3. The probability of getting -1 is the square of the component of |p0> in the e3 direction. The third component of |p0> is -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. Therefore, the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/6.\n\nBut let me check once more to ensure no mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem does not require normalization of the initial state. But in that case, the probability would be |<p0|ψ>|² / |ψ|² * |<e3|p0>|². But since |p0> is already normalized, |<e3|p0>|² is 1/2. Then, |<p0|ψ>|² is | -√2 |² = 2, and |ψ|² is 6, so 2/6 * 1/2 = 2/12 = 1/6. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, if someone incorrectly uses non-normalized states, they might compute 2 * 1/2 = 1, which is wrong.

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for observable \( P \) and then -1 for observable \( Q \), we follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvectors of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

2. **Probability of measuring 0 for \( P \)**:
   - The initial state is \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The inner product of \( \psi \) with the eigenvector \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) is:
     \[
     \left\langle p_0 \mid \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - The norm squared of the initial state \( \psi \) is \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \).
   - The probability is:
     \[
     \frac{\left| \left\langle p_0 \mid \psi \right\rangle \right|^2}{\left\| \psi \right\|^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

3. **Probability of measuring -1 for \( Q \) after collapsing to \( p_0 \)**:
   - The collapsed state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The matrix \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvector for -1 is \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - The inner product of the collapsed state with \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) is \( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - The probability is:
     \[
     \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

4. **Total probability**:
   - The combined probability is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).

Wait, actually, first, the initial state is given. When we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the norm of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenstate(s) of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, after collapsing into that eigenstate, we measure Q. The probability of getting -1 is the square of the norm of the projection of the collapsed state onto the eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.

But first, let's find the eigenstates of P with eigenvalue 0.

So, solving (P - 0*I)v = 0, i.e., Pv = 0.

So, the matrix equation is:

[0, 1/√2, 0] [v1]   [0]  
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2] [v2] = [0]  
[0, 1/√2, 0] [v3]   [0]

Which gives the equations:

(1/√2)v2 = 0  
(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
(1/√2)v2 = 0

From the first and third equations, we get v2 = 0. Then, substituting into the second equation: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 = -v3. Therefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1) (since a can be any scalar, but normalized, we can take a = 1/√2 to make it a unit vector). Wait, but let's check.

Wait, if the eigenvector is (a, 0, -a), then the norm is sqrt(a² + 0 + a²) = sqrt(2a²) = |a|√2. Therefore, to normalize, set |a|√2 = 1 => |a| = 1/√2. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). But let's confirm this.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Let's check the rank of matrix P.

Compute the rank of P. Let's see:

P = [0, 1/√2, 0;  
     1/√2, 0, 1/√2;  
     0, 1/√2, 0]

If we perform row operations:

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Rows 1 and 3 are identical. So, subtract row 1 from row 3: row3 becomes 0,0,0. Then, the matrix becomes:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Row3: 0, 0, 0

Then, swap row1 and row2:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Row3: 0, 0, 0

So, two pivots, so rank 2. Therefore, the null space (eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0) has dimension 3 - 2 = 1. So, only one eigenvector. Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1) or normalized as (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Therefore, the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Let's confirm this by applying P to it:

P * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T:

First component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0  
Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0  
Third component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) = 0  
So, yes, it is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the eigenvector is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). To find the probability of measuring P and getting 0, we compute the inner product of |ψ> with |p0>, then take the square of the absolute value.

First, compute the inner product:

< p0 | ψ > = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2.

Therefore, the amplitude is -√2, so the probability is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2. Wait, but that can't be, since probabilities can't exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. The inner product is correct, but the problem is that the eigenvector |p0> is normalized. Let's check the norm of |p0>:

| |p0> |² = (1/√2)^2 + 0 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, it's normalized. Then, the inner product is -√2, which has a magnitude squared of 2. But the total probability can't be 2. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the inner product:

|ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). |p0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2. So, same result. But the square is 2. But that's impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the eigenvector is wrong, or the initial state is not normalized. Wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's check its norm:

| |ψ> |² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state is not normalized. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Wait, but the problem states "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but perhaps in this problem, they are not. However, when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state. Wait, but the problem says "the state of a system", so perhaps it's already normalized. Wait, but (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So, the norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But the problem didn't mention normalization. Hmm. This is a critical point. If the state is not normalized, then the probabilities are calculated by the square of the projection divided by the norm squared of the state. However, in quantum mechanics, states are typically given as normalized. But the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, perhaps they are not normalized, and we need to compute probabilities without normalizing? But that would lead to probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the state is normalized. Wait, but 6 is the norm squared, so the actual state vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is given as a vector, not necessarily normalized, and we need to normalize it first. But the problem says "the state of a system", which in quantum mechanics is a vector up to a scalar multiple, but when given numerically, it's usually assumed to be normalized. However, in this case, the vector is not normalized. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given vector as the state, and compute probabilities without normalizing. But that would lead to probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector.

Wait, let's check again the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0. Let's solve the equation Pv = 0.

The equations are:

(1/√2)v2 = 0  
(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
(1/√2)v2 = 0

From the first and third equations, v2 = 0. Then, the second equation gives v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3. Therefore, the general solution is (a, 0, -a). So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. Then, normalized, it's (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, that's correct.

Therefore, the inner product of the initial state (-1, 2, 1) with |p0> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = -√2. The square is 2, but since the state is not normalized, the actual probability is |<p0|ψ>|² / |ψ|² = 2 / 6 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Ah, that's the key. The initial state is not normalized, so we need to normalize it when calculating probabilities. Therefore, the probability is |<p0|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of |ψ>. The norm squared of |ψ> is 6, so 2 / 6 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Therefore, the eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector e3 = (0, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the collapsed state in the e3 direction.

So, the collapsed state is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The amplitude for e3 is the third component, which is -1/√2. Therefore, the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But let me verify this step by step.

First, confirm the initial state normalization. The initial state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1). But when we compute the inner product with |p0>, which is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), the inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3.

Therefore, the amplitude is -1/√3, so the probability is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3. So, that's correct. Therefore, the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after the measurement, the state is |p0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Now, to measure Q, which is diagonal. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3. The probability of getting -1 is the square of the component of |p0> in the e3 direction. The third component of |p0> is -1/√2, so the probability is | -1/√2 |² = 1/2. Therefore, the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

But let me check once more to ensure no mistakes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem does not require normalization of the initial state. But in that case, the probability would be |<p0|ψ>|² / |ψ|² * |<e3|p0>|². But since |p0> is already normalized, |<e3|p0>|² is 1/2. Then, |<p0|ψ>|² is | -√2 |² = 2, and |ψ|² is 6, so 2/6 * 1/2 = 2/12 = 1/6. Same result.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly uses non-normalized states, they might compute 2 * 1/2 = 1, which is wrong. But since we have to use normalized states in quantum mechanics, the correct answer is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
