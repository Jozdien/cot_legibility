# Original Question

Imagine an operator $\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) for the given state, we use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

Given the state vector \(|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), which is an eigenstate of \(P_x\) with eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), we need to compute the expectation values \(\langle P_z \rangle\) and \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\).

1. **Expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\):**
   The matrix for \(P_z\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), \(0\), and \(-\hbar\). The expectation value is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (-\hbar)
   \]
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0
   \]

2. **Expectation value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\):**
   The matrix for \(P_z^2\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar^2\), \(0\), and \(\hbar^2\). The expectation value is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar^2 + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar^2
   \]
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
   \]

3. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\):**
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the given state. The uncertainty is defined as the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

First, let me recall the given information. The state vector is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is convenient because the matrix for P_z is diagonal. The matrix for P_z is given as:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ, corresponding to the basis vectors. Since the state is given in this basis, calculating expectation values should be straightforward.

Let me write the state vector as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum over the squared magnitudes of the components multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|² * ħ + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * (-ħ)

Where c1, c2, c3 are the components of the state vector. Let's compute |c1|², |c2|², |c3|².

c1 = -1/2, so |c1|² = (1/2)² = 1/4

c2 = 1/√2, so |c2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2

c3 = -1/2, so |c3|² = 1/4

Therefore,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0

Hmm, that's interesting. The expectation value of P_z is zero. Now, let's compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will also be diagonal, with the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So:

P_z² matrix would be:

First row: (ħ², 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, ħ²)

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So when we square them, we get (ħ)², 0, (-ħ)², which are all ħ², 0, ħ². So the diagonal entries of P_z² are ħ², 0, ħ². Therefore, the matrix for P_z² is:

[ ħ²  0   0  ]
[ 0   0   0  ]
[ 0   0   ħ² ]

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ is |c1|² * ħ² + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * ħ²

Which is (1/4)ħ² + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, the uncertainty squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, ΔP_z = √(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/√2

But let me double-check all steps to make sure.

First, the state vector components: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Their squared magnitudes are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4. Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, which is good, normalized.

Then, ⟨P_z⟩: 1/4 * ħ + 1/4 * (-ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩: 1/4 * ħ² + 1/4 * ħ² = 1/2 ħ². Correct.

Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). So, the answer should be ħ divided by square root of 2. But let me check if there's any possible mistake here.

Wait, the matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So when we square it, each diagonal entry is squared. So yes, the first entry becomes ħ², the second 0, the third (-ħ)^2 = ħ². So the P_z squared matrix is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ². Therefore, the expectation value is sum of |c_i|^2 times the diagonal entries. So 1/4 * ħ² + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * ħ² = 1/2 ħ². Correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/sqrt(2). So, the answer is ħ divided by sqrt(2). 

But let me check if the state is indeed given correctly. The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The given state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me verify if this is indeed an eigenstate of the given P_x matrix with eigenvalue -ħ.

The P_x matrix is:

First row: (0, ħ/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (ħ/sqrt(2), 0, ħ/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, ħ/sqrt(2), 0)

So, let's apply this matrix to the given vector and see if we get -ħ times the vector.

Let me compute P_x multiplied by the vector:

First component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) = ħ/2

Second component: (ħ/sqrt(2))*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (ħ/sqrt(2))*(-1/2) = (-ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) + (-ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) = -ħ/(sqrt(2))

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So, the result is [ ħ/2, -ħ/sqrt(2), ħ/2 ]^T

Now, if the eigenvalue is -ħ, then multiplying the original vector by -ħ should give:

-ħ * [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T = [ ħ/2, -ħ/sqrt(2), ħ/2 ]^T

Which matches exactly the result of P_x acting on the vector. Therefore, the given state is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is correctly given.

Therefore, my calculation for ΔP_z is correct. The uncertainty is ħ divided by sqrt(2). So, the answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

I need to determine the uncertainty ΔP_z for the specified state. The uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²), which involves finding the square root of the difference between the expectation value of P_z squared and the square of the expectation value of P_z.

Let me review the provided information. The state vector is represented as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is advantageous since the P_z matrix is diagonal. The matrix for P_z is structured as follows:

The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ, which correspond to the basis vectors. Since the state is expressed in this basis, calculating the expectation values will be relatively straightforward.

I can represent the state vector in column form as:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

To calculate ⟨P_z⟩, I can leverage the diagonal nature of P_z. The expectation value is simply the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components multiplied by their respective eigenvalues:

⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|² * ħ + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * (-ħ)

Where c1, c2, and c3 represent the components of the state vector. Now I need to compute this value.

Here, c1, c2, and c3 are components of the state vector. Let's perform this computation.

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) for the given state, we need to compute the expectation values \(\langle P_z \rangle\) and \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\) and then use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

The matrix form of \(P_z\) is:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we calculate \(\langle P_z \rangle\):

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 (-\hbar)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0
\]

Next, we calculate \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\). The matrix form of \(P_z^2\) is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar^2
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
\]

Finally, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

ate |c1|², |c2|², |c3|².

c1 = -1/2, so |c1|² = (1/2)² = 1/4

c2 = 1/√2, so |c2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2

c3 = -1/2, so |c3|² = 1/4

Therefore:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0

Okay, so the expectation value of P_z is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ, then P_z² will be the square of those entries. So, P_z² is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²). Let me confirm:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0) squared is (ħ², 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0) squared is (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ) squared is (0, 0, ħ²)

So, P_z² matrix is:

[ ħ²  0    0   ]
[ 0   0    0   ]
[ 0   0   ħ²  ]

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is |c1|² * ħ² + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * ħ²

Which is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2)ħ²

So, the uncertainty squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is √(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/√2

But let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me verify the components again. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The modulus squared of each component:

First component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2

Third component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So, total probability is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, which is good. So the state is normalized.

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ is indeed 1/4 * ħ + 1/4 * (-ħ) = 0. That's correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, since the first and third components have ħ² and 0 in the middle, so 1/4 * ħ² + 1/4 * ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So that's correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2). Alternatively, sqrt(1/2) is the same as 1/sqrt(2), so yes.

But let me just make sure that when we square the operator P_z, we are indeed just squaring the diagonal entries. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal entry squared. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I were to compute ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩, since P_z² is diagonal, it's the same as summing |c_i|² times the diagonal entries. So that's exactly what I did.

Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ divided by sqrt(2). So, ΔP_z = ħ / √2.

But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, maybe the state is not given in the correct basis? Wait, the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is exactly the basis in which P_z is diagonal. So the components of the state are in the P_z eigenbasis, so my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which has eigenvalue -ħ. The given state is the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But when calculating the uncertainty in P_z, it doesn't matter; we just need to compute the expectation values in the given state. So even though the state is an eigenstate of P_x, when expressed in the P_z basis, we can still compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared as I did.

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. The uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

To determine the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the given state, we use the formula \(\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}\).

The state vector is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

The matrix form of \(P_z\) is:
\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\):
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 (-\hbar)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0
\]

Next, we calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\). The matrix form of \(P_z^2\) is:
\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \hbar^2
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
\]

The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is then:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

Let's compute each term:

|c1|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4
|c2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2
|c3|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4

Therefore:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0

So the expectation value of P_z is zero. That simplifies the uncertainty formula, as the second term ⟨P_z⟩² will be zero. Therefore, ΔP_z = √⟨P_z²⟩.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will also be diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the corresponding eigenvalue. The matrix for P_z² is:

First row: (ħ², 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, ħ²)

Calculating ⟨P_z²⟩ follows the same method as ⟨P_z⟩, using the squared eigenvalues:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |c1|² * ħ² + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * ħ²

Plugging in the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of ⟨P_z²⟩, which is √(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/√2.

But let me verify this step again. The square root of (1/2 ħ²) is indeed ħ * √(1/2) = ħ / √2. However, sometimes factors can be tricky here. Let me confirm the calculation once more.

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So √(1/2 ħ²) = ħ * √(1/2) = ħ / √2. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the uncertainty in P_z is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

But wait, let me check if there's any possible mistake in the state vector. The state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's confirm that this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the components should be 1.

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, the state is normalized. That's good.

Therefore, the calculations for |c1|², |c2|², and |c3|² are correct. The expectation values are accurate. So the uncertainty is indeed ħ / √2.

But let me think again. The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The given state is the explicit form. Since the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, the state is expressed in the P_z basis. The uncertainty in P_z is calculated as we did. So the answer should be ħ divided by √2. Therefore, ΔP_z = ħ/√2.

Alternatively, written as (ℏ)/√2. Since the problem uses ℏ, the answer is ℏ/√2. So the uncertainty is ℏ over square root of 2.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

To determine the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the given state, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

**Step 1: Compute \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**

The state vector in the eigenbasis of \(P_z\) is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since \(P_z\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), \(0\), and \(-\hbar\), the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\) is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0
\]

**Step 2: Compute \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**

The operator \(P_z^2\) has eigenvalues \(\hbar^2\), \(0\), and \(\hbar^2\):
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar^2 + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2
\]

**Step 3: Calculate \(\Delta P_z\)**

Substitute into the uncertainty formula:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}
\]

The components are:

c1 = -1/2  
c2 = 1/√2  
c3 = -1/2

Calculating the squared magnitudes:

|c1|² = (1/2)² = 1/4  
|c2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2  
|c3|² = (1/2)² = 1/4

Therefore:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0

Next, we need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will also be diagonal, with each entry being the square of the corresponding eigenvalue. The matrix for P_z² is:

First row: (ħ², 0, 0)  
Second row: (0, 0, 0)  
Third row: (0, 0, ħ²)

Thus, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |c1|² * ħ² + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * ħ²

Plugging in the values:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ²

Now, substituting into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = √( (1/2)ħ² - 0 ) = √(1/2)ħ = (ħ)/√2

Simplifying √(1/2) gives 1/√2, so the uncertainty is ħ divided by √2. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ/√2.
