The given IR and NMR data indicate that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branched alkyl group. The IR spectrum shows a broad O-H stretch (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) and a carbonyl peak (1720 cm⁻¹), characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic C=C stretches (1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹) and the NMR signals (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm doublets) confirm a para-substituted benzene ring. The NMR also reveals a branched alkyl chain: a methine proton (2.9 ppm), a methyl group adjacent to the methine (1.4 ppm, d), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, m), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t). This corresponds to a **1-methylbutyl** group (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached para to the carboxylic acid.

When treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction replaces the -COOH with -CH₃ while retaining the para-substituted alkyl chain. 

**Final Product:**  
**4-(1-Methylbutyl)toluene** (or 4-(2-pentyl)toluene).  

**Structure:**  
A toluene derivative with a methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and a 1-methylbutyl group (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃) in the para positions.  

**Answer:**  
\boxed{4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by analyzing the given IR and NMR data to identify Compound X first. 

Starting with the IR data: The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ usually indicates an O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid because they typically show a broad absorption in that range. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have carbonyl groups, so that fits. The 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks might be from aromatic C=C stretching vibrations. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with some substituents. 

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: The singlet at 10.5 ppm (which is a broad singlet, bs) is likely the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm each integrating to 2H suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between the two doublets (each with 2H) would be typical for a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid. 

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break this down. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH₂, as in a propyl chain (like -CH₂CH₂CH₃). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the middle CH₂ in a propyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group adjacent to a chiral center, maybe a CH(CH₃) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a methine (CH) proton next to some substituents. 

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branching in the substituent. Let me sketch this. The aromatic ring has a substituent in the para position. The substituent could be a -CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃)CH₃ group? Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a terminal methyl (like in propyl), and a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a methyl adjacent to a CH. So maybe the substituent is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃. Wait, but how does that fit with the integration? Let's see:

The 1H NMR has 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which is the CH. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH₂ next to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal CH₃. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl attached to the CH. So the substituent is a sec-pentyl group? Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃ group. Let me count the carbons: the substituent would be a pentyl group but branched. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃) group. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d), which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So the methyl (1.4 ppm, d) is attached to a CH, which is next to another CH₂. Let me think. If the substituent is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂CH3, then the CH(CH3) would have a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm, and the adjacent CH2 would be split into a multiplet. Then the next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t). Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, maybe overlapping with the middle CH2. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But then the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the terminal CH3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me draw the structure:

The aromatic ring (para-substituted) with a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and the 10.5 ppm peak). The other substituent is a branched alkyl chain. Let's see:

The substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH(CH3) would have a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be split into a multiplet (maybe 1.7 ppm, m, 2H), and the next CH2 would be at around 1.3-1.5 ppm, but maybe overlapping. The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3) with the CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but then the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the terminal CH3. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane? No, the NMR doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branching. Let me consider the NMR shifts again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a methine proton. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that, and then the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the methine. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure would be para-methyl(sec-pentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, but the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. So the structure is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid? Let me check the NMR again.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are downfield shifted due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The substituent in the para position would be an alkyl group. The coupling between the aromatic protons as doublets suggests that they are para to each other, so the substituents are in the para positions. So the carboxylic acid is at one para position, and the branched alkyl group is at the other.

Now, when Compound X (which is a benzoic acid derivative) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carboxylic acids. Typically, HI in the presence of red phosphorus (or sometimes just HI) can reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. Wait, but I need to recall the reaction conditions. The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus is known as the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for introducing halogens. Wait, maybe it's the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol? Or perhaps to an alkane. Wait, I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a series of reactions. The general pathway is: carboxylic acid → acid iodide → iodide via reduction. Wait, maybe the reaction is similar to the Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, the HI and red phosphorus might first convert the carboxylic acid to an acid iodide, then further reduce it. Let me think. 

Carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with HI to form RCOOI, which is an acyl iodide. Then, under the reaction conditions (maybe heating with excess HI and red P), the acyl iodide can be reduced. The reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alkane typically involves converting the COOH group to CH3. For example, via the Curtius reaction or other methods. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the reduction of a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol using LiAlH4, but HI and red P are different. 

Wait, another approach: HI is a strong acid and a source of iodide ions. Red phosphorus is often used as a catalyst or to prevent the formation of I2. When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red P, the reaction might proceed by converting the -COOH group to -CH2I, and then further to -CH3. Let me check. For example, the Arndt-Eistert reaction is for homologation, but that's different. Alternatively, the HVZ reaction adds bromine to the alpha position, but that's with Br2 and P. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction here is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. The process would involve converting RCOOH to RCH2I and then to RCH3. Let me think step by step. First, the carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with HI to form the acyl iodide (RCOOI). Then, under the reaction conditions, the acyl iodide could undergo reduction. The HI is a strong reducing agent. The mechanism might involve converting RCOOI to RCH2I via some steps, and then RCH2I could be reduced further to RCH3. Alternatively, maybe the acyl iodide is reduced to RCH2OH, but that's a primary alcohol, but with HI, perhaps it's further converted. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the formation of an alkyl iodide from a carboxylic acid. For example, in the presence of HI and red P, the carboxylic acid could be converted to the alkyl iodide. But how? Let me recall: The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus typically leads to the replacement of the hydroxyl group with iodide. Wait, but carboxylic acids are not alcohols; their -OH is part of the carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction is more involved. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. But decarboxylation usually requires other conditions. Wait, another thought: The HI and red P might first convert the carboxylic acid to an acid iodide (RCOOI), then the acid iodide could undergo elimination to form an alkyl iodide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group. For example, converting RCOOH to RCH2I via two steps: first to RCOOI, then reduction. 

Wait, I think I need to look up the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus. From what I remember, when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI (excess) and red phosphorus, it undergoes a series of reactions where the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acyl iodide, then reduced stepwise. The overall reaction replaces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) with a methyl group (-CH3). So RCOOH becomes RCH3. For example, benzoic acid would become toluene. But in this case, the starting material is a substituted benzoic acid, so the product would be a substituted toluene. 

So if Compound X is 4-(some alkyl)benzoic acid, then the product would be 4-(same alkyl)toluene. Let me confirm. For example, if the original compound is 4-pentylbenzoic acid, then the product would be 4-pentyltoluene. But wait, the alkyl group in the original compound is branched. Let me go back to the NMR to figure out the exact structure of the substituent.

The substituent on the benzene ring (para to the COOH) has the following NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a methine proton (CH) attached to two different groups. The multiplicity is a multiplet, suggesting several neighboring protons.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to the CH (since it's a doublet, coupling with the one proton on the CH).

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group (triplet) from a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but let's count the carbons. The substituent is a pentyl group but branched. The CH(CH3) is the second carbon, then a CH2, then another CH2, then a CH3. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet is from a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the substituent is 1-methylbutyl? Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If it's 1-methylbutyl, that would be a five-carbon chain? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch. Let's name it properly. If the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, that's a 2-pentyl group (since the methyl is on the second carbon of a pentyl chain). Wait, but the IUPAC name would be 3-pentyl? No, wait. Let's number from the benzene ring. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring via the first carbon. The first carbon is the CH(CH3), then the second is CH2, third is CH2, fourth is CH3. So the full substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would be a 1-methylpentyl group? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons: the substituent is:

Benzylic carbon (attached to benzene) is the first carbon, which is CH(CH3). Then the second carbon is CH2, third is CH2, fourth is CH3. Wait, that's four carbons in total. So the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So it's a 1-methylpropyl group? Wait, that would be isobutyl. But isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it:

The substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3

So the chain is Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. That's a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon (the one attached to the benzene). The IUPAC name would be 4-(2-pentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, no. Let me think. The longest chain from the benzene ring is four carbons: the first carbon (attached to benzene) is CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH2, then CH3. So the substituent is a 1-methylbutyl group. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the first carbon is CH(CH3), then the substituent is a pentyl group? No, because the total number of carbons in the substituent is four: CH(CH3) (1), CH2 (2), CH2 (3), CH3 (4). So it's a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-methylpropyl, but that's isobutyl. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3

Wait, that's five carbons in total? No, the benzene is attached to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2, then another CH2, then a CH3. So that's four carbons in the substituent. So the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name would be iso-pentyl? No, iso-pentyl is 3-methylbutyl. Wait, maybe it's a sec-pentyl group. I'm getting confused with the nomenclature here. Let's not get stuck on the name, but focus on the structure. The substituent is a branched four-carbon chain attached to the benzene ring. The branching is a methyl group on the first carbon (the one attached to the ring). So the structure is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3

Wait, but that's five carbons. Wait, no. The substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. Wait, that's five carbons: the benzene is attached to carbon 1 (CH(CH3)), then carbon 2 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH2), carbon 4 (CH3). So it's a pentyl group with a methyl branch on carbon 1. The correct IUPAC name would be 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's 4-(2-pentyl)benzoic acid. I think the exact name might not be necessary for determining the product. The key point is that the substituent is a branched alkyl group attached para to the carboxylic acid.

Now, when this compound reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). So the product would be the corresponding toluene derivative, where the -COOH is replaced by -CH3, and the other substituent remains. So the product would be 4-(branched alkyl)toluene. 

So the original compound is 4-(branched alkyl)benzoic acid, and the product is 4-(branched alkyl)toluene. The alkyl substituent remains unchanged. Therefore, the final product after reduction would have a methyl group where the carboxylic acid was, and the same branched alkyl group in the para position. 

To confirm, let's check the reaction again. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red P typically reduces the -COOH group to -CH3. For example, benzoic acid would become toluene. So in this case, the product is the toluene analog with the same substituent. Therefore, the final product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene, or more accurately, 4-(2-pentyl)toluene, depending on the correct substituent structure. But since the exact name might be tricky, the key is that the substituent remains, and the COOH becomes CH3. 

So the NMR of the product would have the aromatic protons similar to the starting material but without the deshielding effect of the carboxylic acid. However, the problem doesn't ask for the NMR of the product, just to identify it. 

Therefore, the final product is 4-(branched alkyl)toluene. To write the structure, the benzene ring has a methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and a branched pentyl group (as determined from the NMR) in the para positions. The exact structure of the branched alkyl group is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So the product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. Alternatively, named as 4-(2-pentyl)toluene. But the IUPAC name would require proper numbering. 

Alternatively, considering the substituent as a 3-pentyl group (if the branching is on the second carbon of the pentyl chain), but I think the key is to recognize the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group and retain the alkyl substituent. Therefore, the final product is para-methyl-substituted toluene with the branched alkyl group. 

So the answer should be the toluene derivative with the same substituent as the original benzoic acid but with the COOH replaced by CH3. Therefore, the product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. However, to confirm, let's check the substituent again. The substituent in the original compound is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So when the COOH becomes CH3, the product is toluene with a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group in the para position. The IUPAC name would be 1-methyl-4-(2-pentyl)benzene, but more accurately, 4-(2-pentyl)toluene. However, the common name might be more straightforward, like p-(2-pentyl)toluene. But since the problem might expect the structure, perhaps drawing it as toluene with a branched pentyl group in the para position. 

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me think again. The NMR data for the substituent: the CH(CH3) is at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 is at 1.7 ppm, then another CH2, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the first carbon. Wait, that's actually a pentyl group. Wait, no. The substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3

That's five carbons in total: the benzene is attached to the first carbon (CH(CH3)), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So it's a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name would be 4-(2-pentyl)benzoic acid, and the product would be 4-(2-pentyl)toluene. 

But to avoid confusion, perhaps the answer is simply the toluene derivative with the same substituent. Therefore, the final product is 4-(sec-pentyl)toluene. However, the exact nomenclature might vary, but the structure is clear: the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group, and the substituent remains. 

So, putting it all together, the final product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene or 4-(2-pentyl)toluene. Alternatively, using common naming, it might be called p-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. But the key is the structure. 

To confirm, let's check the reaction once more. Carboxylic acid (RCOOH) with HI and red P → RCH3. So the product is R = aryl with substituent. Therefore, the answer is the toluene analog with the substituent as determined. The substituent's structure is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 attached para to the methyl group. Therefore, the final product is 4-(2-pentyl)toluene.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by analyzing the given IR and NMR data to identify Compound X first. 

Starting with the IR data: The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ usually indicates an O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid because they typically show a broad absorption in that range. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have carbonyl groups, so that fits. The 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks might be from aromatic C=C stretching vibrations. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with some substituents. 

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: The singlet at 10.5 ppm (which is a broad singlet, bs) is likely the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm each integrating to 2H suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between the two doublets (each with 2H) would be typical for a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid. 

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break this down. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH₂, as in a propyl chain (like -CH₂CH₂CH₃). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the middle CH₂ in a propyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group adjacent to a chiral center, maybe a CH(CH₃) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a methine (CH) proton next to some substituents. 

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branching in the substituent. Let me sketch this. The aromatic ring has a substituent in the para position. The substituent could be a -CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃)CH₃ group? Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a terminal methyl (like in propyl), and a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a methyl adjacent to a CH. So maybe the substituent is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃. Wait, but how does that fit with the integration? Let's see:

The 1H NMR has 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which is the CH. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH₂ next to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal CH₃. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl attached to the CH. So the substituent is a sec-pentyl group? Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃ group. Let me count the carbons: the substituent would be a pentyl group but branched. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃) group. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d), which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So the methyl (1.4 ppm, d) is attached to a CH, which is next to another CH₂. Let me think. If the substituent is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂CH3, then the CH(CH3) would have a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm, and the adjacent CH2 would be split into a multiplet. Then the next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t). Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, maybe overlapping with the middle CH2. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But then the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the terminal CH3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me draw the structure:

The aromatic ring (para-substituted) with a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and the 10.5 ppm peak). The other substituent is a branched alkyl chain. Let's see:

The substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH(CH3) would have a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be split into a multiplet (maybe 1.7 ppm, m, 2H), and the next CH2 would be at around 1.3-1.5 ppm, but maybe overlapping. The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3) with the CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but then the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the terminal CH3. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane? No, the NMR doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branching. Let me consider the NMR shifts again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a methine proton. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that, and then the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the methine. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure would be para-methyl(sec-pentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, but the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. So the structure is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid? Let me check the NMR again.

The aromatic protons are at 8

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'll first identify Compound X by analyzing the provided IR and NMR spectroscopic data.

Looking at the IR spectrum: There's a broad absorption from 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which typically indicates an O-H stretching vibration, characteristic of carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which aligns with a carboxylic acid functionality. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ likely represent aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, suggesting a benzene ring in the structure.

Examining the ¹H NMR data: The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, strongly indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, as this pattern is typical for such systems. 

For the remaining signals: The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) likely represents a methine (CH) proton adjacent to various substituents. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group (CH₂). The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a chiral carbon, creating a CH(CH₃) arrangement. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is characteristic of a terminal methyl group in a chain, as in a -CH₂CH₂CH₃ group.

When I integrate this information, it appears Compound X may be a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branched alkyl substituent. The NMR data points toward a sec-pentyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃. The methine at 2.9 ppm connects to the methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H) and the methylene group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which connects to another methylene group, terminating in the methyl group (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

Therefore, Compound X is likely 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, where the aromatic ring has a carboxylic acid group at one end and a sec-pentyl group at the para position.

I need to determine the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'll begin by examining the provided IR and NMR data to identify Compound X. 

Analyzing the IR data: The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H stretch, likely indicative of a carboxylic acid due to their typical broad absorption in this range. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is consistent with carboxylic acids since they contain carbonyl groups. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ might represent aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, indicating a benzene ring with substituents could be present.

Turning to the 1H NMR data: The singlet at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, bs) probably represents the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm each integrating to 2H suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling of these doublets is typical for a para-substituted benzene, leading to a possible para-substituted benzoic acid structure.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These break down as follows: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group at the end of a propyl chain (such as -CH₂CH₂CH₃). The signal at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could represent the middle CH₂ in this chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a chiral center, possibly a CH(CH₃) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a methine (CH) proton near other substituents.

Considering this, the structure might be a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branching substituent. The aromatic ring has a para-position substituent. This substituent could be a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃ group. This matches with the NMR, where 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl attached to a CH, and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH₂ next to the CH. The substituent could be a sec-pentyl group, specifically a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃ structure. This structure fits with the NMR integration and the chemical shifts.

So, it seems that the structure is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, where the methylbutyl group is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

The IR spectrum shows a broad O-H stretch (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) and a carbonyl peak (1720 cm⁻¹), consistent with a carboxylic acid. The aromatic C=C stretches (1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹) and the NMR signals (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm doublets) confirm a para-substituted benzene ring.

Thus, Compound X is **4-(pentan-2-yl)benzoic acid**.\n\nWhen treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) undergoes reduction.

The downfield shift of the protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid (8.0 ppm) and the other at 7.2 ppm. The substituent is in the para position. The substituent is a branched alkyl chain. Let me try to draw the structure:\n\nBenzoic acid with a substituent at the para position. The substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent is a 1-methylbutyl group. Wait, but the nomenclature would be 4-(2-pentyl)benzoic acid? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's 4-(3-pentyl)benzoic acid. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group. Wait, that would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, which is a 3-pentyl group. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe substituent has a methine (CH) at 2.9 ppm, which is split into a multiplet. The adjacent protons are a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm and a CH2 group (m, 2H) at 1.7 ppm. Then another CH2 and a terminal CH3 (t, 3H) at 0.9 ppm. So the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. That would be a 2-pentyl group (pentan-2-yl). So the structure is 4-(pentan-2-yl)benzoic acid. Let me check the splitting. The CH(CH3) would have a doublet for the methyl (1.4 ppm, d) because it's adjacent to the CH. The CH is next to a CH2, which would split into a multiplet. The next CH2 (1.7 ppm) is adjacent to another CH2, which would be a quartet, but maybe appears as a multiplet due to coupling with the next group. The terminal CH3 is a triplet because it's next to a CH2. That seems to fit. \n\nSo Compound X is 4-(pentan-2-yl)benzoic acid. Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carboxylic acids. Typically, HI in the presence of red phosphorus (a catalyst) will reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? Wait, no. Wait, HI is a strong acid and a reducing agent. When a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes reduction. The general reaction is RCOOH + HI (excess) → RCH2I + H2O, but I might be mixing up reactions. Alternatively, the reaction could be the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an alkyl iodide. Wait, but maybe it's a more extensive reduction. Let me recall: The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for alpha-bromination of carboxylic acids. For reduction of carboxylic acids, using HI and red phosphorus would likely reduce the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the reaction could be similar to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But here, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Another possibility is that the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acid iodide, then reduced. Wait, HI can convert carboxylic acids to acid iodides (RCOI), but in the presence of red phosphorus, which is a catalyst for such conversions. Then, perhaps the acid iodide is reduced. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the conversion of RCOOH to RCH2I via a series of steps. Let me check.\n\nAnother approach: When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a series of reactions. First, the carboxylic acid (RCOOH) is converted to the acid iodide (RCOI) by HI. Then, the acid iodide can undergo reduction. The typical reaction for reducing a carboxylic acid to an alkane is the use of HI and red phosphorus, which converts RCOOH to RCH2CH2... (Wait, maybe I'm confusing with the reduction of esters or nitriles). Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the reduction of a ketone. Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another possibility: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus would first convert the -COOH group into -CH2I. For example, benzoic acid would be reduced to toluene. But how? Let me check a reference. \n\nUpon checking, the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus (or sometimes H2O) under high temperature and pressure can reduce the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group. The reaction is RCOOH + HI → RCH2I + H2O, and then RCH2I can be hydrolyzed to RCH3. Wait, but in the presence of excess HI and red P, maybe the iodide is not hydrolyzed but remains as RCH2I. However, in some cases, the reaction might go all the way to the alkane. Alternatively, maybe the reaction stops at the alkyl iodide. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction could proceed via the following steps: RCOOH → RCOCl (using PCl5) → RCH2I (using HI and red P). But in this case, the question states that the reagent is HI and red P. So perhaps the carboxylic acid is first converted to the acid iodide (RCOI), which then undergoes reduction. The reduction of RCOI with excess HI and red P would add H2 across the carbonyl, converting the carbonyl group into a methylene group (-CH2-). Wait, but how? Let me think. The acid iodide (RCOI) could be reduced to RCH2I. Then, RCH2I could be further reduced to RCH3. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction stops at RCH2I. \n\nBut in the case of benzoic acid, if you reduce the -COOH group to -CH2I, then you would get benzyl iodide (PhCH2I). But if you have a substituent on the benzene ring, like in our case, the substituent would remain. So the product would be the benzene ring with the substituent (the pentan-2-yl group) and a methyl group where the carboxylic acid was. Wait, but the original substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the substituent is at position 4. If the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group, then the product would be 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. Wait, toluene is methylbenzene. So replacing the -COOH with -CH3 would give a methyl group in the position where the carboxylic acid was. Therefore, the product would be 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene. \n\nBut let me confirm the regiochemistry. The original compound is 4-(pentan-2-yl)benzoic acid. When the -COOH is reduced to -CH3, the product is 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. So the structure would be toluene with a pentan-2-yl group in the para position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reduction converts the -COOH to -CH2CH3? Wait, no. The typical reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alkane would replace the -COOH with -CH3. For example, propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH) would become pentane (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the reduction removes the carbonyl group. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus is a method to reduce the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group. The mechanism involves converting the carboxylic acid to an iodide intermediate, which is then reduced. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. So in the case of benzoic acid (C6H5COOH), the product would be C6H5CH2I, and then further reduction would give C6H5CH3 (toluene). But if the reaction stops at the iodide, it's benzyl iodide, but with excess HI and red P, it might go all the way to toluene. \n\nIn our case, the starting material is 4-(pentan-2-yl)benzoic acid. Reducing the -COOH to -CH3 would give 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. So the product would be a toluene derivative with a pentan-2-yl group in the para position relative to the methyl group. \n\nBut let me check the NMR of the product. If the product is 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene, the NMR would show aromatic protons, the pentan-2-yl group, and the methyl group from the original carboxylic acid. Wait, but the original methyl from the pentan-2-yl is still present. Let me see: The original substituent is pentan-2-yl (CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3). The reduction converts the -COOH to -CH3. So the product would have a methyl group (from the original -COOH) and the pentan-2-yl group in the para position. \n\nThe aromatic protons would now be two doublets, but since the substituents are a methyl and a pentan-2-yl group in para positions, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets again. The methyl group (from the original -COOH) would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm. The pentan-2-yl group would have the same NMR signals as before except for the absence of the carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but the question is about the final product. So the product would be 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction reduces the carbonyl group to a methylene group (-CH2-), but that would require different reagents. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with other reductions. Let me confirm. \n\nAnother thought: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus is a method to replace the -COOH group with a -CH2CH3 group. For example, benzoic acid would become ethylbenzene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a single reduction step. \n\nWait, I need to recall: The treatment of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus typically results in the reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. The reaction proceeds through the formation of an acid iodide, which is then reduced. The overall reaction is RCOOH + 6 HI → RCH2CH3 + 2 H2O + 3 I2. Wait, but that would add two carbons? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's RCOOH → RCH3. For example, if R is phenyl, then benzoic acid would become toluene. That would involve removing one oxygen and adding two hydrogens. The reaction would be: RCOOH + 6 HI → RCH3 + 2 H2O + 3 I2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction could be: RCOOH + HI → RCH2I + H2O (but this would require more HI and steps). Then RCH2I could be reduced further to RCH3. But in any case, the key point is that the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). \n\nTherefore, the final product would be the aromatic ring with a methyl group (from the original -COOH) and the pentan-2-yl group in the para position. So the structure is 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. \n\nBut let me check if there's another possibility. Could the reaction affect the substituent? For example, the pentan-2-yl group might undergo some reaction with HI and red phosphorus. But typically, those conditions are for reducing carboxylic acids or other functional groups, not for cleaving alkyl chains. Unless there's an ester or something else, but in this case, the substituent is an alkyl group. So I think the substituent remains unchanged. \n\nTherefore, the final product is 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. The name would be 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene. Alternatively, using IUPAC nomenclature, the longest chain in the substituent is pentane, so the substituent is pentan-2-yl. The parent is toluene (methylbenzene), so the substituent is at the para position. The correct IUPAC name would be 4-(2-pentyl)toluene or p-(2-pentyl)toluene. However, toluene is a common name, so the systematic name would be 1-methyl-4-(2-pentyl)benzene. \n\nAlternatively, numbering the benzene ring with the methyl group as position 1 and the pentan-2-yl group as position 4. So the structure is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final product after the reaction is 4-(2-pentyl)toluene.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447905, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3198, prompt_tokens=1583, total_tokens=4781, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

.0 and 7.2 ppm, which is typical for a para-substituted benzoic acid. The downfield shift of the protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid (8.0 ppm) and the other at 7.2 ppm. The substituent is in the para position. The substituent is a branched alkyl chain. Let me try to draw the structure:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position. The substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent is a 1-methylbutyl group. Wait, but the nomenclature would be 4-(2-pentyl)benzoic acid? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's 4-(3-pentyl)benzoic acid. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group. Wait, that would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, which is a 3-pentyl group. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think step by step.

The substituent has a methine (CH) at 2.9 ppm, which is split into a multiplet. The adjacent protons are a methyl (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm and a CH2 group (m, 2H) at 1.7 ppm. Then another CH2 and a terminal CH3 (t, 3H) at 0.9 ppm. So the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. That would be a 2-pentyl group (pentan-2-yl).

Alternatively, maybe the reduction converts the -COOH to -CH2CH3? Wait, no. The typical reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alkane would replace the -COOH with -CH3. For example, propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH) would become pentane (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the reduction removes the carbonyl group. Let me think again.

Therefore, the final product after the reaction is 4-(2-pentyl)toluene.

Red phosphorus and HI are commonly used in the reduction of carboxylic acids. The reaction typically converts carboxylic acids to alkanes via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but with HI and red phosphorus, the pathway might involve initial conversion to an acid iodide, followed by reduction. However, another possibility is that the carboxylic acid is reduced to the corresponding alcohol. Wait, but HI is a strong acid and a reducing agent in such conditions. Alternatively, the reaction might be the cleavage of ethers, but since the compound is a carboxylic acid, that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, another approach: The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus typically leads to the replacement of the hydroxyl group with iodine. However, under certain conditions, especially with excess HI and heat, the carboxylic acid can be reduced. For example, the Arndt-Eistert reaction isn't exactly this. Alternatively, maybe the Clemmensen reduction? But Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, the HI and red P might be used for deoxygenation. Let me recall: HI and red phosphorus can reduce ketones to alkanes, but for carboxylic acids, perhaps the reaction is more about converting the -COOH group into -CH2I, but that seems unlikely. Wait, another thought: The carboxylic acid could first be converted to an acid iodide (RCOI), then further reduced. For example, RCOO⁻ + HI → RCOI + H2O. Then, with excess HI and red P, which is a source of HI and acts as a catalyst, the RCOI could undergo reduction. The reduction of acid iodides typically gives aldehydes (RCOI → RCHO), but under more vigorous conditions, maybe further reduction to RCH2I. Alternatively, perhaps the entire COOH group is replaced by a hydrogen, leading to an alkane. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. But I need to verify the exact reaction conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus might proceed through the formation of an acyl iodide intermediate, which then undergoes reduction. The HI is a strong reducing agent. For example, in the case of converting RCOOH to RCH2I, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction uses red phosphorus and bromine to brominate carboxylic acids at the alpha position, but here we have HI. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the substitution of hydroxyl groups in alcohols. But carboxylic acids are more resistant to such substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit here.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an alkyl iodide. For example, if the carboxylic acid is first converted to the acid chloride (using something like PCl5), then treated with HI. But in this case, the reagents are red P and HI. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. For example, RCOOH → RCH3. How would that happen? One possible pathway is via the formation of the acid iodide, then reduction. For example, RCOOH + HI → RCOOIH (maybe not), but perhaps under these conditions, the carboxylic acid is reduced. Let me check a reference in my mind: The Rosenmund reduction reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes, but that's with H2 and a poisoned catalyst. Another method is the use of LiAlH4 to reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, but HI and red P are different.\n\nWait, another thought: The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. The Wolff-Kishner reduces carbonyl groups to methylene groups under basic conditions. But for carboxylic acids, perhaps a similar approach is used. However, the reagents here are HI and red P. Let me think again. HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Red phosphorus is often used to generate HI in situ and prevent the reverse reaction. For example, in the conversion of alcohols to alkyl iodides, red P and I2 are used. But here, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Maybe the reaction is similar to the substitution of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid with iodide. However, the -OH in carboxylic acids is not a good leaving group. To substitute it, the -OH would need to be converted to a better leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate. But in the presence of HI and red P, perhaps the H+ from HI protonates the carboxylic acid, making the -OH a better leaving group. Then, the iodide ion could attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to substitution. But that would form an acyl iodide (RCOI). However, acyl iodides are reactive and might undergo further reactions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction proceeds through a different mechanism. For example, the HI could reduce the carboxylic acid. Let me recall: HI is a strong reducing agent. In some cases, carboxylic acids can be reduced to alcohols, but more commonly, they are reduced to aldehydes or ketones. Wait, but under certain conditions, like with excess HI and heat, maybe the carboxylic acid is reduced all the way to a hydrocarbon. For example, RCOOH + HI → RCH2I + H2O (but how?), then RCH2I + HI → RCH3 + I2. But this would require multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. For example, RCOOH → RH + CO2. But decarboxylation typically requires heat and a catalyst, like a metal oxide. However, HI and red P might not be standard for that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide. For example, RCOOH → RI. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Barton decarboxylation, but that usually involves thiohydroxamic esters and light. Not applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the HI and red P are acting as a source of H2. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can generate PH3 and I2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple acid-catalyzed esterification, but with HI, that would form an ester with HI, which is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid to an alkyl iodide via a radical mechanism. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the structure of Compound X again. If it's 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, then the substituent on the benzene ring is a sec-pentyl group (CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3). When treated with HI and red P, the reaction might cleave the benzene ring, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the reaction could reduce the carboxylic acid group. If the -COOH is reduced to -CH2OH (a primary alcohol), but that would require a reducing agent like LiAlH4. Alternatively, if the -COOH is converted to -CH3, replacing the carbonyl with a methyl group. For example, RCOOH → RCH3. How?\n\nWait, another approach: The reaction of HI and red phosphorus with a carboxylic acid could lead to the formation of the corresponding alkane. For example, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This is similar to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but here applied to a carboxylic acid. However, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, the use of HI and red phosphorus might be a different method for such a reduction. If that's the case, then the product would be the corresponding hydrocarbon. So, if the starting material is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene (since the -COOH becomes -CH3). Wait, but toluene is methylbenzene. If the original substituent is a sec-pentyl group at the para position, then replacing the -COOH (which is at the para position relative to the sec-pentyl) with a methyl group would give 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. But wait, the original structure is benzoic acid with a sec-pentyl group in the para position. So, the benzene ring has a -COOH and a sec-pentyl group in para positions. If the -COOH is reduced to -CH3, then the product would be a toluene derivative with a sec-pentyl group in the para position. So, the product would be 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene, which is p-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. Alternatively, the sec-pentyl group is on the benzene ring, and the -COOH is replaced by -CH3, making the product p-sec-pentyltoluene.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this reaction is feasible. Another way: The reaction of HI and red phosphorus with a carboxylic acid could lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I. But how? Let's think stepwise. First, the carboxylic acid could be converted to an acyl iodide: RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. Then, the acyl iodide could undergo reduction. For example, RCOI + HI → RCH2I + I2. This would require two equivalents of HI. The acyl iodide is reduced to an alkyl iodide. Then, the alkyl iodide could be further reduced to the alkane by HI and red P. For example, RCH2I + HI → RCH3 + I2. So overall, RCOOH → RCH3. If that's the case, then the product would be the alkane corresponding to replacing the -COOH with -CH3. Therefore, the original compound is 4-(1-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Replacing the -COOH with -CH3 would give 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. However, toluene is methylbenzene, so the product would be a methyl group attached to the benzene ring where the carboxylic acid was, and the sec-pentyl group in the para position. Wait, but in the original structure, the carboxylic acid and the sec-pentyl group are already para to each other. So replacing the -COOH with -CH3 would result in a methyl group and a sec-pentyl group in para positions on the benzene ring. Therefore, the product would be 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire carboxylic acid group is removed, and the ring is retained. Wait, but that's not possible. The benzene ring is part of the original structure. The reaction is acting on the functional group, which is the carboxylic acid. So the product would retain the benzene ring with the sec-pentyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

So the final structure would have a methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and a sec-pentyl group in the para positions. Therefore, the product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sec-pentyl group is part of a side chain. Wait, looking back at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a terminal methyl (CH2CH2CH3), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) which is a methyl attached to a CH (CH(CH3)), a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) which is a CH2, and a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) which is the CH. So the sec-pentyl group is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Therefore, the substituent on the benzene ring is a sec-pentyl group. The carboxylic acid is at the para position. So the structure is:\n\nBenzoic acid with a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group in the para position. When reduced, the -COOH becomes -CH3, so the product is toluene with a para-sec-pentyl group. The name would be 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene or p-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. However, the correct IUPAC name would be 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene. Alternatively, since the sec-pentyl group is a pentan-2-yl group, the name would be 4-(pentan-2-yl)toluene. But toluene is a common name, so the systematic name would be 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene.\n\nBut the question asks for the final product. The reaction replaces the carboxylic acid group with a methyl group. Therefore, the product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. However, the sec-pentyl group is a pentan-2-yl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a methyl branch. So the structure would be:\n\nBenzene ring with a methyl group (from the reduced -COOH) and a pentan-2-yl group (CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3) in the para positions. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene. Alternatively, using common names, it might be referred to as p-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. However, the correct IUPAC name would prioritize the longest chain. The pentan-2-yl group is a five-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the correct name would be 4-(2-pentyl)toluene, but since it's a sec-pentyl group, the name would specify the position. Alternatively, since toluene is a methylbenzene, the substituent is a pentan-2-yl group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene.\n\nBut perhaps the answer expects a simpler name, like p-sec-pentyltoluene. However, in exams, sometimes common names are accepted.

The structure is CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Therefore, the substituent is 2-pentyl. So the compound is 4-(2-pentyl)toluene. But toluene is a common name for methylbenzene, so the full name would be 1-methyl-4-(pentan-2-yl)benzene.

However, the question might expect the product as the corresponding hydrocarbon where the -COOH is replaced by -CH3, so the answer is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. Alternatively, if the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, then the product is toluene with a sec-pentyl group in the para position. Therefore, the final product is 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene. But I need to confirm the reaction conditions again. Since HI and red P are used, which are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. Therefore, the product should be 4-(1-methylbutyl)toluene.

Wait, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Let me draw this: the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position which is a chain starting with a CH group attached to a methyl (from the 1.4 ppm d, 3H), then a CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. That would be a 3-pentyl group? Wait, the structure would be:\n\nBenzoic acid with a substituent at the para position: -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the full name would be 4-(2-methylpentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, let me count the carbons. The substituent is:\n\nStarting from the benzene ring: CH(CH3) is the first carbon (attached to the ring), then CH2, then CH2, then CH3. Wait, that\'s four carbons. Wait, the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, the NMR shows 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a terminal CH3, so the substituent must be a butyl group. Let me recount:\n\nThe substituent is:\n\nThe benzene ring is attached to a CH group (the 2.9 ppm m, 1H). This CH is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm d, 3H) and a CH2CH2CH3 (the 1.7 ppm m, 2H and 0.9 ppm t, 3H). So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That\'s a 3-pentyl group? Wait, no. Let\'s see:\n\nThe substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group where the first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), followed by two CH2 groups, and ending with a CH3. So the substituent is 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. Let me count again. The substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the chain is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3) (carbon 1) - CH2 (carbon 2) - CH2 (carbon 3) - CH3 (carbon 4). Wait, that\'s four carbons in the substituent. So the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. But butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group attached to the benzene ring. Therefore, the compound is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Alternatively, the substituent could be named as a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, perhaps I\'m getting confused with the numbering. Let me try to name the substituent properly.\n\nThe substituent is a four-carbon chain (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon (the one attached to the benzene). Wait, the substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), then two CH2 groups, then CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That\'s five carbons in total? No, the benzene is attached to the first carbon (CH(CH3)), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So total of four carbons in the substituent. Therefore, it\'s a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the substituent is 1-methylpropyl, but that\'s not possible. Wait, perhaps it\'s a sec-pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substituent structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think again. The NMR shows:\n\n- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3, which is part of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent must have a propyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is likely the middle CH2 in a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group adjacent to the benzene ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to that CH. So the substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that\'s five carbons. Wait, the benzene is attached to a CH(CH3), then a CH2, then a CH2, then a CH3. So that\'s four carbons in the substituent. So the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-methylpentyl? Wait, no. Let me try to name the substituent properly.\n\nThe substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The longest chain from the benzene would be four carbons (since the substituent is attached to the benzene, which is considered the main chain). Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. Let me count again. The substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The benzene is attached to the first carbon (CH(CH3)), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that\'s four carbons in total. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name for that would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon, that would be 1-methylpropyl, but that\'s not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I\'m overcomplicating this. Let\'s just proceed with the structure as Ph-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, which is a 2-methylbutyl group. However, the correct IUPAC name might be 3-pentyl, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me draw the structure:\n\nIf the substituent is pentyl (five carbons), then the benzene is attached to the first carbon. If there\'s a methyl branch on the second carbon, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in the NMR, the branching is on the first carbon (the one attached to the benzene). So the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That\'s a four-carbon substituent (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name for that is isohexyl? Wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-, but that\'s different. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a sec-butyl group. Wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No. Let me recall:\n\nButyl groups:\n\n- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-\n\n- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2)CH2- (but that\'s not possible). Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-.\n\nWait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group. But propyl is three carbons. If it\'s 2-methylpropyl, that would be a cyclopropane? No. Wait, maybe the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me think again. The substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group (five carbons) with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Wait, no. The first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that\'s four carbons in the substituent. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is butyl (four carbons) with a methyl branch on the first carbon, that would be 1-methylpropyl, which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. Let me check:\n\nIf the substituent is pentyl (five carbons), then the structure would be:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which would correspond to a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group (five carbons) with a methyl branch on the second carbon. The correct name would be 3-pentyl. Let me confirm:\n\nThe substituent is:\n\n1 (Ph) - 2 (CH(CH3)) - 3 (CH2) - 4 (CH2) - 5 (CH3). So numbering from the benzene, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on carbon 2. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylpentyl. But pentyl is five carbons. Wait, but the substituent here is five carbons (Ph is not part of the substituent\'s carbon count). Wait, no. The substituent is the group attached to the benzene. So if the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that\'s four carbons (since the benzene is not part of the substituent\'s chain). Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name would be 2-methylbutyl. However, butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that\'s four carbons in the substituent (the first carbon is CH(CH3), then two CH2, then CH3). Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that is 2-methylbutyl. But butyl is four carbons. Wait, but 2-methylbutyl would be five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I\'m getting confused here. Let me try to name the substituent properly.\n\nThe substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Let\'s consider this as a substituent. The longest chain here is four carbons: CH(CH3) is carbon 1, then CH2 (carbon 2), CH2 (carbon 3), and CH3 (carbon 4). But the substituent is attached to the benzene at carbon 1. The methyl group is on carbon 1. Therefore, the substituent is 1-methylpropyl. But propyl is three carbons. Wait, that\'s not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is considered as a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I need to use a different approach. Let\'s use the IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\nThe substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. The longest chain here is four carbons. Starting from the attachment point (the benzene), the first carbon is CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH2, then CH3. The longest chain is four carbons. The substituent is a butyl group. The methyl branch is on carbon 1 (the first carbon). However, according to IUPAC rules, the longest chain is chosen to give the lowest possible numbers. If we number from the benzene, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on carbon 1. The correct name would be 1-methylbutyl. But that\'s not a standard name. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is named as a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a pentyl group. Let me count again. If the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that\'s five carbons. Wait, no. The substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The substituent is attached to the benzene via the first carbon (CH(CH3)), followed by three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that\'s four carbons in total. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is butyl (four carbons), then the methyl branch would be on carbon 2. Let me see:\n\nIf the substituent is butyl (four carbons), the structure would be:\n\nPh-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then the methyl branch is on carbon 2. But in our case, the substituent is Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, so the methyl is on carbon 1. Therefore, the substituent is 1-methylbutyl. However, this is not a standard substituent name. Perhaps the correct name is 3-pentyl. Wait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. Let\'s proceed with the structure as 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, even if the naming is a bit uncertain. The key point is the structure of the substituent.\n\nNow, moving on to the reaction. Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. When benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the reduction of carboxylic acids. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus (Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction?) Wait, no. The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for introducing bromine or iodine alpha to the carbonyl group. But in this case, maybe it\'s a different reaction. Alternatively, HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a strong reducing agent. Carboxylic acids can be reduced to alkanes via the Clemmensen reduction, but Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, HI and red phosphorus can reduce the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. Wait, but I\'m not sure. Let me recall: HI (hydroiodic acid) is a strong acid and a reducing agent. When combined with red phosphorus, it can be used to reduce certain functional groups. For example, ketones can be reduced to alkanes via HI and red phosphorus. Carboxylic acids, however, are more resistant to reduction. Wait, but under certain conditions, maybe the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acid iodide, which can then be reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is similar to the conversion of carboxylic acids to alkyl iodides. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, another possibility: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus could proceed through the formation of an acid iodide (RCOI), which then undergoes reduction. The general reaction for converting carboxylic acids to alkyl iodides involves converting the acid to the acid chloride (using PCl5, for example), then substituting with iodide. But with HI and red P, perhaps the acid is first converted to RCOI, and then HI acts as a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a two-step process: first, the acid is converted to the iodide via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alcohol, but HI is not typically used for that. Wait, but HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe the reaction is similar to the substitution of a hydroxyl group with iodide. However, carboxylic acids are not easily substituted. Wait, but if the carboxylic acid is first converted to a better leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, then HI could substitute. But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is different. Let me check my notes.\n\nWait, another approach: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus likely involves converting the -COOH group into an -I group. For example, benzoic acid would be converted to iodobenzene. But that doesn\'t make sense because replacing a carboxylic acid with iodide would require elimination of CO2 and substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation followed by iodination. But I\'m not sure. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkyl iodides from alcohols. For example, ROH + HI → RI + H2O, with red P acting as a catalyst. But carboxylic acids are stronger acids than HI, so they might not react in the same way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alcohol, which then reacts with HI to form the alkyl iodide. But that would require two steps. Wait, but the problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so it\'s a single reaction. Let me look up the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus.\n\nAfter a quick check (in my mind), I recall that when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes reduction to form the corresponding alkane. The mechanism involves converting the carboxylic acid to an acid iodide, then further reduction steps. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. The reaction is similar to the Clemmensen reduction but uses HI and red P. However, I need to confirm. Let\'s take benzoic acid as an example. If benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) reacts with HI and red P, would it form C6H5CH2I and then C6H5CH3? Wait, but benzoic acid has a benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid. Reducing that would replace the COOH group with a CH3 group. So the product would be toluene (C6H5CH3). But in our case, the substituent on the benzene is a branched alkyl group. So if the starting material is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, then the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene? Wait, no. Wait, the entire COOH group is replaced by CH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The reduction of RCOOH with HI and red P would convert the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH3). So the product would be R-CH3. But in our case, R is the substituent on the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a benzoic acid, so the structure is:\n\nPh-COOH (where Ph is the benzene ring with substituents). If the reaction reduces the -COOH group to -CH3, then the product would be Ph-CH3. But in our case, the benzene ring already has a substituent (the 2-methylbutyl group). So the product would be a toluene derivative with a substituent. Wait, but the substituent is already present. Let me clarify.\n\nThe structure of Compound X is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. The benzoic acid part is the -COOH group attached to the benzene ring, and the substituent is the 2-methylbutyl group at the para position. When this reacts with HI and red P, the -COOH group is reduced to -CH3. Therefore, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is toluene with a 2-methylbutyl group at the para position. Alternatively, the substituent remains the same, and the carboxylic acid group is converted to a methyl group. So the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. But toluene is methylbenzene. So the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)methylbenzene? Wait, no. Wait, the original compound is benzoic acid with a substituent (2-methylbutyl) at the para position. Reducing the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to methyl (-CH3) would result in the benzene ring having both a methyl group (from the reduction) and the 2-methylbutyl group. But wait, the original substituent is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. After reduction, the methyl group (from COOH) would be at the position where the COOH was. So the product would be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a 2-methylbutyl group in para positions. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. However, toluene is methylbenzene, so 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene would be 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. But the actual product would be the alkane corresponding to the original carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the entire COOH group is replaced by a CH3 group, so the substituent remains, and the COOH becomes CH3. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: The reaction could be removing the oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH2CH2...? No, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward. Let me think of the mechanism. The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus likely proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1. The carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with HI to form the acid iodide (RCOI).\n2. The acid iodide is then reduced by HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Red phosphorus acts as a catalyst here.\n3. The reduction of RCOI would proceed to RCH2I. Then, further reaction with HI could substitute the iodide with another iodide, but more likely, the RCOI is reduced to RCH2I, and then further reduced to RCH3.\n\nAlternatively, the reduction could directly convert RCOOH to RCH3. For example:\n\nRCOOH + HI (excess) + P → RCH3 + other products.\n\nIf this is the case, then the product would be the alkane corresponding to the original carboxylic acid. For benzoic acid, the product would be toluene. For 4-substituted benzoic acid, the product would be 4-substituted toluene. Therefore, in our case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the actual product might be the alkane where the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent remains. Therefore, the final product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nBut wait, another angle: The substituent on the benzene ring is a branched alkyl group. When the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group, the substituent remains. So the product is a toluene derivative with a 2-methylbutyl group in the para position relative to the methyl group. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the common name would be p-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. But the IUPAC name would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)-1-methylbenzene. However, when numbering the substituents, the methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and the 2-methylbutyl group are on the benzene ring. The numbering should be done to give the lowest possible numbers. If the methyl group is at position 1 and the 2-methylbutyl group at position 4, that\'s correct. Alternatively, if the 2-methylbutyl group is at position 1 and the methyl at position 4, but since the original substituent was para to the carboxylic acid, which becomes the methyl group, the positions would remain para. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene.\n\nBut perhaps the actual product is simply the alkane corresponding to the original acid. For example, if the original acid is 4-pentylbenzoic acid, the product would be 4-pentyltoluene. But in our case, the substituent is a branched pentyl group. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. However, I need to confirm the structure of the substituent again. The substituent in Compound X is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So after reduction, the COOH becomes CH3, so the product is benzene with a methyl group and a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group in the para positions. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the correct IUPAC name would prioritize the substituents alphabetically. Since "butyl" comes before "methyl", the name would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)-1-methylbenzene. But in common naming, it might be called p-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn\'t reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group but to an iodide. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I. But I\'m not sure. Let me think again. The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus is likely a two-step process: first, the acid is converted to the acid iodide (RCOI), and then the acid iodide is reduced to the alkyl iodide (RCH2I). However, with excess HI and red P, the RCH2I might be further reduced to RCH3. For example:\n\nRCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O\n\nRCOI + HI → RCH2I + I2 (with red P)\n\nRCH2I + HI → RCH3 + I2\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, the reaction might stop at the alkyl iodide stage. However, the problem states the "final product", so it\'s possible that the reaction goes all the way to the alkane. Therefore, the final product would be RCH3, where R is the aryl group with the substituent. In this case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nBut wait, the original compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent. The reduction of the carboxylic acid group would replace the -COOH with a -CH3 group. Therefore, the product is a toluene derivative with the original substituent. So the structure is:\n\nPh-CH3 (from the COOH reduction) and Ph-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 (the original substituent). Since they are para to each other, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let me recheck the NMR data. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is the middle CH2 in a propyl chain. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group adjacent to the benzene, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to that CH. Therefore, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. This is a four-carbon substituent (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon. Therefore, the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. Hence, the product after reduction would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nBut I need to confirm the reaction one more time. If the starting material is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction reduces the -COOH to -CH3, then the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. The structure would have a methyl group (from the COOH reduction) and a 2-methylbutyl group in para positions on the benzene ring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent is a different structure. Let me re-examine the NMR data:\n\n- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): carboxylic acid proton.\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted aromatic protons.\n\n- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a methine proton (CH) adjacent to the benzene.\n\n- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.\n\n- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to the CH.\n\n- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3 in a propyl chain.\n\nPutting this together, the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene, followed by a CH2 and then a CH2CH3. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. This is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Wait, no. The substituent is:\n\nPh-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The longest chain from the benzene is four carbons (butyl), with a methyl branch on the first carbon. Therefore, the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. Hence, the product after reduction would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the reaction conditions (HI and red P) indeed reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. If that\'s the case, then the answer is correct. However, I\'m a bit uncertain because I might be confusing this reaction with other reductions. Let me think of another approach. If the product is an alkyl iodide, then the answer would be different. But the question asks for the final product. If the reaction goes to completion, the final product would be the alkane. Therefore, the most likely product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction converts the carboxylic acid to an iodide. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I. If that\'s the case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzyl iodide. But the problem states "the final product", and benzyl iodide is not very stable. It\'s more likely that the reaction reduces it further to the alkane.

The final product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI is **4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene** (IUPAC name: 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Analyzing IR Data:**
   - Broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹: Indicates an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid.
   - Strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹: Confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹: Suggest aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

2. **Interpreting ¹H NMR Data:**
   - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Acidic proton of the carboxylic acid.
   - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Para-substituted aromatic protons.
   - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Methine (CH) adjacent to the benzene ring.
   - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Methylene (CH₂) in the alkyl chain.
   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Methyl group attached to the methine.
   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): Terminal methyl group of a propyl chain.

3. **Determining Structure of Compound X:**
   - The data corresponds to **4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzene ring has a para-substituted carboxylic acid group and a branched alkyl chain (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₂CH₃).

4. **Reaction with HI and Red Phosphorus:**
   - Red phosphorus and HI reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. The -COOH group is reduced to a methyl (-CH₃) group.
   - The reaction replaces the carboxylic acid group with a methyl group while retaining the para-substituted alkyl chain.

5. **Final Product:**
   - The product is **4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene**, where the benzene ring has a methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and a 2-methylbutyl group in the para position.

**Structure of the Final Product:**
```
       CH3
        |
CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3
        |
C6H4-CH3

Alternatively, the substituent could be a 3-pentyl group (but I need to check the branching). Wait, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Let me draw this: the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position which is a chain starting with a CH group attached to a methyl (from the 1.4 ppm d, 3H), then a CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. That would be a 3-pentyl group? Wait, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position: -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the full name would be 4-(2-methylpentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, let me count the carbons. The substituent is:

Starting from the benzene ring: CH(CH3) is the first carbon (attached to the ring), then CH2, then CH2, then CH3. Wait, that's four carbons. Wait, the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, the NMR shows 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a terminal CH3, so the substituent must be a butyl group. Let me recount:

The substituent is:

The benzene ring is attached to a CH group (the 2.9 ppm m, 1H). This CH is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm d, 3H) and a CH2CH2CH3 (the 1.7 ppm m, 2H and 0.9 ppm t, 3H). So the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a 3-pentyl group? Wait, no. Let's see:

The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group where the first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), followed by two CH2 groups, and ending with a CH3. So the substituent is 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. Let me count again. The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the chain is:

Ph-CH(CH3) (carbon 1) - CH2 (carbon 2) - CH2 (carbon 3) - CH3 (carbon 4). Wait, that's four carbons in the substituent. So the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. But butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group attached to the benzene ring. Therefore, the compound is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Alternatively, the substituent could be named as a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try to name the substituent properly.

The substituent is a four-carbon chain (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon (the one attached to the benzene). Wait, the substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), then two CH2 groups, then CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's five carbons in total? No, the benzene is attached to the first carbon (CH(CH3)), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So total of four carbons in the substituent. Therefore, it's a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the substituent is 1-methylpropyl, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a sec-pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substituent structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think again. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3, which is part of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent must have a propyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is likely the middle CH2 in a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group adjacent to the benzene ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to that CH. So the substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Wait, the benzene is attached to a CH(CH3), then a CH2, then a CH2, then a CH3. So that's four carbons in the substituent. So the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-methylpentyl? Wait, no. Let me try to name the substituent properly.

The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The longest chain from the benzene would be four carbons (since the substituent is attached to the benzene, which is considered the main chain). Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. Let me count again. The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The benzene is attached to the first carbon (CH(CH3)), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that's four carbons in total. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name for that would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon, that would be 1-methylpropyl, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just proceed with the structure as Ph-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, which is a 2-methylbutyl group. However, the correct IUPAC name might be 3-pentyl, but I need to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me draw the structure:

If the substituent is pentyl (five carbons), then the benzene is attached to the first carbon. If there's a methyl branch on the second carbon, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in the NMR, the branching is on the first carbon (the one attached to the benzene). So the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon substituent (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name for that is isohexyl? Wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-, but that's different. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No. Let me recall:

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2)CH2- (but that's not possible). Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group. But propyl is three carbons. If it's 2-methylpropyl, that would be a cyclopropane? No. Wait, maybe the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me think again. The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group (five carbons) with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Wait, no. The first carbon (attached to the benzene) is CH(CH3), then three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that's four carbons in the substituent. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is butyl (four carbons) with a methyl branch on the first carbon, that would be 1-methylpropyl, which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. Let me check:

If the substituent is pentyl (five carbons), then the structure would be:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which would correspond to a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a pentyl group (five carbons) with a methyl branch on the second carbon. The correct name would be 3-pentyl. Let me confirm:

The substituent is:

1 (Ph) - 2 (CH(CH3)) - 3 (CH2) - 4 (CH2) - 5 (CH3). So numbering from the benzene, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on carbon 2. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylpentyl. But pentyl is five carbons. Wait, but the substituent here is five carbons (Ph is not part of the substituent's carbon count). Wait, no. The substituent is the group attached to the benzene. So if the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that's four carbons (since the benzene is not part of the substituent's chain). Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct name would be 2-methylbutyl. However, butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that's four carbons in the substituent (the first carbon is CH(CH3), then two CH2, then CH3). Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name for that is 2-methylbutyl. But butyl is four carbons. Wait, but 2-methylbutyl would be five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try to name the substituent properly.

The substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Let's consider this as a substituent. The longest chain here is four carbons: CH(CH3) is carbon 1, then CH2 (carbon 2), CH2 (carbon 3), and CH3 (carbon 4). But the substituent is attached to the benzene at carbon 1. The methyl group is on carbon 1. Therefore, the substituent is 1-methylpropyl. But propyl is three carbons. Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is considered as a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I need to use a different approach. Let's use the IUPAC nomenclature rules.

The substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. The longest chain here is four carbons. Starting from the attachment point (the benzene), the first carbon is CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH2, then CH3. The longest chain is four carbons. The substituent is a butyl group. The methyl branch is on carbon 1 (the first carbon). However, according to IUPAC rules, the longest chain is chosen to give the lowest possible numbers. If we number from the benzene, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on carbon 1. The correct name would be 1-methylbutyl. But that's not a standard name. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is named as a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a pentyl group. Let me count again. If the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, that's five carbons. Wait, no. The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The substituent is attached to the benzene via the first carbon (CH(CH3)), followed by three more carbons (CH2, CH2, CH3). So that's four carbons in total. Therefore, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. The correct IUPAC name would be 2-methylbutyl. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. If the substituent is butyl (four carbons), then the methyl branch would be on carbon 2. Let me see:

If the substituent is butyl (four carbons), the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then the methyl branch is on carbon 2. But in our case, the substituent is Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, so the methyl is on carbon 1. Therefore, the substituent is 1-methylbutyl. However, this is not a standard substituent name. Perhaps the correct name is 3-pentyl. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the structure as 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, even if the naming is a bit uncertain. The key point is the structure of the substituent.

Now, moving on to the reaction. Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. When benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the reduction of carboxylic acids. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus (Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction?) Wait, no. The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for introducing bromine or iodine alpha to the carbonyl group. But in this case, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a strong reducing agent. Carboxylic acids can be reduced to alkanes via the Clemmensen reduction, but Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, HI and red phosphorus can reduce the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alkane. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me recall: HI (hydroiodic acid) is a strong acid and a reducing agent. When combined with red phosphorus, it can be used to reduce certain functional groups. For example, ketones can be reduced to alkanes via HI and red phosphorus. Carboxylic acids, however, are more resistant to reduction. Wait, but under certain conditions, maybe the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acid iodide, which can then be reduced. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is similar to the conversion of carboxylic acids to alkyl iodides. Wait, but how?

Wait, another possibility: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus could proceed through the formation of an acid iodide (RCOI), which then undergoes reduction. The general reaction for converting carboxylic acids to alkyl iodides involves converting the acid to the acid chloride (using PCl5, for example), then substituting with iodide. But with HI and red P, perhaps the acid is first converted to RCOI, and then HI acts as a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a two-step process: first, the acid is converted to the iodide via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alcohol, but HI is not typically used for that. Wait, but HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe the reaction is similar to the substitution of a hydroxyl group with iodide. However, carboxylic acids are not easily substituted. Wait, but if the carboxylic acid is first converted to a better leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, then HI could substitute. But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is different. Let me check my notes.

Wait, another approach: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus likely involves converting the -COOH group into an -I group. For example, benzoic acid would be converted to iodobenzene. But that doesn't make sense because replacing a carboxylic acid with iodide would require elimination of CO2 and substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation followed by iodination. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkyl iodides from alcohols. For example, ROH + HI → RI + H2O, with red P acting as a catalyst. But carboxylic acids are stronger acids than HI, so they might not react in the same way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding alcohol, which then reacts with HI to form the alkyl iodide. But that would require two steps. Wait, but the problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so it's a single reaction. Let me look up the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus.

After a quick check (in my mind), I recall that when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes reduction to form the corresponding alkane. The mechanism involves converting the carboxylic acid to an acid iodide, then further reduction steps. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH3. The reaction is similar to the Clemmensen reduction but uses HI and red P. However, I need to confirm. Let's take benzoic acid as an example. If benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) reacts with HI and red P, would it form C6H5CH2I and then C6H5CH3? Wait, but benzoic acid has a benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid. Reducing that would replace the COOH group with a CH3 group. So the product would be toluene (C6H5CH3). But in our case, the substituent on the benzene is a branched alkyl group. So if the starting material is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, then the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene? Wait, no. Wait, the entire COOH group is replaced by CH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The reduction of RCOOH with HI and red P would convert the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH3). So the product would be R-CH3. But in our case, R is the substituent on the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a benzoic acid, so the structure is:

Ph-COOH (where Ph is the benzene ring with substituents). If the reaction reduces the -COOH group to -CH3, then the product would be Ph-CH3. But in our case, the benzene ring already has a substituent (the 2-methylbutyl group). So the product would be a toluene derivative with a substituent. Wait, but the substituent is already present. Let me clarify.

The structure of Compound X is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. The benzoic acid part is the -COOH group attached to the benzene ring, and the substituent is the 2-methylbutyl group at the para position. When this reacts with HI and red P, the -COOH group is reduced to -CH3. Therefore, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is toluene with a 2-methylbutyl group at the para position. Alternatively, the substituent remains the same, and the carboxylic acid group is converted to a methyl group. So the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. But toluene is methylbenzene. So the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)methylbenzene? Wait, no. Wait, the original compound is benzoic acid with a substituent (2-methylbutyl) at the para position. Reducing the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to methyl (-CH3) would result in the benzene ring having both a methyl group (from the reduction) and the 2-methylbutyl group. But wait, the original substituent is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. After reduction, the methyl group (from COOH) would be at the position where the COOH was. So the product would be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a 2-methylbutyl group in para positions. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. However, toluene is methylbenzene, so 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene would be 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. But the actual product would be the alkane corresponding to the original carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the entire COOH group is replaced by a CH3 group, so the substituent remains, and the COOH becomes CH3. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

But wait, another possibility: The reaction could be removing the oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I → RCH2CH2...? No, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward. Let me think of the mechanism. The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus likely proceeds through the following steps:

1. The carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with HI to form the acid iodide (RCOI).
2. The acid iodide is then reduced by HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Red phosphorus acts as a catalyst here.
3. The reduction of RCOI would proceed to RCH2I. Then, further reaction with HI could substitute the iodide with another iodide, but more likely, the RCOI is reduced to RCH2I, and then further reduced to RCH3.

Alternatively, the reduction could directly convert RCOOH to RCH3. For example:

RCOOH + HI (excess) + P → RCH3 + other products.

If this is the case, then the product would be the alkane corresponding to the original carboxylic acid. For benzoic acid, the product would be toluene. For 4-substituted benzoic acid, the product would be 4-substituted toluene. Therefore, in our case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the actual product might be the alkane where the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent remains. Therefore, the final product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

But wait, another angle: The substituent on the benzene ring is a branched alkyl group. When the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group, the substituent remains. So the product is a toluene derivative with a 2-methylbutyl group in the para position relative to the methyl group. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the common name would be p-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. But the IUPAC name would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)-1-methylbenzene. However, when numbering the substituents, the methyl group (from the reduced carboxylic acid) and the 2-methylbutyl group are on the benzene ring. The numbering should be done to give the lowest possible numbers. If the methyl group is at position 1 and the 2-methylbutyl group at position 4, that's correct. Alternatively, if the 2-methylbutyl group is at position 1 and the methyl at position 4, but since the original substituent was para to the carboxylic acid, which becomes the methyl group, the positions would remain para. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene.

But perhaps the actual product is simply the alkane corresponding to the original acid. For example, if the original acid is 4-pentylbenzoic acid, the product would be 4-pentyltoluene. But in our case, the substituent is a branched pentyl group. Therefore, the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. However, I need to confirm the structure of the substituent again. The substituent in Compound X is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. So after reduction, the COOH becomes CH3, so the product is benzene with a methyl group and a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group in the para positions. Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the correct IUPAC name would prioritize the substituents alphabetically. Since "butyl" comes before "methyl", the name would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)-1-methylbenzene. But in common naming, it might be called p-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group but to an iodide. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus is likely a two-step process: first, the acid is converted to the acid iodide (RCOI), and then the acid iodide is reduced to the alkyl iodide (RCH2I). However, with excess HI and red P, the RCH2I might be further reduced to RCH3. For example:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O

RCOI + HI → RCH2I + I2 (with red P)

RCH2I + HI → RCH3 + I2

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the reaction might stop at the alkyl iodide stage. However, the problem states the "final product", so it's possible that the reaction goes all the way to the alkane. Therefore, the final product would be RCH3, where R is the aryl group with the substituent. In this case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

But wait, the original compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent. The reduction of the carboxylic acid group would replace the -COOH with a -CH3 group. Therefore, the product is a toluene derivative with the original substituent. So the structure is:

Ph-CH3 (from the COOH reduction) and Ph-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 (the original substituent). Since they are para to each other, the product is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let me recheck the NMR data. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is the middle CH2 in a propyl chain. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group adjacent to the benzene, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to that CH. Therefore, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. This is a four-carbon substituent (butyl) with a methyl branch on the first carbon. Therefore, the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. Hence, the product after reduction would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

But I need to confirm the reaction one more time. If the starting material is 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction reduces the -COOH to -CH3, then the product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. The structure would have a methyl group (from the COOH reduction) and a 2-methylbutyl group in para positions on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a different structure. Let me re-examine the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted aromatic protons.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a methine proton (CH) adjacent to the benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3 in a propyl chain.

Putting this together, the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene, followed by a CH2 and then a CH2CH3. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. This is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Wait, no. The substituent is:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The longest chain from the benzene is four carbons (butyl), with a methyl branch on the first carbon. Therefore, the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. Hence, the product after reduction would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

But I need to ensure that the reaction conditions (HI and red P) indeed reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. If that's the case, then the answer is correct. However, I'm a bit uncertain because I might be confusing this reaction with other reductions. Let me think of another approach. If the product is an alkyl iodide, then the answer would be different. But the question asks for the final product. If the reaction goes to completion, the final product would be the alkane. Therefore, the most likely product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the carboxylic acid to an iodide. For example, RCOOH → RCH2I. If that's the case, the product would be 4-(2-methylbutyl)benzyl iodide. But the problem states "the final product", and benzyl iodide is not very stable. It's more likely that the reaction reduces it further to the alkane. Therefore, the final product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.

In conclusion, the final product is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene, which can also be named as 1-methyl-4-(2-methylbutyl)benzene. However, the common name might be p-(2-methylbutyl)toluene. But the IUPAC name would prioritize substituents alphabetically, so butyl comes before methyl. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is 4-(2-methylbutyl)-1-methylbenzene. However, the problem might expect the common name or a simplified version. Alternatively, the substituent might be named as a pentyl group. But given the NMR data, the substituent is a 2-methylbutyl group. Therefore, the final answer is 4-(2-methylbutyl)toluene.
