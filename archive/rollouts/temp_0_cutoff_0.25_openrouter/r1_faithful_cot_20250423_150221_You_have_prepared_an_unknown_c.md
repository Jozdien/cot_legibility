The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - The **broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹** indicates an O-H stretch, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which forms strong hydrogen bonds.
   - The **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) group, typical of carboxylic acids.
   - The **peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** suggests a conjugated C=C double bond, consistent with the vinyl hydrogens observed in the NMR.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** confirms the existence of a double bond (C=C), aligning with the IR data.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - The **fragment at m/z = 45** corresponds to the -COOH group (12 + 16×2 + 1 = 45), supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - For **C₆H₁₀O₂**, DoU = (2×6 + 2 − 10)/2 = 2. This accounts for one double bond (C=C) and one carbonyl (C=O), matching the spectroscopic data.
   - Other formulas (C₆H₁₂O, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₂O₂) either lack sufficient oxygen atoms to explain the -COOH group or have insufficient DoU to accommodate both the carbonyl and double bond.

**Conclusion**: The compound is a **carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond**, giving the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me start by going through each piece of information one by one and see what clues they give.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It mentions a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 are usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is more common in carboxylic acids because they can form strong hydrogen bonds. But wait, maybe it's an alcohol? But alcohols can also have broad peaks if they're in a solution where they can hydrogen bond, like in a concentrated solution or a solid. However, carboxylic acids typically have a very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So maybe that's a clue here. The other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is a strong absorption, which is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an alkene (C=C). The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would support the presence of an alkene. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Looking at the NMR next. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that confirms the presence of an alkene. The splitting pattern could tell us more, but since it's not specified, I can just note that there's a double bond in the structure. The chemical shifts for vinyl protons are usually around 4.5-6.5 ppm. If there's a conjugated system, maybe the shifts are a bit downfield. But without more details, I can just note the presence of an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z = 45. Common fragments at 45 could be the COOH group (which is 45, since COOH is 45: C=12, O=16*2=32, H=1, so 12+32+1=45? Wait, wait. Let me check. The molecular weight of COOH (carboxylic acid group) would be 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 1 (H) = 12+32+1=45. So a fragment at 45 could be the -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's another group. Another common fragment at 45 is the CH2CH2O+ (but that might not add up). Let me calculate: CH2CH3O? Wait, 12*2 + 1*5 + 16 = 24 +5 +16=45. So maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O+ (but that structure might not be right). Alternatively, maybe it's the -COOH+ ion. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, losing the -COOH group would leave a fragment, but maybe the molecular ion would lose a COOH group. Alternatively, the base peak at 45 could be from the loss of a larger fragment. Hmm. But if the molecular ion is, say, C6H10O2, then the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(16*2)=72+10+32=114. If there's a fragment at 45, that could correspond to 114 - 45 = 69, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is a key fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe there's a fragment corresponding to the acid part or the alcohol part. But the 45 is a key point here. If it's a carboxylic acid, the molecular ion might lose COOH (45), but that would leave a fragment of M-45. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from the carboxylic acid group itself. Wait, but the molecular ion would have the entire molecule. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the molecular ion would include the COOH group. But in mass spectrometry, the molecular ion can fragment. For example, a carboxylic acid might lose the -COOH group as a neutral (not as a charged fragment), but the charged fragment would be the remaining part. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from another part. Let me think. Another common fragment at m/z 45 is the CH3CH2O+ ion (if it's an ethyl ester, for example). Let me check: CH2CH2O+ would be (12*2)+(1*4)+(16)=24+4+16=44, so that's 44. But 45 would be maybe CH3CHOH+? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the -COOH+ ion, which is 45. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the molecular ion could lose a water molecule or other groups, but the presence of a fragment at 45 might suggest the presence of a -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups (1700 cm⁻¹) and maybe another oxygen. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each to see which ones fit with the presence of a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and possibly a carbonyl group.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

For C6H12O: DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring. But the compound has a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and a possible O-H (if it's an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Wait, but if it's C6H12O, the DoU is 1. If there's a carbonyl (C=O), that's one DoU, so that would account for it. But then where is the O? If it's an alcohol, then the O is in an -OH group. But the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be -OH. But then the carbonyl at 1700 would require another oxygen? Wait, no. If the compound is a ketone, for example, then it would have a carbonyl (C=O) and the formula would be C6H12O. Let's see: a ketone would be R2C=O. For example, maybe 2-hexanone: C6H12O. That would have a carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹. But then the FTIR also has a peak at 1650, which could be a C=C. But the DoU would be 1 (from the ketone), so there can't be a double bond. Wait, that's a problem. Because if the DoU is 1, and the carbonyl is one DoU, then there can't be another double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which require a double bond. So C6H12O can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond. Therefore, C6H12O is out. Because DoU=1, but we need at least two (one for carbonyl, one for alkene). So that formula is not possible.

Next, C6H10O: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be two double bonds, or one double bond and a ring, or a triple bond. But the presence of a carbonyl (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU) would fit. So that's possible. But then the formula is C6H10O. Let's see. If it's a ketone with a double bond, like a cyclohexenone, but that might have a ring. Alternatively, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, something like 3-penten-2-one. But the molecular formula would need to be C6H10O. Let's check: 3-penten-2-one is CH2=C(CO)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count. 3-penten-2-one would be (CH2)2COCH2CH2? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond. But perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with a double bond. But the FTIR shows a carbonyl at 1700, which is more typical for ketones or esters. Aldehydes have higher carbonyl stretches, around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H and 1720-1700 for the carbonyl. Wait, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Wait, but esters have two oxygen atoms. The formula C6H10O has only one oxygen. So if it's an ester, the formula would need to be C6H10O2. So that's another option. Let's check the other formulas.

C6H10O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a carbonyl and a double bond, or two carbonyls, or a ring and a carbonyl, etc. If it's an ester, which has a carbonyl and an oxygen, then the formula would fit. For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is C5H8O2. But we need C6H10O2. Maybe something like hexenoic acid, but that would be a carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, 3-hexenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH. Wait, that would be C6H10O2. Let's count: COOH is -COOH (2 oxygens), and the rest is CH2CH2CH=CH- (but that's 5 carbons plus the COOH makes 6). So yes, C6H10O2. That would have a carboxylic acid group (broad peak at 3000), a carbonyl at 1700 (the carboxylic acid C=O), and the double bond at 1650 cm⁻¹ (C=C). The vinyl hydrogens in NMR would be from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be the -COOH group (which is 45). So when the molecule fragments, the -COOH could break off, leaving a fragment at 45. Alternatively, the molecular ion might lose COOH, but the fragment at 45 would be the COOH+ ion. That seems plausible.

Then the last option is C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But we have both a carbonyl (from the IR at 1700) and a double bond (from the NMR), which would require two DoU. So C6H12O2 can't be the right formula because it only has one DoU. Therefore, that's out.

So now we're down to C6H10O and C6H10O2. Let's reconsider.

The FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000, which suggests -OH (alcohol or carboxylic acid). If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would need to have two oxygens (COOH group: one oxygen in the carbonyl, one in the -OH). So a carboxylic acid would be RCOOH, which is C6H10O2 (since COOH is -COOH, which is two oxygens). So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2. That would fit with the DoU: two (one from the carboxylic acid carbonyl, one from the double bond). The IR would show the broad -OH stretch of the carboxylic acid, the carbonyl at 1700, and the C=C at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the -COOH group. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester (C6H10O2), then the IR might not have the broad -OH peak. Esters don't have -OH groups, so the broad peak at 3000 would have to be explained otherwise. But the problem states a very broad absorption at 3000, which is more consistent with an -OH group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which would require two oxygens, so C6H10O2.

Wait, but let's check the other possibility. If the compound is an enol, which has an -OH and a double bond, but enols are less common and might not be stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with a double bond, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, the formula C6H10O has only one oxygen. If it's an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl, but that would require two oxygens. Wait, no. If the compound is a ketone with a double bond and an alcohol, that would need two oxygens. But C6H10O has only one oxygen. So that's not possible. Therefore, the presence of both a carbonyl (from 1700 cm⁻¹) and an -OH (from 3000 cm⁻¹) would require two oxygens, so the formula must be C6H10O2.

Therefore, the correct formula is C6H10O2.

Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me start by going through each piece of information one by one and see what clues they give.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It mentions a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 are usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is more common in carboxylic acids because they can form strong hydrogen bonds. But wait, maybe it's an alcohol? But alcohols can also have broad peaks if they're in a solution where they can hydrogen bond, like in a concentrated solution or a solid. However, carboxylic acids typically have a very broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So maybe that's a clue here. The other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is a strong absorption, which is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an alkene (C=C). The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would support the presence of an alkene. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Looking at the NMR next. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that confirms the presence of an alkene. The splitting pattern could tell us more, but since it's not specified, I can just note that there's a double bond in the structure. The chemical shifts for vinyl protons are usually around 4.5-6.5 ppm. If there's a conjugated system, maybe the shifts are a bit downfield. But without more details, I can just note the presence of an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z = 45. Common fragments at 45 could be the COOH group (which is 45, since COOH is 45: C=12, O=16*2=32, H=1, so 12+32+1=45? Wait, wait. Let me check. The molecular weight of COOH (carboxylic acid group) would be 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 1 (H) = 12+32+1=45. So a fragment at 45 could be the -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's another group. Another common fragment at 45 is the CH2CH2O+ (but that might not add up). Let me calculate: CH2CH3O? Wait, 12*2 + 1*5 + 16 = 24 +5 +16=45. So maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O+ (but that structure might not be right). Alternatively, maybe it's the -COOH+ ion. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, losing the -COOH group would leave a fragment, but maybe the molecular ion would lose a COOH group. Alternatively, the base peak at 45 could be from the loss of a larger fragment. Hmm. But if the m

Alright, I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound from the spectroscopic data provided. The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. I'll analyze each piece of data systematically to identify the correct structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum, there's a notably broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. This typically indicates O-H stretching, which occurs in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in carboxylic acids. While alcohols can also show broad peaks when hydrogen bonding occurs (in concentrated solutions or solids), carboxylic acids characteristically display very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range. The spectrum also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak strongly suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak likely indicates either a conjugated carbonyl or an alkene (C=C).

The NMR data reveals peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. These hydrogens attached to double bonds typically show chemical shifts in the 4.5-6.5 ppm range, potentially shifting downfield if part of a conjugated system. Although specific splitting patterns would provide more structural information, the data simply confirms an alkene functionality.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z = 45. This could represent a carboxylic acid group (COOH), which has a molecular weight of 45 (C=12, O=16×2=32, H=1, totaling 45). Alternatively, it might be another fragment like CH2CH2O+, which also calculates to 45 (C=12×2=24, H=1×5=5, O=16, totaling 45). If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the m/z 45 peak could result from the loss of the COOH group from the molecular ion, or it might represent the COOH+ fragment itself. The base peak at 45 could also result from the loss of a larger fragment. However, the analysis seems to be cut off mid-thought when considering the m

I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the provided spectroscopic data. The possibilities are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. I'll examine each piece of information for clues.

First, the FTIR spectrum indicates a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Broad peaks around 3000 typically suggest O-H stretching, common in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness implies hydrogen bonding, which is more prevalent in carboxylic acids due to their strong hydrogen bonds. It could also be an alcohol, as alcohols form broad peaks in solutions where they can hydrogen bond, such as in a concentrated solution or a solid. Nonetheless, carboxylic acids usually show a very broad peak between 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which might be significant here. The additional strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ are also notable. The 1700 peak is strongly indicative of carbonyl groups (C=O), and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an alkene (C=C). The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR supports the existence of an alkene, suggesting the compound could contain both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Next, examining the NMR data, it shows peaks related to vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of an alkene due to their attachment to a double bond. While the splitting pattern isn't specified, the presence of a double bond is clear. Vinyl proton chemical shifts typically range from 4.5-6.5 ppm, but could shift downfield in a conjugated system. Lacking further details, I'll note the alkene's presence.

The mass spectrum features a fragment at m/z = 45. Common fragments at this value include the COOH group. The molecular weight of the COOH group is calculated as 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 1 (H) = 45. Thus, a fragment at 45 could be the -COOH group. Alternatively, it might represent another group. A potential fragment at 45 is the CH2CH2O+ ion, but verification is required: CH2CH2O is calculated as 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 45. Although this might not be the precise structure, it's another possibility. The base peak at 45 could result from the loss of a larger fragment if the compound is a carboxylic acid, potentially losing the -COOH group or similar.

But wait, the 1700 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone or aldehyde, but the 1650 cm⁻¹ might be an alkene. But if there's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of a broad O-H stretch and a carbonyl peak would suggest a carboxylic acid. But then the molecular formula would need to include a COOH group. Let's check the options:\n\nThe possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.\n\nA carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for example, if the compound is C6H12O2, that could be a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons in the R group (since COOH is 2 oxygens). Let's see: C5H11COOH would be C6H12O2. That fits. Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, that would be a carboxylic acid with one degree of unsaturation (since C6H10O2: degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carboxylic acid (which has a double bond) and another from maybe a ring or a double bond. But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2. Let me check: for example, if it's pentenoic acid (CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH with a double bond), but the exact structure isn't necessary right now. The key is the formula.\n\nBut wait, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would need two oxygen atoms. So C6H12O2 or C6H10O2. The presence of a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens in NMR and the 1650 cm⁻¹ in IR) would mean that the compound has one double bond. So for C6H10O2: the degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carboxylic acid (which is a double bond) and another from a ring or another double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's another double bond. Wait, but a carboxylic acid already has a double bond (the carbonyl), so if there's another double bond in the molecule, that would account for two degrees of unsaturation. So C6H10O2 would have two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl, one from the alkene). That makes sense. Alternatively, C6H12O2 would have (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1 degree of unsaturation, which would be the carbonyl from the carboxylic acid, but then there's an alkene as well, which would require another degree, making it two. But C6H12O2 can't have two degrees of unsaturation because the formula gives only one. Wait, that's a problem. Let me recalculate degrees of unsaturation properly.\n\nDegrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), so DoU = (2*6 +2 - H)/2.\n\nFor C6H12O2: DoU = (12 +2 -12)/2 = (2)/2 =1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the compound has a carbonyl (from IR) which is a double bond, so that uses up the one degree. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would require another double bond, which would require another degree. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, C6H12O2 can't have both a carbonyl and an alkene. Therefore, the formula must be C6H10O2, which has DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2 =4/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carbonyl (carboxylic acid) and one from the alkene. That fits.\n\nAlternatively, if the compound is an ester, which also has a carbonyl (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹), but esters don't have the O-H stretch. The IR here has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H, so more likely a carboxylic acid. So the formula would be C6H10O2.\n\nWait, but let's check the other options. C6H10O: DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees. If it's a ketone (C=O) and an alkene, that would fit. But then the O-H stretch in IR would not be explained unless it's an alcohol. But an alcohol's O-H is broad, but if the compound is an enol (a conjugated enol with a double bond), but enols are less common. Alternatively, maybe a phenol, but phenols have O-H around 3300-3500, and the broad peak here is at 3000, which is lower. Maybe it's a carboxylic acid after all. But C6H10O can't be a carboxylic acid because carboxylic acids have two oxygen atoms. So C6H10O would have to be something else, like a ketone with an alcohol, but then the O-H would be present. But the carbonyl would be at 1700, and maybe the 1650 is something else. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.\n\nThe mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the fragment could be COOH+ (45). If the molecular ion loses the rest of the molecule, but maybe the base peak is at 45. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the fragment at 45 could be something else. For example, if it's methyl ester, the CH3O+ would be 31 (15+16=31), but 45 is higher. Wait, 45 could be the CH2CH2O+? Let me calculate: C2H5O+ would be (2*12)+(5*1)+16=24+5+16=45. So maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O+. That could come from an ether or an ester. But if the compound is an ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750, which matches the IR. But then where is the O-H? The broad peak at 3000 would suggest an -OH group, which esters don't have. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the fragment at 45 would be the -COOH group. But wait, the molecular ion of a carboxylic acid would likely lose COOH as a neutral fragment, but in mass spectrometry, the charge stays on the fragment. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H11COOH (which is C6H12O2), losing the COOH group would leave C5H11+ which would be 71 (5*12 +11=60+11=71). But the fragment here is at 45. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group itself is breaking off as a charged fragment. But the molecular weight of COOH is 45, so if the molecular ion is, say, 117 (for C6H12O2: 6*12 +12 +16*2=72+12+32=116), so the molecular ion would be at 116. If there's a fragment at 45, that could be the COOH+ ion. But I'm not sure if that's a common fragmentation. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, but then the O-H would be present. Let's see, for C6H10O, which has DoU=2. If it's a cyclic ether with a double bond, but that might not explain the carbonyl peak. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol. Wait, but a ketone has a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), and an alcohol has O-H (broad peak). But then the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might be something else. Maybe conjugated carbonyl? If the compound is something like a diketone, but that would have two carbonyl peaks. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For example, a conjugated enone. The carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be in the NMR. The O-H from an alcohol would explain the broad peak. But if the formula is C6H10O, that would require an alcohol and a conjugated carbonyl. But then the mass spec fragment at 45 could be something else. Maybe the molecular ion loses a large fragment, leaving a small ion. For example, if it's a secondary alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl, maybe the fragmentation leads to a CH2CH2O+ ion (45). But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLet me try to summarize:\n\n- FTIR: Broad O-H (carboxylic acid?), C=O at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (maybe conjugated C=O or C=C).\n- NMR: Vinyl hydrogens (so C=C).\n- Mass spec: Fragment at 45 (possibly COOH+ or C2H5O+).\n\nPossible formulas:\n\n- C6H12O: DoU=1. Can't have both C=O and C=C (needs 2 DoU).\n- C6H10O: DoU=2. Could have C=O and C=C. But needs an O-H (alcohol?) and a carbonyl. But then the carbonyl would be at 1700, and the 1650 could be C=C. But would an alcohol's O-H be that broad? Maybe if it's a phenol, but the shift is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but that requires two oxygens.\n- C6H10O2: DoU=2. Carboxylic acid (O-H, C=O) and a C=C. This fits. The fragment at 45 would be COOH+.\n- C6H12O2: DoU=1. Can't have both C=O and C=C.\n\nSo the most likely is C6H10O2. Let me check the mass spec again. If the molecular weight is C6H10O2: 6*12 +10 +16*2=72+10+32=114. The molecular ion would be at 114. If there's a fragment at 45, that could be the COOH+ (45), so the remaining part would be C5H9 (which would be 5*12 +9=69). But 69+45=114, so that makes sense. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but then the O-H wouldn't be present. So the presence of the O-H suggests carboxylic acid. Therefore, the formula is C6H10O2.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445920, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2954, prompt_tokens=841, total_tokens=3795, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A **broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹** indicates an **O-H stretch**, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (due to hydrogen bonding).
   - **Strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and a **conjugated alkene (C=C)**, respectively. The conjugation between the carbonyl and alkene lowers the C=O stretching frequency slightly and explains the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Vinyl hydrogens** (protons on a C=C bond) confirm the presence of an **alkene**, consistent with the IR absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A **fragment at m/z = 45** corresponds to the **-COOH⁺** group (carboxylic acid fragment), which aligns with the IR evidence for a carboxylic acid. The molecular ion (M⁺) for C₆H₁₀O₂ would be 114, and the loss of the -COOH fragment (45) leaves a residual fragment of 69 (C₅H₉⁺).

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - For **C₆H₁₀O₂**: \( \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2 \), accounting for **one double bond (C=O)** and **one double bond (C=C)**. This matches the IR and NMR data.
   - Other formulas (C₆H₁₂O, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₂O₂) either lack sufficient oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid or cannot accommodate both a carbonyl and alkene due to insufficient degrees of unsaturation.

**Conclusion**: The compound is a **carboxylic acid with a conjugated alkene**, corresponding to the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. 

**Answer**: \boxed{C_6H_{10}O_2}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

/z=45 is a fragment, then maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group, which would align with the IR's broad peak at 3000 (O-H) and the 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O). But wait, the 1700 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone or aldehyde, but the 1650 cm⁻¹ might be an alkene. But if there's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of a broad O-H stretch and a carbonyl peak would suggest a carboxylic acid. But then the molecular formula would need to include a COOH group. Let's check the options:

The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

A carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for example, if the compound is C6H12O2, that could be a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons in the R group (since COOH is 2 oxygens). Let's see: C5H11COOH would be C6H12O2. That fits. Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, that would be a carboxylic acid with one degree of unsaturation (since C6H10O2: degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carboxylic acid (which has a double bond) and another from maybe a ring or a double bond. But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2. Let me check: for example, if it's pentenoic acid (CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH with a double bond), but the exact structure isn't necessary right now. The key is the formula.

But wait, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would need two oxygen atoms. So C6H12O2 or C6H10O2. The presence of a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens in NMR and the 1650 cm⁻¹ in IR) would mean that the compound has one double bond. So for C6H10O2: the degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carboxylic acid (which is a double bond) and another from a ring or another double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's another double bond. Wait, but a carboxylic acid already has a double bond (the carbonyl), so if there's another double bond in the molecule, that would account for two degrees of unsaturation. So C6H10O2 would have two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl, one from the alkene). That makes sense. Alternatively, C6H12O2 would have (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1 degree of unsaturation, which would be the carbonyl from the carboxylic acid, but then there's an alkene as well, which would require another degree, making it two. But C6H12O2 can't have two degrees of unsaturation because the formula gives only one. Wait, that's a problem. Let me recalculate degrees of unsaturation properly.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), so DoU = (2*6 +2 - H)/2.

For C6H12O2: DoU = (12 +2 -12)/2 = (2)/2 =1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the compound has a carbonyl (from IR) which is a double bond, so that uses up the one degree. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would require another double bond, which would require another degree. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, C6H12O2 can't have both a carbonyl and an alkene. Therefore, the formula must be C6H10O2, which has DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2 =4/2=2. So two degrees: one from the carbonyl (carboxylic acid) and one from the alkene. That fits.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which also has a carbonyl (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹), but esters don't have the O-H stretch. The IR here has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H, so more likely a carboxylic acid. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, but let's check the other options. C6H10O: DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees. If it's a ketone (C=O) and an alkene, that would fit. But then the O-H stretch in IR would not be explained unless it's an alcohol. But an alcohol's O-H is broad, but if the compound is an enol (a conjugated enol with a double bond), but enols are less common. Alternatively, maybe a phenol, but phenols have O-H around 3300-3500, and the broad peak here is at 3000, which is lower. Maybe it's a carboxylic acid after all. But C6H10O can't be a carboxylic acid because carboxylic acids have two oxygen atoms. So C6H10O would have to be something else, like a ketone with an alcohol, but then the O-H would be present. But the carbonyl would be at 1700, and maybe the 1650 is something else. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the fragment could be COOH+ (45). If the molecular ion loses the rest of the molecule, but maybe the base peak is at 45. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the fragment at 45 could be something else. For example, if it's methyl ester, the CH3O+ would be 31 (15+16=31), but 45 is higher. Wait, 45 could be the CH2CH2O+? Let me calculate: C2H5O+ would be (2*12)+(5*1)+16=24+5+16=45. So maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O+. That could come from an ether or an ester. But if the compound is an ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750, which matches the IR. But then where is the O-H? The broad peak at 3000 would suggest an -OH group, which esters don't have. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the fragment at 45 would be the -COOH group. But wait, the molecular ion of a carboxylic acid would likely lose COOH as a neutral fragment, but in mass spectrometry, the charge stays on the fragment. So if the molecular ion is, say, C5H11COOH (which is C6H12O2), losing the COOH group would leave C5H11+ which would be 71 (5*12 +11=60+11=71). But the fragment here is at 45. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group itself is breaking off as a charged fragment. But the molecular weight of COOH is 45, so if the molecular ion is, say, 117 (for C6H12O2: 6*12 +12 +16*2=72+12+32=116), so the molecular ion would be at 116. If there's a fragment at 45, that could be the COOH+ ion. But I'm not sure if that's a common fragmentation. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, but then the O-H would be present. Let's see, for C6H10O, which has DoU=2. If it's a cyclic ether with a double bond, but that might not explain the carbonyl peak. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol. Wait, but a ketone has a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), and an alcohol has O-H (broad peak). But then the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak might be something else. Maybe conjugated carbonyl? If the compound is something like a diketone, but that would have two carbonyl peaks. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For example, a conjugated enone. The carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be in the NMR. The O-H from an alcohol would explain the broad peak. But if the formula is C6H10O, that would require an alcohol and a conjugated carbonyl. But then the mass spec fragment at 45 could be something else. Maybe the molecular ion loses a large fragment, leaving a small ion. For example, if it's a secondary alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl, maybe the fragmentation leads to a CH2CH2O+ ion (45). But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit complicated.

Let me try to summarize:

- FTIR: Broad O-H (carboxylic acid?), C=O at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (maybe conjugated C=O or C=C).
- NMR: Vinyl hydrogens (so C=C).
- Mass spec: Fragment at 45 (possibly COOH+ or C2H5O+).

Possible formulas:

- C6H12O: DoU=1. Can't have both C=O and C=C (needs 2 DoU).
- C6H10O: DoU=2. Could have C=O and C=C. But needs an O-H (alcohol?) and a carbonyl. But then the carbonyl would be at 1700, and the 1650 could be C=C. But would an alcohol's O-H be that broad? Maybe if it's a phenol, but the shift is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but that requires two oxygens.
- C6H10O2: DoU=2. Carboxylic acid (O-H, C=O) and a C=C. This fits. The fragment at 45 would be COOH+.
- C6H12O2: DoU=1. Can't have both C=O and C=C.

So the most likely is C6H10O2. Let me check the mass spec again. If the molecular weight is C6H10O2: 6*12 +10 +16*2=72+10+32=114. The molecular ion would be at 114. If there's a fragment at 45, that could be the COOH+ (45), so the remaining part would be C5H9 (which would be 5*12 +9=69). But 69+45=114, so that makes sense. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but then the O-H wouldn't be present. So the presence of the O-H suggests carboxylic acid. Therefore, the formula is C6H10O2.

So two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or a triple bond. The IR shows a carbonyl (one double bond) and an alkene (another double bond), which matches. If it's a ketone with a double bond (e.g., cyclohexenone), but then the O-H stretch would not be present. Alternatively, an enol, but enols are less stable. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would require a -COOH group, which would add O and H. Wait, C6H10O would have one oxygen. A carboxylic acid would be RCOOH, so the formula would be C5H11COOH → C6H12O2. But the options include C6H10O2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, but then where is the O-H? The broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group. So maybe a carboxylic acid with a double bond. But the formula C6H10O2 would be required for a carboxylic acid (since RCOOH is CnH2nO2). For example, hexenoic acid (C5H9COOH = C6H10O2). That would fit the O-H (carboxylic acid), carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), and the conjugated double bond (1650 cm⁻¹). The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 would correspond to the COOH+ ion (45 m/z). So if the formula is C6H10O2, that's possible. But wait, the options given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since RCOOH is CnH2nO2; for n=5, C5H10O2, but here the total is C6, so maybe pentenoic acid? Wait, maybe hexenoic acid would be C6H10O2. Let me check: For a carboxylic acid, the general formula is CnH2n-1COOH. Wait, no. Let's think: For a straight-chain carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH → C6H12O2. But if there's a double bond, like pentenoic acid (C5H8O2), but the options here are C6H10O2. So maybe a cyclohexene carboxylic acid? Or a substituted one. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. But esters don't have O-H stretches. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH, so likely a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the formula would be C6H12O2 for a saturated carboxylic acid (hexanoic acid), but that would have a DOU of 1 (from the COOH group). However, the presence of a double bond (from the IR and NMR) would add another DOU, making total DOU=2. So the formula would need to account for that. Let's calculate DOU for each possible formula:\n\n- **C6H12O**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But the IR shows two peaks (1700 and 1650), which could be a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. But if the formula is C6H12O, then the oxygen is either an alcohol, ether, or ketone. If it's a ketone with a double bond, that would require two DOU. But C6H12O has only one DOU. So that's a problem. Therefore, C6H12O is unlikely.\n\n- **C6H10O**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DOU. This could be a carbonyl and a double bond. For example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond, or an enone. But again, the O-H stretch suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl, that would require three DOU? Wait, no. Let's see: If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde (but that would be a carbonyl and a double bond, DOU=2). But aldehydes have a carbonyl. However, the O-H stretch would need to be explained. Maybe a secondary alcohol with a conjugated system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would require O2, so C6H10O can't be a carboxylic acid. Therefore, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol, and the carbonyl is from a ketone. But then the formula would need to account for that. For example, a cyclohexenol with a ketone? That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a dienol, but that's less likely. The presence of a carbonyl (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650) might suggest an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, cyclohex-2-enone. The formula for cyclohex-2-enone is C6H8O. But the given formula is C6H10O, which has two more hydrogens. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a substituted compound. This is getting confusing. Let's move to the next formula.\n\n- **C6H10O2**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DOU. This could be a carboxylic acid (which has a carbonyl) and a double bond. For example, pentenoic acid (CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH with a double bond). Wait, let's count: If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C5H9COOH (which is C6H10O2). That fits. The O-H from the carboxylic acid explains the broad peak at 3000. The carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹ (carboxylic acid C=O), and the conjugated double bond at 1650 cm⁻¹. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH+ ion (45). This seems plausible.\n\n- **C6H12O2**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DOU. This could be a carboxylic acid (which has a carbonyl) but no double bond. However, the IR and NMR suggest a double bond. So unless there's a ring, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, not a ring. Therefore, C6H12O2 would have only one DOU, which would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl, but then the double bond would add another DOU, making total DOU=2. Therefore, C6H12O2 can't have a double bond unless there's a ring as well, but the NMR indicates a double bond (vinyl Hs), not a ring. So C6H12O2 is less likely.\n\nPutting this together, the most plausible formula is C6H10O2. It accounts for the O-H (carboxylic acid), the carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), the conjugated double bond (1650 cm⁻¹), and the vinyl hydrogens in NMR. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the COOH+ ion.

/z 45 fragment.

Considering the possible formulas:

1. **C6H12O**: This could be an alcohol (like hexanol) or an ether. However, the presence of a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (1650 cm⁻¹) doesn't align with an ether (no carbonyl) or a simple alcohol (no carbonyl or double bond unless it's an enol, which is less common).

Wait, maybe hexenoic acid would be C6H10O2. Let me check: For a carboxylic acid, the general formula is CnH2n-1COOH. Wait, no. Let's think: For a straight-chain carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH → C6H12O2. But if there's a double bond, like pentenoic acid (C5H8O2), but the options here are C6H10O2. So maybe a cyclohexene carboxylic acid? Or a substituted one. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. But esters don't have O-H stretches. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH, so likely a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the formula would be C6H12O2 for a saturated carboxylic acid (hexanoic acid), but that would have a DOU of 1 (from the COOH group). However, the presence of a double bond (from the IR and NMR) would add another DOU, making total DOU=2. So the formula would need to account for that. Let's calculate DOU for each possible formula:

- **C6H12O**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But the IR shows two peaks (1700 and 1650), which could be a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. But if the formula is C6H12O, then the oxygen is either an alcohol, ether, or ketone. If it's a ketone with a double bond, that would require two DOU. But C6H12O has only one DOU. So that's a problem. Therefore, C6H12O is unlikely.

- **C6H10O**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DOU. This could be a carbonyl and a double bond. For example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond, or an enone. But again, the O-H stretch suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl, that would require three DOU? Wait, no. Let's see: If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde (but that would be a carbonyl and a double bond, DOU=2). But aldehydes have a carbonyl. However, the O-H stretch would need to be explained. Maybe a secondary alcohol with a conjugated system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would require O2, so C6H10O can't be a carboxylic acid. Therefore, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol, and the carbonyl is from a ketone. But then the formula would need to account for that. For example, a cyclohexenol with a ketone? That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a dienol, but that's less likely. The presence of a carbonyl (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650) might suggest an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, cyclohex-2-enone. The formula for cyclohex-2-enone is C6H8O. But the given formula is C6H10O, which has two more hydrogens. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a substituted compound. This is getting confusing. Let's move to the next formula.

- **C6H10O2**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DOU. This could be a carboxylic acid (which has a carbonyl) and a double bond. For example, pentenoic acid (CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH with a double bond). Wait, let's count: If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C5H9COOH (which is C6H10O2). That fits. The O-H from the carboxylic acid explains the broad peak at 3000. The carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹ (carboxylic acid C=O), and the conjugated double bond at 1650 cm⁻¹. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH+ ion (45). This seems plausible.

- **C6H12O2**: DOU = (2×6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DOU. This could be a carboxylic acid (which has a carbonyl) but no double bond. However, the IR and NMR suggest a double bond. So unless there's a ring, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond, not a ring. Therefore, C6H12O2 would have only one DOU, which would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl, but then the double bond would add another DOU, making total DOU=2. Therefore, C6H12O2 can't have a double bond unless there's a ring as well, but the NMR indicates a double bond (vinyl Hs), not a ring. So C6H12O2 is less likely.

Putting this together, the most plausible formula is C6H10O2. It accounts for the O-H (carboxylic acid), the carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), the conjugated double bond (1650 cm⁻¹), and the vinyl hydrogens in NMR. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the COOH+ ion. Therefore, the compound is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.

If the compound is an alcohol (C6H13O), but the formula is C6H12O. Wait, the formula given is C6H12O, which would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +12*1 +16= 72+12+16=100. If the molecular ion is at 100, then a fragment at 45 could be from breaking a bond. For example, if it's a cyclic ether or an alcohol, but the presence of a carbonyl group (from IR) complicates this. Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone, but the IR peak at 1700 would fit a ketone. However, the broad peak at 3000 might suggest an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But a ketone would not have an O-H stretch. So perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which would have a carbonyl (1700) and an O-H (broad ~3000). Then, the formula would need a COOH group. Let's check the possible formulas:\n\nIf the formula is C6H10O2, that would allow for a COOH group (which is C2H4O2). Then, the remaining would be C4H6O. Wait, but COOH is -COOH, which is C2H4O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H10O2. For example, pentanoic acid would be C5H10O2, but here it's C6, so hexanoic acid would be C6H12O2. Wait, hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH, which is C6H12O2. But one of the options is C6H12O2. However, the molecular formula options given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2 (like hexanoic acid). But the IR has a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe conjugated C=C). The presence of a double bond (from NMR) would suggest an unsaturated acid. For example, maybe a hexenoic acid. The molecular formula would then be C6H10O2. Let me check: a carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, pentenoic acid would be C5H8O2, but if it's hexenoic acid, it would be C6H10O2. So that's one of the options. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and possibly an alkene. For example, an ester with a double bond. The molecular formula for an ester would be RCOOR', which would have the formula CnH2nO2. If n=4, then C4H8O2, but here the options are C6. So for a six-carbon ester, the formula would be C6H12O2. For example, butyl acetate is C6H12O2. But then, the O-H stretch would not be present in an ester. The broad peak at 3000 would not be explained by an ester. Therefore, the O-H stretch suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be C6H12O2 (if saturated) or C6H10O2 (if unsaturated). The presence of a double bond (from NMR) would suggest the latter. So C6H10O2. Let's check the degrees of unsaturation. For C6H10O2: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation, which could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, or one double bond and one carbonyl. Since the IR shows a carbonyl (1700) and possibly a double bond (1650), that would account for two degrees of unsaturation, which matches. So C6H10O2 would fit. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like CH2=CH(CH2)3COOH. That would be C6H10O2. The molecular ion would be 6*12 +10*1 +16*2=72+10+32=114. The fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the -COOH group (which is 45). However, the molecular ion would be 114, so the base peak might not be the molecular ion. Alternatively, the molecular ion could lose the -COOH group (45), leaving a fragment of 114-45=69. But the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which could be the -COOH+ ion. Alternatively, the fragment could be from another part of the molecule. Let's check the other possible formulas.\n\nC6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl (1700) which is a double bond (C=O), so that would account for one degree. Then, the presence of another peak at 1650 (another double bond?) would require another degree, but C6H12O can only have one. So this formula is unlikely. Similarly, C6H10O: degrees of unsaturation=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. If one is a carbonyl (1700) and another is a C=C (1650), that would fit. But the formula is C6H10O. However, a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C would require two degrees. But the presence of an O-H (from IR) would suggest an alcohol or carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol with a carbonyl and a double bond, but the formula would need to account for that. For example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond? But the O-H suggests an alcohol. Alternatively, an enol (C=C-OH), but enols are usually less stable. The presence of a carbonyl and an O-H could be a carboxylic acid, but the formula C6H10O would not have two oxygen atoms. So C6H10O is less likely. The other option is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. But the IR suggests a carbonyl (1700) and possibly a C=C (1650), which would require two degrees. Therefore, C6H12O2 would not fit. So the only formula that fits the degrees of unsaturation (two) and the presence of both a carbonyl and a C=C is C6H10O2. Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at 45 could correspond to the -COOH group (if it's a carboxylic acid), which would require two oxygen atoms, so C6H10O2. The O-H stretch in the IR (broad at 3000) supports a carboxylic acid. The two strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C) would align with a conjugated system, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH (which is C6H10O2). The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would correspond to the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 would be the -COOH group.

However, if the molecular ion is intact, the presence of a -COOH group would add 45 to the molecular formula. Let's check the possible formulas:

Possible formulas:

1. C6H12O: Molecular weight = (6*12) + (12*1) + 16 = 72 + 12 +16=100. If the molecular ion is at 100, but the fragment is at 45. If the compound is an alcohol (C6H13O), but the formula is C6H12O. Wait, the formula given is C6H12O, which would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +12*1 +16= 72+12+16=100. If the molecular ion is at 100, then a fragment at 45 could be from breaking a bond. For example, if it's a cyclic ether or an alcohol, but the presence of a carbonyl group (from IR) complicates this. Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone, but the IR peak at 1700 would fit a ketone. However, the broad peak at 3000 might suggest an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But a ketone would not have an O-H stretch. So perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which would have a carbonyl (1700) and an O-H (broad ~3000). Then, the formula would need a COOH group. Let's check the possible formulas:

If the formula is C6H10O2, that would allow for a COOH group (which is C2H4O2). Then, the remaining would be C4H6O. Wait, but COOH is -COOH, which is C2H4O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H10O2. For example, pentanoic acid would be C5H10O2, but here it's C6, so hexanoic acid would be C6H12O2. Wait, hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH, which is C6H12O2. But one of the options is C6H12O2. However, the molecular formula options given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2 (like hexanoic acid). But the IR has a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe conjugated C=C). The presence of a double bond (from NMR) would suggest an unsaturated acid. For example, maybe a hexenoic acid. The molecular formula would then be C6H10O2. Let me check: a carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, pentenoic acid would be C5H8O2, but if it's hexenoic acid, it would be C6H10O2. So that's one of the options. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and possibly an alkene. For example, an ester with a double bond. The molecular formula for an ester would be RCOOR', which would have the formula CnH2nO2. If n=4, then C4H8O2, but here the options are C6. So for a six-carbon ester, the formula would be C6H12O2. For example, butyl acetate is C6H12O2. But then, the O-H stretch would not be present in an ester. The broad peak at 3000 would not be explained by an ester. Therefore, the O-H stretch suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be C6H12O2 (if saturated) or C6H10O2 (if unsaturated). The presence of a double bond (from NMR) would suggest the latter. So C6H10O2. Let's check the degrees of unsaturation. For C6H10O2: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation, which could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, or one double bond and one carbonyl. Since the IR shows a carbonyl (1700) and possibly a double bond (1650), that would account for two degrees of unsaturation, which matches. So C6H10O2 would fit. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like CH2=CH(CH2)3COOH. That would be C6H10O2. The molecular ion would be 6*12 +10*1 +16*2=72+10+32=114. The fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the -COOH group (which is 45). However, the molecular ion would be 114, so the base peak might not be the molecular ion. Alternatively, the molecular ion could lose the -COOH group (45), leaving a fragment of 114-45=69. But the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which could be the -COOH+ ion. Alternatively, the fragment could be from another part of the molecule. Let's check the other possible formulas.

C6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl (1700) which is a double bond (C=O), so that would account for one degree. Then, the presence of another peak at 1650 (another double bond?) would require another degree, but C6H12O can only have one. So this formula is unlikely. Similarly, C6H10O: degrees of unsaturation=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. If one is a carbonyl (1700) and another is a C=C (1650), that would fit. But the formula is C6H10O. However, a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C would require two degrees. But the presence of an O-H (from IR) would suggest an alcohol or carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol with a carbonyl and a double bond, but the formula would need to account for that. For example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond? But the O-H suggests an alcohol. Alternatively, an enol (C=C-OH), but enols are usually less stable. The presence of a carbonyl and an O-H could be a carboxylic acid, but the formula C6H10O would not have two oxygen atoms. So C6H10O is less likely. The other option is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. But the IR suggests a carbonyl (1700) and possibly a C=C (1650), which would require two degrees. Therefore, C6H12O2 would not fit. So the only formula that fits the degrees of unsaturation (two) and the presence of both a carbonyl and a C=C is C6H10O2. Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at 45 could correspond to the -COOH group (if it's a carboxylic acid), which would require two oxygen atoms, so C6H10O2. The O-H stretch in the IR (broad at 3000) supports a carboxylic acid. The two strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C) would align with a conjugated system, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH (which is C6H10O2). The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would correspond to the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 would be the -COOH group. Therefore, the correct formula is C6H10O2.
