To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of a Hydrogen atom for a wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861\ \mu\text{m}\) under a magnetic field \(B = 1\ \text{T}\):

1. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   The energy of a photon corresponding to \(\lambda = 0.4861\ \mu\text{m}\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J} \quad (\text{or } 2.55\ \text{eV}).

Okay, so I need to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a Hydrogen atom that has a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla and it's along the Oz axis. Also, they mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic concepts here.

First, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think that refers to the Zeeman effect, specifically the paramagnetic or orbital Zeeman effect. The energy associated with the Zeeman effect is given by E_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an orbital magnetic moment, μ is related to the orbital angular momentum. The formula for the orbital magnetic moment is μ = - (μ_B) * L / ħ, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But since we're dealing with the z-component, maybe it's μ_z = -μ_B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So the energy would be E_Zeeman = -μ_z * B = μ_B * m * B. Since B is in the Oz direction, the energy depends on m. But they mention small values of m, so maybe m is like 0, ±1, or something like that. But even so, we need the order of magnitude, so perhaps take m=1 for estimation.

Then, the transition energy ΔE for the Hydrogen atom corresponding to a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So ΔE would be the energy difference between two energy levels, which emits a photon of that wavelength. Let me compute that first. Let's convert λ to meters: 0.4861 μm is 0.4861e-6 meters. Then, h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let me calculate that. 

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 Joules. To make it in electron volts, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a visible wavelength, since visible light is around 1.5-3 eV. So the transition energy is on the order of a few eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Let's compute E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T, and m is small, say m=1. So E_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. To compare with ΔE, which is 4.09e-19 J. So the ratio is E_Zeeman / ΔE ≈ 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Wait, but let me check if I did the units correctly. The energy from the Zeeman effect is in Joules, and the transition energy is also in Joules. So the ratio is indeed unitless. Let me confirm the Bohr magneton value: yes, μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So 1 T * μ_B gives 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is ~4e-19 J. So 9e-24 / 4e-19 = (9/4) * 1e-5 = 2.25e-5, which is approximately 2e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller? Wait, 1e-5 is 10^-5, so the ratio is 1:10^5, meaning the paramagnetic term is 10^-5 times the transition energy, so five orders of magnitude smaller. Wait, no. If E_Zeeman is 1e-5 times ΔE, then it's four orders of magnitude? Wait, 1e-5 is 0.00001, so five orders of magnitude smaller. Because 1e1 is ten, 1e0 is 1, 1e-1 is 0.1, so each exponent is an order of magnitude. So 1e-5 is five orders of magnitude smaller than 1. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. But in my calculation, the ratio was approximately 2.27e-5, which is ~2e-5, so between 1e-5 and 1e-4. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5, so five orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their ratio is ~1e-5.

But let me check if I used the correct formula for the Zeeman energy. The paramagnetic term is the orbital Zeeman effect. The energy is indeed μ_B * B * m. For the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number m ranges from -l to +l. But since they mention small m, maybe m=1 is the maximum, but even if m is 1, the energy is as calculated. Alternatively, if m is smaller, like m=0.5, but m must be an integer. Wait, m is an integer, right? For orbital angular momentum, m is integer. So m can be 0, ±1, ±2,... up to ±l. But if the problem states small m, maybe m=1 is the case. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian, which is (e/(2m_e)) * B * L_z, but the energy would then be proportional to m * ħ * (eB)/(2m_e). Which is the same as μ_B * B * m, since μ_B = eħ/(2m_e). So yes, the energy is μ_B * B * m. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic coupling term is on the order of 1e-5 times the transition energy. So the ratio is approximately 1e-5, so the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

But let me just cross-verify with another approach. The transition energy for the hydrogen atom for a wavelength of 0.4861 μm. That wavelength corresponds to the blue line in the hydrogen spectrum, which is the H-beta line of the Balmer series, transitioning from n=4 to n=2. The energy difference can be calculated using the Rydberg formula: 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²). For H-beta, n1=2, n2=4. R is Rydberg constant ≈ 1.097e7 m^-1. Let's compute 1/λ = 1.097e7*(1/4 - 1/16) = 1.097e7*(3/16) ≈ 1.097e7*0.1875 ≈ 2.059e6 m^-1. Then λ = 1 / 2.059e6 ≈ 4.857e-7 m, which is 485.7 nm, which is approximately 0.4857 μm, close to the given 0.4861 μm. So that's the H-beta line, n=4 to n=2. The energy is indeed about 2.55 eV, as calculated before. So that's correct.

The Zeeman energy for B=1 T and m=1 is μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. The transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the ratio is 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, which is the same as before. So 2.27e-5 is approximately 2e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 1e-5 times the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy ΔE.

Let me recall some fundamental concepts first. The paramagnetic coupling term relates to the Zeeman effect, particularly the orbital Zeeman effect. The Zeeman energy is expressed as E_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ represents the magnetic moment. For an orbital magnetic moment, μ is connected to orbital angular momentum. The formula for orbital magnetic moment is μ = - (μ_B) * L / ħ, with μ_B being the Bohr magneton. For the z-component specifically, it becomes μ_z = -μ_B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy would be E_Zeeman = -μ_z * B = μ_B * m * B. Since B points in the Oz direction, the energy varies with m. For small values of m like 0, ±1, we can use m=1 for our order of magnitude estimation.

For the transition energy ΔE of the Hydrogen atom with wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, we use the relation E = hc/λ. This represents the energy difference between two energy levels that produces a photon with this wavelength. Converting λ to meters gives 0.4861e-6 meters. With Planck's constant h ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s and c = 3e8 m/s, we calculate E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4

I need to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE for a Hydrogen atom, given a wavelength λ of 0.4861 μm. The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla along the Oz axis, and there are references to small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Let me first revisit some fundamental concepts.

The paramagnetic coupling term likely pertains to the Zeeman effect, specifically the paramagnetic or orbital Zeeman effect. The energy of the Zeeman effect is given by E_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ signifies the magnetic moment. For an orbital magnetic moment, μ is linked to the orbital angular momentum, and the formula is μ = - (μ_B) * L / ħ, with μ_B being the Bohr magneton. Since we're considering the z-component, it might be μ_z = -μ_B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Hence, the energy becomes E_Zeeman = -μ_z * B = μ_B * m * B. Given that B is in the Oz direction, the energy relies on m. Considering they mention small values of m, it might be 0, ±1, or something similar. For determining the order of magnitude, assuming m = 1 could suffice.

Next, the transition energy ΔE for the Hydrogen atom aligns with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 μm. The energy of a photon can be expressed as E = hc/λ. Therefore, ΔE represents the energy difference between two energy levels resulting in a photon being emitted with that wavelength. Let me calculate that first. Converting λ to meters gives us 0.4861 μm as 0.4861e-6 meters. Planck's constant, h, is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light, c, is 3e8 m/s. So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6).

Let me compute that. Let's see:\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.\n\nDenominator: 0.4861e-6 m.\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. Let me check that calculation again. 0.4861e-6 is 4.861e-7, so 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.409 * 1e-18 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. Yes, that seems right. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a visible wavelength transition in Hydrogen. For example, the Balmer series lines are in the visible range, and 0.4861 μm is about 486.1 nm, which is the H-beta line, corresponding to the transition from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.\n\nNow, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy. Let's compute that. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 T. For m=1, the energy is μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. To compare this with ΔE, which is 4.09e-19 J. So the ratio is Zeeman energy / ΔE = 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 2.27e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude would be 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the units correctly. The energy from the Zeeman effect is in Joules, and the transition energy is also in Joules. So the ratio is indeed 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So that's 2.27 x 10^-5, which is approximately 10^-5. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. But to be precise, the ratio is ~2.3e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the ratio in terms of eV. Let's see. The Zeeman energy in eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. The transition energy is 2.55 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV / 2.55 eV ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So the ratio is the same. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.3e-5 times the transition energy, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5, so four orders of magnitude (since 1e-4 is four orders, 1e-5 is five orders). Wait, 1e-5 is five orders of magnitude smaller. Because 1e-5 is 10^-5, so five orders. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.\n\nBut let me check if I used the correct expression for the paramagnetic term. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy, which is E_Z = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, that's correct. But in some contexts, the Zeeman energy is given by (μ_B * B * m)/2, but no, the Bohr magneton already includes the factors. Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = -μ_B * m, so the energy is E = -μ·B = μ_B * m * B. So that's correct. So 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is 4.09e-19 J, so the ratio is indeed ~2.27e-5. So 2.27e-5 is approximately 2 x 10^-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller. But since 1e-5 is 10^-5, that's five orders of magnitude. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5, so five orders.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the comparison in terms of energy scales. Let me confirm the numbers again. Let's compute E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, B=1 T, μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T. So E_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is 4.09e-19 J. So 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 = (9.274 / 4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27e-5. So yes, that's correct. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.3e-5 times smaller, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is of the order 1e-5 compared to the transition energy, so their ratio is approximately 10^-5.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different approach. The transition energy can also be calculated using the Rydberg formula. For Hydrogen, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The transition corresponding to λ=486.1 nm (H-beta line) is from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6 / 4) - (-13.6 / 16) = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV, which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.\n\nThe Zeeman energy for m=1, B=1 T is μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Converting that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV compared to 2.55 eV. The ratio is 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, meaning the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the ratio is on the order of \\boxed{10^{-5}}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445718, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2455, prompt_tokens=513, total_tokens=2968, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

.861e-6). Let me compute that. Let's see:

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 0.4861e-6 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. Let me check that calculation again. 0.4861e-6 is 4.861e-7, so 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.409 * 1e-18 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. Yes, that seems right. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a visible wavelength transition in Hydrogen. For example, the Balmer series lines are in the visible range, and 0.4861 μm is about 486.1 nm, which is the H-beta line, corresponding to the transition from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy. Let's compute that. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 T. For m=1, the energy is μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. To compare this with ΔE, which is 4.09e-19 J. So the ratio is Zeeman energy / ΔE = 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 2.27e-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude would be 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but let me check if I did the units correctly. The energy from the Zeeman effect is in Joules, and the transition energy is also in Joules. So the ratio is indeed 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So that's 2.27 x 10^-5, which is approximately 10^-5. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. But to be precise, the ratio is ~2.3e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5.

Alternatively, maybe they want the ratio in terms of eV. Let's see. The Zeeman energy in eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. The transition energy is 2.55 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV / 2.55 eV ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So the ratio is the same. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.3e-5 times the transition energy, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5, so four orders of magnitude (since 1e-4 is four orders, 1e-5 is five orders). Wait, 1e-5 is five orders of magnitude smaller. Because 1e-5 is 10^-5, so five orders. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

But let me check if I used the correct expression for the paramagnetic term. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy, which is E_Z = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, that's correct. But in some contexts, the Zeeman energy is given by (μ_B * B * m)/2, but no, the Bohr magneton already includes the factors. Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = -μ_B * m, so the energy is E = -μ·B = μ_B * m * B. So that's correct. So 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is 4.09e-19 J, so the ratio is indeed ~2.27e-5. So 2.27e-5 is approximately 2 x 10^-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller. But since 1e-5 is 10^-5, that's five orders of magnitude. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5, so five orders.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the comparison in terms of energy scales. Let me confirm the numbers again. Let's compute E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, B=1 T, μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T. So E_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J. The transition energy is 4.09e-19 J. So 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 = (9.274 / 4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27e-5. So yes, that's correct. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.3e-5 times smaller, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is of the order 1e-5 compared to the transition energy, so their ratio is approximately 10^-5.

But let me check if there's a different approach. The transition energy can also be calculated using the Rydberg formula. For Hydrogen, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The transition corresponding to λ=486.1 nm (H-beta line) is from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6 / 4) - (-13.6 / 16) = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV, which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.

The Zeeman energy for m=1, B=1 T is μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Converting that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV compared to 2.55 eV. The ratio is 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, meaning the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller.

**Final Answer**
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the ratio is on the order of \boxed{10^{-5}}.

The energy difference can be calculated using the Rydberg formula as well: ΔE = 13.6 eV * (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For n1=2 and n2=4, ΔE = 13.6*(1/4 - 1/16) = 13.6*(3/16) = 2.55 eV. Alternatively, using E=hc/λ: hc is 1240 eV·nm, so 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV. That matches. So ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy) for m=1 and B=1 T. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, B=1 T, that's 9.274e-24 J. Converting this to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E_Zeeman ≈ 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV.

Comparing this to ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV. The ratio is (5.79e-5 eV) / (2.55 eV) ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is 10^-5.

ΔE = 2.55 eV. So 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is ~1e-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 1e-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the answer is that the paramagnetic term is about four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Wait, 1e-5 is five orders of magnitude. Since 10^-5 is 0.00001, which is five decimal places. So the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. So the order of magnitude is 10^-5.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy, then it's ~1e-5, so the order is 10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5 compared to the transition energy. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is of the order 1e-5 times the transition energy, so they differ by five orders of magnitude.

But let me check if there's another approach. The transition energy is on the order of eV, while the Zeeman energy for B=1 T is on the order of 1e-4 eV (since 1 T gives about 0.1 meV for m=1, but wait, 5.79e-5 eV is 0.0579 meV, which is even smaller).

The transition is from n=4 to n=2. The energy levels in Hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV, E2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of a Hydrogen atom for a wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861\ \mu\text{m}\) under a magnetic field \(B = 1\ \text{T}\):

1. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   The energy corresponding to the photon emitted during the transition is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J} \approx 2.55\ \text{eV}.
   \]  
   This matches the energy difference for the H\(\beta\) line (Balmer series, \(n=4 \to n=2\)).

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy):**  
   For \(m = 1\) and \(B = 1\ \text{T}\), the energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B B = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}\ \text{J/T})(1\ \text{T}) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24}\ \text{J} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy is:  
   \[
   \frac{E_{\text{Zeeman}}}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{eV}}{2.55\ \text{eV}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   **Conclusion:** The paramagnetic coupling term is about **5 orders of magnitude smaller** than the transition energy (\(\sim 10^{-5}\) times).  

**Final Answer:**  
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \(\boxed{10^{-5}}\) times smaller in magnitude than the transition energy \(\Delta E\).

Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25, divided by 0.4861e-6 gives 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.09e-19 J. To convert this to electron volts (since atomic energies are often in eV), 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy) for m=1, B=1 T. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. For m=1, that's 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Converting this to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So E_Zeeman ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Comparing the two: ΔE is about 2.55 eV, and the paramagnetic term is ~5.79e-5 eV. The ratio is 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude difference is approximately 10^-5.

Wait, but let me verify if I did the calculations correctly. Let's check the energy of the transition again. The wavelength 0.4861 μm is in the visible range, specifically the blue region. For Hydrogen, the Hβ line (Balmer series) has a wavelength around 486.1 nm, which is 0.4861 μm. The transition is from n=4 to n=2. The energy levels in Hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV, E2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV. The difference ΔE = E2 - E4 = -3.4 - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV, which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.

For the Zeeman energy, μ_B is indeed about 9.274e-24 J/T. So 1 T gives 9.274e-24 J. Converting to eV: 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So that's correct. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is about 5.79e-5 eV, and the transition energy is 2.55 eV. The ratio is indeed ~2.27e-5, so the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

But wait, the problem says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is of the order 1e-5 times the transition energy. So the orders are 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is four to five orders smaller. Since 1e-5 is 10^-5, which is five orders of magnitude. So the conclusion is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy ΔE.

Alternatively, maybe I should present both energies in the same units. Let me check again. ΔE is 2.55 eV, which is 2.55 eV. The paramagnetic term is 5.79e-5 eV. So 5.79e-5 eV divided by 2.55 eV is approximately 2.27e-5, which is 2.27 x 10^-5, so the paramagnetic term is about 2 x 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the order of magnitude is 1e-5. So the paramagnetic term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller. Since 1e-5 is 10^-5, which is five orders. So the answer is that the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is ~1e-4 to 1e-5 of the transition energy. But according to the numbers, 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, which is ~2e-5, so order of magnitude 1e-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is smaller by a factor of ~1e-5, so five orders of magnitude. Therefore, the order of magnitude comparison is 1e-5.

I think that's the conclusion. So the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 10^-5 times the transition energy, so their orders of magnitude differ by 10^5, with the paramagnetic term being smaller.
