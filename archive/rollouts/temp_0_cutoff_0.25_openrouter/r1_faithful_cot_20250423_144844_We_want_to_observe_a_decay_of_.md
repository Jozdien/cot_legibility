# Original Question

We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we use the exponential decay model. 

Given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, we know the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%. This can be modeled as:
\[ P(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \]
where \( P(t) \) is the survival probability at time \( t \), and \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. 

From the given data:
\[ 1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32 \]
\[ e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \]

We need the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this is equivalent to the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time 0:
\[ P(\text{decay in next 150 minutes} | \text{no decay in first 50 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} \]

Substituting \( \lambda \):
\[ \lambda \cdot 150 = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \cdot 150 = -1.5 \ln(0.68) \]
\[ e^{-1.5 \ln(0.68)} = (0.68)^{1.5} \]

Calculating \( (0.68)^{1.5} \):
\[ (0.68)^{1.5} = \sqrt{0.68^3} \]
\[ 0.68^3 = 0.314432 \]
\[ \sqrt{0.314432} \approx 0.5607 \]

Thus, the probability of decay is:
\[ 1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393 \]

Converting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest whole number:
\[ 0.4393 \approx 43.93\% \approx 44\% \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about decay probabilities. 

The problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, if I start monitoring the atom right away, there's a 32% chance it will decay within the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have already passed without a decay, and we want to know the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time. Wait, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? But the original information is about 100 minutes. Maybe I need to model the decay process using exponential decay, which is typical for radioactive decay.

In exponential decay, the probability that an atom has not decayed by time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. I can solve for λ here. Let me do that first.

So, 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32  
=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68  
Take natural logarithm of both sides:  
-100λ = ln(0.68)  
=> λ = -ln(0.68)/100  
Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) which is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit higher, so maybe around -0.3857? Let me check with a calculator. If I recall, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. So, λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

So, the decay constant λ is approximately 0.00385662 min⁻¹.

Now, the atom has already survived 50 minutes without decaying. We need the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). Here, event B is surviving 50 minutes, and event A is decaying in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between 50 and 200 minutes). But since we're dealing with time intervals, maybe it's better to use the memoryless property if applicable.

Wait, does the exponential distribution have the memoryless property? Yes, it does! The memoryless property states that the probability of an event occurring in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed without the event. But wait, if that's the case, then the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes would be the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. But wait, that seems conflicting with the given data. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The memoryless property says that the remaining time until decay is independent of how much time has already passed. So, if the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But in our case, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if we use the memoryless property, we can model the remaining lifetime as exponential with the same λ.

But let's verify this. Let's compute the conditional probability properly. The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is:

P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50)

But since decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to P(decay within 150 minutes) starting from time 0. So, that would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But wait, but the original data was given for 100 minutes. Let me check if this approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe we need to compute it without relying on the memoryless property directly. Let's compute it step by step.

The probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays before 200 minutes minus the probability that it decays before 50 minutes. But since we know it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes, we need to condition on that.

So, P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay before 200) - P(decay before 50)] / P(no decay before 50)

But P(decay before 200) is 1 - e^(-λ*200), and P(decay before 50) is 1 - e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the numerator is [1 - e^(-λ*200) - (1 - e^(-λ*50))] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200). The denominator is P(no decay before 50) = e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which is the same as the memoryless property suggests. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Since we already calculated λ as approximately 0.00385662 per minute, let's compute that.

First, compute λ*150: 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493. Then, e^(-0.578493). Let me compute that. e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. So, 0.578493 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator: e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^(-0.57) ≈ 0.5647 (since e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488, so each 0.1 decrease in the exponent multiplies the result by about 0.5488/0.6065 ≈ 0.904. So, from 0.5 to 0.57 is 0.07, which is 0.7*0.1. So, 0.6065 * (0.904)^0.7 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.93 ≈ 0.564. So, approximately 0.564. Therefore, 1 - 0.564 ≈ 0.436, so 43.6%.

But let me check with a calculator for more precision. Let's compute 0.578493:

First, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662, so λ = 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, λ*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.

Compute e^(-0.578493):

Using a calculator, e^-0.578493 ≈ 0.5615.

Therefore, 1 - 0.5615 ≈ 0.4385, so approximately 43.85%.

But wait, the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Let's verify if with λ = 0.00385662, this holds.

Compute e^(-0.00385662*100) = e^(-0.385662) ≈ 0.68, which matches the given 32% decay probability. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is approximately 43.85%. But let's see if we can get a more precise value.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute it symbolically first. Let's denote T as the time to decay. We need P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)] / P(T > 50) = [ (1 - e^(-λ*200)) - (1 - e^(-λ*50)) ] / e^(-λ*50) = [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). So, as before, 1 - e^(-λ*150). Since λ = -ln(0.68)/100, then λ*150 = -ln(0.68)*150/100 = -1.5*ln(0.68). Therefore, e^(-λ*150) = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) = (0.68)^1.5. Let's compute that.

(0.68)^1.5 = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) ≈ e^(1.5*(-0.385662)) ≈ e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5615 as before. So, 1 - 0.5615 ≈ 0.4385 or 43.85%.

But maybe we can compute (0.68)^1.5 directly. 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3). Let's compute 0.68^3 = 0.68*0.68*0.68. 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624*0.68 = 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432). The square root of 0.314432 is approximately 0.56, since 0.56^2 = 0.3136. So, approximately 0.56, which gives 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, so 44%. So, rounding, about 44%.

But the problem might expect an exact answer using the exponential formula. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Wait, the problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, perhaps the question is designed to use the memoryless property, but since the original time was 100 minutes, and we have a remaining time of 150 minutes, which is longer than the original 100 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, but the memoryless property would say that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But the original data is for 100 minutes. However, we derived that it's 1 - e^(-λ*150), and since we know λ from the 100-minute data, we can compute it. So, the answer is approximately 43.85%, which rounds to 43.9% or 44%.

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. Suppose we model the decay as a geometric distribution, but since time is continuous, the exponential distribution is the right model. So, I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the conditional probability formula without assuming the exponential distribution. But the problem mentions that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which suggests that it's a single atom with a constant decay rate, hence exponential distribution. So, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.85%, which we can round to 43.9% or 44%. However, let's see if the problem expects an exact answer. Let's compute it more precisely.

First, compute λ:

λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.385662/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, λ*150 ≈ 0.00385662*150 ≈ 0.578493.

Compute e^(-0.578493):

Using Taylor series expansion might be tedious, but let's use a calculator approximation. Alternatively, use the fact that ln(0.68) = -0.385662, so we can relate it.

Alternatively, use natural exponentiation:

e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 / e^(0.578493). Let's compute e^0.578493.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211. 0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.

Compute e^0.078493 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 + (0.078493)^3/6 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + 0.003081 + 0.000254 ≈ 1.081828. Therefore, e^0.578493 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.078493 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.081828 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 ≈ 1.781 (exact calculation: 1.64872*1.081828 ≈ 1.64872*1 + 1.64872*0.08 + 1.64872*0.001828 ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1319 + 0.00301 ≈ 1.7836). So, e^0.578493 ≈ 1.7836, so e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1/1.7836 ≈ 0.5607.

Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, 43.93% ≈ 43.9%, or if we need a percentage without decimal, 44%.

But let's check if the problem expects an exact answer using the given 32% probability. Wait, maybe there's a way to compute it without calculating λ explicitly. Let's see.

We know that the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (since decay probability is 32%). So, S(100) = 0.68. For exponential decay, S(t) = e^(-λt), so S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Therefore, S(t) = (0.68)^(t/100). Because e^(-λt) = (e^(-λ*100))^(t/100) = (0.68)^(t/100).

Therefore, the survival probability at time t is (0.68)^(t/100). Therefore, the probability that the atom survives until time t is (0.68)^(t/100).

Given that it has already survived 50 minutes, we want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from t=50 to t=200). The survival probability at t=200 is (0.68)^(200/100) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. Therefore, the probability that it has decayed by t=200 is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376. But we need the conditional probability given that it survived until t=50. The survival probability at t=50 is (0.68)^(50/100) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, the conditional probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = [0.8246 - 0.4624]/0.8246 ≈ (0.3622)/0.8246 ≈ 0.4393, which is the same as before, approximately 43.93%.

Ah! This is a much simpler way to compute it without dealing with λ. Since the survival probability is (0.68)^(t/100), then the conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50) = 1 - (0.68)^(200/100)/(0.68)^(50/100) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5. Which is exactly what we had before. So, this confirms the result.

Therefore, the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5. Let's compute (0.68)^1.5 precisely. Since 1.5 is 3/2, so (0.68)^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). Compute 0.68^3:

0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624  
0.4624 * 0.68 = 0.314432  
Now, sqrt(0.314432). Let's compute that.  
We know that 0.56^2 = 0.3136, which is very close to 0.314432.  
0.56^2 = 0.3136  
0.56^2 + 0.000832 = 0.314432  
So, sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.56 + (0.000832)/(2*0.56) ≈ 0.56 + 0.00074 ≈ 0.56074.  
Therefore, (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074, so 1 - 0.56074 ≈ 0.43926, which is approximately 43.93%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, 43.93% ≈ 43.9%, or if we round to the nearest whole number, 44%.

But the problem might expect the answer to be given with one decimal place, so 43.9%, or perhaps as a fraction. Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected to be exact in terms of the original percentage. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use a Poisson process approach, but since it's a single atom, it's just the exponential distribution.

Another way to think about it: the half-life. But since we don't have the half-life given, but we can compute it. The half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. But since we have λ = -ln(0.68)/100, then T_1/2 = ln(2)/(-ln(0.68)/100) = 100*ln(2)/(-ln(0.68)). Compute that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147  
-ln(0.68) ≈ 0.385662  
So, T_1/2 ≈ 100*0.693147 / 0.385662 ≈ 100*1.797 ≈ 179.7 minutes. So, the half-life is approximately 179.7 minutes. But I don't know if this helps here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use linear approximation, but that would be incorrect because decay is exponential, not linear. For example, if someone mistakenly assumes that the decay rate is linear, they might say that in 100 minutes, 32% decay, so 0.32 per 100 minutes, so in 150 minutes, it would be 0.32*1.5 = 0.48, but that's wrong because decay is not linear. However, the correct approach is exponential as we did.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be rounded to 44%.

But let me check once more. The problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So, that's the cumulative probability. Then, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, we want the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the exponential model, we found that the answer is approximately 43.9%.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes a different model, like a uniform distribution of decay time between 0 and some time T, but that's not typical for atomic decay. The standard model is exponential.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 43.9%, which is 44% when rounded. So, the final answer is \boxed{44\%}.


**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about decay probabilities. 

The problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, if I start monitoring the atom right away, there's a 32% chance it will decay within the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have already passed without a decay, and we want to know the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time. Wait, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? But the original information is about 100 minutes. Maybe I need to model the decay process using exponential decay, which is typical for radioactive decay.

In exponential decay, the probability that an atom has not decayed by time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. I can solve for λ here. Let me do that first.

So, 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32  
=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68  
Take natural logarithm of both sides:  
-100λ = ln(0.68)  
=> λ = -ln(0.68)/100  
Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) which is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit higher, so maybe around -0.3857? Let me check with a calculator. If I recall, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. So, λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

So, the decay constant λ is approximately 0.00385662 min⁻¹.

Now, the atom has already survived 50 minutes without decaying. We need the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). Here, event B is surviving 50 minutes, and event A is decaying in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between 50 and 200 minutes). But since we're dealing with time intervals, maybe it's better to use the memoryless property if applicable.

Wait, does the exponential distribution have the memoryless property? Yes, it does! The memoryless property states that the probability of an event occurring in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed without the event. But wait, if that's the case, then the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes would be the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. But wait, that seems conflicting with the given data. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The memoryless property says that the remaining time until decay is independent of how much time has already passed. So, if the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But in our case, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if we use the memoryless property, we can model the remaining lifetime as exponential with the same λ.

But let's verify this. Let's compute the conditional probability properly. The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is:

P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50)

But since decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to P(decay within 150

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the probability of an atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. According to the problem, there's a 32% chance of decay within 100 minutes from the start of observation.

To approach this, I should use the exponential decay model which is standard for radioactive decay. In this model, the probability that an atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, I can write:
1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32
e^(-100λ) = 0.68

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = -ln(0.68)/100

Calculating ln(0.68), I estimate it's approximately -0.385662. Therefore:
λ ≈ 0.385662/100 ≈ 0.00385662 min⁻¹

This is an exponential decay process which has the memoryless property. This means the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given survival for 50 minutes already, is the same as the probability a fresh atom would decay in 150 minutes.

To verify this rigorously, I should calculate the conditional probability:
P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50)

The memoryless property indicates this equals P(decay within 150

# OpenAI completion

Alright, so I need to determine the probability that the atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed during the initial 50 minutes. I know that the decay probability over a 100-minute period is 32%. If I start observing the atom immediately, there is a 32% chance it will decay in the first 100 minutes. However, since it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes and we're interested in the subsequent 150 minutes, the total timeframe from the start becomes 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. The data provided pertains to a 100-minute interval, so I might need to employ an exponential decay model, commonly used in radioactive decay scenarios.

In the context of exponential decay, the probability that an atom remains undecayed after time t is represented by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ represents the decay constant. Hence, the probability of it decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). Since the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, we have 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, allowing me to solve for λ.

So, 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32  
=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68  
By taking the natural logarithm of both sides:  
-100λ = ln(0.68)  
=> λ = -ln(0.68)/100  
Calculating ln(0.68), it should be close to the value I recall, which is approximately ln(0.7) or about -0.3567. But since 0.68 is slightly less, let me verify with a calculator. The value ln(0.68) works out to be roughly -0.385662. Thus, λ is approximately 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Therefore, the decay constant λ is roughly 0.00385662 min⁻¹.

Given that the atom has already lasted 50 minutes without decaying, we need the probability that it decays within the following 150 minutes, assuming no decay in the initial 50. This involves conditional probability. The relationship for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In this scenario, event B is lasting 50 minutes without decay, and event A is decaying between 50 and 200 minutes. Considering events interval-wise, it might be more appropriate to apply the memoryless property if it's applicable.

Does the exponential distribution possess the memoryless property? Indeed, it does! According to this property, the chance of an event occurring in the next t minutes remains constant, regardless of time already elapsed sans the event. Consequently, if this holds true, the probability of the atom decaying in the subsequent 150 minutes, given it hasn’t decayed in the preceding 50, should equal the probability of a fresh atom decaying in a full 150-minute span. But if it contradicts the provided information, reevaluation is necessary.

Oh, the memoryless property means the remaining time until decay is unaffected by elapsed time without decay. Therefore, if the atom has survived 50 minutes, the likelihood it decays in the next 150 minutes equates to that of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes. Since the original decay probability relates to 100 minutes, leveraging the memoryless property, we can consider the remaining duration with the same λ.

For confirmation, let's calculate the conditional probability accurately. The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, assuming no decay by 50 minutes, is:

P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50).

Recognizing that decay is a memoryless process, this mirrors the probability of decay within 150 minutes.

Because the process doesn\'t remember the past, so surviving up to 50 minutes, the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if we use the exponential model, we can compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let\'s check.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute the decay constant λ as we did before. Then, the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes starting from now (after already 50 minutes) is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But let\'s compute that.\n\nGiven that λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute, then 1 - e^(-0.00385662*150). Let\'s compute the exponent:\n\n0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493. Then, e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.578493) is a bit lower. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.578493. Let\'s use a calculator. e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5612. Therefore, 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388. So approximately 43.88%.\n\nBut wait, the original 100-minute decay probability is 32%, so over 150 minutes, it\'s higher. But the answer here is 43.88%. However, the problem is that the atom has already survived 50 minutes. So, is this the correct approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not exponential? Wait, the question says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If it\'s a single atom, then the standard model is exponential decay. But maybe the problem is using a different model? For example, if it\'s a discrete probability, like 32% chance to decay at some point within 100 minutes, and if it doesn\'t decay in the first 50 minutes, the remaining probability is adjusted. But that\'s not the usual model. The usual model is exponential decay with the memoryless property.\n\nBut let\'s check both approaches.\n\nFirst, the exponential model. As above, we found λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute. Then, given that the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.88%.\n\nAlternatively, if we model it as a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes? Wait, but that\'s not typical for decay processes. Decay is a Poisson process, which is memoryless. But maybe the problem is presented in a way that assumes a uniform probability? Let me see.\n\nIf the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then if the atom hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, what\'s the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? If we model it as uniform over 100 minutes, then the decay is equally likely to happen at any time within 100 minutes. But that\'s not correct, because in reality, the decay time is continuous and the probability is not uniform. But maybe the problem is a simplified model where the decay can only happen at discrete intervals? The problem statement doesn\'t specify, but since it\'s about an atomic nucleus, the standard model is exponential decay.\n\nBut let\'s suppose, for the sake of argument, that the problem is using a uniform distribution over 100 minutes. Then, the probability density function would be constant over 0 to 100 minutes, such that the total probability is 32%. So, the probability density would be 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, if the atom hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining time is 50 minutes, and the total remaining probability would be 0.32 - (0.0032 * 50) = 0.32 - 0.16 = 0.16. But wait, that\'s not how probability works. If the decay is uniformly distributed over 100 minutes, then the probability that it decays in the first 50 minutes is 50/100 * 0.32 = 0.16, and the probability it decays in the next 50 minutes is also 0.16. But if it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the conditional probability of decaying in the next 50 minutes would be 0.16 / (1 - 0.16) = 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 0.1905 or 19.05%. But the problem is asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. However, if the decay can only happen within the first 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 0. So, if we are at 50 minutes, the remaining time for possible decay is 50 minutes (from 50 to 100 minutes). Therefore, the conditional probability would be 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 19.05%. But the problem is asking for the next 150 minutes, which would go beyond the 100-minute mark. But according to this model, decay can\'t happen after 100 minutes, so the maximum time we can consider is 50 more minutes (up to 100 minutes total). Therefore, the probability would still be 19.05% for the next 50 minutes, and 0 for the remaining 100 minutes. So total probability is 19.05%.\n\nBut this is a different answer than the exponential model. So which one is correct? The problem states that "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If this is a single atom, the standard interpretation is that it\'s an exponential decay, so the 32% is the cumulative probability over 100 minutes. Therefore, the memoryless property applies, and the answer would be 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.88%. However, if the problem is using a non-exponential model, such as a uniform distribution over 100 minutes, then the answer would be different.\n\nBut since the problem mentions an atomic nucleus, which typically follows exponential decay, I think the intended approach is to use the exponential model. Therefore, we should proceed with that.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let\'s rederive the conditional probability without assuming memoryless property. The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it has not decayed by 50 minutes is equal to [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). In the exponential model, P(decay between 50 and 200) is P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200). Then, P(no decay before 50) is e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200 - 50)) = 1 - e^(-λ*150), which is the same as the memoryless property. So, indeed, the conditional probability is just the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Therefore, the answer is 43.88%.\n\nBut wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. Let\'s check if 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Since we computed λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662, then 1 - e^(-0.00385662*100) = 1 - e^(-0.385662) ≈ 1 - 0.68 = 0.32, which matches. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.00385662*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, or 43.88%.\n\nBut let me check this calculation again. Let\'s compute λ more accurately. Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Therefore, -100λ = ln(0.68). Let\'s compute ln(0.68) precisely. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3856624808. Therefore, λ ≈ 0.3856624808 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nThen, λ*150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 ≈ 0.57849372. Then, e^(-0.57849372) ≈ e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Let\'s interpolate. 0.57849372 is 0.5 + 0.07849372. The difference between e^-0.5 and e^-0.6 is 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577 over an interval of 0.1 in the exponent. So, per 0.01 increase in the exponent, the decrease in e^-x is approximately 0.0577 / 0.1 = 0.577 per 0.01. So, for 0.07849372 beyond 0.5, the decrease would be 0.577 * 7.849372 ≈ 4.53. Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, no, that approach is not correct. Let me use a Taylor series approximation around x=0.5.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula e^(-a - b) = e^(-a) * e^(-b). Let me write 0.57849372 as 0.5 + 0.07849372. So, e^(-0.5 - 0.07849372) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07849372). We know e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then, e^(-0.07849372) ≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.07849372)^2 / 2 - ... Using the first two terms: 1 - 0.07849372 ≈ 0.9215. So, approximate e^(-0.07849372) ≈ 0.924. Therefore, e^(-0.57849372) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.924 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065 * 0.024 = 0.014556, total ≈ 0.5604. So, more accurately, approximately 0.5604. Therefore, 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, so approximately 43.96%. So, about 44%.\n\nBut to get a more precise value, let\'s use a calculator. If I compute e^(-0.57849372):\n\nFirst, 0.57849372. Let\'s compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nUsing a calculator: e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5612. Wait, but when I computed with the split method, I got approximately 0.5604. Maybe the actual value is around 0.561. Let\'s check with a calculator. If I use the exponent function:\n\n0.57849372\n\ne^-0.57849372 = ?\n\nUsing a calculator: e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5612. So, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so approximately 43.88%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 43.88%. So, rounding to two decimal places, 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer using the exponential formula without approximating λ. Let\'s see.\n\nGiven that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150λ). Let\'s express 150λ as (150/100)*100λ = 1.5*100λ. Since 100λ = -ln(0.68), then 150λ = 1.5*(-ln(0.68)). Therefore, e^(-150λ) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5)) = 0.68^1.5. Therefore, the probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5.\n\nCompute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) = e^(1.5*(-0.385662)) ≈ e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5612, as before. So, 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.\n\nAlternatively, compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1 = 0.68, 0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, plus 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167, total ≈ 0.5607. So, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, the exact value is 1 - 0.68^(150/100) = 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 43.9%.\n\nBut the problem might want the answer as a percentage, maybe rounded to the nearest whole number or one decimal place. Alternatively, expressed exactly in terms of 0.68^1.5, but that\'s not a standard form. Alternatively, maybe there\'s another approach.\n\nWait, but let\'s think again. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, P(T <= 100) = 0.32. Then, given that T > 50, find P(T <= 200 | T > 50). Wait, no, the question is: 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So, starting from the current time (after 50 minutes), the next 150 minutes. So, total time from the initial start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Therefore, the conditional probability is P(T <= 200 | T > 50) = [P(T <= 200) - P(T <= 50)] / P(T > 50). \n\nIn the exponential model, this is [1 - e^(-λ*200) - (1 - e^(-λ*50))] / e^(-λ*50) = [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150), which is the same as before. So, 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but follows some other distribution, the answer would be different. But since the problem mentions an atomic nucleus, which typically follows exponential decay, we should go with that.\n\nBut let\'s check if there\'s another way to interpret the problem. Suppose that the decay probability within any 100-minute period is 32%, regardless of when you start. But that would complicate things. However, the standard interpretation is that the 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes of its existence. Therefore, given that it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is calculated as above.\n\nAlternatively, if the 32% is a one-time probability for the first 100 minutes, and after that, the probability resets or something, but that\'s not the usual case. So, sticking with the exponential model is the right approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. But let\'s see if the problem expects an exact answer. Since 0.68^1.5 is not a standard value, maybe we need to present it as 1 - 0.68^(3/2), but that\'s not a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the conditional probability formula without assuming exponential decay, but that would require more information.\n\nWait, another approach: If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, then the survival probability is 68%. If the process is memoryless (exponential), then the survival probability for 150 minutes is e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(150/100) = 0.68^(1.5) ≈ 0.5612, so decay probability is 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay is not memoryless, but we have some other distribution. For example, if the decay must happen within 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, it\'s guaranteed to have decayed. But the problem says "decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes", which implies that there\'s a 68% chance it hasn\'t decayed by 100 minutes. So, in that case, the decay could happen after 100 minutes as well. But that contradicts the initial statement. Wait, no. If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, that means that there\'s a 32% chance it decays before 100 minutes, and a 68% chance it survives beyond 100 minutes. So, the decay could happen at any time, but the probability that it happens within the first 100 minutes is 32%. Therefore, the process is ongoing, and the atom can decay at any time, with the probability modeled by the exponential distribution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 43.9%. Rounding to two decimal places, 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%. If we need to round to the nearest whole number, it\'s 44%. But the problem might want the exact value in terms of 0.68^1.5, but that\'s not a clean number. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, then the half-life can be calculated? Let\'s see. The half-life T₁/₂ is related to λ by T₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ. But we have 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So, maybe compute the half-life? But unless needed, it\'s not necessary. Since we already have λ, we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use simple conditional probability without considering the exponential model. For example, if the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then if the atom hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining probability is still 32% for the next 100 minutes? But that doesn\'t make sense because the time intervals overlap.\n\nWait, no. If we naively assume that the 32% is the probability to decay in any 100-minute interval, which is not the standard case. But in reality, decay probability depends on the length of the interval and the decay constant. So, the standard approach is the exponential model.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the 32% is the probability to decay in the first 100 minutes, and after that, the atom is no longer considered, but that complicates things. However, the problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So, it\'s a single atom with a 32% chance to decay within the first 100 minutes. Then, given that it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, what\'s the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. If we don\'t assume the memoryless property, we need to know the distribution. But since it\'s an atom, the only reasonable distribution is exponential.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. But let\'s check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes, and it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is 32%, because the original probability was 32% for 100 minutes. But that\'s not correct, because the 150 minutes is longer than the original 100 minutes. Wait, but if the decay can only happen within the first 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, it\'s impossible. So, if we are at 50 minutes, the remaining time for possible decay is 50 minutes (from 50 to 100). Therefore, the probability would be 32% minus the probability it decayed in the first 50 minutes, divided by the probability it survived the first 50 minutes.\n\nBut this approach assumes that the decay is only possible within the first 100 minutes, which is not how radioactive decay works. Radioactive decay can happen at any time, but the probability within a certain interval is given. If the problem says the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, that doesn\'t mean it can\'t decay after 100 minutes; it just means that there\'s a 32% chance it does so before 100 minutes, and a 68% chance it takes longer than 100 minutes.\n\nTherefore, if we are at 50 minutes, the atom has a 68% chance to survive past 100 minutes. But we need the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Wait, but 200 minutes is beyond the original 100-minute mark. However, in the exponential model, the atom can decay at any time, so even after 100 minutes. Therefore, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability it decays within 150 minutes starting from 50 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.\n\nBut let\'s verify this with numbers. Suppose we have a large number of atoms, say N = 1,000,000. The expected number decaying within 100 minutes is 320,000, and 680,000 survive. After 50 minutes, the number surviving is N * e^(-λ*50). Let\'s compute that. λ = 0.00385662, so λ*50 ≈ 0.1928. e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.8247. So, surviving after 50 minutes: 1,000,000 * 0.8247 ≈ 824,700 atoms. Then, the number decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is the number that decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is surviving at 50 minutes minus surviving at 200 minutes. Surviving at 200 minutes: N * e^(-λ*200) ≈ 1,000,000 * e^(-0.7713) ≈ 1,000,000 * 0.4624 ≈ 462,400. Therefore, the number decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 824,700 - 462,400 = 362,300. Therefore, the probability is 362,300 / 824,700 ≈ 0.4393, or 43.93%, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be rounded to 44% or expressed as 43.9%. Depending on the required precision, but since the original probability was given as 32% (two significant figures), the answer should also be two significant figures, so 44%.\n\nBut let me check once more. If we use the exact expression: 1 - 0.68^1.5. Let\'s compute 0.68^1.5 exactly. Since 1.5 is 3/2, so 0.68^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). Compute 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68. 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 43.93%, which is 43.9% when rounded to one decimal place, or 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nSince the original problem states the probability as 32%, which is two significant figures, the answer should also be two significant figures, so 44%.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a different interpretation. Suppose the problem is not exponential, but the decay has a constant hazard rate after the first 100 minutes. Wait, but the problem doesn\'t specify any such thing. Without additional information, the standard model is exponential.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \\boxed{44\\%}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445164, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5801, prompt_tokens=988, total_tokens=6789, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given that the decay probability of an atom within 100 minutes is 32%, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

1. **Determine the decay constant (λ):**
   The decay probability within 100 minutes is given by \(1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32\). Solving for λ:
   \[
   e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \\
   -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \\
   \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.00385662 \text{ per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate the conditional probability:**
   Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is:
   \[
   P(\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
   \]
   Substituting the value of λ:
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.00385662 \cdot 150 \approx 0.578493 \\
   e^{-0.578493} \approx 0.5612 \\
   P(\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.5612 \approx 0.4388
   \]

3. **Convert to percentage:**
   The probability is approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 44% when considering two significant figures.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

minutes). Because the process doesn't remember the past, so surviving up to 50 minutes, the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes.

But wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So, if we use the exponential model, we can compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let's check.

First, let's compute the decay constant λ as we did before. Then, the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes starting from now (after already 50 minutes) is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But let's compute that.

Given that λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute, then 1 - e^(-0.00385662*150). Let's compute the exponent:

0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493. Then, e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.578493) is a bit lower. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.578493. Let's use a calculator. e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5612. Therefore, 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388. So approximately 43.88%.

But wait, the original 100-minute decay probability is 32%, so over 150 minutes, it's higher. But the answer here is 43.88%. However, the problem is that the atom has already survived 50 minutes. So, is this the correct approach?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not exponential? Wait, the question says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If it's a single atom, then the standard model is exponential decay. But maybe the problem is using a different model? For example, if it's a discrete probability, like 32% chance to decay at some point within 100 minutes, and if it doesn't decay in the first 50 minutes, the remaining probability is adjusted. But that's not the usual model. The usual model is exponential decay with the memoryless property.

But let's check both approaches.

First, the exponential model. As above, we found λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute. Then, given that the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.88%.

Alternatively, if we model it as a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes? Wait, but that's not typical for decay processes. Decay is a Poisson process, which is memoryless. But maybe the problem is presented in a way that assumes a uniform probability? Let me see.

If the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? If we model it as uniform over 100 minutes, then the decay is equally likely to happen at any time within 100 minutes. But that's not correct, because in reality, the decay time is continuous and the probability is not uniform. But maybe the problem is a simplified model where the decay can only happen at discrete intervals? The problem statement doesn't specify, but since it's about an atomic nucleus, the standard model is exponential decay.

But let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that the problem is using a uniform distribution over 100 minutes. Then, the probability density function would be constant over 0 to 100 minutes, such that the total probability is 32%. So, the probability density would be 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining time is 50 minutes, and the total remaining probability would be 0.32 - (0.0032 * 50) = 0.32 - 0.16 = 0.16. But wait, that's not how probability works. If the decay is uniformly distributed over 100 minutes, then the probability that it decays in the first 50 minutes is 50/100 * 0.32 = 0.16, and the probability it decays in the next 50 minutes is also 0.16. But if it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the conditional probability of decaying in the next 50 minutes would be 0.16 / (1 - 0.16) = 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 0.1905 or 19.05%. But the problem is asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. However, if the decay can only happen within the first 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 0. So, if we are at 50 minutes, the remaining time for possible decay is 50 minutes (from 50 to 100 minutes). Therefore, the conditional probability would be 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 19.05%. But the problem is asking for the next 150 minutes, which would go beyond the 100-minute mark. But according to this model, decay can't happen after 100 minutes, so the maximum time we can consider is 50 more minutes (up to 100 minutes total). Therefore, the probability would still be 19.05% for the next 50 minutes, and 0 for the remaining 100 minutes. So total probability is 19.05%.

But this is a different answer than the exponential model. So which one is correct? The problem states that "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". If this is a single atom, the standard interpretation is that it's an exponential decay, so the 32% is the cumulative probability over 100 minutes. Therefore, the memoryless property applies, and the answer would be 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.88%. However, if the problem is using a non-exponential model, such as a uniform distribution over 100 minutes, then the answer would be different.

But since the problem mentions an atomic nucleus, which typically follows exponential decay, I think the intended approach is to use the exponential model. Therefore, we should proceed with that.

Wait, but let me confirm. Let's rederive the conditional probability without assuming memoryless property. The conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it has not decayed by 50 minutes is equal to [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). In the exponential model, P(decay between 50 and 200) is P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200). Then, P(no decay before 50) is e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200 - 50)) = 1 - e^(-λ*150), which is the same as the memoryless property. So, indeed, the conditional probability is just the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). Therefore, the answer is 43.88%.

But wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. Let's check if 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Since we computed λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662, then 1 - e^(-0.00385662*100) = 1 - e^(-0.385662) ≈ 1 - 0.68 = 0.32, which matches. So that's correct.

Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.00385662*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, or 43.88%.

But let me check this calculation again. Let's compute λ more accurately. Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Therefore, -100λ = ln(0.68). Let's compute ln(0.68) precisely. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3856624808. Therefore, λ ≈ 0.3856624808 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, λ*150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 ≈ 0.57849372. Then, e^(-0.57849372) ≈ e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Let's interpolate. 0.57849372 is 0.5 + 0.07849372. The difference between e^-0.5 and e^-0.6 is 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577 over an interval of 0.1 in the exponent. So, per 0.01 increase in the exponent, the decrease in e^-x is approximately 0.0577 / 0.1 = 0.577 per 0.01. So, for 0.07849372 beyond 0.5, the decrease would be 0.577 * 7.849372 ≈ 4.53. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, that approach is not correct. Let me use a Taylor series approximation around x=0.5.

Alternatively, use the formula e^(-a - b) = e^(-a) * e^(-b). Let me write 0.57849372 as 0.5 + 0.07849372. So, e^(-0.5 - 0.07849372) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07849372). We know e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then, e^(-0.07849372) ≈ 1 - 0.07849372 + (0.07849372)^2 / 2 - ... Using the first two terms: 1 - 0.07849372 ≈ 0.9215. So, approximate e^(-0.07849372) ≈ 0.924. Therefore, e^(-0.57849372) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.924 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065 * 0.024 = 0.014556, total ≈ 0.5604. So, more accurately, approximately 0.5604. Therefore, 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, so approximately 43.96%. So, about 44%.

But to get a more precise value, let's use a calculator. If I compute e^(-0.57849372):

First, 0.57849372. Let's compute e^-0.57849372.

Using a calculator: e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5612. Wait, but when I computed with the split method, I got approximately 0.5604. Maybe the actual value is around 0.561. Let's check with a calculator. If I use the exponent function:

0.57849372

e^-0.57849372 = ?

Using a calculator: e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5612. So, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so approximately 43.88%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.88%. So, rounding to two decimal places, 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%.

But the problem might expect an exact answer using the exponential formula without approximating λ. Let's see.

Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150λ). Let's express 150λ as (150/100)*100λ = 1.5*100λ. Since 100λ = -ln(0.68), then 150λ = 1.5*(-ln(0.68)). Therefore, e^(-150λ) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5)) = 0.68^1.5. Therefore, the probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5.

Compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5*ln(0.68)) = e^(1.5*(-0.385662)) ≈ e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5612, as before. So, 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.

Alternatively, compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1 = 0.68, 0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, plus 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167, total ≈ 0.5607. So, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.

Therefore, the exact value is 1 - 0.68^(150/100) = 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 43.9%.

But the problem might want the answer as a percentage, maybe rounded to the nearest whole number or one decimal place. Alternatively, expressed exactly in terms of 0.68^1.5, but that's not a standard form. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, P(T <= 100) = 0.32. Then, given that T > 50, find P(T <= 200 | T > 50). Wait, no, the question is: 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So, starting from the current time (after 50 minutes), the next 150 minutes. So, total time from the initial start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Therefore, the conditional probability is P(T <= 200 | T > 50) = [P(T <= 200) - P(T <= 50)] / P(T > 50). 

In the exponential model, this is [1 - e^(-λ*200) - (1 - e^(-λ*50))] / e^(-λ*50) = [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150), which is the same as before. So, 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.

Alternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but follows some other distribution, the answer would be different. But since the problem mentions an atomic nucleus, which typically follows exponential decay, we should go with that.

But let's check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Suppose that the decay probability within any 100-minute period is 32%, regardless of when you start. But that would complicate things. However, the standard interpretation is that the 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes of its existence. Therefore, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is calculated as above.

Alternatively, if the 32% is a one-time probability for the first 100 minutes, and after that, the probability resets or something, but that's not the usual case. So, sticking with the exponential model is the right approach.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. But let's see if the problem expects an exact answer. Since 0.68^1.5 is not a standard value, maybe we need to present it as 1 - 0.68^(3/2), but that's not a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the conditional probability formula without assuming exponential decay, but that would require more information.

Wait, another approach: If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, then the survival probability is 68%. If the process is memoryless (exponential), then the survival probability for 150 minutes is e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(150/100) = 0.68^(1.5) ≈ 0.5612, so decay probability is 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.

Alternatively, if the decay is not memoryless, but we have some other distribution. For example, if the decay must happen within 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, it's guaranteed to have decayed. But the problem says "decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes", which implies that there's a 68% chance it hasn't decayed by 100 minutes. So, in that case, the decay could happen after 100 minutes as well. But that contradicts the initial statement. Wait, no. If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, that means that there's a 32% chance it decays before 100 minutes, and a 68% chance it survives beyond 100 minutes. So, the decay could happen at any time, but the probability that it happens within the first 100 minutes is 32%. Therefore, the process is ongoing, and the atom can decay at any time, with the probability modeled by the exponential distribution.

Therefore, the answer is 43.9%. Rounding to two decimal places, 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%. If we need to round to the nearest whole number, it's 44%. But the problem might want the exact value in terms of 0.68^1.5, but that's not a clean number. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: If the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, then the half-life can be calculated? Let's see. The half-life T₁/₂ is related to λ by T₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ. But we have 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So, maybe compute the half-life? But unless needed, it's not necessary. Since we already have λ, we can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use simple conditional probability without considering the exponential model. For example, if the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining probability is still 32% for the next 100 minutes? But that doesn't make sense because the time intervals overlap.

Wait, no. If we naively assume that the 32% is the probability to decay in any 100-minute interval, which is not the standard case. But in reality, decay probability depends on the length of the interval and the decay constant. So, the standard approach is the exponential model.

Alternatively, if we consider that the 32% is the probability to decay in the first 100 minutes, and after that, the atom is no longer considered, but that complicates things. However, the problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So, it's a single atom with a 32% chance to decay within the first 100 minutes. Then, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. If we don't assume the memoryless property, we need to know the distribution. But since it's an atom, the only reasonable distribution is exponential.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%. But let's check once more.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes, and it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is 32%, because the original probability was 32% for 100 minutes. But that's not correct, because the 150 minutes is longer than the original 100 minutes. Wait, but if the decay can only happen within the first 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, it's impossible. So, if we are at 50 minutes, the remaining time for possible decay is 50 minutes (from 50 to 100). Therefore, the probability would be 32% minus the probability it decayed in the first 50 minutes, divided by the probability it survived the first 50 minutes.

But this approach assumes that the decay is only possible within the first 100 minutes, which is not how radioactive decay works. Radioactive decay can happen at any time, but the probability within a certain interval is given. If the problem says the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, that doesn't mean it can't decay after 100 minutes; it just means that there's a 32% chance it does so before 100 minutes, and a 68% chance it takes longer than 100 minutes.

Therefore, if we are at 50 minutes, the atom has a 68% chance to survive past 100 minutes. But we need the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Wait, but 200 minutes is beyond the original 100-minute mark. However, in the exponential model, the atom can decay at any time, so even after 100 minutes. Therefore, the probability it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability it decays within 150 minutes starting from 50 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.

But let's verify this with numbers. Suppose we have a large number of atoms, say N = 1,000,000. The expected number decaying within 100 minutes is 320,000, and 680,000 survive. After 50 minutes, the number surviving is N * e^(-λ*50). Let's compute that. λ = 0.00385662, so λ*50 ≈ 0.1928. e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.8247. So, surviving after 50 minutes: 1,000,000 * 0.8247 ≈ 824,700 atoms. Then, the number decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is the number that decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is surviving at 50 minutes minus surviving at 200 minutes. Surviving at 200 minutes: N * e^(-λ*200) ≈ 1,000,000 * e^(-0.7713) ≈ 1,000,000 * 0.4624 ≈ 462,400. Therefore, the number decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 824,700 - 462,400 = 362,300. Therefore, the probability is 362,300 / 824,700 ≈ 0.4393, or 43.93%, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be rounded to 44% or expressed as 43.9%. Depending on the required precision, but since the original probability was given as 32% (two significant figures), the answer should also be two significant figures, so 44%.

But let me check once more. If we use the exact expression: 1 - 0.68^1.5. Let's compute 0.68^1.5 exactly. Since 1.5 is 3/2, so 0.68^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). Compute 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68. 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 43.93%, which is 43.9% when rounded to one decimal place, or 44% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Since the original problem states the probability as 32%, which is two significant figures, the answer should also be two significant figures, so 44%.

But let me check if there's a different interpretation. Suppose the problem is not exponential, but the decay has a constant hazard rate after the first 100 minutes. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any such thing. Without additional information, the standard model is exponential.

Therefore, the answer is 44%.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

First, take the square root of 0.68, then multiply by 0.68.\n\nsqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246, so 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logs:\n\nln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662, so λ = 0.00385662 min⁻¹\n\nThen, λ*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem is using a different model. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. If the model is not exponential, perhaps a different approach is needed. However, in reality, nuclear decay is modeled exponentially, so the memoryless property holds. Therefore, the answer should be 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes a uniform probability over the 100 minutes, which is not the case in reality, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, but the problem says "decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes", which is phrased in a way that suggests it\'s the cumulative probability, which aligns with the exponential model. So I think the answer is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again. Let\'s compute (0.68)^1.5.\n\nFirst, 0.68^1 = 0.68\n\n0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246\n\nMultiply them: 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is 43.93%, so approximately 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, using more precise calculation:\n\nCompute ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.3856624808 * 1.5 = -0.5784937212\n\nExponentiate: e^-0.5784937212 ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5607\n\nSo yes, 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or rounded to 44%.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. Suppose the problem is using a non-exponential model, like fixed probability per unit time. For example, if the decay has a constant probability per minute such that after 100 minutes, the total probability is 32%. But in that case, the probability per minute would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. But this is a linear model, which is not how decay works, but maybe the problem is expecting that. However, in reality, that\'s not correct because the probability would be 1 - (1 - p)^t, where p is the per-minute probability. If we use that model, then:\n\n1 - (1 - p)^100 = 0.32\n\nSo (1 - p)^100 = 0.68\n\nTake natural log: 100 ln(1 - p) = ln(0.68)\n\nln(1 - p) = ln(0.68)/100 ≈ -0.00385662\n\nExponentiate: 1 - p ≈ e^{-0.00385662} ≈ 0.99615\n\nTherefore, p ≈ 0.00385 per minute.\n\nThen, after 50 minutes without decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be 1 - (1 - p)^{150}\n\nBut wait, in this model, the survival probability after t minutes is (1 - p)^t. So given that it survived 50 minutes, the survival probability for the next 150 minutes is (1 - p)^{150}, so the decay probability is 1 - (1 - p)^{150}\n\nBut since (1 - p)^100 = 0.68, then (1 - p)^{150} = (0.68)^{1.5} ≈ 0.5607, so decay probability is 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, same as before.\n\nTherefore, even if we model it as a fixed probability per unit time (which is actually equivalent to the exponential model when p is small, since ln(1 - p) ≈ -p for small p), we get the same result. Because in the limit of small p, the two models converge. So even if the problem is using a different model, the answer is the same. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. Let\'s compute (0.68)^{1.5} precisely.\n\nFirst, 0.68^1.5 = e^{1.5 * ln(0.68)} ≈ e^{1.5 * (-0.385662)} ≈ e^{-0.578493} ≈ 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or 44% if rounding to the nearest whole number. However, since the original data was given as 32%, which is two significant figures, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures as 44%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, using conditional probability without assuming exponential decay. Suppose the decay has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. If 50 minutes have passed without decay, what\'s the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. If the decay is memoryless, then the answer is 1 - (0.68)^{150/100} as before. But if the decay is not memoryless, perhaps the probability is different. However, without more information about the decay process, the standard assumption is exponential decay. Therefore, the answer is 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is using a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes, which is not realistic, but let\'s explore. If the decay is equally likely to happen at any time within the 100 minutes, then the probability density function is constant. The cumulative probability is 32% at 100 minutes, so the probability per minute would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. But in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the first 50 minutes is 0.0032*50 = 0.16, so 16%. Then, given that it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes would be min(100 - 50, 150) * 0.0032 / (1 - 0.16) = (50 * 0.0032)/0.84 ≈ (0.16)/0.84 ≈ 0.1905 or 19.05%. But this is different from the exponential model. However, this approach is incorrect for atomic decay, which follows an exponential distribution, not a uniform one. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, which is a cumulative probability, and the standard model for such processes is exponential. Therefore, the correct approach is the exponential one, leading to approximately 43.9%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or rounded to 44%. However, since 32% has two significant figures, 44% is appropriate. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer using fractions. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use conditional probability directly. The total time after 50 minutes is 150 minutes, but the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. Wait, but the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. However, the problem says "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes" given that 50 minutes have passed. So we need to compute the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given that it hasn\'t decayed by t=50.\n\nIf the decay process is memoryless (exponential), then this is equivalent to the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. But the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. Therefore, we need to relate the decay constant over different time intervals.\n\nGiven that P(decay within 100 minutes) = 0.32, then P(decay within t minutes) = 1 - e^{-λt} = 0.32 when t=100. Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nThen, P(decay within 150 minutes) = 1 - e^{-λ*150} = 1 - e^{- (ln(0.68)/100)*150 } = 1 - e^{(ln(0.68))*1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5} ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nHence, the probability is approximately 44%.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445423, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2743, prompt_tokens=450, total_tokens=3193, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we use the exponential decay model. The key steps are:

1. **Decay Constant Calculation**:
   Given a 32% decay probability within 100 minutes:
   \[
   1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32 \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{min}^{-1}
   \]

2. **Memoryless Property**:
   The exponential distribution is memoryless, so the remaining decay probability depends only on the future interval. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is equivalent to the unconditional probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time 0:
   \[
   P(\text{decay in 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
   \]

3. **Substitute \(\lambda\)**:
   Using \(\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.5785\):
   \[
   e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5607 \implies 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393
   \]

**Answer**: The probability is approximately **43.9%**, which rounds to **44%**.

\boxed{44\%}

minutes from start), which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). However, since the original data gives the decay probability for 100 minutes, I need to check if 150 minutes is within the same framework or if there's a different timescale.

Wait, the problem states that the original decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is derived from that. Then, after 50 minutes without decay, the remaining time is 150 minutes. The question is, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Using the exponential model, the conditional probability is [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). Let's compute that.

First, P(decay between 50 and 200) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)

P(no decay before 50) = e^(-λ*50)

Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150)

Which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0. This is the memoryless property.

So, compute 1 - e^(-λ*150). But we know that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, so e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Then, e^(-λ*150) = [e^(-λ*100)]^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5

Calculating (0.68)^1.5. Let's compute that. First, take the square root of 0.68, then multiply by 0.68.

sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246, so 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, or 43.93%.

Alternatively, using natural logs:

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662, so λ = 0.00385662 min⁻¹

Then, λ*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493

So e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check if the problem is using a different model. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. If the model is not exponential, perhaps a different approach is needed. However, in reality, nuclear decay is modeled exponentially, so the memoryless property holds. Therefore, the answer should be 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 43.9%.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes a uniform probability over the 100 minutes, which is not the case in reality, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, but the problem says "decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes", which is phrased in a way that suggests it's the cumulative probability, which aligns with the exponential model. So I think the answer is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

But let me check the calculation again. Let's compute (0.68)^1.5.

First, 0.68^1 = 0.68

0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246

Multiply them: 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607

Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is 43.93%, so approximately 43.9%.

Alternatively, using more precise calculation:

Compute ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808

Multiply by 1.5: -0.3856624808 * 1.5 = -0.5784937212

Exponentiate: e^-0.5784937212 ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5607

So yes, 43.93%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or rounded to 44%.

But let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the problem is using a non-exponential model, like fixed probability per unit time. For example, if the decay has a constant probability per minute such that after 100 minutes, the total probability is 32%. But in that case, the probability per minute would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. But this is a linear model, which is not how decay works, but maybe the problem is expecting that. However, in reality, that's not correct because the probability would be 1 - (1 - p)^t, where p is the per-minute probability. If we use that model, then:

1 - (1 - p)^100 = 0.32

So (1 - p)^100 = 0.68

Take natural log: 100 ln(1 - p) = ln(0.68)

ln(1 - p) = ln(0.68)/100 ≈ -0.00385662

Exponentiate: 1 - p ≈ e^{-0.00385662} ≈ 0.99615

Therefore, p ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Then, after 50 minutes without decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be 1 - (1 - p)^{150}

But wait, in this model, the survival probability after t minutes is (1 - p)^t. So given that it survived 50 minutes, the survival probability for the next 150 minutes is (1 - p)^{150}, so the decay probability is 1 - (1 - p)^{150}

But since (1 - p)^100 = 0.68, then (1 - p)^{150} = (0.68)^{1.5} ≈ 0.5607, so decay probability is 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, same as before.

Therefore, even if we model it as a fixed probability per unit time (which is actually equivalent to the exponential model when p is small, since ln(1 - p) ≈ -p for small p), we get the same result. Because in the limit of small p, the two models converge. So even if the problem is using a different model, the answer is the same. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute (0.68)^{1.5} precisely.

First, 0.68^1.5 = e^{1.5 * ln(0.68)} ≈ e^{1.5 * (-0.385662)} ≈ e^{-0.578493} ≈ 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or 44% if rounding to the nearest whole number. However, since the original data was given as 32%, which is two significant figures, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures as 44%.

But let me check if the problem expects a different approach. For example, using conditional probability without assuming exponential decay. Suppose the decay has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. If 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. If the decay is memoryless, then the answer is 1 - (0.68)^{150/100} as before. But if the decay is not memoryless, perhaps the probability is different. However, without more information about the decay process, the standard assumption is exponential decay. Therefore, the answer is 43.9%.

Alternatively, if the problem is using a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes, which is not realistic, but let's explore. If the decay is equally likely to happen at any time within the 100 minutes, then the probability density function is constant. The cumulative probability is 32% at 100 minutes, so the probability per minute would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. But in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the first 50 minutes is 0.0032*50 = 0.16, so 16%. Then, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes would be min(100 - 50, 150) * 0.0032 / (1 - 0.16) = (50 * 0.0032)/0.84 ≈ (0.16)/0.84 ≈ 0.1905 or 19.05%. But this is different from the exponential model. However, this approach is incorrect for atomic decay, which follows an exponential distribution, not a uniform one. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, which is a cumulative probability, and the standard model for such processes is exponential. Therefore, the correct approach is the exponential one, leading to approximately 43.9%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be written as 43.9% or rounded to 44%. However, since 32% has two significant figures, 44% is appropriate. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer using fractions. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use conditional probability directly. The total time after 50 minutes is 150 minutes, but the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. Wait, but the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. However, the problem says "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes" given that 50 minutes have passed. So we need to compute the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given that it hasn't decayed by t=50.

If the decay process is memoryless (exponential), then this is equivalent to the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. But the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. Therefore, we need to relate the decay constant over different time intervals.

Given that P(decay within 100 minutes) = 0.32, then P(decay within t minutes) = 1 - e^{-λt} = 0.32 when t=100. Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Then, P(decay within 150 minutes) = 1 - e^{-λ*150} = 1 - e^{- (ln(0.68)/100)*150 } = 1 - e^{(ln(0.68))*1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5} ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.

Hence, the probability is approximately 44%.

Hence, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).\n\nGiven that λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662, then λ*150 ≈ 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493. Therefore, e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^(-0.5) is about 0.56, but more accurately, 0.578493. Let me compute e^(-0.578493):\n\nFirst, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5 + 0.078493. e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, and e^(-0.078493) ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 ≈ 0.9245. So, multiplying 0.6065 * 0.9245 ≈ 0.6065*0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065*0.0245 ≈ 0.01486, totaling ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.\n\nBut let me check this with a calculator for precision. Alternatively, use the exact value of λ*150.\n\nGiven that λ = -ln(0.68)/100, so λ*150 = -150/100 * ln(0.68) = -1.5 * ln(0.68). Then, e^(ln(0.68)*1.5) = (e^(ln(0.68)))^1.5 = 0.68^1.5. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 is equal to sqrt(0.68^3). Let\'s compute 0.68^3 first: 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then, sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.\n\nBut the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so over 150 minutes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.93%. However, this seems higher than the original 32% over 100 minutes, which is logical because 150 minutes is longer. But the problem is that the initial data is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps the model is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not exponential? Wait, but the question states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If the decay is a single atom, then the standard model is exponential decay, so the 32% is 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but perhaps follows a different distribution? For example, if the decay is uniform over the 100 minutes, but that\'s not typical for atomic decay. Atomic decay is memoryless, so exponential. So, the answer should be 43.93%, approximately 44%.\n\nBut let me check again. If the decay is exponential, then the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But since we know that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, we can express e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Therefore, e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(1.5) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607 as before. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using conditional probability without assuming exponential decay. For example, if the decay is not memoryless, but the problem states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If we don\'t assume exponential decay, but instead a fixed probability over 100 minutes, then perhaps the problem is different.\n\nWait, but if the decay is not memoryless, then the fact that it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes might affect the remaining probability. For example, if the decay is equally likely to happen at any time in the 100 minutes, then the probability that it decays in the first 50 minutes is 16%, and the next 50 minutes is 16%, totaling 32%. But if it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the remaining probability over the next 50 minutes would be 16% / (1 - 16%) = 16% / 84% ≈ 19.05%. But this is a uniform distribution model, which is not the case for actual atomic decay. However, the problem doesn\'t specify the model, but since it\'s about atomic decay, the exponential model is appropriate.\n\nBut the problem states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If we don\'t assume exponential decay, but instead a fixed probability per unit time, but that\'s not standard. The standard model is exponential. So, the answer should be approximately 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, if the decay is modeled as a fixed probability per minute, but that\'s not how decay works. Decay is a Poisson process with constant hazard rate λ, leading to exponential distribution. So, the answer is 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check again. If the decay is exponential, then the probability that the atom survives 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But given that it has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-λ*150)] / e^(-λ*50). Wait, no. Wait, the conditional probability is [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). The numerator is P(decay between 50 and 200) = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200). The denominator is e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which is the same as the memoryless property. Therefore, the answer is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the given 32% decay in 100 minutes, then the probability of decay in 150 minutes would be 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(150/100). But that\'s assuming a geometric distribution, which is discrete, but time is continuous. However, this approach is incorrect for continuous time. The correct model is exponential, not geometric. So, that approach would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if someone mistakenly uses linear probability, they might think that since 100 minutes have 32%, then per minute it\'s 0.32% per minute, but that\'s not correct. Because decay is not linear; it\'s exponential.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the exponential model. So, given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, we can compute λ, then compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given survival up to 50 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). As calculated, this is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation again. Let\'s compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = e^(1.5 * (-0.385662)) = e^(-0.578493). Then, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, so 43.93%. Rounded to two decimal places, that\'s 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me see. If we use the exact value:\n\nGiven that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - e^( (150/100) * ln(0.68) ) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\nCalculating (0.68)^1.5:\n\nFirst, take the natural logarithm: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. Multiply by 1.5: -0.578493. Exponentiate: e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.\n\nAlternatively, if we compute (0.68)^(3/2):\n\n0.68^(1/2) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, same result.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%. The problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, so 43.93% becomes 43.9%, or maybe 44%. Alternatively, if expressed as a fraction, 0.4393 is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another way. Suppose we model the decay as a uniform distribution over 100 minutes. Then, the probability density function (pdf) would be constant over 0 to 100 minutes, such that the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. Then, the pdf f(t) = 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, the survival function S(t) = 1 - 0.0032 * t for t <= 100. But this is a uniform distribution model. However, in reality, this is not how decay works, but if the problem assumes this, then the answer would be different.\n\nIf the atom hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, then under the uniform model, the remaining time is 50 minutes. But the total probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the cumulative probability up to time t is 0.0032 * t. Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50, would be the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. But under the uniform model, the maximum time is 100 minutes, so after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 100%? Wait, no. If the model is uniform up to 100 minutes with 32% probability, that\'s inconsistent because a uniform distribution over 100 minutes would have 100% probability at t=100. Therefore, this approach is invalid. Hence, the uniform model is not appropriate here.\n\nTherefore, the only valid approach is the exponential decay model. Hence, the answer is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check once more. If the decay follows an exponential distribution with 32% decay probability in 100 minutes, then the survival probability at 100 minutes is 68%, so S(100) = 0.68. Therefore, S(t) = e^(-λt) = 0.68 when t=100. Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute. Then, the survival probability at t=200 minutes is S(200) = e^(-λ*200) = (e^(-λ*100))^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. Therefore, the probability of decay by 200 minutes is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376, or 53.76%. However, since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50). S(50) = e^(-λ*50) = sqrt(e^(-λ*100)) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, [0.8246 - 0.4624] / 0.8246 ≈ (0.3622) / 0.8246 ≈ 0.4393, which is the same as before. So, 43.93%.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is approximately 43.9%. So, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, is approximately 43.9%.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a different interpretation. The problem states: "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If this is a single observation, perhaps the 32% is a frequentist probability, meaning that if we have many such atoms, 32% decay within 100 minutes. Then, the same exponential model applies. So, the answer remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in discrete time intervals, but since time is continuous, the exponential model is the standard. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be rounded to 44% or expressed as 43.9%.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer to be 32% * (150/100) = 48%, but that\'s linear scaling, which is incorrect for decay probabilities. That approach would be wrong because probabilities don\'t scale linearly with time in decay processes.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that after 50 minutes, the remaining time to reach the original 100 minutes is 50 minutes, but the question asks for 150 minutes, which is 50 minutes beyond the original 100-minute window. However, the original 32% probability is only defined for 100 minutes, so extending beyond that requires the exponential model.\n\nAlternatively, if we model the decay as having a 32% chance in the first 100 minutes, and if it doesn\'t decay in the first 50, then the remaining 50 minutes would have a probability such that the total over 100 minutes is 32%. But this is similar to the uniform model, which is not correct. For example, if the first 50 minutes had a 16% chance and the next 50 minutes had a 16% chance, then given survival past 50, the remaining probability is 16% / 84% ≈ 19.05%, but this is only if the decay is certain to happen within 100 minutes, which contradicts the 32% probability. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid approach is the exponential decay model, leading to approximately 43.9% probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \\boxed{44\\%}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445543, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3748, prompt_tokens=904, total_tokens=4652, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we use the exponential decay model. 

1. **Decay Constant Calculation**:
   - The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so we have:
     \[
     1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
     \]
   - Solving for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \implies -\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.00385662 \text{ per minute}
     \]

2. **Conditional Probability**:
   - Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start.
   - Calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes:
     \[
     P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
     \]
   - Substituting \(\lambda \cdot 150 = 1.5 \cdot \ln(0.68)\):
     \[
     e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} = (e^{\ln(0.68)})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5} \approx 0.5607
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability of decay is:
     \[
     1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393 \approx 43.93\%
     \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

Alternatively, using the exponential model:

P(decay between t1 and t2 | no decay before t1) = 1 - e^(-λ(t2 - t1)).

Therefore, substituting t1 = 50 and t2 = 200, the time interval is 150 minutes. Hence, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Given that λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662, then λ*150 ≈ 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493. Therefore, e^(-0.578493) ≈ e^(-0.5) is about 0.56, but more accurately, 0.578493. Let me compute e^(-0.578493):

First, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5 + 0.078493. e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, and e^(-0.078493) ≈ 1 - 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 ≈ 0.9245. So, multiplying 0.6065 * 0.9245 ≈ 0.6065*0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065*0.0245 ≈ 0.01486, totaling ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.

But let me check this with a calculator for precision. Alternatively, use the exact value of λ*150.

Given that λ = -ln(0.68)/100, so λ*150 = -150/100 * ln(0.68) = -1.5 * ln(0.68). Then, e^(ln(0.68)*1.5) = (e^(ln(0.68)))^1.5 = 0.68^1.5. Therefore, 0.68^1.5 is equal to sqrt(0.68^3). Let's compute 0.68^3 first: 0.68*0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624*0.68 ≈ 0.314432. Then, sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%.

But the original decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so over 150 minutes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.93%. However, this seems higher than the original 32% over 100 minutes, which is logical because 150 minutes is longer. But the problem is that the initial data is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps the model is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not exponential? Wait, but the question states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If the decay is a single atom, then the standard model is exponential decay, so the 32% is 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Therefore, the approach is correct.

Alternatively, if the decay is not exponential, but perhaps follows a different distribution? For example, if the decay is uniform over the 100 minutes, but that's not typical for atomic decay. Atomic decay is memoryless, so exponential. So, the answer should be 43.93%, approximately 44%.

But let me check again. If the decay is exponential, then the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But since we know that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, we can express e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Therefore, e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^(1.5) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607 as before. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using conditional probability without assuming exponential decay. For example, if the decay is not memoryless, but the problem states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If we don't assume exponential decay, but instead a fixed probability over 100 minutes, then perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, but if the decay is not memoryless, then the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes might affect the remaining probability. For example, if the decay is equally likely to happen at any time in the 100 minutes, then the probability that it decays in the first 50 minutes is 16%, and the next 50 minutes is 16%, totaling 32%. But if it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the remaining probability over the next 50 minutes would be 16% / (1 - 16%) = 16% / 84% ≈ 19.05%. But this is a uniform distribution model, which is not the case for actual atomic decay. However, the problem doesn't specify the model, but since it's about atomic decay, the exponential model is appropriate.

But the problem states "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If we don't assume exponential decay, but instead a fixed probability per unit time, but that's not standard. The standard model is exponential. So, the answer should be approximately 43.9%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let's see.

Alternatively, if the decay is modeled as a fixed probability per minute, but that's not how decay works. Decay is a Poisson process with constant hazard rate λ, leading to exponential distribution. So, the answer is 43.9%.

But let me check again. If the decay is exponential, then the probability that the atom survives 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150). But given that it has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-λ*150)] / e^(-λ*50). Wait, no. Wait, the conditional probability is [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). The numerator is P(decay between 50 and 200) = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200). The denominator is e^(-λ*50). Therefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which is the same as the memoryless property. Therefore, the answer is 1 - e^(-λ*150) ≈ 43.9%.

Alternatively, if we use the given 32% decay in 100 minutes, then the probability of decay in 150 minutes would be 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(150/100). But that's assuming a geometric distribution, which is discrete, but time is continuous. However, this approach is incorrect for continuous time. The correct model is exponential, not geometric. So, that approach would be wrong.

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly uses linear probability, they might think that since 100 minutes have 32%, then per minute it's 0.32% per minute, but that's not correct. Because decay is not linear; it's exponential.

Therefore, the correct approach is to use the exponential model. So, given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, we can compute λ, then compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given survival up to 50 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150). As calculated, this is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check the exact calculation again. Let's compute 0.68^1.5. 0.68^1.5 = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = e^(1.5 * (-0.385662)) = e^(-0.578493). Then, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, so 43.93%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.

But the problem might expect an exact answer. Let me see. If we use the exact value:

Given that 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - e^( (150/100) * ln(0.68) ) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.

Calculating (0.68)^1.5:

First, take the natural logarithm: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. Multiply by 1.5: -0.578493. Exponentiate: e^(-0.578493) ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.

Alternatively, if we compute (0.68)^(3/2):

0.68^(1/2) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, same result.

So, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%. The problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, so 43.93% becomes 43.9%, or maybe 44%. Alternatively, if expressed as a fraction, 0.4393 is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check if there's another way. Suppose we model the decay as a uniform distribution over 100 minutes. Then, the probability density function (pdf) would be constant over 0 to 100 minutes, such that the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. Then, the pdf f(t) = 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, the survival function S(t) = 1 - 0.0032 * t for t <= 100. But this is a uniform distribution model. However, in reality, this is not how decay works, but if the problem assumes this, then the answer would be different.

If the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, then under the uniform model, the remaining time is 50 minutes. But the total probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the cumulative probability up to time t is 0.0032 * t. Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, would be the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. But under the uniform model, the maximum time is 100 minutes, so after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 100%? Wait, no. If the model is uniform up to 100 minutes with 32% probability, that's inconsistent because a uniform distribution over 100 minutes would have 100% probability at t=100. Therefore, this approach is invalid. Hence, the uniform model is not appropriate here.

Therefore, the only valid approach is the exponential decay model. Hence, the answer is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check once more. If the decay follows an exponential distribution with 32% decay probability in 100 minutes, then the survival probability at 100 minutes is 68%, so S(100) = 0.68. Therefore, S(t) = e^(-λt) = 0.68 when t=100. Therefore, λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute. Then, the survival probability at t=200 minutes is S(200) = e^(-λ*200) = (e^(-λ*100))^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. Therefore, the probability of decay by 200 minutes is 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376, or 53.76%. However, since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50). S(50) = e^(-λ*50) = sqrt(e^(-λ*100)) = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Therefore, [0.8246 - 0.4624] / 0.8246 ≈ (0.3622) / 0.8246 ≈ 0.4393, which is the same as before. So, 43.93%.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is approximately 43.9%. So, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is approximately 43.9%.

But let me check if there's a different interpretation. The problem states: "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If this is a single observation, perhaps the 32% is a frequentist probability, meaning that if we have many such atoms, 32% decay within 100 minutes. Then, the same exponential model applies. So, the answer remains the same.

Alternatively, if the problem is in discrete time intervals, but since time is continuous, the exponential model is the standard. Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, which can be rounded to 44% or expressed as 43.9%.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer to be 32% * (150/100) = 48%, but that's linear scaling, which is incorrect for decay probabilities. That approach would be wrong because probabilities don't scale linearly with time in decay processes.

Alternatively, if we consider that after 50 minutes, the remaining time to reach the original 100 minutes is 50 minutes, but the question asks for 150 minutes, which is 50 minutes beyond the original 100-minute window. However, the original 32% probability is only defined for 100 minutes, so extending beyond that requires the exponential model.

Alternatively, if we model the decay as having a 32% chance in the first 100 minutes, and if it doesn't decay in the first 50, then the remaining 50 minutes would have a probability such that the total over 100 minutes is 32%. But this is similar to the uniform model, which is not correct. For example, if the first 50 minutes had a 16% chance and the next 50 minutes had a 16% chance, then given survival past 50, the remaining probability is 16% / 84% ≈ 19.05%, but this is only if the decay is certain to happen within 100 minutes, which contradicts the 32% probability. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid approach is the exponential decay model, leading to approximately 43.9% probability.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.
