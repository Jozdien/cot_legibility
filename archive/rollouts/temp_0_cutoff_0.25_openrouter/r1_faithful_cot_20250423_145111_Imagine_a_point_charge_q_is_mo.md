# Original Question

Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\mu_o$ is the permeability.

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \) are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), when the electromagnetic fields began propagating from the charge's position \( \vec{s}(t_r) \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) points from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, and \( \vec{v} \) is the charge's velocity at \( t_r \).

**Scalar Potential:**
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]

**Vector Potential:**
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
\]

Here, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, and \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space. The denominator \( |\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c} \) incorporates the relativistic correction due to the charge's velocity at the retarded time.

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t due to a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a later time t, which is after the retarded time tr. The retarded time is the time when the field "left" the charge to propagate to the observation point r. 

First, I remember that for moving charges, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. But let me try to recall the exact expressions. 

The scalar potential V and vector potential A are related to the charge and its motion. Since the charge is moving, we can't just use the static Coulomb potential. Instead, we have to account for the retardation effect, which means the information about the charge's position and velocity takes time to reach the observation point. 

The retarded time tr is the time when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach r at time t. So, the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r is d = |r - s(tr)|, and the time it takes for light to travel that distance is (d)/c. Therefore, tr = t - d/c. But d itself depends on tr, which makes this an implicit equation. However, for the potentials, we might not need to solve for tr explicitly here; maybe the potentials are expressed in terms of tr.

In the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the potentials depend on the charge's position, velocity, and acceleration at the retarded time tr. But wait, the problem statement mentions the velocity v at the retarded time tr, but doesn't mention acceleration. So maybe the charge is in uniform motion? Or perhaps the acceleration term is not needed here? Wait, no, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials do include terms with velocity and acceleration. But maybe the problem is just asking for the general form, regardless of acceleration. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "in obtaining the expressions, use the notation of c, ε0, μ0". So I need to write down the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let me recall them.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

And the vector potential A is:

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

Where n is the unit vector in the direction from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So, n = (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|. 

But in the problem statement, they define d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). Therefore, |d| = |r - s(tr)|, and the unit vector n is d / |d|. 

So substituting d into the expressions, the scalar potential becomes:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( (1 - (d · v)/(c |d|) ) * |d| ) ]

But since d · v is the dot product of the vector d and the velocity v at tr, and |d| is the magnitude of d, so (d · v)/|d| is the component of the velocity in the direction of d. Let me denote that as v_parallel. So the denominator becomes |d| (1 - v_parallel / c). 

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

A = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - (d · v)/(c |d|) ) * |d| ) ]

But since μ0 = 1/(ε0 c²), we can also write this in terms of ε0 and c. However, the problem says to use the given notations, so we can leave it as μ0.

But let me check the exact expressions again. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4πε0} \left( \frac{q}{(1 - \mathbf{n} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}) |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \right)_{t_r}

A(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4π} \left( \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{(1 - \mathbf{n} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}) |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \right)_{t_r}

where β = v/c, and n is the unit vector from s(tr) to r. 

So substituting the given variables, since d = r - s(tr), then |d| = |r - s(tr)|, and n = d / |d|. Therefore, the denominator term (1 - n · v/c ) |d| is ( |d| - (d · v)/c ). 

Therefore, the scalar potential V is:

V = \frac{1}{4πε0} \frac{q}{ |d| - (d · v)/c }

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

A = \frac{\mu_0}{4π} \frac{q v}{ |d| - (d · v)/c }

But wait, in the denominator, is it |d| (1 - (d · v)/(c |d| )) which is |d| - (d · v)/c. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, since d is a vector, but in the denominator, we have |d| - (d · v)/c. So the denominator is a scalar. 

Therefore, the expressions are:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q}{ |\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c }

A(r, t) = \frac{\mu₀}{4π} \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{ |\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c }

But wait, in the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is actually |r - s(tr)| (1 - n · β ), where β = v/c. So since n = d / |d|, then 1 - n · β = 1 - (v · d)/(c |d| ). Therefore, the denominator is |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) = |d| - (v · d)/c. So that's correct.

Therefore, the scalar potential is q divided by (4πε₀ times ( |d| - (v · d)/c )), and the vector potential is μ₀/(4π) times (q v divided by the same denominator).

But wait, the problem statement says "the velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant tr is v". So v is evaluated at tr, which is consistent with the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which take the velocity (and acceleration) at the retarded time.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Scalar potential V:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c}

Vector potential A:

\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c}

But let me check the units. For V, the units should be volts (V). The denominator is in meters (since |d| is in meters, and (d · v)/c is (meters * meters/second) / (meters/second) ) = meters. So denominator is meters. Then q/(4πε₀ * meters) is (C)/(F/m * m) ) = C/(F) = C/(C/V) ) = V. So that's correct.

For A, the units should be tesla·meters (T·m) or equivalently kg/(s·C). Let's see: μ0 has units of H/m (henrys per meter). H is Wb/A, and Wb is T·m². So μ0 is T·m/A. Then (μ0/(4π)) * (q v / (denominator)) has units (T·m/A) * (C·m/s) / m = (T·m/A) * (C/s) = T·m/(A) * A (since C/s is ampere) = T·m. Which is correct for vector potential (since B is the curl of A, which has units T, so A must be T·m).

Therefore, the units check out.

But wait, in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, if the charge is accelerating, there are additional terms involving acceleration. But the problem statement doesn't mention acceleration. So maybe the problem is assuming the charge is moving at constant velocity? But the question just says "moving with a trajectory s(t)", so it could be any motion. However, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in general do include acceleration terms in the expressions for the electric and magnetic fields, but the potentials themselves (V and A) only depend on the velocity at the retarded time, not the acceleration. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me recall. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials do not include acceleration terms in the potentials themselves. The potentials V and A depend only on the position and velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The acceleration comes into play when you compute the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials, through the derivatives. So even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials at a point depend only on the position and velocity at the retarded time. Therefore, the expressions I wrote above are correct even for accelerating charges. The acceleration affects the fields but not the potentials directly. Therefore, the answer should be as above.

Therefore, the scalar and vector potentials are as I wrote, with the denominator being |d| - (d · v)/c, and the numerator being q and qv respectively, scaled by the appropriate constants.

So, to write the final answer:

Scalar potential V:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

Vector potential \vec{A}:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

But let me check a reference to confirm. 

Wait, according to Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

\phi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{(1 - \mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}) R} \right)_{\text{ret}}

\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{(1 - \mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}) R} \right)_{\text{ret}}

where R = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_s(t_r)|, which is |d|, and \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \mathbf{R}/R = \mathbf{d}/|d|, and \boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{v}/c. 

Therefore, substituting, we have:

\phi = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(1 - (\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v})/(c |d|)) |d| } = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{ |d| - (\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v})/c }

Similarly for A. So yes, the expressions are correct.

Therefore, the answer is as above.

I need to determine the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position r and time t resulting from a moving point charge q. The charge follows a trajectory s(t), and we're examining the potentials at time t, which occurs after the retarded time tr. This retarded time represents when the field originated from the charge before propagating to the observation point r.

I recall that for moving charges, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. For a moving charge, we cannot simply apply the static Coulomb potential, but must account for retardation effects, as information about the charge's position and velocity requires time to reach the observation point.

The retarded time tr is when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to arrive at r at time t. The distance between the charge's position at tr and observation point r is d = |r - s(tr)|, and light travels this distance in time d/c. Thus, tr = t - d/c. This creates an implicit equation since d depends on tr. However, I might not need to solve for tr explicitly if the potentials are expressed in terms of it.

In the Liénard-Wiechert formulation, potentials depend on the charge's position, velocity, and acceleration at the retarded time tr. The problem mentions velocity v at the retarded time, but not acceleration. This might indicate uniform motion, or perhaps the acceleration term isn't needed here. Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the general form regardless of acceleration.

Since the problem requests notation using c, ε0, and μ0, I need to express the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V is given by:

I need to determine the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t due to a point charge q that is in motion. The charge follows a path given by s(t), and we are interested in the potentials at a time t, following the retarded time tr, which is when the field actually "left" the charge to propagate toward the point at r.

For moving charges, the relevant potentials are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I should try to recall the specific expressions for these potentials. 

The scalar potential V and the vector potential A are linked to the charge's movement. Since the charge is not stationary, we can't apply the static Coulomb potential. Instead, we must factor in the retardation effect, indicating that information about the charge's position and velocity takes time to travel to the point of observation.

The retarded time tr is when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to arrive at r at the time t. Thus, the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r is d = |r - s(tr)|, and light takes a time d/c to cover that distance. Hence, tr = t - d/c. However, since d is dependent on tr, this is an implicit equation. Yet, for the potentials, it may not be necessary to explicitly solve for tr; they might be expressed in terms of tr already.

In the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the value of the potentials is influenced by the charge’s position, velocity, and acceleration at the retarded time tr. The given problem mentions the velocity v at the retarded time tr but not the acceleration. This could imply the charge is moving uniformly, or perhaps the acceleration term is not required here. Nonetheless, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials generally account for velocity and acceleration terms. It might be that the problem requires only the general form without focusing on acceleration.

The problem also states, "in obtaining the expressions, use the notation of c, ε0, μ0." Therefore, I need to note the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let me recall these:

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

The term (1 - n · v/c ) is called the Doppler factor or the retardation factor. It accounts for the velocity of the charge in the direction of the observation point.\n\nBut let me verify this. The denominator in both potentials is the retarded distance multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ). So, the denominator is |d| * (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) = |d| - (v · d)/c. Since d = r - s(tr), then |d| is the distance, and (v · d)/c is the projection of the velocity onto the direction of d, scaled by 1/c. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes this is written as |r - s(tr)| - (v · (r - s(tr)))/c. But in the denominator, it's multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ), so that's equivalent.\n\nBut let me check the exact expressions. In the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the scalar potential is:\n\nV = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q / ( |r - s(tr)| (1 - β · n) ) )\n\nand the vector potential is:\n\nA = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v / ( |r - s(tr)| (1 - β · n) ) )\n\nwhere β = v/c, and n is the unit vector from s(tr) to r.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the key idea is that the potentials depend not just on the retarded position, but also on the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, through the (1 - β · n) term in the denominator. This factor accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect and the fact that the potentials depend on the charge's velocity towards or away from the observation point.\n\nSo, in the problem statement, the vector d is defined as the vector from the point where the field was generated (s(tr)) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). Therefore, |d| is the distance at the retarded time, and the unit vector n is d / |d|. The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.\n\nTherefore, substituting d into the expressions, the scalar potential V is:\n\nV(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) ) ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nV = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential A is:\n\nA(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nA = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]\n\nAlternatively, since (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) is the same as (1 - (v · n)/c ), where n is the unit vector in the direction of d. But since the problem defines d as the vector from s(tr) to r, then n = d / |d|. So both forms are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the final expressions for the potentials are:\n\nV(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) )\n\nA(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) )\n\nBut wait, in some references, the denominator is written as (1 - n · v/c ) multiplied by |d|, so that's the same as |d| (1 - n · v/c ) = |d| - (v · d)/c. So yes, the denominator is |d| - (v · d)/c.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be these expressions. Let me check the units. The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is (N·m²/C²) * (C) / (m) = (N·m/C). Wait, but 1 V = 1 J/C = 1 N·m/C, so yes. The denominator is in meters, so |d| is meters, (v · d)/c is (m/s * m)/ (m/s) ) = m²/s * s/m = m. So the denominator is in meters. So q/(denominator) is C/m, multiplied by 1/(4πε0) which has units of N·m²/C², so overall (N·m²/C²)*(C/m) = N·m/C = V. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential A has units of T·m or Wb/m. The expression is μ0/(4π) * q v / (denominator). μ0 has units of T·m/A. q is in C, v in m/s. Denominator is in m. So units are (T·m/A) * (C * m/s) / m = T·m/A * C/s. Since C/s is A, so T·m/A * A = T·m. Which is correct for A. So units check out.\n\nTherefore, the expressions are correct.\n\nBut let me just confirm once again. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge are indeed given by:\n\nV(r, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{(1 - \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}/c) |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \\right)\n\nand\n\n\\mathbf{A}(r, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{q \\mathbf{v}}{(1 - \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}/c) |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \\right)\n\nwhere \\mathbf{n} is the unit vector from \\mathbf{s}(t_r) to \\mathbf{r}, which is \\mathbf{d}/|\\mathbf{d}|. So substituting \\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{s}(t_r), we can write:\n\nV(r, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\mathbf{d}| - \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{d}/c}\n\nand\n\n\\mathbf{A}(r, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{d}| - \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{d}/c}\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be these two expressions. The key is that both potentials have the same denominator, which includes the term accounting for the velocity of the charge in the direction of the observation point. This term can cause the potentials to be different from the static case even if the charge is moving at constant velocity, which is interesting.\n\nTherefore, the scalar potential V and vector potential A at position r and time t due to a moving charge q are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials as above. Since the problem doesn't mention acceleration, but just velocity at the retarded time, these expressions are correct even if the charge is accelerating, as long as we use the velocity at the retarded time. However, if the charge is accelerating, there would be additional terms in the electric and magnetic fields, but the potentials themselves as given here are still valid. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials do not include acceleration in the potentials themselves. The acceleration comes into play when computing the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials. The potentials themselves only depend on the position and velocity at the retarded time. So even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials are still given by these expressions. The acceleration affects the derivatives of the potentials when calculating E and B. So the answer here is correct regardless of acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is as above. Let me just write them in LaTeX notation.\n\nScalar potential V:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}| - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}/c}\n\nVector potential \\vec{A}:\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}| - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}/c}\n\nWhere \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r), and t_r is the retarded time. The problem states that t > t_r, which is necessary for the causality, as the potentials at time t depend on the charge's state at the earlier time t_r.\n\nSo these are the expressions.

To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), which is the time when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach the observation point \( \vec{r} \) at time \( t \). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Retarded Time and Distance**: The retarded time \( t_r \) is defined such that \( t_r = t - \frac{|\vec{d}|}{c} \), where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) is the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

2. **Velocity Factor**: The velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge at the retarded time \( t_r \) introduces a Doppler factor in the denominator of the potentials. This factor is \( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|} \), which simplifies to \( |\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c} \).

3. **Scalar Potential**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given by:
   \[
   V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
   \]

4. **Vector Potential**: The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is given by:
   \[
   \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
   \]

These expressions account for the retarded position and velocity of the charge, ensuring the correct relativistic formulation of the potentials.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
\]
where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). These are the \boxed{Lienard-Wiechert potentials} for a moving point charge.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ntial A is:

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

Here, n is the unit vector in the direction from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r, so n = (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|. The term (1 - n · v/c ) is called the Doppler factor or the retardation factor. It accounts for the velocity of the charge in the direction of the observation point.

But let me verify this. The denominator in both potentials is the retarded distance multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ). So, the denominator is |d| * (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) = |d| - (v · d)/c. Since d = r - s(tr), then |d| is the distance, and (v · d)/c is the projection of the velocity onto the direction of d, scaled by 1/c. 

Alternatively, sometimes this is written as |r - s(tr)| - (v · (r - s(tr)))/c. But in the denominator, it's multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ), so that's equivalent.

But let me check the exact expressions. In the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q / ( |r - s(tr)| (1 - β · n) ) )

and the vector potential is:

A = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v / ( |r - s(tr)| (1 - β · n) ) )

where β = v/c, and n is the unit vector from s(tr) to r.

Yes, that seems right. So the key idea is that the potentials depend not just on the retarded position, but also on the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, through the (1 - β · n) term in the denominator. This factor accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect and the fact that the potentials depend on the charge's velocity towards or away from the observation point.

So, in the problem statement, the vector d is defined as the vector from the point where the field was generated (s(tr)) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). Therefore, |d| is the distance at the retarded time, and the unit vector n is d / |d|. The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.

Therefore, substituting d into the expressions, the scalar potential V is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) ) ]

Which can be written as:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

A = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]

Alternatively, since (1 - (v · d)/(c |d| )) is the same as (1 - (v · n)/c ), where n is the unit vector in the direction of d. But since the problem defines d as the vector from s(tr) to r, then n = d / |d|. So both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the final expressions for the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) )

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v / ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) )

But wait, in some references, the denominator is written as (1 - n · v/c ) multiplied by |d|, so that's the same as |d| (1 - n · v/c ) = |d| - (v · d)/c. So yes, the denominator is |d| - (v · d)/c.

Therefore, the answer should be these expressions. Let me check the units. The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is (N·m²/C²) * (C) / (m) = (N·m/C). Wait, but 1 V = 1 J/C = 1 N·m/C, so yes. The denominator is in meters, so |d| is meters, (v · d)/c is (m/s * m)/ (m/s) ) = m²/s * s/m = m. So the denominator is in meters. So q/(denominator) is C/m, multiplied by 1/(4πε0) which has units of N·m²/C², so overall (N·m²/C²)*(C/m) = N·m/C = V. Correct.

Similarly, the vector potential A has units of T·m or Wb/m. The expression is μ0/(4π) * q v / (denominator). μ0 has units of T·m/A. q is in C, v in m/s. Denominator is in m. So units are (T·m/A) * (C * m/s) / m = T·m/A * C/s. Since C/s is A, so T·m/A * A = T·m. Which is correct for A. So units check out.

Therefore, the expressions are correct.

But let me just confirm once again. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge are indeed given by:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{(1 - \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c) |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \right)

and

\mathbf{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{(1 - \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}/c) |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}(t_r)|} \right)

where \mathbf{n} is the unit vector from \mathbf{s}(t_r) to \mathbf{r}, which is \mathbf{d}/|\mathbf{d}|. So substituting \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}(t_r), we can write:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}/c}

and

\mathbf{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{d}| - \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}/c}

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be these two expressions. The key is that both potentials have the same denominator, which includes the term accounting for the velocity of the charge in the direction of the observation point. This term can cause the potentials to be different from the static case even if the charge is moving at constant velocity, which is interesting.

Therefore, the scalar potential V and vector potential A at position r and time t due to a moving charge q are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials as above. Since the problem doesn't mention acceleration, but just velocity at the retarded time, these expressions are correct even if the charge is accelerating, as long as we use the velocity at the retarded time. However, if the charge is accelerating, there would be additional terms in the electric and magnetic fields, but the potentials themselves as given here are still valid. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials do not include acceleration in the potentials themselves. The acceleration comes into play when computing the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials. The potentials themselves only depend on the position and velocity at the retarded time. So even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials are still given by these expressions. The acceleration affects the derivatives of the potentials when calculating E and B. So the answer here is correct regardless of acceleration.

Therefore, the final answer is as above. Let me just write them in LaTeX notation.

Scalar potential V:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}

Vector potential \vec{A}:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}

Where \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r), and t_r is the retarded time. The problem states that t > t_r, which is necessary for the causality, as the potentials at time t depend on the charge's state at the earlier time t_r.

So these are the expressions. Let me check once more for any possible mistakes. For example, sometimes the denominator is written as |d| (1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}/c), which is the same as |d| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c, since \hat{d} = \vec{d}/|d|. So yes, that's equivalent. Therefore, the answer is correct.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c}
\]
where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). These are the \boxed{Lienard-Wiechert potentials} for a moving point charge.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \), due to a moving point charge \( q \) following trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), are given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These account for the retarded time \( t_r \), when the electromagnetic influence left the charge to arrive at \( \vec{r} \) at time \( t \). The potentials depend on the charge's position \( \vec{s}(t_r) \), velocity \( \vec{v} = \dot{\vec{s}}(t_r) \), and the displacement vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \).

### Scalar Potential:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \left[ \frac{q}{\left( |\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \right) \right)} \right]
\]
### Vector Potential:
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \frac{q \vec{v}}{\left( |\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \right) \right)} \right]
\]

**Key terms:**
- \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \): Displacement from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.
- \( \hat{d} = \vec{d}/|\vec{d}| \): Unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \).
- \( \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d} \): Component of the charge's velocity (at \( t_r \)) along \( \vec{d} \).
- The factor \( 1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}/c \) accounts for relativistic effects due to the charge's motion.

These expressions are valid for \( t > t_r \), where \( t_r = t - |\vec{d}|/c \). The potentials depend on the charge's state (position and velocity) at the retarded time \( t_r \), ensuring causality in electromagnetic field propagation.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

A is (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

Here, n is the unit vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, so n = (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|. The denominator includes the term (1 - n · v/c), which accounts for the Doppler-like factor due to the charge's velocity.

Wait, but in the problem statement, they define d as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point. So d = r - s(tr). Therefore, |d| is the distance, and the unit vector n is d/|d|. So substituting d into the potentials:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( (1 - (d · v)/(c |d|) ) |d| ) ]

But d · v is the dot product of the displacement vector and velocity. Alternatively, since d is the vector from s(tr) to r, and v is the velocity at tr, then (d · v) is the component of velocity toward the observation point. The term (1 - (d · v)/(c |d|)) can be written as (1 - (d̂ · v)/c), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q ) / [ |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

A = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v ) / [ |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) ]

But since μ0 = 1/(ε0 c²), we can also express A in terms of ε0. However, the problem asks to use μ0, so we should keep it as μ0.

But let me verify the Liénard-Wiechert expressions again. The standard expressions are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( (1 - β · n ) R ) ]_ret

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - β · n ) R ) ]_ret

Where β = v/c, n is the unit vector from the retarded position to the field point, and R is the distance |r - s(tr)|, which is |d| here.

So substituting the variables as per the problem:

d = r - s(tr)

R = |d|

n = d / R

Therefore, substituting into the potentials:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / ( R (1 - (v · d)/(c R) ) ) ]

But since v · d = v · (r - s(tr)) evaluated at tr. However, since d is the vector from s(tr) to r, and v is the velocity of the charge at tr, then (v · d) is the dot product of the velocity and the displacement vector.

So the denominator is R (1 - (v · d)/(c R)) = R - (v · d)/c. But this is equivalent to R (1 - (v · n)/c) since n = d/R. So both forms are equivalent.

Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( R (1 - (v · n)/c ) ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( R (1 - (v · n)/c ) ) ]

But since μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1, we can also write A in terms of V: A = (V/c²) v, but the problem wants the answer in terms of μ₀, so we should use the expression with μ₀.

Therefore, the final expressions are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( |d| (1 - (d̂ · v)/c ) ) ]

Where d is the vector from the retarded position s(tr) to the observation point r, d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d, and v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.

The problem statement defines d as the vector from the point where the field was generated (s(tr)) to the observation point (r), so that's exactly our d. Therefore, the answer should be expressed in terms of d, v, c, ε₀, μ₀, and q.

So putting it all together, the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t and position r are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which account for the retarded time and the velocity-dependent terms. Since the charge is moving, the potentials depend not just on the distance |d| but also on the component of the charge's velocity toward the observation point, which modifies the effective distance by the factor (1 - (d̂ · v)/c). This factor can be thought of as a Doppler shift effect, compressing or expanding the potential depending on the charge's motion relative to the observation point.

Therefore, the final expressions are as above. Let me check units. For V, the units should be volts (N·m/C). The standard Coulomb potential is q/(4πε₀ r), which has the right units. The denominator here is |d| multiplied by (1 - (d̂ · v)/c), which is dimensionless, so the units remain correct. Similarly, for A, the units should be T·m or kg/(C·s). The term μ₀ q v / (4π |d| (1 - ... )) would have units (H/m) * C * (m/s) / m = (H·C)/(s·m). Since H is Wb/A = (V·s)/A, so substituting, (V·s/A * C)/(s·m) = (V·C)/(A·m). Since V=J/C and A=C/s, so (J/C * C)/( (C/s) * m ) = (J)/( (C/s) * m ) = (N·m)/( (C/s) * m ) = N/(C/s) = N·s/C. But N·s is kg·m/s, so kg·m/(C·s). Hmm, but the unit for A is kg/(C·s). Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the units check out. Alternatively, since A is in Tesla·meter (T·m), and T is kg/(s²·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s²·A). But maybe I need not get bogged down here. The key is that the structure of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is standard, and the problem is asking for those expressions.

Therefore, the answer should be the Liénard-Wiechert potentials expressed in terms of d, v, c, ε₀, μ₀, and q. The problem does not mention acceleration, so even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials would still depend on velocity at the retarded time. Wait, but in the full Liénard-Wiechert potentials, there are terms that depend on acceleration for the fields, but the potentials themselves only depend on velocity. Wait, no, the potentials themselves do not have explicit acceleration terms. The acceleration comes into play when calculating the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials. So even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials at a point are determined by the position and velocity at the retarded time, not the acceleration. Therefore, the expressions given here are correct regardless of acceleration.

Therefore, the scalar and vector potentials are as derived above.

The standard expression is:\n\nA(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr\n\nHere, n is the unit vector in the direction from the charge\'s retarded position to the field point r. So, n = (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|. The term (1 - n · v/c ) is a Doppler-like factor that accounts for the velocity\'s component in the direction of the observation point. This factor arises due to the retardation effect and the motion of the charge.\n\nBut let me verify this. The denominator in both potentials is the retarded distance multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ).

But since d is a vector, d · v would be |d| |v| cosθ, which is |d| (n · v). So, (d - (d · v)/c) = |d| (1 - (n · v)/c ).

So, \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r). Therefore, |\\vec{d}| = d, and \\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d. So, substituting that in, we can write:\n\nV(r, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/(c d)) d} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right)\n\nSimilarly for A:\n\n\\vec{A}(r, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right)\n\nBut both forms are equivalent. The first form factors out d in the denominator, while the second combines them. Depending on the notation, either is acceptable. The problem mentions \\vec{d} as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, so using \\vec{d} in the expression is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the scalar potential is:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}| (1 - (\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c)}\n\nBut since \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r), and |\\vec{d}| = d, and \\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d, so \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / d. Therefore, the denominator can be written as d (1 - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/(c d)) = d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c. So, the scalar potential can also be written as:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is:\n\n\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}\n\nBut both forms are correct. The first form with the (1 - n · v/c ) factor is perhaps more standard. Let me check a reference.\n\nIn standard textbooks like Griffiths\' "Introduction to Electrodynamics," the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are presented as:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{(\\mathcal{R} c - \\vec{\\mathcal{R}} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q c \\vec{v}}{(\\mathcal{R} c - \\vec{\\mathcal{R}} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\n\nWhere \\vec{\\mathcal{R}} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r) and \\mathcal{R} = |\\vec{\\mathcal{R}}|. So, substituting \\vec{\\mathcal{R}} as \\vec{d}, then:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q c}{c d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}\n\nWhich matches the second form. Similarly, the vector potential is:\n\n\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q c \\vec{v}}{c d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}\n\nTherefore, both forms are equivalent. The key is that the denominator is the retarded distance adjusted by the projection of the velocity onto the direction of the observation point. This term accounts for the Doppler shift effect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nScalar potential V:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) |\\vec{d}|} \\right]\n\nVector potential \\vec{A}:\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) |\\vec{d}|} \\right]\n\nAlternatively, using \\vec{d}:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}| - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}| - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}\n\nEither form is acceptable, but since the problem defines \\vec{d} as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, using \\vec{d} in the expression is appropriate. The key is to have the denominator include the term that subtracts the component of the velocity in the direction of \\vec{d} scaled by 1/c.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be presented in terms of \\vec{d}, with the denominator as |\\vec{d}|(1 - (\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c) or equivalently |\\vec{d}| - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c. The problem statement uses the notation tr for the retarded time, and the potentials are evaluated at time t > tr. The velocity \\vec{v} is given as the velocity at the retarded time tr. So, all variables are as defined in the problem.\n\nHence, the scalar and vector potentials are as derived above. Let me check once more for any possible mistakes. For example, the units: V should be in volts (C/(F·m)), and A in tesla·meters (T·m) or equivalently (H·A/m). The expressions given have the correct units when considering the constants ε0 and μ0.\n\nYes, for V: [1/(ε0)] * [q]/[distance] gives the correct unit for electric potential. For A: [μ0] * [q v]/[distance] gives the correct unit for vector potential (since μ0 has units of H/m, and H is Wb/A, so μ0 q v / distance is (H/m)(C)(m/s)/m = (Wb/(A·m))(C·m/s)/m = (T·m/A)(C·m/s)/m. Since C/s is A, so T·m/A * A /m = T. But vector potential is in T·m, so perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, let\'s see:\n\nThe unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m) or equivalently Weber per meter (Wb/m). Let\'s check:\n\nμ0 has units of H/m (henry per meter). Henry is Wb/A, so μ0 is Wb/(A·m). The term qv has units of C·m/s. The denominator is meters. So:\n\nμ0 * (q v) / (distance) has units of (Wb/(A·m)) * (C·m/s) / m = (Wb/(A·m)) * (C/s) * (m/m) = (Wb/(A·m)) * A = Wb/m = T·m²/m = T·m. Which is the correct unit for vector potential (since A is in T·m). So yes, the units check out.\n\nTherefore, the expressions are correct. The answer is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials as written above.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe scalar potential \\( V \\) and vector potential \\( \\vec{A} \\) at time \\( t \\) and position \\( \\vec{r} \\) are given by:\n\\[\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) |\\vec{d}|}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) |\\vec{d}|}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r) \\), \\( \\hat{d} \\) is the unit vector in the direction of \\( \\vec{d} \\), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \\( t_r \\).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445447, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3873, prompt_tokens=679, total_tokens=4552, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \) are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), which is the time when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach the observation point at time \( t \). The key expressions are derived as follows:

1. **Scalar Potential \( V \)**:
   \[
   V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|}
   \]
   where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, \( \hat{d} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time \( t_r \).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A} \)**:
   \[
   \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|}
   \]
   Here, the same retarded quantities \( \vec{d} \), \( \hat{d} \), and \( \vec{v} \) are used, with \( \mu_0 \) being the permeability of free space.

These expressions include the factor \( (1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) \) in the denominator, which accounts for the Doppler-like effect due to the charge's velocity relative to the observation point. The potentials are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \), ensuring causality by considering the finite speed of light \( c \).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:

Well, A is related to V through the velocity. The standard expression is:

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) ] evaluated at tr

Here, n is the unit vector in the direction from the charge's retarded position to the field point r. So, n = (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|. The term (1 - n · v/c ) is a Doppler-like factor that accounts for the velocity's component in the direction of the observation point. This factor arises due to the retardation effect and the motion of the charge.

But let me verify this. The denominator in both potentials is the retarded distance multiplied by (1 - n · v/c ). The numerator for V is q, and for A is qv. The constants are 1/(4πε0) for V and μ0/(4π) for A. Since μ0ε0 = 1/c², there's a relationship between the two constants.

Alternatively, sometimes the potentials are written with the denominator as d(1 - n · v/c ), where d is |r - s(tr)|. So, putting it all together, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q ) / [ d (1 - (n · v)/c ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v ) / [ d (1 - (n · v)/c ) ]

Here, d = |r - s(tr)|, and n is the unit vector in the direction of d = r - s(tr). The velocity v is evaluated at the retarded time tr.

But let me check if there's a different convention. For example, sometimes the denominator is written as (d - (d · v)/c). But since d is a vector, d · v would be |d| |v| cosθ, which is |d| (n · v). So, (d - (d · v)/c) = |d| (1 - (n · v)/c ). Therefore, the denominator is indeed d (1 - n · v/c ), where d is the magnitude.

Therefore, the expressions I wrote above should be correct.

But let me also recall that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the retarded potentials, considering the charge's motion. The key idea is that the potential at (r, t) is determined by the charge's state at the retarded time tr, but adjusted by the factor (1 - n · v/c ) in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that if the charge is moving towards the observer, the effective distance is contracted, leading to a stronger potential.

So, to summarize:

Scalar potential V(r, t) is given by:

V = (1/(4πε0)) * [ q / (d (1 - (n · v)/c )) ]

Vector potential A(r, t) is given by:

A = (μ0/(4π)) * [ q v / (d (1 - (n · v)/c )) ]

Where:

- d = |r - s(tr)| is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.

- n = (r - s(tr))/d is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point.

- v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.

- c is the speed of light.

- ε0 is the permittivity of free space.

- μ0 is the permeability of free space.

These expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. They are exact solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials due to a moving charge, considering relativistic effects. The (1 - n · v/c ) term in the denominator is crucial as it leads to effects like the Doppler shift in the potentials and fields.

Therefore, the answer should be these expressions. Let me check if there's any missing component. For example, if the charge is accelerating, there are additional terms in the potentials. But the problem statement mentions only the velocity v at the retarded time tr. So perhaps the acceleration is zero, or maybe the problem is only asking for the velocity-dependent terms, not the acceleration-dependent ones. However, the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials include both velocity and acceleration contributions. Wait, no. Wait, the scalar and vector potentials themselves do not have explicit acceleration terms. The acceleration comes into play when you compute the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials, through the derivatives. The potentials themselves depend only on the position and velocity at the retarded time. Let me confirm.

Looking up in my mind, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε0)) * ( q / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) )

A(r, t) = (μ0/(4π)) * ( q v / ( (1 - n · v/c ) * |r - s(tr)| ) )

Yes, these are the potentials. The acceleration terms come into the electric field when you take the derivatives of these potentials. The potentials themselves are only dependent on the velocity at the retarded time. So even if the charge is accelerating, the potentials are still given by these expressions, with v evaluated at tr, and the acceleration affects the fields when you compute E and B.

Therefore, the answer is as above. The problem statement does not mention acceleration, so we can safely present these expressions.

So, to write the final answer:

The scalar potential V at position r and time t is:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)|} \right)

Similarly, the vector potential A is:

\vec{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)|} \right)

But in the problem statement, the vector from the retarded position to the observation point is called d. So, \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r). Therefore, |\vec{d}| = d, and \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d. So, substituting that in, we can write:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{(1 - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/(c d)) d} \right) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c} \right)

Similarly for A:

\vec{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c} \right)

But both forms are equivalent. The first form factors out d in the denominator, while the second combines them. Depending on the notation, either is acceptable. The problem mentions \vec{d} as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, so using \vec{d} in the expression is appropriate.

Therefore, the scalar potential is:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| (1 - (\hat{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c)}

But since \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r), and |\vec{d}| = d, and \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d, so \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v} = (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) / d. Therefore, the denominator can be written as d (1 - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/(c d)) = d - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c. So, the scalar potential can also be written as:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{d - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c}

Similarly, the vector potential is:

\vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c}

But both forms are correct. The first form with the (1 - n · v/c ) factor is perhaps more standard. Let me check a reference.

In standard textbooks like Griffiths' "Introduction to Electrodynamics," the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are presented as:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{(\mathcal{R} c - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})}

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q c \vec{v}}{(\mathcal{R} c - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})}

Where \vec{\mathcal{R}} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) and \mathcal{R} = |\vec{\mathcal{R}}|. So, substituting \vec{\mathcal{R}} as \vec{d}, then:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{c d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{d - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c}

Which matches the second form. Similarly, the vector potential is:

\vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q c \vec{v}}{c d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c}

Therefore, both forms are equivalent. The key is that the denominator is the retarded distance adjusted by the projection of the velocity onto the direction of the observation point. This term accounts for the Doppler shift effect.

Therefore, the answer is:

Scalar potential V:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{q}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|} \right]

Vector potential \vec{A}:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \frac{q \vec{v}}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|} \right]

Alternatively, using \vec{d}:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c}

Either form is acceptable, but since the problem defines \vec{d} as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, using \vec{d} in the expression is appropriate. The key is to have the denominator include the term that subtracts the component of the velocity in the direction of \vec{d} scaled by 1/c.

Therefore, the final answer should be presented in terms of \vec{d}, with the denominator as |\vec{d}|(1 - (\hat{d} \cdot \vec{v})/c) or equivalently |\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c. The problem statement uses the notation tr for the retarded time, and the potentials are evaluated at time t > tr. The velocity \vec{v} is given as the velocity at the retarded time tr. So, all variables are as defined in the problem.

Hence, the scalar and vector potentials are as derived above. Let me check once more for any possible mistakes. For example, the units: V should be in volts (C/(F·m)), and A in tesla·meters (T·m) or equivalently (H·A/m). The expressions given have the correct units when considering the constants ε0 and μ0.

Yes, for V: [1/(ε0)] * [q]/[distance] gives the correct unit for electric potential. For A: [μ0] * [q v]/[distance] gives the correct unit for vector potential (since μ0 has units of H/m, and H is Wb/A, so μ0 q v / distance is (H/m)(C)(m/s)/m = (Wb/(A·m))(C·m/s)/m = (T·m/A)(C·m/s)/m. Since C/s is A, so T·m/A * A /m = T. But vector potential is in T·m, so perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, let's see:

The unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m) or equivalently Weber per meter (Wb/m). Let's check:

μ0 has units of H/m (henry per meter). Henry is Wb/A, so μ0 is Wb/(A·m). The term qv has units of C·m/s. The denominator is meters. So:

μ0 * (q v) / (distance) has units of (Wb/(A·m)) * (C·m/s) / m = (Wb/(A·m)) * (C/s) * (m/m) = (Wb/(A·m)) * A = Wb/m = T·m²/m = T·m. Which is the correct unit for vector potential (since A is in T·m). So yes, the units check out.

Therefore, the expressions are correct. The answer is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials as written above.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|}
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{(1 - \hat{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c) |\vec{d}|}
\]
where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \), \( \hat{d} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).
