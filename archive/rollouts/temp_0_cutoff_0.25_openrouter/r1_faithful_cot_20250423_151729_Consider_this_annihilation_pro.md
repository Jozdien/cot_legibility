To determine the velocity of particle A produced in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), we use energy and momentum conservation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Assumptions and Initial Energy**:
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible. The total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 2m_p c^2 \quad \text{(where \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \))}
     \]

2. **Rest Mass of Products**:
   - The total rest mass energy of the four A particles is:
     \[
     4m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

3. **Available Kinetic Energy**:
   - The excess energy converted into kinetic energy is:
     \[
     K_{\text{total}} = 2m_p c^2 - 4m_A c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Each A particle receives approximately \( \frac{676}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV} \) of kinetic energy.

4. **Relativistic Energy Relation**:
   - The total energy per A particle is:
     \[
     E_A = m_A c^2 + K_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563
     \]

5. **Velocity Calculation**:
   - Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{300}{469}\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     v \approx c \sqrt{1 - 0.409} \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.7686c
     \]

**Final Answer**:
The velocity of particle A is approximately \(\boxed{0.77c}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this physics problem here: an antiproton and a proton annihilate each other, producing two A+ particles and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm, let's see. 

First, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that the proton is at rest in the lab frame? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So the initial momentum of the system would be approximately zero? Wait, but the antiproton is moving, so even if it's slow, it has some momentum. But if it's moving very slowly, maybe the proton's rest frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

In annihilation processes, usually, we consider the center-of-mass frame because the initial particles (proton and antiproton) can annihilate into other particles, and the products' momenta depend on that frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame (where the proton is at rest) is almost the same as the center-of-mass frame? Wait, the proton and antiproton have the same mass, so their center-of-mass frame would have equal and opposite momenta if they are moving towards each other. But here, the antiproton is moving slowly towards a stationary proton. So the total momentum isn't zero. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the center-of-mass energy first?

Alternatively, since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible. So the total energy is just the rest energy of the proton and antiproton. Since they annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into the energy of the A particles. But the A particles have mass, so their energy will be their rest mass plus kinetic energy. But how does that relate to their velocity?

Wait, the problem says "the velocity of particle A". Since there are two A+ and two A-, maybe they are produced in pairs, so their velocities are related? But the question just asks for the velocity of particle A, so maybe all four particles have the same speed? Or maybe they are produced in such a way that their momenta balance each other?

Let me start by writing down the conservation laws. In any reaction, energy and momentum must be conserved. So in the initial state, we have a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly. Let's denote the proton as p and antiproton as \bar{p}. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is m_p c² + K, where K is its kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, K is much smaller than m_p c² (which is about 938 MeV), so maybe we can approximate the total energy as 2 m_p c². But I need to check if that's a valid approximation.

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is p = \sqrt{2 m_p K} / c, but since K is small, the momentum is small. So the total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton, which is small. But in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum. However, after the annihilation, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum. If the initial momentum is small, maybe the A particles are produced with some symmetric momentum distribution so that their total momentum is equal to the initial small momentum. But if the initial momentum is negligible, then the total momentum of the products should be zero. Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving", so maybe we can't neglect its momentum? Or maybe we can?

Wait, the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving", but doesn't specify the velocity. So perhaps we are supposed to assume that the proton is at rest and the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. Then the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately zero. Then, in the center-of-mass frame (which would be the same as the lab frame in this approximation), the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles would be produced in such a way that their momenta cancel out. Since there are four particles, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might not necessarily give zero. Alternatively, they could be produced in pairs with opposite momenta.

But each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. So the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV, which would be the kinetic energy distributed among the four A particles. But how does that translate into their velocity?

Wait, but maybe I need to use relativistic energy and momentum conservation. Let's try to set up the equations.

In the lab frame: proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_p + E_{\bar{p}} = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each has mass m_A = 300 MeV/c². Let's denote their energies as E1, E2, E3, E4 and momenta as p1, p2, p3, p4. Then:

Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = E_p + E_{\bar{p}} = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Conservation of momentum: p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = γ m_p v.

But this seems complicated with four particles. Maybe there's a symmetry. If the four A particles are produced in pairs, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, such that their momenta cancel out. But if the initial momentum is not zero, then the total momentum of the products should equal the initial momentum. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is small, so the products must have a small net momentum, but their individual velocities could be high due to the high energy.

Alternatively, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products would have to be emitted symmetrically. Then, transforming back to the lab frame (where the proton is at rest) would give the velocities. But this might be complicated.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass frame is close to the lab frame. Let me calculate the center-of-mass energy.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_p + E_{\bar{p}})^2 - (p_p c + p_{\bar{p}} c)^2. Since the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c². The antiproton has energy E_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p c² and momentum p_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p v. So,

s = (m_p c² + γ m_p c²)^2 - (γ m_p v c)^2

= m_p² c^4 (1 + γ)^2 - γ² m_p² v² c²

But γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so γ² v² = (v²)/(1 - v²/c²) = c² (γ² - 1). Therefore,

s = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + γ)^2 - (γ² - 1) ]

= m_p² c^4 [1 + 2γ + γ² - γ² + 1]

= m_p² c^4 [2 + 2γ]

= 2 m_p² c^4 (1 + γ)

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, v << c, so γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Then,

s ≈ 2 m_p² c^4 (1 + 1 + v²/(2c²)) ≈ 2 m_p² c^4 (2) = 4 m_p² c^4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if v is very small, then γ ≈ 1, so s ≈ 2 m_p² c^4 (1 + 1) = 4 m_p² c^4. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 2 m_p c². But that's the same as the total energy in the center-of-mass frame when both particles are moving towards each other with equal speeds. Wait, but here, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. So actually, the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame. Hmm, maybe I need to compute the velocity of the center-of-mass frame.

The velocity of the center-of-mass frame (u) can be found by:

u = (E_{\bar{p}} v_{\bar{p}} ) / (E_p + E_{\bar{p}} )

Since the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c², and E_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p c², and v_{\bar{p}} is the velocity of the antiproton. If the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ ≈ 1, so E_{\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c², and u ≈ (m_p c² * v) / (m_p c² + m_p c²) ) = v / 2. So the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame.

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the center-of-mass frame is moving at half that speed in the same direction. However, since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, but doesn't give a specific velocity, maybe we can take the limit as v approaches 0? In that case, the center-of-mass frame approaches the lab frame, and the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Then, the rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV, as before. The available kinetic energy is 2*938 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV. But how is this kinetic energy distributed among the four A particles?

Alternatively, maybe all four A particles are produced at rest, but that can't be because their rest mass is 1200 MeV, and the total energy is 1876 MeV, so there's extra energy. So they must have kinetic energy. But how to find their velocity?

Wait, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are produced at rest? No, that would require their total energy to be 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV, but the center-of-mass energy is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV, so that's not possible. Therefore, they must have kinetic energy.

Alternatively, maybe the four A particles are produced with equal speeds in the center-of-mass frame. Then, their velocities can be calculated from energy and momentum conservation. But since there are four particles, it's complicated. Maybe we can model it as two pairs of particles moving in opposite directions. For simplicity, suppose that two A+ and two A- are produced in such a way that each pair has equal and opposite momentum. Then, the total momentum is zero in the center-of-mass frame. Then, each particle has the same speed. So, in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has energy E and momentum p. Then, total energy is 4E = 2 m_p c², so E = (2 m_p c²)/4 = m_p c² / 2 ≈ 469 MeV. But each A particle has rest mass 300 MeV, so their energy is E = γ m_A c² = 469 MeV. Therefore, γ = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64, so 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096, so v²/c² ≈ 0.5904, so v ≈ 0.768 c. So approximately 0.77 c. But wait, this is in the center-of-mass frame. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. So we need to transform the velocity from the center-of-mass frame to the lab frame.

But earlier, we found that if the antiproton is moving slowly with velocity v, then the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity u = v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But if v is very small, then u is also very small. However, in the limit as v approaches 0, the center-of-mass frame approaches the lab frame, and the velocity of the A particles would be 0.768 c in the lab frame. But is this correct?

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame, so the velocity of the A particles would be as calculated in the center-of-mass frame, which is around 0.768 c. But let's check the numbers again.

In the center-of-mass frame, total energy is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV. The four A particles have total rest mass 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 676 MeV. If each particle has energy E = 469 MeV, then each has kinetic energy KE = E - m_A c² = 469 - 300 = 169 MeV. So total kinetic energy is 4 * 169 = 676 MeV, which matches. So that seems consistent.

Then, the velocity of each A particle in the center-of-mass frame is v = c * sqrt(1 - (m_A c² / E)^2 ) = c * sqrt(1 - (300 / 469)^2 ) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.768. So about 0.768 c. 

But if the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame, then we need to perform a Lorentz transformation to get the velocity in the lab frame. However, if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then u is very small, so the velocity addition would be approximately v' ≈ v + u. But if u is negligible, then the velocity in the lab frame is approximately the same as in the center-of-mass frame, which is 0.768 c. But is this the case?

Wait, but if the center-of-mass frame is moving at u = v/2, and v is small, then even if v is, say, 0.01 c, then u is 0.005 c. Then, the velocity in the lab frame would be v' = (v + u)/(1 + v u /c²) ≈ v + u (since v and u are small compared to c). So if in the center-of-mass frame the velocity is 0.768 c, and the center-of-mass is moving at 0.005 c relative to the lab frame, then the lab frame velocity would be approximately 0.768 c + 0.005 c ≈ 0.773 c. But since the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving", maybe we can neglect u compared to v of the A particles. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles is approximately 0.768 c. 

But let me check if this approach is valid. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's consider that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a small velocity. The total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately m_p v. After the annihilation, the four A particles must have total momentum m_p v. If m_p v is small, then the A particles must have velocities such that their total momentum is small. But if each A particle has a large velocity, their momenta could cancel out. But this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, and the A particles are emitted symmetrically. Then, their speed is calculated as above, and since the antiproton is moving slowly, the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame, so the speed is around 0.768 c. 

But let's verify the calculation again. The energy of each A particle in the center-of-mass frame is E = 2 m_p c² / 4 = m_p c² / 2 ≈ 469 MeV. Then, γ = E / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.768. So β ≈ 0.768, so v ≈ 0.768 c. 

Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.768 times the speed of light. But the problem might want an exact answer. Let's see. Let's do the exact calculation.

Given that E = m_p c² / 2 for each A particle. Then, γ = E / (m_A c²) = (m_p / (2 m_A)). Since m_p c² is approximately 938 MeV, so m_p / m_A = 938 / 300 ≈ 3.1267. Therefore, γ = 3.1267 / 2 ≈ 1.5633. Then, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/2.444) = sqrt(1 - 0.409) = sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688. So approximately 0.769 c. 

But maybe we can write it in terms of exact values. Let's use symbols. Let m_p be the proton mass, m_A = 300 MeV/c². The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c². Each A particle has energy E = (2 m_p c²)/4 = m_p c² / 2. Then, γ = E / (m_A c²) = (m_p c² / 2) / (m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A). Then, β = sqrt(1 - (m_A / (m_p / 2))² ) = sqrt(1 - (2 m_A / m_p )² ). Plugging in m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV, so 2 m_A / m_p = 600 / 938 ≈ 0.6397. Then, β = sqrt(1 - (0.6397)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688. So approximately 0.769 c. 

Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77 c. But the problem might want an exact answer in terms of a fraction or a multiple. Wait, 0.768 c is roughly 77% the speed of light. But let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, using energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar. The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v_pbar.

After the annihilation, we have four A particles. Let's assume for simplicity that they all move in the same direction (but that would give a large momentum, which may not match the initial small momentum). Alternatively, maybe two move in one direction and two in the opposite. But this complicates things. Alternatively, if they are emitted symmetrically, but in the lab frame, which is not the center-of-mass frame, this symmetry might not hold.

Alternatively, if we consider that in the lab frame, the initial momentum is small, so the products must have a small net momentum. But each A particle has a large momentum due to high velocity. Therefore, their momenta must almost cancel out. For example, two A+ moving in one direction and two A- moving in the opposite direction with slightly different speeds so that the total momentum equals the initial small momentum. But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated in the center-of-mass frame, assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, so the total momentum is zero. Then, the four A particles are emitted symmetrically with equal speeds. Then, their velocity is calculated as above, around 0.77 c. Since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, this approximation is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Since the rest mass of each A is 300 MeV, and the total energy available per A is (2 * 938 MeV)/4 = 469 MeV, then the gamma factor is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, leading to velocity ≈ 0.77 c. So the answer is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But let me check if there's a different approach. For example, using the invariant mass squared. The invariant mass squared s = (E_total / c²)^2 - (p_total c)^2. In the lab frame, E_total = m_p c² + E_{\bar{p}}, and p_total = p_{\bar{p}}. The invariant mass squared should be equal to the sum of the four A particles' energies and momenta. But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV, and asks for the velocity of particle A, perhaps we can use the relation between kinetic energy and velocity. But we need to know the kinetic energy of each A particle. If the total energy available is 2 m_p c², and the rest mass energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, then the total kinetic energy is 2*938 - 1200 ≈ 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. So each A particle has 676 / 4 ≈ 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, the total energy of each A particle is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV, which matches the earlier calculation. Then, using KE = (γ - 1) m_A c², so 169 = (γ - 1) * 300 => γ - 1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.563 => γ ≈ 1.563. Then, as before, β ≈ 0.768. So velocity is 0.768 c.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the velocity comes out to approximately 0.77 c. Since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps we need to calculate it more precisely.

Let me compute β more accurately. Given γ = 1.5633, then:

β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/2.444) = sqrt(1 - 0.4091) = sqrt(0.5909) ≈ 0.7686. So approximately 0.7686 c. Rounded to three significant figures, that's 0.769 c. But the problem might want it as a fraction or in terms of sqrt terms. Alternatively, maybe there's an exact expression.

Alternatively, since γ = m_p / (2 m_A) = (938 / 300) / 2 ≈ 3.127 / 2 ≈ 1.563. Then, β = sqrt(1 - (2 m_A / m_p )² ). Plugging in m_A = 300, m_p = 938:

β = sqrt(1 - (600 / 938 )² ) = sqrt(1 - (0.6397)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.4092) ≈ sqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686. So same result.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as (sqrt( (m_p / (2 m_A))² - 1 )) / (m_p / (2 m_A)) )? Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, γ = E / (m_A c²) = (m_p c² / 2) / (m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A). Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (2 m_A / m_p )² ). So β = sqrt(1 - (2 * 300 / 938 )² ) = sqrt(1 - (600 / 938 )² ). Calculating 600 / 938 ≈ 0.63966. Squared is ≈ 0.4092. 1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908. Square root of that is ≈ 0.7686. So β ≈ 0.7686 c. 

Since the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV, and the proton mass is a known constant (≈938 MeV/c²), the answer is a numerical multiple of c. So approximately 0.77 c. But maybe they want it as a fraction? Let's see. 0.7686 is approximately 77% of c. But perhaps the exact value is sqrt(0.5908) which is irrational. Alternatively, maybe there's a calculation mistake.

Wait, let's check the initial assumption. If the proton and antiproton annihilate at rest, then the total energy would be 2 m_p c², and the four A particles would share this energy. But in reality, the antiproton is moving slowly, so the total energy is slightly more than 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is not zero. However, since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, we can approximate the total energy as 2 m_p c² and total momentum as zero, leading to the calculation above. Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77 c. 

Alternatively, if we don't make that approximation, and consider the antiproton's kinetic energy, but since it's not given, we can't calculate it. Therefore, the problem expects us to assume that the proton and antiproton are annihilating at rest, leading to the velocity calculated as 0.77 c. 

But wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate, but usually, they annihilate into pions, but in this problem, it's into A particles. Regardless, the process is similar. So I think the answer is approximately 0.77 c. 

But let me check with exact values. Let's use m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV.

Total energy: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

Total rest mass of products: 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

So available kinetic energy: 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

Assuming each A particle has the same energy: 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV.

So each A has energy 469 MeV, rest mass 300 MeV, so gamma = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/1.5633)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688.

So beta ≈ 0.7688, which is approximately 0.77 c.

Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. Since the problem might want the answer in terms of c, we can write it as 0.77c. But maybe more precisely, 0.77 c or 0.768 c. Depending on the required precision.

Alternatively, using more precise calculation:

beta = sqrt(1 - (300/469)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (90000/219961)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.40916) ≈ sqrt(0.59084) ≈ 0.7686. So approximately 0.769 c.

Rounded to two decimal places, 0.77 c. Rounded to three, 0.769 c. Since the given data (300 MeV) has three significant figures, the answer should also have three. So 0.769 c. But maybe the exact fraction is  sqrt(1 - (600/938)^2 ). Let's compute 600/938:

600 ÷ 938 ≈ 0.63966

Square that: ≈ 0.40916

1 - 0.40916 ≈ 0.59084

Square root: ≈ 0.7686

So 0.7686 c. Rounded to three significant figures, 0.769 c. But perhaps the answer is expected to be (sqrt( (2 m_p c^2 / 4)^2 - (m_A c^2)^2 )) / (2 m_p c^2 / 4) ) * c. Wait, that's another way to write beta.

Wait, beta = v/c = (sqrt(E² - (m_A c²)^2 )) / E = sqrt(1 - (m_A c² / E )² ). Which is what we did. So yes, beta = sqrt(1 - (m_A / (E / c² ))^2 ). Since E = m_p c² / 2, then beta = sqrt(1 - (2 m_A / m_p )² ). 

Plugging in the numbers:

beta = sqrt(1 - (2*300/938)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (600/938)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.40916) ≈ 0.7686 c.

So the precise answer is approximately 0.7686 c. Depending on the problem's expectation, this could be written as 0.77 c, 0.769 c, or maybe as a fraction. But since 0.7686 is approximately 77% of c, and the given values have three significant figures, 0.769 c is appropriate.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here: an antiproton and a proton annihilate each other, producing two A+ particles and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm, let's see. 

First, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that the proton is at rest in the lab frame? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So the initial momentum of the system would be approximately zero? Wait, but the antiproton is moving, so even if it's slow, it has some momentum. But if it's moving very slowly, maybe the proton's rest frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

In annihilation processes, usually, we consider the center-of-mass frame because the initial particles (proton and antiproton) can annihilate into other particles, and the products' momenta depend on that frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame (where the proton is at rest) is almost the same as the center-of-mass frame? Wait, the proton and antiproton have the same mass, so their center-of-mass frame would have equal and opposite momenta if they are moving towards each other. But here, the antiproton is moving slowly towards a stationary proton. So the total momentum isn't zero. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the center-of-mass energy first?

Alternatively, since the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible. So the total energy is just the rest energy of the proton and antiproton. Since they annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into the energy of the A particles. But the A particles have mass, so their energy will be their rest mass plus kinetic energy. But how does that relate to their velocity?

Wait, the problem says "the velocity of particle A". Since there are two A+ and two A-, maybe they are produced in pairs, so their velocities are related? But the question just asks for the velocity of particle A, so maybe all four particles have the same speed? Or maybe they are produced in such a way that their momenta balance each other?

Let me start by writing down the conservation laws. In any reaction, energy and momentum must be conserved. So in the initial state, we have a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly. Let's denote the proton as p and antiproton as \bar{p}. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is m_p c² + K, where K is its kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, K is much smaller than m_p c² (which is about 938 MeV), so maybe we can approximate the total energy as 2 m_p c². But I need to check if that's a valid approximation.

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is p = \sqrt{2 m_p K} / c, but since K is small, the momentum is small. So the total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton, which is small. But in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum. However, after the annihilation, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum. If the initial momentum is small, maybe the A particles are produced with some symmetric momentum distribution so that their total momentum is equal to the initial small momentum. But if the initial momentum is negligible, then the total momentum of the products should be zero. Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving", so maybe we can't neglect its momentum? Or maybe we can?

Wait, the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving", but doesn't specify the velocity. So perhaps we are supposed to assume that the proton is at rest and the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. Then the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately zero. Then, in the center-of-mass frame (which would be the same as the lab frame in this approximation), the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles would be produced in such a way that their momenta cancel out. Since there are four particles, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might not necessarily give zero. Alternatively, they could be produced in pairs with opposite momenta.

But each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. So the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV, which would be the kinetic energy distributed among the four A particles. But how does that translate into their velocity?

Wait, but maybe I need to use relativistic energy and momentum conservation. Let's try to set up the equations.

In the lab frame: proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_p + E_{\bar{p}} = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each has mass m_A = 300 MeV/c². Let's denote their energies as E1, E2, E3, E4 and momenta as p1, p2, p3, p4. Then:

Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = E_p + E_{\bar{p}} = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Conservation of momentum: p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = γ m_p v.

But this seems complicated with four particles. Maybe there's a symmetry. If the four A particles are produced in pairs, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, such that their momenta cancel out. But if the initial momentum is not zero, then the total momentum of the products should equal the initial momentum. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is sma

I have a physics problem about an antiproton and proton annihilating to produce two A+ particles and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c². I need to determine the velocity of particle A.

I'm wondering if I can assume the proton is at rest in the lab frame since the antiproton is moving slowly. This would mean the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Would the initial momentum of the system be approximately zero? Even a slowly moving antiproton has some momentum, though. Perhaps the proton's rest frame is close to the center-of-mass frame if the antiproton is moving very slowly?

In annihilation reactions, we typically use the center-of-mass frame since the products' momenta depend on that frame. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame (with the proton at rest) approximates the center-of-mass frame? Since protons and antiprotons have identical masses, their center-of-mass frame would have equal and opposite momenta if they're moving toward each other. However, in this case, a slowly moving antiproton approaches a stationary proton, so the total momentum isn't zero. Perhaps I should calculate the center-of-mass energy first?

Alternatively, I could approximate the antiproton's kinetic energy as negligible since it's moving slowly. Then the total energy would just be the rest energy of both particles. When they annihilate, this rest mass energy converts into the energy of the A particles. But the A particles have mass too, so their energy includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. How does this relate to their velocity?

The problem asks for "the velocity of particle A." Since there are two A+ and two A- particles, maybe they're produced in pairs with related velocities? Or perhaps all four particles have the same speed? Or they might be produced with balanced momenta?

Let me start with conservation laws. Energy and momentum must be conserved in any reaction. Initially, we have a stationary proton (p) and a slowly moving antiproton (p̄). The proton's energy is mpc², while the antiproton's energy is mpc² + K, where K represents kinetic energy. Since the antiproton moves slowly, K is much less than mpc² (approximately 938 MeV), so perhaps the total energy approximates to 2mpc². I should verify if this approximation is valid.

For a slowly moving antiproton, its momentum is p = √(2mpK)/c, which is small since K is small. The total initial momentum approximately equals the antiproton's momentum. After annihilation, the four A particles must have a combined momentum equal to this initial momentum. If the initial momentum is negligible, the products' total momentum should be zero. But the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," so can we neglect its momentum or not?

Since the problem doesn't specify the antiproton's velocity, perhaps we should assume the proton is stationary and the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. This would make the total energy 2mpc² with approximately zero total momentum. In the center-of-mass frame (approximately the lab frame in this case), the products must have zero total momentum. The four A particles would be arranged so their momenta cancel out.

Each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c², giving a total rest mass energy of 4 × 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The initial energy is 2 × 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. The excess energy (1876 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV) would be distributed as kinetic energy among the four A particles. But how does this translate to their velocity?

Perhaps I need to use relativistic energy and momentum conservation. In the lab frame, we have a stationary proton and an antiproton moving with velocity v. The total energy is Ep + Ep̄ = mpc² + γmpc². The total momentum is ptotal = γmpv.

After annihilation, we have four particles (two A+ and two A-), each with mass mA = 300 MeV/c². If we denote their energies as E1, E2, E3, E4 and momenta as p1, p2, p3, p4, then:

Energy conservation: E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = Ep + Ep̄ = mpc² + γmpc²
Momentum conservation: p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = γmpv

This seems complicated with four particles. Maybe there's a symmetry, like the A particles being produced in pairs moving in opposite directions so their momenta cancel out. But if the initial momentum isn't zero, the products' total momentum should equal this initial momentum. If the antiproton is moving slowly, though, maybe the initial momentum is small.

Alright, I have a physics problem involving an antiproton and a proton annihilating to produce two A+ particles and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c². I need to determine the velocity of particle A. Let's think about this.

Considering the antiproton moves slowly, I might assume the proton is stationary in the lab frame. This is because the slow motion of the antiproton means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy, and thus the initial momentum of the system is nearly zero. But, since the antiproton has some slow motion, it does have a bit of momentum, though the proton’s rest frame might essentially be akin to the center-of-mass frame.

In annihilations, the center-of-mass frame is usually considered as the initial particles' annihilation leads to products whose momenta depend on this frame. With the antiproton moving slowly, the lab frame at rest with the proton might approximate the center-of-mass frame. Given both particles have equal mass, their center-of-mass frame features opposite momenta when moving towards each other, but here, the slow-moving antiproton approaches a stationary proton, meaning the total momentum isn't zero. Perhaps I need to calculate the center-of-mass energy first?

Alternatively, assuming the antiproton’s kinetic energy is negligible due to its slow speed, the total energy would primarily be the rest energy of the pair. During annihilation, this converts into A particles’ energy. But since A particles possess mass, they have both rest mass and kinetic energy. How does this relate to their velocity?

The problem mentions "the velocity of particle A," suggesting that the velocities might be linked in pair production. But if the task simply asks for one A particle's velocity, perhaps their speeds are identical or balanced in movement to conserve momentum.

Beginning with conservation laws, energy and momentum must be conserved in any reaction. Initially, the proton is stationary (energy = m_p c²), and the antiproton's energy is m_p c² + K (where K is the kinetic energy, but very minimal compared to m_p c², around 938 MeV), leading to a total energy approximation of 2 m_p c². If this is a fair estimate...

The antiproton's momentum, p = √(2 m_p K) / c, is small, making the initial momentum primarily that of the antiproton, albeit small. But in the lab frame, only the antiproton contributes to this initial momentum. Post-annihilation, four A particles must share total momentum similar to the initial tiny momentum, potentially arranged symmetrically and equaling this small momentum. If negligible, the products’ total momentum should be zero. Can we disregard the small momentum of the antiproton's slow movement?

The problem implies the antiproton's slow pace but lacks velocity specifics. Perhaps we should assume an at-rest proton and negligible kinetic energy from the antiproton. This makes total energy nearly 2 m_p c² and total momentum near zero. Thus, in the center-of-mass frame—akin to this lab frame—that annihilation involves resultant particles with zero net momentum. Two A particles could move one way with the other two opposing them, balancing momentum.

Individually, each A particle has 300 MeV/c², making the total rest mass energy of four A particles 1200 MeV. With initial energy roughly 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876, this leaves approximately 676 MeV as kinetic energy distributed among them. How does this go into their speed?

Do I require relativistic conservation? Set equations properly then:

Lab frame: stationary proton; antiproton velocity v. Total energy = E_p + E_μ = m_p c² + γ m_p c²; total momentum = γ m_p v.

Post-annihilation, four particles (two A+, two A-) each with m_A = 300 MeV/c². Denote energies E1, E2, E3, E4, and momenta p1, p2, p3, p4. Conservation yields:

Energy: E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = m_p c² + γ m_p c²

Momentum: p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = γ m_p v

Perhaps, pairing particles symmetrically means their momenta cancel, balancing around an initial small momentum. So complex, but in this slow-moving context, might symmetry and slow motion null significant momentum effects?

But if v is small, then m_p v is small. So the total momentum of the products should be small. But the products have rest mass 4 * 300 MeV/c² = 1200 MeV/c², and the total energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV. So each particle would have some kinetic energy. But how to find their velocity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Then, in that frame, the products would have to have zero total momentum. So the four A particles would be emitted symmetrically. Then, their velocities can be calculated based on energy conservation. Then, transforming back to the lab frame (if needed) would give the velocity. But the problem doesn\'t specify the frame, but since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton rest frame), maybe the velocity of A is asked in the lab frame?\n\nWait, the problem says "What is the velocity of particle A?" without specifying the frame, so probably in the lab frame. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is similar to electron-positron annihilation, where they annihilate into two photons. But here, it\'s proton-antiproton annihilating into four particles. But the exact process might require knowing the dynamics, but since it\'s a physics problem, maybe we can assume that all the energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles, and use conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nBut with four particles, it\'s complicated. Maybe there\'s a simpler way. Let\'s think about the threshold energy. The minimum energy required for the reaction p + \\bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A− would be when all the products are at rest. But since they are four particles, they can\'t all be at rest unless their total momentum is zero. But the threshold would be when they are produced with zero kinetic energy. But in reality, the initial energy must be higher than the total rest mass of the products. But in this case, the initial energy is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV, and the products\' rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So there\'s plenty of energy, so the reaction is possible. But how to find the velocity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are emitted with equal speed in different directions. If we can find their speed in the center-of-mass frame, then maybe boost to the lab frame. But this might be complicated.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the proton is at rest, and the total momentum is small. But the center-of-mass frame would have velocity v_cm = (p_initial) / (E_initial / c²). Since p_initial is small (because antiproton is slow), the center-of-mass frame is moving slowly relative to the lab frame. But if the velocity is very small, maybe we can approximate the center-of-mass frame as the lab frame. Hmm, but I need to check.\n\nWait, the center-of-mass velocity is given by:\n\nv_cm = ( (E_p * v_p + E_{\\bar{p}} * v_{\\bar{p}}) / (E_p + E_{\\bar{p}}) ) c²\n\nBut the proton is at rest, so v_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c². The antiproton has velocity v (slow), so E_{\\bar{p}} = γ m_p c² ≈ m_p c² (since v is small), and its momentum is p_{\\bar{p}} = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v. So the total momentum is p_total ≈ m_p v. The total energy is E_total ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c². Then, the velocity of the center-of-mass frame is:\n\nv_cm = (p_total c²) / E_total ≈ (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v / 2.\n\nSo the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since v is small (antiproton moving slowly), the center-of-mass frame is moving at half that small velocity relative to the lab. So if we can consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the problem is symmetric, and the A particles are emitted with some velocity, then we can transform back to the lab frame. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, and then find the velocity of A in that frame, which would then be the velocity in the lab frame if the center-of-mass frame is not moving. But earlier calculation shows that the center-of-mass frame is moving at v / 2 relative to the lab. But if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then v / 2 is negligible, so the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. Therefore, maybe we can proceed in the center-of-mass frame, assuming total initial momentum is zero.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum in the lab frame is not zero. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so the total momentum is non-zero. But if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then the total momentum is small, but not zero. However, if the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving", maybe we can make the approximation that the kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately m_p v, which is small. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame. Let\'s try that. In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta. Then, when they annihilate, the products must also have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. For simplicity, maybe they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with equal speeds. Then, each A particle would have the same speed. Then, we can use energy conservation to find that speed.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton energies. Since they are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta, their energies would be equal. Let\'s denote the proton\'s energy as E and the antiproton\'s energy as E. So total energy is 2E. But in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is also equal to the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton plus their kinetic energies. Wait, but if they are moving towards each other with speed u, then each has energy γ m_p c², so total energy is 2 γ m_p c². The total momentum is zero because their momenta are opposite.\n\nBut when they annihilate into four A particles, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 γ m_p c², and the total momentum is zero. The rest mass of the four A particles is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. The kinetic energy of the system is then 2 γ m_p c² - 4 m_A c². This kinetic energy is distributed among the four A particles. But how?\n\nIf we assume that all four A particles have the same speed (for simplicity), then each has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c², and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v_A. Since the total momentum is zero, the momenta must cancel. So if two A+ are moving in one direction and two A- in the opposite, each with the same speed, then the total momentum cancels. So each pair contributes 2 γ_A m_A v_A in opposite directions, so total momentum is zero.\n\nThen, the total energy is 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 γ m_p c². So:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 γ m_p c²\n\nDivide both sides by 2 c²:\n\n2 γ_A m_A = γ m_p\n\nBut we need to relate γ and γ_A. However, in the center-of-mass frame, the initial gamma factor γ is determined by the velocity of the proton and antiproton. Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with velocities u and -u, such that their momenta cancel. So each has momentum p = γ_u m_p u, and since they are equal and opposite, total momentum is zero. The total energy is 2 γ_u m_p c².\n\nBut how is γ_u related to the lab frame? Wait, in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Then, the center-of-mass frame is moving with velocity v_cm relative to the lab frame. The velocity v_cm can be found by:\n\nv_cm = (m_p v) / (m_p + γ_v m_p)\n\nBut since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ_v ≈ 1, so:\n\nv_cm ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p) ) = v / 2\n\nSo the center-of-mass frame is moving at v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since v is small, v_cm is also small. Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, the velocities of the proton and antiproton are:\n\nu_p = (v_p - v_cm) / (1 - v_p v_cm / c²)\n\nBut the proton is at rest in the lab frame, so v_p = 0, so u_p = -v_cm ≈ -v / 2\n\nSimilarly, the antiproton\'s velocity in the center-of-mass frame is:\n\nu_{\\bar{p}} = (v - v_cm) / (1 - v v_cm / c²) ≈ (v - v/2) / (1 - v^2 / (2 c²)) ≈ v / 2 / (1 - 0) ≈ v / 2\n\nSo in the center-of-mass frame, the proton is moving to the left with speed v / 2, and the antiproton is moving to the right with speed v / 2. But since v is small, their speeds in the center-of-mass frame are also small, so their gamma factors are approximately 1. Therefore, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is approximately 2 m_p c², same as the lab frame. Wait, but that can\'t be. If the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame, the total energy would be different. Hmm, maybe I need to use the relativistic transformation for energy.\n\nThe total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = m_p c² + γ_v m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c². The total momentum in the lab frame is p_lab = γ_v m_p v ≈ m_p v. Then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by:\n\nE_cm² = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2\n\nSo E_cm² ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v c)^2\n\nBut since v is small, the second term is negligible, so E_cm ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2 m_p c², same as the lab frame. So in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the products must have total energy 2 m_p c². The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c² - 4 m_A c² ≈ 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. This kinetic energy is distributed among the four A particles.\n\nIf we assume each A particle has the same speed, then each has kinetic energy K = 676 / 4 ≈ 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A particle is E_A = m_A c² + K = 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE_A = γ_A m_A c²\n\nSo γ_A = E_A / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563\n\nThen, γ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A² / c²) ≈ 1.563\n\nSolving for v_A:\n\n1 - v_A² / c² = 1 / (1.563)^2 ≈ 1 / 2.443 ≈ 0.409\n\nSo v_A² / c² ≈ 1 - 0.409 = 0.591\n\nv_A ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c\n\nSo approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. But wait, this is assuming that each A particle has the same kinetic energy, which might not be the case. Also, this is in the center-of-mass frame. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, which is presumably in the lab frame. So if the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame, we need to transform the velocity back to the lab frame.\n\nEarlier, we found that the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm ≈ v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so v_cm is small. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately their velocity in the center-of-mass frame plus v_cm. But if v_cm is very small, maybe we can neglect it? But then the answer would be approximately 0.77 c. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe we can approximate the lab frame as the center-of-mass frame, and the velocity is 0.77 c. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let\'s think again.\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v.\n\nAfter annihilation, we have four A particles. Let\'s assume that they are produced symmetrically such that their total momentum is p_total. If the A particles are emitted in pairs in opposite directions, their momenta could cancel out, but since the total initial momentum is p_total, maybe two are moving in the direction of the initial antiproton and two in the opposite, but with a net momentum p_total.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe we can use the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the velocity of the A particles is 0.77 c, and then transform this velocity to the lab frame. Since the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm = v / 2 relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be:\n\nv_lab = (v_cm + v_A) / (1 + v_cm v_A / c²)\n\nBut if v_cm is small (since v is small), then this is approximately v_cm + v_A. But if v_cm is negligible, then v_lab ≈ v_A ≈ 0.77 c. But is this correct?\n\nWait, but if the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would depend on their direction. For example, if in the center-of-mass frame, an A particle is moving forward at 0.77 c, then in the lab frame, its velocity would be (v_cm + 0.77 c) / (1 + v_cm * 0.77). Similarly, if another A particle is moving backward at -0.77 c, its velocity in the lab frame would be (v_cm - 0.77 c) / (1 - v_cm * 0.77). But since v_cm is small, these would be approximately 0.77 c + v_cm and -0.77 c + v_cm. But since the problem just asks for "the velocity of particle A", maybe it\'s referring to the speed, regardless of direction. But the question says "velocity", which is a vector, so maybe we need to consider the direction. But the problem might be expecting a magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame, assuming that the initial momentum is zero. But in reality, the initial momentum isn\'t zero in the lab frame. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is negligible, so we can approximate the lab frame as the center-of-mass frame. Then, the velocity of the A particles would be 0.77 c. But let\'s check the numbers again.\n\nGiven that m_A c² = 300 MeV, and the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV. The rest mass energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. If divided equally among four particles, each has 169 MeV. Then, each A particle has total energy 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, gamma is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) c ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) c ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c. So approximately 0.77 c. \n\nBut is this the correct approach? Because in reality, the kinetic energy might not be divided equally. However, in the absence of other information, assuming symmetry is reasonable. So maybe the answer is approximately 0.77 c. But let\'s see if there\'s another way.\n\nAlternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. Let\'s try that.\n\nIn the lab frame, proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v. After annihilation, four A particles. Let\'s assume that all four A particles have the same speed (for simplicity) and are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. Then, total momentum of the A particles is 4 γ_A m_A v_A. This must equal the initial momentum, which is γ m_p v. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so initial momentum is m_p v. So:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v\n\nAnd conservation of energy:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c²\n\nSo from energy conservation:\n\nγ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.563\n\nWhich is the same as before. Then, from momentum conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v\n\nBut from energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A = 2 m_p / c² * c² = 2 m_p. Wait, no:\n\nWait, 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ 4 γ_A m_A = 2 m_p / c² * c²? Wait, no. Let\'s re-express:\n\nFrom energy: 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A m_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 c²) = m_p / 2\n\nSo γ_A m_A = m_p / 2\n\nFrom momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v\n\nBut γ_A m_A = m_p / 2, so:\n\n4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A = m_p v ⇒ 2 m_p v_A = m_p v ⇒ v_A = v / 2\n\nBut we also have γ_A = 1.563, which relates to v_A:\n\nγ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A / c)^2) ≈ 1.563\n\nSo sqrt(1 - (v_A / c)^2) ≈ 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64\n\nThen, 1 - (v_A / c)^2 ≈ 0.409 ⇒ (v_A / c)^2 ≈ 0.591 ⇒ v_A ≈ 0.769 c\n\nBut from momentum conservation, v_A = v / 2. So v = 2 v_A ≈ 1.538 c. Wait, that can\'t be, since v cannot exceed c. This is a contradiction. So my assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction must be wrong. Because if they are moving in the same direction, their momentum would require the initial velocity v to be larger than c, which is impossible. Therefore, the A particles must be moving in different directions such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum m_p v.\n\nBut this complicates things. Maybe two A particles move in one direction and two in the opposite, but with different speeds. But without more information, it\'s hard to model. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame, where total momentum is zero, and then the velocity of A particles is as calculated before, 0.769 c, and since the center-of-mass frame is moving slowly relative to the lab frame, the velocity in the lab frame is approximately the same. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77 c.\n\nBut let\'s check the numbers again. If in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has speed 0.769 c, and the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm = v / 2 relative to the lab frame. If the antiproton\'s velocity v is non-relativistic, say v << c, then v_cm ≈ v / 2 is also non-relativistic. Then, the velocity of an A particle in the lab frame moving in the same direction as the center-of-mass frame would be approximately v_cm + 0.769 c ≈ 0.769 c + v / 2. But since v is small, this is approximately 0.769 c. Similarly, an A particle moving opposite would have velocity -0.769 c + v / 2 ≈ -0.769 c. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, so depending on the direction, it could be either. But since the question doesn\'t specify, maybe it\'s asking for the speed, which would be approximately 0.77 c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. Let\'s consider that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v. After the annihilation, the four A particles must have total energy E_total and total momentum p_total.\n\nAssuming that the four A particles are emitted symmetrically, two in the forward direction and two in the backward direction, each with speed u. Then, the total momentum would be 2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_u m_A u = 0, which contradicts the initial momentum p_total. Therefore, this symmetry is not possible. Alternatively, three in one direction and one in the other, but this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, two A particles are emitted at an angle θ and two at -θ, such that the momentum components perpendicular to the initial direction cancel, and the components along the initial direction add up to p_total. But this requires knowing the angle θ, which is not given.\n\nAlternatively, consider that all four A particles are emitted in the same direction as the initial antiproton\'s motion. Then, their total momentum is 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v. From energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + γ m_p c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.563\n\nThen, γ_A = 1.563, so v_A ≈ 0.769 c as before. Then, from momentum conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v\n\nBut γ_A m_A = (2 m_p) / (4 c²) * c² = m_p / 2\n\nWait, no. From energy conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A m_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 c²) = m_p / 2\n\nSo γ_A m_A = m_p / 2\n\nThen, momentum conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A = 4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A = 2 m_p v_A = m_p v ⇒ v = 2 v_A\n\nBut from γ_A = 1.563, we have v_A ≈ 0.769 c, so v ≈ 1.538 c, which is impossible. Therefore, this configuration is not possible. Hence, the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the A particles must be moving in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum m_p v, but their velocities are such that no individual velocity exceeds c. This likely requires a more complex distribution of velocities. However, without additional information, it\'s difficult to proceed. \n\nGiven that the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving", and given that the rest mass of the A particles is 300 MeV/c², which is less than the proton\'s rest mass (938 MeV/c²), perhaps the velocity of the A particles is determined purely by energy conservation in the center-of-mass frame, neglecting the initial momentum. Since the problem might be expecting a numerical answer, and given the earlier calculation in the center-of-mass frame gives v ≈ 0.769 c, which is approximately 0.77 c or 0.8 c. \n\nAlternatively, using the energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, but considering that the initial momentum is small. Let\'s try this.\n\nIn the lab frame:\n\nInitial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ ≈ 1)\n\nInitial momentum: p_initial ≈ m_p v\n\nAfter annihilation:\n\nTotal energy: E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c²\n\nTotal momentum: p_final = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming all A particles move in the same direction)\n\nBut from energy conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 1.563\n\nSo γ_A ≈ 1.563, leading to v_A ≈ 0.769 c as before. Then, from momentum conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v ⇒ v ≈ (4 γ_A m_A v_A) / m_p\n\nSubstituting γ_A m_A = m_p / 2 from energy conservation:\n\nv ≈ (4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A) / m_p = 2 v_A\n\nBut v_A ≈ 0.769 c ⇒ v ≈ 1.538 c, which is impossible. Therefore, this configuration is impossible, meaning that the A particles cannot all be moving in the same direction. Therefore, they must have some distribution of velocities. \n\nPerhaps two A particles move forward and two move backward with higher speed to compensate. Let\'s assume that two A particles move forward with speed u and two move backward with speed w. Then, total momentum:\n\n2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_w m_A w = m_p v\n\nTotal energy:\n\n2 γ_u m_A c² + 2 γ_w m_A c² = 2 m_p c²\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1) 2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_w m_A w = m_p v\n\n2) 2 γ_u m_A c² + 2 γ_w m_A c² = 2 m_p c²\n\nDivide equation 2 by 2 c²:\n\nγ_u m_A + γ_w m_A = m_p\n\nSo γ_u + γ_w = m_p / m_A ≈ 938 / 300 ≈ 3.127\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n2 m_A (γ_u u - γ_w w) = m_p v\n\nBut this is still complicated. If we assume that the backward-moving particles have negligible speed (w ≈ 0), then γ_w ≈ 1, and equation 2 becomes:\n\nγ_u m_A + m_A ≈ m_p ⇒ γ_u ≈ (m_p / m_A) - 1 ≈ 3.127 - 1 ≈ 2.127\n\nThen, γ_u ≈ 2.127 ⇒ u ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/2.127²) c ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/4.524) c ≈ sqrt(0.779) c ≈ 0.883 c\n\nThen, from equation 1:\n\n2 m_A (γ_u u - γ_w w) ≈ 2 m_A (γ_u u - 0) ≈ 2 m_A γ_u u = m_p v\n\nSo v ≈ (2 m_A γ_u u) / m_p ≈ (2 * 300 * 2.127 * 0.883) / 938 ≈ (2 * 300 * 1.879) / 938 ≈ (1127.4) / 938 ≈ 1.202 c\n\nAgain, impossible. So this assumption is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the backward-moving particles have speed such that their momentum cancels part of the forward momentum. But this is getting too involved. \n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent and the fact that this is a problem likely expecting an approximate answer, I think the intended approach is to consider the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, calculate the velocity there as approximately 0.77 c, and since the antiproton is moving slowly, the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame, so the velocity is about 0.77 c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. Let\'s compute gamma for the A particle:\n\nγ = 1.563\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/2.443) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) = c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769\n\nYes, so approximately 0.769 c. Rounding to two significant figures, 0.77 c.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446997, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7423, prompt_tokens=1408, total_tokens=8831, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the velocity of particle A produced in the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), we use conservation of energy and momentum. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is approximately \( 2m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} \).

2. **Final Energy**:
   - The rest mass energy of the four A particles is \( 4m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The remaining energy is kinetic: \( K_{\text{total}} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV} \).

3. **Assuming Symmetry in Center-of-Mass Frame**:
   - In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Each A particle shares the kinetic energy equally. Thus, each A particle has kinetic energy \( K_A = \frac{676}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total energy per A particle: \( E_A = m_A c^2 + K_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV} \).

4. **Relating Energy to Velocity**:
   - Using \( E_A = \gamma m_A c^2 \), solve for \( \gamma \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563
     \]
   - Relate \( \gamma \) to velocity \( v \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \implies v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
     \]
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{1.563^2}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - 0.409} \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769c
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The velocity of particle A in the center-of-mass frame is approximately \( 0.77c \). Since the antiproton moves slowly, the lab frame approximates the center-of-mass frame.

**Answer**: The velocity of particle A is approximately \(\boxed{0.77c}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ ≈ 1, so E_{\bar{p}} ≈ m_p c², so total energy is ≈ 2 m_p c², and total momentum is ≈ m_p v, where v is small. But if v is small, then m_p v is small. So the total momentum of the products should be small. But the products have rest mass 4 * 300 MeV/c² = 1200 MeV/c², and the total energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 ≈ 676 MeV. So each particle would have some kinetic energy. But how to find their velocity?

Alternatively, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Then, in that frame, the products would have to have zero total momentum. So the four A particles would be emitted symmetrically. Then, their velocities can be calculated based on energy conservation. Then, transforming back to the lab frame (if needed) would give the velocity. But the problem doesn't specify the frame, but since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton rest frame), maybe the velocity of A is asked in the lab frame?

Wait, the problem says "What is the velocity of particle A?" without specifying the frame, so probably in the lab frame. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the process is similar to electron-positron annihilation, where they annihilate into two photons. But here, it's proton-antiproton annihilating into four particles. But the exact process might require knowing the dynamics, but since it's a physics problem, maybe we can assume that all the energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A particles, and use conservation of energy and momentum.

But with four particles, it's complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think about the threshold energy. The minimum energy required for the reaction p + \bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A− would be when all the products are at rest. But since they are four particles, they can't all be at rest unless their total momentum is zero. But the threshold would be when they are produced with zero kinetic energy. But in reality, the initial energy must be higher than the total rest mass of the products. But in this case, the initial energy is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV, and the products' rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So there's plenty of energy, so the reaction is possible. But how to find the velocity?

Alternatively, maybe in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles are emitted with equal speed in different directions. If we can find their speed in the center-of-mass frame, then maybe boost to the lab frame. But this might be complicated.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the proton is at rest, and the total momentum is small. But the center-of-mass frame would have velocity v_cm = (p_initial) / (E_initial / c²). Since p_initial is small (because antiproton is slow), the center-of-mass frame is moving slowly relative to the lab frame. But if the velocity is very small, maybe we can approximate the center-of-mass frame as the lab frame. Hmm, but I need to check.

Wait, the center-of-mass velocity is given by:

v_cm = ( (E_p * v_p + E_{\bar{p}} * v_{\bar{p}}) / (E_p + E_{\bar{p}}) ) c²

But the proton is at rest, so v_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c². The antiproton has velocity v (slow), so E_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p c² ≈ m_p c² (since v is small), and its momentum is p_{\bar{p}} = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v. So the total momentum is p_total ≈ m_p v. The total energy is E_total ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c². Then, the velocity of the center-of-mass frame is:

v_cm = (p_total c²) / E_total ≈ (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v / 2.

So the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since v is small (antiproton moving slowly), the center-of-mass frame is moving at half that small velocity relative to the lab. So if we can consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the problem is symmetric, and the A particles are emitted with some velocity, then we can transform back to the lab frame. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, and then find the velocity of A in that frame, which would then be the velocity in the lab frame if the center-of-mass frame is not moving. But earlier calculation shows that the center-of-mass frame is moving at v / 2 relative to the lab. But if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then v / 2 is negligible, so the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. Therefore, maybe we can proceed in the center-of-mass frame, assuming total initial momentum is zero.

Wait, but the initial momentum in the lab frame is not zero. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so the total momentum is non-zero. But if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then the total momentum is small, but not zero. However, if the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving", maybe we can make the approximation that the kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately m_p v, which is small. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame. Let's try that. In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta. Then, when they annihilate, the products must also have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. For simplicity, maybe they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with equal speeds. Then, each A particle would have the same speed. Then, we can use energy conservation to find that speed.

In the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton energies. Since they are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta, their energies would be equal. Let's denote the proton's energy as E and the antiproton's energy as E. So total energy is 2E. But in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is also equal to the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton plus their kinetic energies. Wait, but if they are moving towards each other with speed u, then each has energy γ m_p c², so total energy is 2 γ m_p c². The total momentum is zero because their momenta are opposite.

But when they annihilate into four A particles, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 γ m_p c², and the total momentum is zero. The rest mass of the four A particles is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. The kinetic energy of the system is then 2 γ m_p c² - 4 m_A c². This kinetic energy is distributed among the four A particles. But how?

If we assume that all four A particles have the same speed (for simplicity), then each has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c², and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v_A. Since the total momentum is zero, the momenta must cancel. So if two A+ are moving in one direction and two A- in the opposite, each with the same speed, then the total momentum cancels. So each pair contributes 2 γ_A m_A v_A in opposite directions, so total momentum is zero.

Then, the total energy is 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 γ m_p c². So:

4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 γ m_p c²

Divide both sides by 2 c²:

2 γ_A m_A = γ m_p

But we need to relate γ and γ_A. However, in the center-of-mass frame, the initial gamma factor γ is determined by the velocity of the proton and antiproton. Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with velocities u and -u, such that their momenta cancel. So each has momentum p = γ_u m_p u, and since they are equal and opposite, total momentum is zero. The total energy is 2 γ_u m_p c².

But how is γ_u related to the lab frame? Wait, in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Then, the center-of-mass frame is moving with velocity v_cm relative to the lab frame. The velocity v_cm can be found by:

v_cm = (m_p v) / (m_p + γ_v m_p)

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ_v ≈ 1, so:

v_cm ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p) ) = v / 2

So the center-of-mass frame is moving at v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since v is small, v_cm is also small. Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, the velocities of the proton and antiproton are:

u_p = (v_p - v_cm) / (1 - v_p v_cm / c²)

But the proton is at rest in the lab frame, so v_p = 0, so u_p = -v_cm ≈ -v / 2

Similarly, the antiproton's velocity in the center-of-mass frame is:

u_{\bar{p}} = (v - v_cm) / (1 - v v_cm / c²) ≈ (v - v/2) / (1 - v^2 / (2 c²)) ≈ v / 2 / (1 - 0) ≈ v / 2

So in the center-of-mass frame, the proton is moving to the left with speed v / 2, and the antiproton is moving to the right with speed v / 2. But since v is small, their speeds in the center-of-mass frame are also small, so their gamma factors are approximately 1. Therefore, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is approximately 2 m_p c², same as the lab frame. Wait, but that can't be. If the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame, the total energy would be different. Hmm, maybe I need to use the relativistic transformation for energy.

The total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = m_p c² + γ_v m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c². The total momentum in the lab frame is p_lab = γ_v m_p v ≈ m_p v. Then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by:

E_cm² = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2

So E_cm² ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v c)^2

But since v is small, the second term is negligible, so E_cm ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2 m_p c², same as the lab frame. So in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the products must have total energy 2 m_p c². The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c² - 4 m_A c² ≈ 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. This kinetic energy is distributed among the four A particles.

If we assume each A particle has the same speed, then each has kinetic energy K = 676 / 4 ≈ 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A particle is E_A = m_A c² + K = 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E_A = γ_A m_A c²

So γ_A = E_A / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563

Then, γ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A² / c²) ≈ 1.563

Solving for v_A:

1 - v_A² / c² = 1 / (1.563)^2 ≈ 1 / 2.443 ≈ 0.409

So v_A² / c² ≈ 1 - 0.409 = 0.591

v_A ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c

So approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. But wait, this is assuming that each A particle has the same kinetic energy, which might not be the case. Also, this is in the center-of-mass frame. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, which is presumably in the lab frame. So if the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame, we need to transform the velocity back to the lab frame.

Earlier, we found that the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm ≈ v / 2 relative to the lab frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so v_cm is small. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately their velocity in the center-of-mass frame plus v_cm. But if v_cm is very small, maybe we can neglect it? But then the answer would be approximately 0.77 c. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe we can approximate the lab frame as the center-of-mass frame, and the velocity is 0.77 c. But I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's think again.

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, we have four A particles. Let's assume that they are produced symmetrically such that their total momentum is p_total. If the A particles are emitted in pairs in opposite directions, their momenta could cancel out, but since the total initial momentum is p_total, maybe two are moving in the direction of the initial antiproton and two in the opposite, but with a net momentum p_total.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we can use the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the velocity of the A particles is 0.77 c, and then transform this velocity to the lab frame. Since the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm = v / 2 relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be:

v_lab = (v_cm + v_A) / (1 + v_cm v_A / c²)

But if v_cm is small (since v is small), then this is approximately v_cm + v_A. But if v_cm is negligible, then v_lab ≈ v_A ≈ 0.77 c. But is this correct?

Wait, but if the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would depend on their direction. For example, if in the center-of-mass frame, an A particle is moving forward at 0.77 c, then in the lab frame, its velocity would be (v_cm + 0.77 c) / (1 + v_cm * 0.77). Similarly, if another A particle is moving backward at -0.77 c, its velocity in the lab frame would be (v_cm - 0.77 c) / (1 - v_cm * 0.77). But since v_cm is small, these would be approximately 0.77 c + v_cm and -0.77 c + v_cm. But since the problem just asks for "the velocity of particle A", maybe it's referring to the speed, regardless of direction. But the question says "velocity", which is a vector, so maybe we need to consider the direction. But the problem might be expecting a magnitude.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame, assuming that the initial momentum is zero. But in reality, the initial momentum isn't zero in the lab frame. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is negligible, so we can approximate the lab frame as the center-of-mass frame. Then, the velocity of the A particles would be 0.77 c. But let's check the numbers again.

Given that m_A c² = 300 MeV, and the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV. The rest mass energy of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. If divided equally among four particles, each has 169 MeV. Then, each A particle has total energy 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, gamma is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) c ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) c ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c. So approximately 0.77 c. 

But is this the correct approach? Because in reality, the kinetic energy might not be divided equally. However, in the absence of other information, assuming symmetry is reasonable. So maybe the answer is approximately 0.77 c. But let's see if there's another way.

Alternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. Let's try that.

In the lab frame, proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v. After annihilation, four A particles. Let's assume that all four A particles have the same speed (for simplicity) and are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. Then, total momentum of the A particles is 4 γ_A m_A v_A. This must equal the initial momentum, which is γ m_p v. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so initial momentum is m_p v. So:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v

And conservation of energy:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c²

So from energy conservation:

γ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.563

Which is the same as before. Then, from momentum conservation:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v

But from energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A = 2 m_p / c² * c² = 2 m_p. Wait, no:

Wait, 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ 4 γ_A m_A = 2 m_p / c² * c²? Wait, no. Let's re-express:

From energy: 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A m_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 c²) = m_p / 2

So γ_A m_A = m_p / 2

From momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v

But γ_A m_A = m_p / 2, so:

4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A = m_p v ⇒ 2 m_p v_A = m_p v ⇒ v_A = v / 2

But we also have γ_A = 1.563, which relates to v_A:

γ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A / c)^2) ≈ 1.563

So sqrt(1 - (v_A / c)^2) ≈ 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64

Then, 1 - (v_A / c)^2 ≈ 0.409 ⇒ (v_A / c)^2 ≈ 0.591 ⇒ v_A ≈ 0.769 c

But from momentum conservation, v_A = v / 2. So v = 2 v_A ≈ 1.538 c. Wait, that can't be, since v cannot exceed c. This is a contradiction. So my assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction must be wrong. Because if they are moving in the same direction, their momentum would require the initial velocity v to be larger than c, which is impossible. Therefore, the A particles must be moving in different directions such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum m_p v.

But this complicates things. Maybe two A particles move in one direction and two in the opposite, but with different speeds. But without more information, it's hard to model. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame, where total momentum is zero, and then the velocity of A particles is as calculated before, 0.769 c, and since the center-of-mass frame is moving slowly relative to the lab frame, the velocity in the lab frame is approximately the same. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77 c.

But let's check the numbers again. If in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has speed 0.769 c, and the center-of-mass frame is moving at v_cm = v / 2 relative to the lab frame. If the antiproton's velocity v is non-relativistic, say v << c, then v_cm ≈ v / 2 is also non-relativistic. Then, the velocity of an A particle in the lab frame moving in the same direction as the center-of-mass frame would be approximately v_cm + 0.769 c ≈ 0.769 c + v / 2. But since v is small, this is approximately 0.769 c. Similarly, an A particle moving opposite would have velocity -0.769 c + v / 2 ≈ -0.769 c. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, so depending on the direction, it could be either. But since the question doesn't specify, maybe it's asking for the speed, which would be approximately 0.77 c.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v. After the annihilation, the four A particles must have total energy E_total and total momentum p_total.

Assuming that the four A particles are emitted symmetrically, two in the forward direction and two in the backward direction, each with speed u. Then, the total momentum would be 2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_u m_A u = 0, which contradicts the initial momentum p_total. Therefore, this symmetry is not possible. Alternatively, three in one direction and one in the other, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, two A particles are emitted at an angle θ and two at -θ, such that the momentum components perpendicular to the initial direction cancel, and the components along the initial direction add up to p_total. But this requires knowing the angle θ, which is not given.

Alternatively, consider that all four A particles are emitted in the same direction as the initial antiproton's motion. Then, their total momentum is 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v. From energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + γ m_p c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so:

4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.563

Then, γ_A = 1.563, so v_A ≈ 0.769 c as before. Then, from momentum conservation:

4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v

But γ_A m_A = (2 m_p) / (4 c²) * c² = m_p / 2

Wait, no. From energy conservation:

4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A m_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 c²) = m_p / 2

So γ_A m_A = m_p / 2

Then, momentum conservation:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = 4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A = 2 m_p v_A = m_p v ⇒ v = 2 v_A

But from γ_A = 1.563, we have v_A ≈ 0.769 c, so v ≈ 1.538 c, which is impossible. Therefore, this configuration is not possible. Hence, the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid.

Therefore, the A particles must be moving in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum m_p v, but their velocities are such that no individual velocity exceeds c. This likely requires a more complex distribution of velocities. However, without additional information, it's difficult to proceed. 

Given that the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving", and given that the rest mass of the A particles is 300 MeV/c², which is less than the proton's rest mass (938 MeV/c²), perhaps the velocity of the A particles is determined purely by energy conservation in the center-of-mass frame, neglecting the initial momentum. Since the problem might be expecting a numerical answer, and given the earlier calculation in the center-of-mass frame gives v ≈ 0.769 c, which is approximately 0.77 c or 0.8 c. 

Alternatively, using the energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, but considering that the initial momentum is small. Let's try this.

In the lab frame:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ ≈ 1)

Initial momentum: p_initial ≈ m_p v

After annihilation:

Total energy: E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c²

Total momentum: p_final = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming all A particles move in the same direction)

But from energy conservation:

4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² ⇒ γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 1.563

So γ_A ≈ 1.563, leading to v_A ≈ 0.769 c as before. Then, from momentum conservation:

4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v ⇒ v ≈ (4 γ_A m_A v_A) / m_p

Substituting γ_A m_A = m_p / 2 from energy conservation:

v ≈ (4 * (m_p / 2) * v_A) / m_p = 2 v_A

But v_A ≈ 0.769 c ⇒ v ≈ 1.538 c, which is impossible. Therefore, this configuration is impossible, meaning that the A particles cannot all be moving in the same direction. Therefore, they must have some distribution of velocities. 

Perhaps two A particles move forward and two move backward with higher speed to compensate. Let's assume that two A particles move forward with speed u and two move backward with speed w. Then, total momentum:

2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_w m_A w = m_p v

Total energy:

2 γ_u m_A c² + 2 γ_w m_A c² = 2 m_p c²

This gives us two equations:

1) 2 γ_u m_A u - 2 γ_w m_A w = m_p v

2) 2 γ_u m_A c² + 2 γ_w m_A c² = 2 m_p c²

Divide equation 2 by 2 c²:

γ_u m_A + γ_w m_A = m_p

So γ_u + γ_w = m_p / m_A ≈ 938 / 300 ≈ 3.127

From equation 1:

2 m_A (γ_u u - γ_w w) = m_p v

But this is still complicated. If we assume that the backward-moving particles have negligible speed (w ≈ 0), then γ_w ≈ 1, and equation 2 becomes:

γ_u m_A + m_A ≈ m_p ⇒ γ_u ≈ (m_p / m_A) - 1 ≈ 3.127 - 1 ≈ 2.127

Then, γ_u ≈ 2.127 ⇒ u ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/2.127²) c ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/4.524) c ≈ sqrt(0.779) c ≈ 0.883 c

Then, from equation 1:

2 m_A (γ_u u - γ_w w) ≈ 2 m_A (γ_u u - 0) ≈ 2 m_A γ_u u = m_p v

So v ≈ (2 m_A γ_u u) / m_p ≈ (2 * 300 * 2.127 * 0.883) / 938 ≈ (2 * 300 * 1.879) / 938 ≈ (1127.4) / 938 ≈ 1.202 c

Again, impossible. So this assumption is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the backward-moving particles have speed such that their momentum cancels part of the forward momentum. But this is getting too involved. 

Given the time I've spent and the fact that this is a problem likely expecting an approximate answer, I think the intended approach is to consider the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, calculate the velocity there as approximately 0.77 c, and since the antiproton is moving slowly, the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame, so the velocity is about 0.77 c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute gamma for the A particle:

γ = 1.563

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/2.443) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) = c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769

Yes, so approximately 0.769 c. Rounding to two significant figures, 0.77 c.

Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

If all four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might not balance. Alternatively, they could be emitted symmetrically in all directions, but the problem might be considering a specific case where they have a particular velocity.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that all four A particles have the same speed. If that\'s the case, then their momenta vectors must add up to the initial momentum. If the initial momentum is small, maybe they can all have the same speed in the same direction, but that would require their total momentum to be 4γAmAvA = γmpv. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so maybe even a small velocity for the A particles would suffice. But this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if the annihilation occurs at rest (i.e., in the center-of-mass frame where total initial momentum is zero), then the products must have zero total momentum. In that case, the A particles would be emitted symmetrically. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the lab frame isn\'t the center-of-mass frame. Hmm.\n\nWait, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. The total momentum is then approximately m_p * v (since the antiproton\'s velocity is non-relativistic, so γ ≈ 1). The center-of-mass frame would have a velocity relative to the lab frame. Maybe I need to compute the velocity of the center-of-mass frame first.\n\nThe center-of-mass velocity (u) can be found by:\n\nu = (p_p + p_p̄) / (E_p + E_p̄) * c²\n\nSince the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c². The antiproton\'s momentum is p_p̄ = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, γ ≈ 1). Its energy is E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v². But since v is small, the kinetic energy is negligible, so E_p̄ ≈ m_p c². Therefore, the center-of-mass velocity u ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p c²) * c² = v/2. So the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame.\n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the center-of-mass frame is moving at half that speed. However, since the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," maybe we can take the limit as v approaches zero, so the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. But in reality, even a small velocity would mean the center-of-mass frame is moving. However, if the velocity is so small that the kinetic energy is negligible, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the center-of-mass energy is the same as the lab frame energy. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Then, the A particles would be produced at rest? But that can\'t be, because their rest mass energy is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So there\'s excess energy, so they must have kinetic energy.\n\nWait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c² (if the kinetic energy is negligible). Then, the available energy is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (676 MeV) is the kinetic energy. So each A particle would have kinetic energy of 676 / 4 ≈ 169 MeV. Then, using the relativistic kinetic energy formula K = (γ - 1) m c², we can solve for γ and then the velocity.\n\nBut wait, the kinetic energy is 169 MeV, and each A has rest mass 300 MeV. So:\n\n169 MeV = (γ - 1) * 300 MeV\n\nSo (γ - 1) = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.5633\n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 1.5633\n\nThen, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSo sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.5633 ≈ 0.64\n\nThen, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.64² ≈ 0.4096\n\nSo v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904\n\nv ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768 c\n\nSo approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nBut wait, this is assuming that all the kinetic energy is equally distributed among the four A particles. Is that a valid assumption? In particle physics, when particles are produced, they can have a range of energies and momenta, but in the center-of-mass frame, they must balance each other\'s momenta. However, if all four particles are identical in mass and produced symmetrically, perhaps they each have the same speed. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that would require their momenta to cancel. But if they are moving in all directions, but with the same speed, then the vector sum of their momenta would be zero. But in that case, each particle\'s momentum magnitude is the same, but directions vary. However, the problem might be simplifying this to a case where all particles move with the same speed in the same direction, but that would require some net momentum. But since the initial momentum in the center-of-mass frame is zero, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the only way for four particles to have zero total momentum is if their momenta vectors cancel out. If they are all moving in different directions, but with the same speed, that\'s possible. For example, two pairs moving in opposite directions. But in that case, each pair would have equal and opposite momenta, leading to a total momentum of zero. However, the kinetic energy would then be distributed among them. But if each particle has the same speed, then each would have the same kinetic energy. So maybe the assumption that each has 169 MeV of kinetic energy is valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. If we are in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², but the total momentum is non-zero (since the antiproton is moving). Therefore, the products must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum. However, if the initial momentum is small, then the products\' momenta must sum to that small value. But if the products have rest mass, their momenta can\'t be too small. This seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero, and the velocity of the A particles is calculated there. Then, the answer would be approximately 0.77c. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, so maybe that\'s the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me check the energy and momentum conservation again.\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v_p̄.\n\nAfter the reaction, we have four A particles. Let\'s assume they all have the same speed v (direction to be determined). Each A has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v.\n\nIf the four A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum equals p_total, then:\n\nSum of their momenta = 4 γ_A m_A v * direction = γ m_p v_p̄.\n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ ≈ 1, and p_total ≈ m_p v_p̄. If the A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, then:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v = m_p v_p̄.\n\nBut we also have energy conservation:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².\n\nSo 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² => γ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A).\n\nGiven that m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV and m_A c² = 300 MeV, so γ_A = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.\n\nThis is the same gamma as before. Then, using γ_A = 1.5633, we can solve for v.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ ≈ 0.64 => 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096 => v²/c² ≈ 0.5904 => v ≈ 0.768 c.\n\nSo the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.768c. But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. However, in reality, the total momentum of the system is p_total = m_p v_p̄. If the A particles are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 γ_A m_A v. But according to energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, combining these two equations:\n\nFrom energy: γ_A = m_p / (2 m_A)\n\nFrom momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v = m_p v_p̄\n\nSubstituting γ_A from energy into momentum equation:\n\n4 * (m_p / (2 m_A)) * m_A v = m_p v_p̄\n\nSimplify: 4 * (m_p / 2) * v = m_p v_p̄ => 2 m_p v = m_p v_p̄ => 2 v = v_p̄\n\nSo the velocity of each A particle is half the velocity of the antiproton. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly. If the A particles are moving at half that speed, then they are also moving slowly. But according to our previous calculation, their velocity is 0.768c, which is relativistic. There\'s a contradiction here.\n\nWait, this suggests that if the A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, their velocity is half the antiproton\'s velocity. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the A particles would also move slowly. However, our earlier calculation using energy conservation gave a relativistic speed. This inconsistency arises because we made conflicting assumptions. Let me check where the mistake is.\n\nIf we take the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. Then, the total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ_p̄ m_p v_p̄.\n\nAfter annihilation, the four A particles have total energy E_total = 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming all moving in the same direction).\n\nSo equating energies:\n\n4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c²\n\nEquating momenta:\n\n4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ_p̄ m_p v_p̄\n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ_p̄ ≈ 1, and v_p̄ is small. So:\n\nEnergy: 4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² => γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = m_p / (2 m_A) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633\n\nMomentum: 4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p̄\n\nBut from energy, γ_A ≈ 1.5633, so:\n\nv_A ≈ (m_p v_p̄) / (4 γ_A m_A)\n\nSubstituting m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c², γ_A ≈ 1.5633:\n\nv_A ≈ (938 v_p̄) / (4 * 1.5633 * 300) ≈ (938 / (4 * 1.5633 * 300)) v_p̄\n\nCalculate denominator: 4 * 1.5633 ≈ 6.2532; 6.2532 * 300 ≈ 1875.96\n\nSo v_A ≈ (938 / 1875.96) v_p̄ ≈ 0.5 v_p̄\n\nTherefore, v_A ≈ 0.5 v_p̄. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v_A is also small. However, our previous calculation using γ_A ≈ 1.5633 gives v_A ≈ 0.768c, which is not small. This inconsistency suggests that the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid when the antiproton is moving slowly. Because if the A particles have to move at 0.768c to satisfy energy conservation, but their momentum would then be 4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768c / c² ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 / c. Wait, units are a bit messy here. Let\'s use natural units where c=1.\n\nIn natural units, m_p = 938 MeV, m_A = 300 MeV, v_p̄ is small (non-relativistic), so γ_p̄ ≈ 1. Then:\n\nEnergy conservation: 4 γ_A * 300 = 938 + 938 = 1876 => γ_A = 1876 / (4 * 300) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633\n\nMomentum conservation: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄\n\nBut m_p = 938, m_A = 300, γ_A ≈ 1.5633:\n\n4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A = 938 * v_p̄\n\nSo v_A = (938 / (4 * 1.5633 * 300)) * v_p̄ ≈ (938 / 1875.96) * v_p̄ ≈ 0.5 * v_p̄\n\nBut from γ_A = 1.5633, we can compute v_A:\n\nγ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A²) => sqrt(1 - v_A²) = 1 / 1.5633 ≈ 0.64 => 1 - v_A² ≈ 0.4096 => v_A² ≈ 0.5904 => v_A ≈ 0.768\n\nBut according to momentum conservation, v_A ≈ 0.5 v_p̄. Therefore, combining these two results:\n\n0.768 ≈ 0.5 v_p̄ => v_p̄ ≈ 1.536\n\nBut in natural units, v cannot exceed 1 (c). So v_p̄ ≈ 1.536c, which is impossible. This contradiction shows that our initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton is invalid because it leads to a contradiction (antiproton moving faster than light). Therefore, the correct approach must involve the A particles moving in different directions such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum, but their individual speeds are determined by energy conservation.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. In that case, the products must have zero total momentum. Therefore, the four A particles would be emitted symmetrically. If they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions, each pair cancels the other\'s momentum. For simplicity, assume each A particle has the same speed. Then, their momenta vectors would cancel out. For example, two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with equal speeds. In this case, each A particle\'s energy is γ m_A c², and the total energy is 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633. Then, as before, γ = 1.5633, leading to v ≈ 0.768c. This seems consistent.\n\nBut in this case, the center-of-mass frame is different from the lab frame. The problem states the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton at rest). Therefore, the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame. To find the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame, we need to perform a Lorentz transformation from the center-of-mass frame to the lab frame.\n\nThis complicates things. Let\'s recap:\n\n1. In the lab frame: proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly.\n2. Total energy: E_lab = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ_p̄ ≈ 1)\n3. Total momentum: p_lab ≈ m_p v_p̄ (non-relativistic antiproton)\n4. In the center-of-mass frame: total momentum is zero. The energy is the same as the total energy in the lab frame divided by gamma of the boost. Wait, no. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt((E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2). Since p_lab is small, E_cm ≈ E_lab - (p_lab c)^2 / (2 E_lab). But since p_lab is small, E_cm ≈ E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c².\n\nBut actually, the center-of-mass energy is calculated as:\n\nE_cm² = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2\n\nSince E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c² and p_lab ≈ m_p v_p̄, then:\n\nE_cm² ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p̄ c)^2\n\nBut since v_p̄ is small, the second term is negligible, so E_cm ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the products\' total energy is this. Then, in the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are produced at rest? No, because their rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the center-of-mass energy is 1876 MeV, so they must have kinetic energy. Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has energy 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV. Since each A has rest mass 300 MeV, their gamma factor is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633, leading to velocity ≈ 0.768c as before.\n\nBut the problem asks for the velocity of particle A in the lab frame. To find this, we need to boost the velocity from the center-of-mass frame to the lab frame. The center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame. Earlier, we found u ≈ v_p̄ / 2. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, u is small. But if u is small, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately their velocity in the center-of-mass frame plus u. However, since velocities don\'t add linearly in relativity, we need to use the velocity addition formula.\n\nThe velocity addition formula is:\n\nv_lab = (v_cm + u) / (1 + (v_cm u)/c²)\n\nIf u is small (non-relativistic), then this approximates to v_lab ≈ v_cm + u. But since u is small, the correction term (v_cm u)/c² is negligible.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are moving with velocity v_cm ≈ 0.768c in various directions. When we boost to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity u ≈ v_p̄ / 2 relative to the center-of-mass frame, the velocities of the A particles will depend on their direction. For example, an A particle moving in the same direction as the boost (same as the antiproton\'s motion) will have a higher speed in the lab frame, while one moving opposite will have a lower speed. However, the problem states "the velocity of particle A," which might imply the speed, not the direction. But since the problem doesn\'t specify direction, maybe it\'s asking for the magnitude of the velocity in the lab frame. However, this would vary depending on the direction. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that in the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are emitted isotropically, but the question might be expecting the answer in the center-of-mass frame, assuming symmetry.\n\nBut the problem says "the velocity of particle A" without specifying the frame. Since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame, and the proton is at rest, the lab frame is specified. However, calculating the velocity in the lab frame would require knowing the direction of the A particle\'s velocity in the center-of-mass frame. If we assume that the A particles are emitted isotropically in the center-of-mass frame, then in the lab frame, their velocities would be a combination of the center-of-mass velocity and their own velocity. However, without knowing the emission angle, we can\'t determine the exact velocity. Therefore, the problem might be simplifying to the center-of-mass frame, where the velocity is 0.768c, and the answer is expected in that frame. But the problem doesn\'t specify the frame, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the entire rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is converted into the energy of the A particles, with the assumption that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. Then, using conservation of energy and momentum, but since the initial momentum is not zero, this complicates things. However, if we assume that the initial momentum is negligible (since the antiproton is moving slowly), then the problem reduces to the center-of-mass frame scenario where the velocity of the A particles is 0.768c.\n\nGiven that the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," and doesn\'t provide any specific velocity or kinetic energy, it\'s likely that we\'re supposed to assume the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the A particles are produced with kinetic energy such that their total energy is 2 m_p c². Then, each A particle has energy 469 MeV, leading to γ ≈ 1.5633 and velocity ≈ 0.768c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c. To be precise, let\'s calculate it again:\n\nγ = 1.5633\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nsqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ ≈ 0.64\n\n1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096\n\nv²/c² ≈ 0.5904\n\nv ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.7683c\n\nSo approximately 0.768c. Rounding to two significant figures, since m_A is given as 300 MeV (two sig figs), the answer would be 0.77c. However, sometimes in physics problems, they might expect an exact form. Let\'s see:\n\nFrom γ = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...\n\nThen, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = c * sqrt(1 - (300/469)²)\n\nCalculate (300/469)² ≈ (0.63966)² ≈ 0.4092\n\nSo 1 - 0.4092 ≈ 0.5908\n\nsqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686\n\nSo v ≈ 0.7686c, which is approximately 0.77c or 0.769c.\n\nAlternatively, using more precise calculations:\n\nγ = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 = 1.563333...\n\n1/γ ≈ 0.63936\n\n1/γ² ≈ 0.4087\n\n1 - 1/γ² ≈ 0.5913\n\nsqrt(0.5913) ≈ 0.769\n\nSo v ≈ 0.769c\n\nTherefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. Suppose we use energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton\'s kinetic energy is negligible. Then, the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately m_p v_p̄, where v_p̄ is small. The four A particles must have total energy 2 m_p c² and total momentum m_p v_p̄.\n\nIf we assume that the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta are balanced except for a small net momentum m_p v_p̄, but this seems complicated. However, if the A particles are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy would be (1/2) m_A v² each, but given that their rest mass is 300 MeV and the available kinetic energy is 676 MeV, they must be relativistic. Therefore, the previous approach using the center-of-mass frame is more appropriate.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn\'t specify the frame, but mentions the antiproton is moving slowly (implying the lab frame is the proton\'s rest frame), but the calculation in the lab frame leads to a contradiction unless we consider the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is likely the velocity in the center-of-mass frame, which is approximately 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using classical physics, but given the high velocities involved (relativistic speeds), that\'s unlikely. The mass of the A particle is 300 MeV/c², and the total energy per A is 469 MeV, which is relativistic.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.77c. To express this as a numerical value:\n\nv ≈ 0.77c\n\nBut let\'s verify once more. The key steps are:\n\n1. Total energy in center-of-mass frame: 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV\n2. Total rest mass of four A particles: 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV\n3. Total kinetic energy: 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV\n4. Kinetic energy per A particle: 676 / 4 = 169 MeV\n5. Relate kinetic energy to velocity: K = (γ - 1) m_A c²\n6. 169 = (γ - 1) * 300 => γ = 1 + 169/300 ≈ 1.5633\n7. Calculate velocity from γ: v ≈ 0.768c\n\nYes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447343, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6434, prompt_tokens=1079, total_tokens=7513, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The velocity of particle A is determined by analyzing the annihilation process in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy available from the proton-antiproton system (assuming the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible) is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = 2m_p c^2 = 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Rest Mass of Products**:  
   The total rest mass energy of the four A particles is:  
   \[
   4m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

3. **Kinetic Energy Distribution**:  
   The remaining energy is converted into kinetic energy:  
   \[
   K_{\text{total}} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}
   \]  
   Each A particle receives:  
   \[
   K_A = \frac{676}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

4. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   Using \( K = (\gamma - 1)m_A c^2 \):  
   \[
   169 = (\gamma - 1) \times 300 \implies \gamma = 1 + \frac{169}{300} \approx 1.5633
   \]

5. **Velocity Calculation**:  
   Relate \(\gamma\) to velocity:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \implies v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(\gamma \approx 1.5633\):  
   \[
   v \approx c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx 0.768c
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The velocity of particle A is approximately \(\boxed{0.77c}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

If the products have to carry away this momentum, but they have rest mass, their velocities can't be too low.

Alternatively, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the products must have zero total momentum. If all four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might not balance. Alternatively, they could be emitted symmetrically in all directions, but the problem might be considering a specific case where they have a particular velocity.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that all four A particles have the same speed. If that's the case, then their momenta vectors must add up to the initial momentum. If the initial momentum is small, maybe they can all have the same speed in the same direction, but that would require their total momentum to be 4γAmAvA = γmpv. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so maybe even a small velocity for the A particles would suffice. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, if the annihilation occurs at rest (i.e., in the center-of-mass frame where total initial momentum is zero), then the products must have zero total momentum. In that case, the A particles would be emitted symmetrically. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the lab frame isn't the center-of-mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. The total momentum is then approximately m_p * v (since the antiproton's velocity is non-relativistic, so γ ≈ 1). The center-of-mass frame would have a velocity relative to the lab frame. Maybe I need to compute the velocity of the center-of-mass frame first.

The center-of-mass velocity (u) can be found by:

u = (p_p + p_p̄) / (E_p + E_p̄) * c²

Since the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c². The antiproton's momentum is p_p̄ = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, γ ≈ 1). Its energy is E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v². But since v is small, the kinetic energy is negligible, so E_p̄ ≈ m_p c². Therefore, the center-of-mass velocity u ≈ (m_p v) / (2 m_p c²) * c² = v/2. So the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame.

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the center-of-mass frame is moving at half that speed. However, since the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," maybe we can take the limit as v approaches zero, so the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. But in reality, even a small velocity would mean the center-of-mass frame is moving. However, if the velocity is so small that the kinetic energy is negligible, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the center-of-mass energy is the same as the lab frame energy. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Then, the A particles would be produced at rest? But that can't be, because their rest mass energy is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial energy is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So there's excess energy, so they must have kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c² (if the kinetic energy is negligible). Then, the available energy is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (676 MeV) is the kinetic energy. So each A particle would have kinetic energy of 676 / 4 ≈ 169 MeV. Then, using the relativistic kinetic energy formula K = (γ - 1) m c², we can solve for γ and then the velocity.

But wait, the kinetic energy is 169 MeV, and each A has rest mass 300 MeV. So:

169 MeV = (γ - 1) * 300 MeV

So (γ - 1) = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.5633

Therefore, γ ≈ 1.5633

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 1.5633 ≈ 0.64

Then, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.64² ≈ 0.4096

So v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904

v ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768 c

So approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But wait, this is assuming that all the kinetic energy is equally distributed among the four A particles. Is that a valid assumption? In particle physics, when particles are produced, they can have a range of energies and momenta, but in the center-of-mass frame, they must balance each other's momenta. However, if all four particles are identical in mass and produced symmetrically, perhaps they each have the same speed. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that would require their momenta to cancel. But if they are moving in all directions, but with the same speed, then the vector sum of their momenta would be zero. But in that case, each particle's momentum magnitude is the same, but directions vary. However, the problem might be simplifying this to a case where all particles move with the same speed in the same direction, but that would require some net momentum. But since the initial momentum in the center-of-mass frame is zero, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the only way for four particles to have zero total momentum is if their momenta vectors cancel out. If they are all moving in different directions, but with the same speed, that's possible. For example, two pairs moving in opposite directions. But in that case, each pair would have equal and opposite momenta, leading to a total momentum of zero. However, the kinetic energy would then be distributed among them. But if each particle has the same speed, then each would have the same kinetic energy. So maybe the assumption that each has 169 MeV of kinetic energy is valid.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. If we are in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², but the total momentum is non-zero (since the antiproton is moving). Therefore, the products must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum. However, if the initial momentum is small, then the products' momenta must sum to that small value. But if the products have rest mass, their momenta can't be too small. This seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame, where the total momentum is zero, and the velocity of the A particles is calculated there. Then, the answer would be approximately 0.77c. But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, so maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me check the energy and momentum conservation again.

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v_p̄.

After the reaction, we have four A particles. Let's assume they all have the same speed v (direction to be determined). Each A has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v.

If the four A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum equals p_total, then:

Sum of their momenta = 4 γ_A m_A v * direction = γ m_p v_p̄.

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ ≈ 1, and p_total ≈ m_p v_p̄. If the A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, then:

4 γ_A m_A v = m_p v_p̄.

But we also have energy conservation:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² => γ_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A).

Given that m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV and m_A c² = 300 MeV, so γ_A = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

This is the same gamma as before. Then, using γ_A = 1.5633, we can solve for v.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ ≈ 0.64 => 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096 => v²/c² ≈ 0.5904 => v ≈ 0.768 c.

So the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.768c. But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. However, in reality, the total momentum of the system is p_total = m_p v_p̄. If the A particles are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 γ_A m_A v. But according to energy conservation, 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, combining these two equations:

From energy: γ_A = m_p / (2 m_A)

From momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v = m_p v_p̄

Substituting γ_A from energy into momentum equation:

4 * (m_p / (2 m_A)) * m_A v = m_p v_p̄

Simplify: 4 * (m_p / 2) * v = m_p v_p̄ => 2 m_p v = m_p v_p̄ => 2 v = v_p̄

So the velocity of each A particle is half the velocity of the antiproton. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly. If the A particles are moving at half that speed, then they are also moving slowly. But according to our previous calculation, their velocity is 0.768c, which is relativistic. There's a contradiction here.

Wait, this suggests that if the A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton, their velocity is half the antiproton's velocity. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the A particles would also move slowly. However, our earlier calculation using energy conservation gave a relativistic speed. This inconsistency arises because we made conflicting assumptions. Let me check where the mistake is.

If we take the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. Then, the total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

After annihilation, the four A particles have total energy E_total = 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming all moving in the same direction).

So equating energies:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c²

Equating momenta:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ_p̄ m_p v_p̄

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then γ_p̄ ≈ 1, and v_p̄ is small. So:

Energy: 4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² => γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = m_p / (2 m_A) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633

Momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p̄

But from energy, γ_A ≈ 1.5633, so:

v_A ≈ (m_p v_p̄) / (4 γ_A m_A)

Substituting m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c², γ_A ≈ 1.5633:

v_A ≈ (938 v_p̄) / (4 * 1.5633 * 300) ≈ (938 / (4 * 1.5633 * 300)) v_p̄

Calculate denominator: 4 * 1.5633 ≈ 6.2532; 6.2532 * 300 ≈ 1875.96

So v_A ≈ (938 / 1875.96) v_p̄ ≈ 0.5 v_p̄

Therefore, v_A ≈ 0.5 v_p̄. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v_A is also small. However, our previous calculation using γ_A ≈ 1.5633 gives v_A ≈ 0.768c, which is not small. This inconsistency suggests that the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid when the antiproton is moving slowly. Because if the A particles have to move at 0.768c to satisfy energy conservation, but their momentum would then be 4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768c / c² ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 / c. Wait, units are a bit messy here. Let's use natural units where c=1.

In natural units, m_p = 938 MeV, m_A = 300 MeV, v_p̄ is small (non-relativistic), so γ_p̄ ≈ 1. Then:

Energy conservation: 4 γ_A * 300 = 938 + 938 = 1876 => γ_A = 1876 / (4 * 300) ≈ 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633

Momentum conservation: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄

But m_p = 938, m_A = 300, γ_A ≈ 1.5633:

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A = 938 * v_p̄

So v_A = (938 / (4 * 1.5633 * 300)) * v_p̄ ≈ (938 / 1875.96) * v_p̄ ≈ 0.5 * v_p̄

But from γ_A = 1.5633, we can compute v_A:

γ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A²) => sqrt(1 - v_A²) = 1 / 1.5633 ≈ 0.64 => 1 - v_A² ≈ 0.4096 => v_A² ≈ 0.5904 => v_A ≈ 0.768

But according to momentum conservation, v_A ≈ 0.5 v_p̄. Therefore, combining these two results:

0.768 ≈ 0.5 v_p̄ => v_p̄ ≈ 1.536

But in natural units, v cannot exceed 1 (c). So v_p̄ ≈ 1.536c, which is impossible. This contradiction shows that our initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the antiproton is invalid because it leads to a contradiction (antiproton moving faster than light). Therefore, the correct approach must involve the A particles moving in different directions such that their total momentum equals the initial momentum, but their individual speeds are determined by energy conservation.

This suggests that the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. In that case, the products must have zero total momentum. Therefore, the four A particles would be emitted symmetrically. If they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions, each pair cancels the other's momentum. For simplicity, assume each A particle has the same speed. Then, their momenta vectors would cancel out. For example, two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with equal speeds. In this case, each A particle's energy is γ m_A c², and the total energy is 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = m_p / (2 m_A) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633. Then, as before, γ = 1.5633, leading to v ≈ 0.768c. This seems consistent.

But in this case, the center-of-mass frame is different from the lab frame. The problem states the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton at rest). Therefore, the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame. To find the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame, we need to perform a Lorentz transformation from the center-of-mass frame to the lab frame.

This complicates things. Let's recap:

1. In the lab frame: proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly.
2. Total energy: E_lab = m_p c² + γ_p̄ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ_p̄ ≈ 1)
3. Total momentum: p_lab ≈ m_p v_p̄ (non-relativistic antiproton)
4. In the center-of-mass frame: total momentum is zero. The energy is the same as the total energy in the lab frame divided by gamma of the boost. Wait, no. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt((E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2). Since p_lab is small, E_cm ≈ E_lab - (p_lab c)^2 / (2 E_lab). But since p_lab is small, E_cm ≈ E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c².

But actually, the center-of-mass energy is calculated as:

E_cm² = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2

Since E_lab ≈ 2 m_p c² and p_lab ≈ m_p v_p̄, then:

E_cm² ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v_p̄ c)^2

But since v_p̄ is small, the second term is negligible, so E_cm ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the products' total energy is this. Then, in the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are produced at rest? No, because their rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the center-of-mass energy is 1876 MeV, so they must have kinetic energy. Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has energy 1876 / 4 = 469 MeV. Since each A has rest mass 300 MeV, their gamma factor is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633, leading to velocity ≈ 0.768c as before.

But the problem asks for the velocity of particle A in the lab frame. To find this, we need to boost the velocity from the center-of-mass frame to the lab frame. The center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame. Earlier, we found u ≈ v_p̄ / 2. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, u is small. But if u is small, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be approximately their velocity in the center-of-mass frame plus u. However, since velocities don't add linearly in relativity, we need to use the velocity addition formula.

The velocity addition formula is:

v_lab = (v_cm + u) / (1 + (v_cm u)/c²)

If u is small (non-relativistic), then this approximates to v_lab ≈ v_cm + u. But since u is small, the correction term (v_cm u)/c² is negligible.

In the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are moving with velocity v_cm ≈ 0.768c in various directions. When we boost to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity u ≈ v_p̄ / 2 relative to the center-of-mass frame, the velocities of the A particles will depend on their direction. For example, an A particle moving in the same direction as the boost (same as the antiproton's motion) will have a higher speed in the lab frame, while one moving opposite will have a lower speed. However, the problem states "the velocity of particle A," which might imply the speed, not the direction. But since the problem doesn't specify direction, maybe it's asking for the magnitude of the velocity in the lab frame. However, this would vary depending on the direction. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that in the center-of-mass frame, the A particles are emitted isotropically, but the question might be expecting the answer in the center-of-mass frame, assuming symmetry.

But the problem says "the velocity of particle A" without specifying the frame. Since the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame, and the proton is at rest, the lab frame is specified. However, calculating the velocity in the lab frame would require knowing the direction of the A particle's velocity in the center-of-mass frame. If we assume that the A particles are emitted isotropically in the center-of-mass frame, then in the lab frame, their velocities would be a combination of the center-of-mass velocity and their own velocity. However, without knowing the emission angle, we can't determine the exact velocity. Therefore, the problem might be simplifying to the center-of-mass frame, where the velocity is 0.768c, and the answer is expected in that frame. But the problem doesn't specify the frame, which is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the entire rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is converted into the energy of the A particles, with the assumption that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. Then, using conservation of energy and momentum, but since the initial momentum is not zero, this complicates things. However, if we assume that the initial momentum is negligible (since the antiproton is moving slowly), then the problem reduces to the center-of-mass frame scenario where the velocity of the A particles is 0.768c.

Given that the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," and doesn't provide any specific velocity or kinetic energy, it's likely that we're supposed to assume the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the A particles are produced with kinetic energy such that their total energy is 2 m_p c². Then, each A particle has energy 469 MeV, leading to γ ≈ 1.5633 and velocity ≈ 0.768c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c. To be precise, let's calculate it again:

γ = 1.5633

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ ≈ 0.64

1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.4096

v²/c² ≈ 0.5904

v ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.7683c

So approximately 0.768c. Rounding to two significant figures, since m_A is given as 300 MeV (two sig figs), the answer would be 0.77c. However, sometimes in physics problems, they might expect an exact form. Let's see:

From γ = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...

Then, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = c * sqrt(1 - (300/469)²)

Calculate (300/469)² ≈ (0.63966)² ≈ 0.4092

So 1 - 0.4092 ≈ 0.5908

sqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686

So v ≈ 0.7686c, which is approximately 0.77c or 0.769c.

Alternatively, using more precise calculations:

γ = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 = 1.563333...

1/γ ≈ 0.63936

1/γ² ≈ 0.4087

1 - 1/γ² ≈ 0.5913

sqrt(0.5913) ≈ 0.769

So v ≈ 0.769c

Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But let me check if there's another approach. Suppose we use energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. Then, the total energy is 2 m_p c², and the total momentum is approximately m_p v_p̄, where v_p̄ is small. The four A particles must have total energy 2 m_p c² and total momentum m_p v_p̄.

If we assume that the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta are balanced except for a small net momentum m_p v_p̄, but this seems complicated. However, if the A particles are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy would be (1/2) m_A v² each, but given that their rest mass is 300 MeV and the available kinetic energy is 676 MeV, they must be relativistic. Therefore, the previous approach using the center-of-mass frame is more appropriate.

Given that the problem doesn't specify the frame, but mentions the antiproton is moving slowly (implying the lab frame is the proton's rest frame), but the calculation in the lab frame leads to a contradiction unless we consider the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is likely the velocity in the center-of-mass frame, which is approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using classical physics, but given the high velocities involved (relativistic speeds), that's unlikely. The mass of the A particle is 300 MeV/c², and the total energy per A is 469 MeV, which is relativistic.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.77c. To express this as a numerical value:

v ≈ 0.77c

But let's verify once more. The key steps are:

1. Total energy in center-of-mass frame: 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV
2. Total rest mass of four A particles: 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV
3. Total kinetic energy: 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV
4. Kinetic energy per A particle: 676 / 4 = 169 MeV
5. Relate kinetic energy to velocity: K = (γ - 1) m_A c²
6. 169 = (γ - 1) * 300 => γ = 1 + 169/300 ≈ 1.5633
7. Calculate velocity from γ: v ≈ 0.768c

Yes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

Then, each A particle would have the same speed, but directions opposite. But with four particles, perhaps two pairs moving in opposite directions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is designed for a simple answer, perhaps using energy conservation and assuming that all kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass of the A particles. But that can\'t be, since the initial rest mass is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV, and the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, so there\'s 676 MeV of energy left. So, the A particles must have kinetic energy. But how much?\n\nAlternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c² (if the antiproton is moving slowly, so the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame). Then, the products must have total energy 2 m_p c². Each A particle\'s energy would be E = γ m_A c². Since there are four particles, 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1.563.

But in reality, in the center-of-mass frame, they could be moving in different directions but with the same speed. If the problem is symmetric, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but each with the same speed. But in that case, the total momentum would cancel out, which is necessary in the center-of-mass frame. So, each A particle would have the same speed, but opposite directions. So, the velocity magnitude would be the same for all, but directions vary. So, the speed would be 0.77c. But let\'s check the calculation again.\n\nWait, but the initial energy is 2 m_p c². The total energy of the four A particles is 4 γ m_A c². So, 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = (m_p)/(2 m_A). Since m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c². So, γ = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563. So, yes, that\'s correct. Then, γ ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) as above. So, 0.77c. So, approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Let me verify. If each A particle has gamma = 1.563, then their total energy is 4 * 1.563 * 300 = 4 * 468.9 ≈ 1875.6 MeV, which is approximately 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So, that checks out. So, the energy is conserved. Momentum: in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So, if the four A particles are arranged such that their momenta cancel out, then momentum is conserved. For example, two moving in +x and two in -x with equal speeds. Each A particle\'s momentum is γ m_A v. So, two in one direction and two in the opposite would cancel. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c. But let me compute the exact value.\n\nGiven γ = 1.563, then:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/2.443) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) = c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.7688 ≈ 0.769c.\n\nSo, approximately 0.77c. But maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let\'s compute sqrt(0.591):\n\nsqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688. So, 0.7688c. Rounded to two decimal places, 0.77c. Alternatively, 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nBut let me check if this approach is correct. The key assumption is that in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles each have the same speed. But in reality, they could have different speeds but arranged in such a way that their momenta cancel. However, given the symmetry of the problem (two A+ and two A-), it\'s reasonable to assume that they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions with the same speed. Therefore, each pair cancels the other\'s momentum, leading to total momentum zero. So, each A particle would have the same speed. Therefore, the calculation is valid.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum is not zero. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small. However, the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might imply that its kinetic energy is negligible. If so, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v, where v is the antiproton\'s velocity. But if v is very small, then the initial momentum is small, and the products must have a total momentum equal to that. However, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the products must have zero total momentum, which would again lead us to the center-of-mass frame scenario. But if the initial momentum is not negligible, then the products would have some net momentum. However, given that the problem does not specify the antiproton\'s velocity, but only states it\'s "slowly moving," perhaps we can assume that the initial momentum is negligible, and the problem is effectively in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Let\'s use energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has energy E = γ m_p c², where γ ≈ 1 (since it\'s moving slowly). Therefore, total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². The initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since γ ≈ 1). After annihilation, the four A particles have total energy 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total. So, energy conservation: 4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ_A ≈ (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563, same as before. Then, velocity of each A is v_A = c sqrt(1 - 1/γ_A²) ≈ 0.77c. But momentum conservation: p_initial = p_total. If p_initial ≈ m_p v, then the total momentum of the four A particles must equal m_p v. However, if the A particles are moving symmetrically, their momenta could cancel, but if there\'s a net momentum, they must have some directionality. But since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the net momentum is small, and the velocities of the A particles are dominated by the energy from the annihilation. However, without knowing the exact velocity of the antiproton, we can\'t calculate the exact net momentum. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial momentum is negligible, so the A particles are produced at rest. But that can\'t be, because their rest mass is less than the initial energy. Alternatively, the problem might be designed to ignore the initial momentum and consider the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let\'s think about threshold energy. The minimum energy required for a reaction to occur is when all the products are at rest. But in this case, the products can\'t be at rest because their rest mass is less than the initial energy. Wait, the rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So, the initial rest energy is higher than the products\' rest energy, so the reaction can occur even at rest. Therefore, the excess energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the A particles must have kinetic energy. Therefore, their velocity is determined by the gamma factor as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using relativistic energy and momentum conservation. Let\'s denote variables:\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has velocity v_p. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v_p.\n\nAfter annihilation, four A particles. Let\'s assume they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions. Let\'s say two A+ and two A- each moving in opposite directions with speed u. Then, each A particle has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A u. Since two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, total momentum is 2 γ_A m_A u - 2 γ_A m_A u = 0. But the initial momentum was γ m_p v_p. Therefore, unless the initial momentum is zero, this can\'t hold. Therefore, if the initial momentum is not zero, the A particles must have some net momentum. But since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small, but not zero. However, without knowing the exact velocity, we can\'t compute the exact velocity of the A particles. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, leading to the A particles moving symmetrically with velocity 0.77c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use the rest frame of the proton and antiproton combined, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles is approximately 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let\'s think about the rest frame of the proton and antiproton. The total rest energy is 2 m_p c². When they annihilate, they produce four particles each with mass 300 MeV/c². The total energy available is 2 m_p c², so each A particle would have energy E = (2 m_p c²)/4 = m_p c² / 2. Then, the kinetic energy of each A particle is E - m_A c² = (m_p / 2 - m_A) c². Plugging in m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c², so KE = (469 - 300) MeV = 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A is 469 MeV. Then, gamma = E / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) c ≈ 0.77c. So, same result. Therefore, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. To express this as a numerical value, 0.77c. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of a fraction or a decimal. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nGiven gamma = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...\n\nThen, 1/gamma² = (300/469)^2 ≈ (0.63966)^2 ≈ 0.4092\n\n1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908\n\nsqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686\n\nSo, approximately 0.7686c. Rounding to two decimal places, 0.77c. Alternatively, as a fraction, sqrt(1 - (600/938)^2). Wait, let\'s compute gamma again:\n\ngamma = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) = 938 / 600 = 1.563333...\n\nSo, gamma = 1.563333...\n\nThen, 1/gamma² = 1/((938/600)^2) = (600/938)^2 ≈ (0.63966)^2 ≈ 0.4092\n\nSo, 1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908\n\nsqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686c. So, approximately 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, if we use exact fractions:\n\ngamma = 938 / 600 = 469 / 300\n\ngamma² = (469)^2 / (300)^2 = 219, 961 / 90,000 ≈ 2.444...\n\nSo, 1/gamma² = 90,000 / 219,961 ≈ 0.4092\n\nSame as before.\n\nTherefore, the velocity is sqrt(1 - 0.4092) c = sqrt(0.5908) c ≈ 0.7686c.\n\nExpressed as a decimal, approximately 0.77c. If we need more precision, 0.769c, but likely 0.77c is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a beta value (beta = v/c), then beta ≈ 0.77.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach where the kinetic energy is shared among the four particles. Let\'s see:\n\nTotal rest mass energy of products: 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.\n\nTotal energy available: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.\n\nIf this KE is equally shared among four particles, each has 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, gamma = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, leading to the same velocity. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a possible mistake here. For example, if the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, then the total energy is not just 2 m_p c². The antiproton\'s kinetic energy adds to the total energy. However, the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might mean that its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v, where v is small. However, if the initial momentum is not zero, then the products must have a net momentum equal to m_p v. But since the problem doesn\'t specify the antiproton\'s velocity, we can\'t calculate the exact velocity of the A particles in the lab frame. Therefore, the problem must be intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, leading to the velocity calculated as 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in the lab frame and the antiproton\'s velocity is so small that its kinetic energy is negligible, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v. But since v is small, the initial momentum is small. However, the products must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. If the A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum is m_p v, but since m_p v is small, their velocities are still approximately 0.77c. But this complicates things. Without knowing the exact value of v, we can\'t proceed. Therefore, the problem must assume that the initial momentum is negligible, so the velocity is 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use non-relativistic mechanics, but given the high rest mass of the A particles (300 MeV) compared to the available energy (each A has 469 MeV), the velocity is relativistic, so non-relativistic calculations would be invalid. Therefore, the relativistic approach is necessary.\n\nTherefore, after thorough consideration, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. So, the answer is 0.77c. But let me check if there\'s a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: the annihilation of proton and antiproton typically produces other particles, but in this case, it\'s producing four A particles. The key is that the total energy and momentum must be conserved. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, the total energy is m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c². The total momentum is γ m_p v ≈ m_p v. If the velocity v is very small, then the momentum is small. However, the products must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. If the A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum is m_p v, but since m_p v is small, the velocities of the A particles would be slightly different.

Therefore, the problem must be assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, so the products have zero total momentum, leading to the velocity of 0.77c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the rest energy of the proton and antiproton converting into the kinetic energy of the A particles. But that\'s not correct, because the A particles have rest mass. The total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial rest mass of 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. Therefore, the excess energy (676 MeV) is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, each A particle has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, using KE = (γ - 1) m_A c², so 169 = (γ - 1) * 300. Therefore, γ - 1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.563, so γ ≈ 1.563. Then, same as before. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/1.563²) c ≈ 0.77c. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the velocity is approximately 0.77c. Therefore, the answer is 0.77c. But to check if there\'s a different way, perhaps using invariant quantities.\n\nThe invariant mass squared is s = (E_total/c²)^2 - (p_total c)^2. In the lab frame, s = (m_p + γ m_p)^2 - (γ m_p v)^2 c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so s ≈ (2 m_p)^2 - (m_p v)^2 c². But since v is small, the second term is negligible, so s ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2. Then, in the center-of-mass frame, s = (E_total)^2 = (2 m_p c²)^2. Therefore, the invariant mass is 2 m_p c². Then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c², which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c. So, the answer is 0.77 times the speed of light.

Given the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is slowly moving and the mass of each \( A \) particle is \( 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), we need to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible.
   - The total energy in the lab frame (approximately the center-of-mass frame) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton: \( 2m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

2. **Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy after annihilation is converted into the rest energy and kinetic energy of the four \( A \) particles.
   - The total rest energy of the four \( A \) particles is \( 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The remaining energy is the kinetic energy: \( 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV} \).

3. **Relativistic Energy and Velocity**:
   - Each \( A \) particle has an energy of \( \frac{2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) for each \( A \) particle is \( \gamma = \frac{469 \, \text{MeV}}{300 \, \text{MeV}} \approx 1.563 \).
   - Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The velocity of each \( A \) particle is approximately \( 0.77 \) times the speed of light.

\[
\boxed{0.77c}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

If the initial momentum is negligible, then the products must have zero net momentum, so pairs moving in opposite directions. Then, each A particle would have the same speed, but directions opposite. But with four particles, perhaps two pairs moving in opposite directions. But how?

Alternatively, if the problem is designed for a simple answer, perhaps using energy conservation and assuming that all kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass of the A particles. But that can't be, since the initial rest mass is 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV, and the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, so there's 676 MeV of energy left. So, the A particles must have kinetic energy. But how much?

Alternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is 2 m_p c² (if the antiproton is moving slowly, so the lab frame is approximately the center-of-mass frame). Then, the products must have total energy 2 m_p c². Each A particle's energy would be E = γ m_A c². Since there are four particles, 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ≈ (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.563. Then, γ = 1.563. Then, solving for velocity:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ

1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ²

v²/c² = 1 - 1 / γ²

v = c sqrt(1 - 1 / γ²)

Plugging in γ ≈ 1.563:

1 / γ² ≈ 1 / (1.563)^2 ≈ 1 / 2.443 ≈ 0.409

So, 1 - 0.409 ≈ 0.591

v ≈ c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769 ≈ 0.77c

But wait, this approach assumes that all four A particles have the same gamma factor, which would require them to be moving in such a way that their velocities are the same. But in reality, in the center-of-mass frame, they could be moving in different directions but with the same speed. If the problem is symmetric, perhaps two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but each with the same speed. But in that case, the total momentum would cancel out, which is necessary in the center-of-mass frame. So, each A particle would have the same speed, but opposite directions. So, the velocity magnitude would be the same for all, but directions vary. So, the speed would be 0.77c. But let's check the calculation again.

Wait, but the initial energy is 2 m_p c². The total energy of the four A particles is 4 γ m_A c². So, 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = (m_p)/(2 m_A). Since m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c². So, γ = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563. So, yes, that's correct. Then, γ ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) as above. So, 0.77c. So, approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.

But wait, is this correct? Let me verify. If each A particle has gamma = 1.563, then their total energy is 4 * 1.563 * 300 = 4 * 468.9 ≈ 1875.6 MeV, which is approximately 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So, that checks out. So, the energy is conserved. Momentum: in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So, if the four A particles are arranged such that their momenta cancel out, then momentum is conserved. For example, two moving in +x and two in -x with equal speeds. Each A particle's momentum is γ m_A v. So, two in one direction and two in the opposite would cancel. So, that works.

Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c. But let me compute the exact value.

Given γ = 1.563, then:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/2.443) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.409) = c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.7688 ≈ 0.769c.

So, approximately 0.77c. But maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let's compute sqrt(0.591):

sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7688. So, 0.7688c. Rounded to two decimal places, 0.77c. Alternatively, 0.77 times the speed of light.

But let me check if this approach is correct. The key assumption is that in the center-of-mass frame, the four A particles each have the same speed. But in reality, they could have different speeds but arranged in such a way that their momenta cancel. However, given the symmetry of the problem (two A+ and two A-), it's reasonable to assume that they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions with the same speed. Therefore, each pair cancels the other's momentum, leading to total momentum zero. So, each A particle would have the same speed. Therefore, the calculation is valid.

Alternatively, if the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum is not zero. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small. However, the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might imply that its kinetic energy is negligible. If so, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v, where v is the antiproton's velocity. But if v is very small, then the initial momentum is small, and the products must have a total momentum equal to that. However, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the products must have zero total momentum, which would again lead us to the center-of-mass frame scenario. But if the initial momentum is not negligible, then the products would have some net momentum. However, given that the problem does not specify the antiproton's velocity, but only states it's "slowly moving," perhaps we can assume that the initial momentum is negligible, and the problem is effectively in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c.

But let me check another approach. Let's use energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has energy E = γ m_p c², where γ ≈ 1 (since it's moving slowly). Therefore, total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². The initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since γ ≈ 1). After annihilation, the four A particles have total energy 4 γ_A m_A c² and total momentum p_total. So, energy conservation: 4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c². Therefore, γ_A ≈ (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563, same as before. Then, velocity of each A is v_A = c sqrt(1 - 1/γ_A²) ≈ 0.77c. But momentum conservation: p_initial = p_total. If p_initial ≈ m_p v, then the total momentum of the four A particles must equal m_p v. However, if the A particles are moving symmetrically, their momenta could cancel, but if there's a net momentum, they must have some directionality. But since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the net momentum is small, and the velocities of the A particles are dominated by the energy from the annihilation. However, without knowing the exact velocity of the antiproton, we can't calculate the exact net momentum. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial momentum is negligible, so the A particles are produced at rest. But that can't be, because their rest mass is less than the initial energy. Alternatively, the problem might be designed to ignore the initial momentum and consider the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let's think about threshold energy. The minimum energy required for a reaction to occur is when all the products are at rest. But in this case, the products can't be at rest because their rest mass is less than the initial energy. Wait, the rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So, the initial rest energy is higher than the products' rest energy, so the reaction can occur even at rest. Therefore, the excess energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the A particles must have kinetic energy. Therefore, their velocity is determined by the gamma factor as before.

Alternatively, perhaps using relativistic energy and momentum conservation. Let's denote variables:

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has velocity v_p. The total energy is E_total = m_p c² + γ m_p c². The total momentum is p_total = γ m_p v_p.

After annihilation, four A particles. Let's assume they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions. Let's say two A+ and two A- each moving in opposite directions with speed u. Then, each A particle has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A u. Since two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, total momentum is 2 γ_A m_A u - 2 γ_A m_A u = 0. But the initial momentum was γ m_p v_p. Therefore, unless the initial momentum is zero, this can't hold. Therefore, if the initial momentum is not zero, the A particles must have some net momentum. But since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small, but not zero. However, without knowing the exact velocity, we can't compute the exact velocity of the A particles. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, leading to the A particles moving symmetrically with velocity 0.77c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use the rest frame of the proton and antiproton combined, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass frame is approximately the lab frame. Therefore, the velocity of the A particles is approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let's think about the rest frame of the proton and antiproton. The total rest energy is 2 m_p c². When they annihilate, they produce four particles each with mass 300 MeV/c². The total energy available is 2 m_p c², so each A particle would have energy E = (2 m_p c²)/4 = m_p c² / 2. Then, the kinetic energy of each A particle is E - m_A c² = (m_p / 2 - m_A) c². Plugging in m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c², so KE = (469 - 300) MeV = 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A is 469 MeV. Then, gamma = E / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) c ≈ 0.77c. So, same result. Therefore, this seems consistent.

Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. To express this as a numerical value, 0.77c. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of a fraction or a decimal. Let me check the exact calculation.

Given gamma = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563333...

Then, 1/gamma² = (300/469)^2 ≈ (0.63966)^2 ≈ 0.4092

1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908

sqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686

So, approximately 0.7686c. Rounding to two decimal places, 0.77c. Alternatively, as a fraction, sqrt(1 - (600/938)^2). Wait, let's compute gamma again:

gamma = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) = 938 / 600 = 1.563333...

So, gamma = 1.563333...

Then, 1/gamma² = 1/((938/600)^2) = (600/938)^2 ≈ (0.63966)^2 ≈ 0.4092

So, 1 - 0.4092 = 0.5908

sqrt(0.5908) ≈ 0.7686c. So, approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, if we use exact fractions:

gamma = 938 / 600 = 469 / 300

gamma² = (469)^2 / (300)^2 = 219, 961 / 90,000 ≈ 2.444...

So, 1/gamma² = 90,000 / 219,961 ≈ 0.4092

Same as before.

Therefore, the velocity is sqrt(1 - 0.4092) c = sqrt(0.5908) c ≈ 0.7686c.

Expressed as a decimal, approximately 0.77c. If we need more precision, 0.769c, but likely 0.77c is acceptable.

Alternatively, if the problem expects a beta value (beta = v/c), then beta ≈ 0.77.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach where the kinetic energy is shared among the four particles. Let's see:

Total rest mass energy of products: 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

Total energy available: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

So, the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

If this KE is equally shared among four particles, each has 169 MeV. Then, the total energy of each A is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, gamma = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563, leading to the same velocity. So, same result.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the velocity is approximately 0.77c.

But let me check if there's a possible mistake here. For example, if the problem is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, then the total energy is not just 2 m_p c². The antiproton's kinetic energy adds to the total energy. However, the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," which might mean that its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v, where v is small. However, if the initial momentum is not zero, then the products must have a net momentum equal to m_p v. But since the problem doesn't specify the antiproton's velocity, we can't calculate the exact velocity of the A particles in the lab frame. Therefore, the problem must be intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where the total momentum is zero, leading to the velocity calculated as 0.77c.

Alternatively, if the problem is in the lab frame and the antiproton's velocity is so small that its kinetic energy is negligible, then the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v. But since v is small, the initial momentum is small. However, the products must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. If the A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum is m_p v, but since m_p v is small, their velocities are still approximately 0.77c. But this complicates things. Without knowing the exact value of v, we can't proceed. Therefore, the problem must assume that the initial momentum is negligible, so the velocity is 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use non-relativistic mechanics, but given the high rest mass of the A particles (300 MeV) compared to the available energy (each A has 469 MeV), the velocity is relativistic, so non-relativistic calculations would be invalid. Therefore, the relativistic approach is necessary.

Therefore, after thorough consideration, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. So, the answer is 0.77c. But let me check if there's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the annihilation of proton and antiproton typically produces other particles, but in this case, it's producing four A particles. The key is that the total energy and momentum must be conserved. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, the total energy is m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c². The total momentum is γ m_p v ≈ m_p v. If the velocity v is very small, then the momentum is small. However, the products must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. If the A particles are moving in such a way that their total momentum is m_p v, but since m_p v is small, the velocities of the A particles would be slightly different. But without knowing v, we can't calculate this. Therefore, the problem must be assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, so the products have zero total momentum, leading to the velocity of 0.77c. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the rest energy of the proton and antiproton converting into the kinetic energy of the A particles. But that's not correct, because the A particles have rest mass. The total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial rest mass of 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. Therefore, the excess energy (676 MeV) is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, each A particle has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, using KE = (γ - 1) m_A c², so 169 = (γ - 1) * 300. Therefore, γ - 1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.563, so γ ≈ 1.563. Then, same as before. Then, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/1.563²) c ≈ 0.77c. So, same result.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the velocity is approximately 0.77c. Therefore, the answer is 0.77c. But to check if there's a different way, perhaps using invariant quantities.

The invariant mass squared is s = (E_total/c²)^2 - (p_total c)^2. In the lab frame, s = (m_p + γ m_p)^2 - (γ m_p v)^2 c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈ 1, so s ≈ (2 m_p)^2 - (m_p v)^2 c². But since v is small, the second term is negligible, so s ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2. Then, in the center-of-mass frame, s = (E_total)^2 = (2 m_p c²)^2. Therefore, the invariant mass is 2 m_p c². Then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c², which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation holds.

Therefore, the velocity of each A particle is approximately 0.77c. So, the answer is 0.77 times the speed of light. Therefore, the velocity is \boxed{0.77c}.


**Final Answer**
The velocity of particle \( A \) is \boxed{0.77c}.
