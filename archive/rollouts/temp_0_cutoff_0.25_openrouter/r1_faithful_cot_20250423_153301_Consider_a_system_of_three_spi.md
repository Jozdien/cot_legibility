To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy given by \( E = -J [S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3] \), we start by considering all possible states of the system. There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) states in total.

We calculate the energy for each state by evaluating the sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \):

1. **States with all spins aligned** (\( +1, +1, +1 \) and \( -1, -1, -1 \)):
   - The sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = 3 \)
   - Energy \( E = -3J \)
   - There are 2 such states.

2. **States with two spins aligned and one opposite** (the remaining 6 states):
   - The sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -1 \)
   - Energy \( E = J \)
   - There are 6 such states.

The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:
- For the 2 states with energy \( -3J \): \( 2 e^{3\beta J} \)
- For the 6 states with energy \( J \): \( 6 e^{-\beta J} \)

Summing these contributions, we get:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
\]

Thus, the partition function is \(\boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins, each being either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of the exponential of negative beta times energy, right? So Z = sum_{all states} e^{-βE}. 

First, let me recall that each spin can be +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of states should be 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. Maybe I can list all possible states and compute the energy for each, then plug into the partition function formula. 

Let me start by listing all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So the states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Okay, that's all 8 states. Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. The energy is given by -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So for each state, compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, multiply by -J to get E, then compute e^{-βE} for each, and sum them all up.

Let me compute E for each state:

1. State 1: (+1, +1, +1)
   S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
   S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
   S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
   Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   E = -J * 3 = -3J

2. State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
   S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
   S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

3. State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
   S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
   S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

4. State 4: (+1, -1, -1)
   S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

5. State 5: (-1, +1, +1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
   Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

6. State 6: (-1, +1, -1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

7. State 7: (-1, -1, +1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

8. State 8: (-1, -1, -1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   Sum = 1 +1 +1 = 3
   E = -J*3 = -3J

Wait, so looking at the energies, states 1 and 8 have energy -3J, and all the other 6 states have energy J. Let me check that again. For example, state 2: sum is -1, so E = J. Similarly, states 3-7 also have sum -1, so E = J. States 1 and 8 have sum 3, so E = -3J. So that's correct.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all 8 states of e^{-βE}. So let's compute each term:

For states 1 and 8: E = -3J, so the term is e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}

For states 2-7 (6 states): E = J, so the term is e^{-β*J} = e^{-βJ}

Therefore, Z = 2*e^{3βJ} + 6*e^{-βJ}

Is that right? Let me verify. There are 2 states with energy -3J and 6 states with energy J. So yes, multiplying each by their respective Boltzmann factors. So Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, we can factor out e^{-βJ}:

Z = e^{-βJ}(2e^{4βJ} + 6) but maybe it's better left as 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, maybe we can write it in terms of hyperbolic functions? Let me see. Let's note that e^{x} + e^{-x} = 2cosh(x). But here we have 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe not necessary. The answer is probably acceptable in the exponential form.

But let me check if I made a mistake in counting the states. Let's recount:

States with all spins +1 or all -1: 2 states (states 1 and 8). The rest have two spins of one kind and one of the other. Wait, no. Wait, in three spins, the possible magnetizations are +3, +1, -1, -3. But here, the energy depends on the products of pairs. Wait, but in the energy expression, it's the sum of the products. So for three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me see if there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all states.

Alternatively, note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2. Wait, let's check:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)

Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

But since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i^2 = 1. Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3. Therefore,

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2

Therefore, the energy E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ]

So E = -J/2 * ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 )

But maybe this helps in computing the partition function. Let's see. Let M = S1 + S2 + S3. Then E = -J/2 (M^2 - 3). Therefore, the energy depends only on M^2. So we can group the states by the value of M.

Possible values of M: sum of three spins each ±1. So possible M are 3, 1, -1, -3. Wait, no. Let's compute:

If all three are +1: M=3

Two +1, one -1: M=1

One +1, two -1: M=-1

All three -1: M=-3

But wait, actually, for three spins:

Number of +1 spins can be 0,1,2,3.

If 0: M=-3

If 1: M= -1 (since two are -1 and one +1: sum is -1)

If 2: M=+1 (two +1 and one -1: sum is +1)

If 3: M=+3

Therefore, possible M values: ±3, ±1. So four possible M values. The number of states for each M:

- M=3: 1 state (all +1)

- M=1: 3 states (two +1, one -1)

- M=-1: 3 states (two -1, one +1)

- M=-3: 1 state (all -1)

But wait, in our previous enumeration, states 1 and 8 correspond to M=3 and M=-3 (each 1 state). The other 6 states are M=1 and M=-1. Wait, but according to this, M=1 and M=-1 each have 3 states. But in our previous enumeration, states 2-7 (6 states) all have energy J. Wait, but according to M, M=1 and M=-1 each have 3 states. So for M=1, energy would be E = -J/2 (1^2 -3) = -J/2 (-2) = J. Similarly, for M=-1, same since M^2 is 1. So energy is J. For M=3 and M=-3, E = -J/2 (9 -3) = -J/2 *6 = -3J. So that matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the number of states with energy J is 3 (M=1) + 3 (M=-1) = 6, and states with energy -3J are 2 (M=3 and M=-3). So that's consistent.

Therefore, the partition function can also be written as:

Z = sum_{M} g(M) e^{-βE(M)} where g(M) is the number of states with magnetization M.

So:

For M=3 and M=-3: g=1 each, E=-3J. So total contribution 2e^{3βJ}

For M=1 and M=-1: g=3 each, E=J. So total contribution 6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Same result as before. So that's good. So the answer is Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, factor 2e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} +3). But not sure if that's necessary. The problem just asks for the partition function, so either form is acceptable, but probably the first one is better.

Wait, let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the energy expression when using M. So E = -J/2 (M^2 -3). For M=3: E = -J/2 (9 -3) = -3J. For M=1: E = -J/2 (1 -3) = -J/2 (-2) = J. Correct. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the partition function by considering the possible values of the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. But I think the way I did it is straightforward.

Alternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me think if there's a way to express this in terms of variables that can be summed over more easily. For example, if we let variables like S1, S2, S3, but since they are binary variables, maybe we can use some transformation. But I think the enumeration is manageable here.

Alternatively, use the fact that the system is symmetric under permutation of spins, so we can group the states by the number of +1 spins. Wait, but we already did that with the magnetization M. So that's the same approach.

Alternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].

Let me consider that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = S1(S2 + S3) + S2S3. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, note that for three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take two possible values: 3 (when all spins are the same) or -1 (when two are one way and one is the other). Wait, in our previous calculation, we saw that when all spins are the same, the sum is 3, and when there are two of one and one of the other, the sum is -1. So indeed, the sum can only be 3 or -1. Therefore, the energy is either -3J or J. Therefore, the partition function is 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Yes, that's the same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is Z = 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

I think that's it. Let me just check once more. For each state:

- All spins aligned: 2 states, energy -3J, so 2e^{3βJ}

- All other states (6 states) have energy J, so 6e^{-βJ}

Sum them up. Yep. So the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}.

I need to determine the partition function Z for a system consisting of three spins, each with a value of either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is defined by the equation E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function can be calculated as Z = sum_{all states} e^{-βE}, which means I need to sum the exponential of negative beta times energy for all possible states.

Alright, I need to determine the partition function Z for a system consisting of three spins, each of which can either be +1 or -1. The energy is defined as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function involves summing over all potential states of the system, using the exponential of the negative product of beta and energy, so Z = sum_{all states} e^{-βE}.

First, I'll note that every spin can have values of +1 or -1. With three spins, the system has a total of 2^3 = 8 states. This is feasible to handle. I'll enumerate all possible states, compute the energy for each one, and then apply these results in the partition function formula.

I will begin by outlining all combinations of S1, S2, and S3. Possible configurations are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

These represent all 8 states. Next, I'll calculate the energy E for each case. The energy is determined by the expression -J multiplied by the sum of the product of each spin pair. I will compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each configuration, multiply by -J to get E, then evaluate e^{-βE} and sum them.

Let's calculate E for each state:

1. State 1: (+1, +1, +1)
   S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
   S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
   S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
   Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   E = -J * 3 = -3J

2. State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
   S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
   S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   Sum = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

3. State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
   S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
   S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   Sum = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

4. State 4: (+1, -1, -1)
   S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   Sum = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

5. State 5: (-1, +1, +1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
   Sum = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

6. State 6: (-1, +1, -1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
   Sum = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

7. State 7: (-1, -1, +1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1
   S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
   Sum = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1
   E = -J*(-1) = J

8. State 8: (-1, -1, -1)
   S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1

For state 1, all spins are +1, so all products are +1, sum is 3, so E = -3J. Similarly, state 8, all spins -1, so each product is (-1)(-1)=1, so sum is 3, E = -3J. Then the other states, where there's a mix of +1 and -1, the sum of the products is -1, so E = J. How many such states? Let's see, states 2 through 7: that's 6 states. So 2 states with energy -3J and 6 states with energy J.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-βE}. So:\n\nZ = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(J)}\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, E is -3J for states 1 and 8, so when we compute e^{-βE}, that's e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}. Similarly, for the other states, E is J, so e^{-β*J}.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}\n\nIs that right? Let me verify with an example. For state 1, E = -3J, so exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3βJ. For state 2, E = J, so exponent is -β*J. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}\n\nAlternatively, we can factor out e^{-βJ}:\n\nZ = e^{-βJ}(2e^{4βJ} + 6) = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}\n\nBut maybe it's better to leave it as is. Let me check if there's another way to compute this without enumerating all states. Maybe by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the sum as K = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J*K. So Z = sum_{all states} e^{βJ K}\n\nSo we can compute Z by finding the number of states with each possible K value, then multiply by e^{βJ K} and sum.\n\nSo first, what are the possible values of K?\n\nEach term S_iS_j can be +1 or -1. So K is the sum of three terms each ±1. So possible values of K can be 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, but let's check.\n\nWait, if all three terms are +1, K=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, K=1. If one is +1 and two are -1, K=-1. If all three are -1, K=-3. So possible K values: 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nBut wait, in our previous enumeration, we found that K was either 3 or -1. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, in the states we calculated, K was 3 for all spins aligned (either all +1 or all -1), and K was -1 for the other states. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, when we have two +1 and one -1, the sum K was -1. Wait, but according to the possible K values, if two terms are +1 and one is -1, K would be 1. But in our case, when we have two +1 spins and one -1, the sum K was -1. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's take state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum K = +1 -1 -1 = -1. So even though two spins are +1 and one is -1, the sum K is -1. Similarly, if two spins are -1 and one is +1, what's K?\n\nTake state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum K = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So in this case, two -1s and one +1, sum K is -1. So actually, regardless of whether you have two +1s and one -1 or two -1s and one +1, the sum K is -1. So the possible K values are 3 and -1. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me compute K for all possible combinations. Let's consider the number of +1 and -1 spins. If all three spins are +1, K=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, K= -1. If one is +1 and two are -1, K= -1. If all three are -1, K=3. So actually, K can only be 3 or -1. So the possible values of K are 3 and -1. Therefore, the number of states with K=3 is 2 (all +1 or all -1), and the number of states with K=-1 is 6 (the remaining 6 states). So that's why in our enumeration, we had two states with E=-3J (K=3) and six states with E=J (K=-1). Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}\n\nTherefore, that's the answer. But let me check if there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all states, maybe using some symmetry or variable substitution.\n\nAlternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see if I can relate this to the square of the total spin or something. The total spin is S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is ±1, S_i^2 = 1. Therefore, S^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S^2 - 3)/2. Therefore, E = -J*( (S^2 - 3)/2 ) = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2.\n\nTherefore, the energy can be written in terms of the square of the total spin. Then the partition function can be written as sum_{S} g(S) e^{-βE}, where g(S) is the number of states with total spin S. But the total spin S can take values from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, but since each spin is ±1, the possible total spin values are S = 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, no. Wait, S is the sum of three spins each ±1, so possible values are 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), -3 (all -1). So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3. But actually, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let me check:\n\nIf all three are +1: sum = 3\n\nIf two +1, one -1: sum = 1\n\nIf one +1, two -1: sum = -1\n\nIf all three -1: sum = -3\n\nSo yes, possible S values: 3,1,-1,-3. Then, the number of states for each S:\n\n- S=3: 1 state (all +1)\n\n- S=1: C(3,1)=3 states (choosing which spin is -1)\n\n- S=-1: C(3,1)=3 states (choosing which spin is +1)\n\n- S=-3: 1 state (all -1)\n\nWait, but in our previous enumeration, we had two states with K=3 (all +1 and all -1), but here S=3 and S=-3. Wait, but in the energy expression, E is written in terms of S^2. Let me see:\n\nE = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2\n\nTherefore, for a given S, the energy is E = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2. Therefore, the energy depends only on the magnitude of S^2. So for S=3 or S=-3, S^2=9, so E = - (J/2)*9 + (3J)/2 = (-9J/2 + 3J/2) = (-6J/2) = -3J. For S=1 or S=-1, S^2=1, so E = - (J/2)*1 + (3J)/2 = (-J/2 + 3J/2) = (2J/2) = J. Therefore, the energy is the same for S=3 and S=-3 (both -3J) and for S=1 and S=-1 (both J). Therefore, the number of states with energy -3J is the number of states with S=3 or S=-3, which is 1 +1=2. The number of states with energy J is the number of states with S=1 or S=-1, which is 3 +3=6. Therefore, this matches our previous result. Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nTherefore, this method also gives the same result. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the partition function using the fact that the system is small and we can use variable substitution. Let me see. Let's consider variables S1, S2, S3. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over S1, S2, S3 of e^{βJ(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. \n\nAlternatively, we can write this as the product of terms? Wait, but the exponent is a sum of products, not a product of terms. So it's not straightforward. However, maybe we can use some algebraic manipulation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2. Wait, let's check:\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nTherefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2\n\nBut since each S_i^2 =1, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 =3. Therefore,\n\nS1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ S^2 -3 ] /2, where S = S1 + S2 + S3. Which is the same as before. Therefore, E = -J*( [S^2 -3]/2 ) = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2. So we can write the partition function as sum_{S} g(S) e^{β ( (J/2) S^2 - (3J)/2 ) }.\n\nBut since S can be 3,1,-1,-3, and g(S) is the number of states with total spin S, which we already determined as 2 for S=±3 and 6 for S=±1. Therefore, this again gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the system is symmetric under permutation of spins, so we can group the states by the number of up spins. Let's see. Let me consider the number of spins that are +1. Let n be the number of +1 spins. Then n can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nFor n=0: all spins are -1. Then S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3, E=-3J. So one state.\n\nFor n=1: one spin +1, two spins -1. Let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Suppose S1=+1, S2=S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum=-1-1+1=-1. So E=J. Similarly for other positions of the single +1 spin. There are C(3,1)=3 such states.\n\nFor n=2: two spins +1, one spin -1. Let's take S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1-1-1=-1. So E=J. Similarly for other positions of the -1 spin. There are C(3,2)=3 such states.\n\nFor n=3: all spins +1. Sum=3, E=-3J. One state.\n\nTherefore, total states:\n\nn=0:1 state, E=-3J\n\nn=1:3 states, E=J\n\nn=2:3 states, E=J\n\nn=3:1 state, E=-3J\n\nTherefore, total partition function Z=1*e^{3βJ} + (3+3)*e^{-βJ} +1*e^{3βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nSame result. So this method also works. So regardless of the approach, we get Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nBut let me check once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of states. For n=1 and n=2, each gives 3 states, so 3+3=6 states with E=J. For n=0 and n=3, each gives 1 state, so 1+1=2 states with E=-3J. Yes, that's correct. So the partition function is indeed 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nAlternatively, we can factor this expression. Let's see:\n\nZ=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{βJ(3)} +6e^{βJ(-1)}\n\nAlternatively, factor out 2e^{-βJ}:\n\nZ=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)\n\nBut not sure if that's necessary. The problem just asks for the partition function, so either form is acceptable, but the expanded form is probably better.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in terms of hyperbolic functions. Let me see:\n\nNote that e^{3βJ} + e^{-βJ} is similar to hyperbolic functions, but with different exponents. However, since the coefficients are different (2 and 6), it might not lead to a simplification. Let me check:\n\nZ=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor 2e^{-βJ}:\n\n=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)\n\nBut I don't think this simplifies further. So the answer is Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and checks, I'm confident that this is the correct partition function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe partition function is \\boxed{2e^{3\\beta J} + 6e^{-\\beta J}}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447780, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4171, prompt_tokens=1091, total_tokens=5262, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy given by \( E = -J [S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3] \), we start by considering all possible states of the system. There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) states in total.

We calculate the energy for each state and then use the partition function formula \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \).

1. **Enumerate all states and their energies:**
   - **State 1 (+++):** \( E = -3J \)
   - **State 2 (++-):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 3 (+-+):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 4 (+--):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 5 (-++):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 6 (-+-):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 7 (--+):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 8 (---):** \( E = -3J \)

2. **Classify states by energy:**
   - States with energy \( -3J \): 2 states (all spins +1 or all spins -1)
   - States with energy \( J \): 6 states (mixed spins)

3. **Calculate the partition function:**
   - For states with energy \( -3J \): \( 2e^{3\beta J} \)
   - For states with energy \( J \): \( 6e^{-\beta J} \)

Summing these contributions, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

Thus, the partition function of the system is \(\boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

= 1
   Sum = 1 +1 +1 = 3
   E = -J*3 = -3J

So summarizing the energies:

- State 1 and 8 have energy -3J
- States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have energy J

Wait, let me check that again. For state 1, all spins are +1, so all products are +1, sum is 3, so E = -3J. Similarly, state 8, all spins -1, so each product is (-1)(-1)=1, so sum is 3, E = -3J. Then the other states, where there's a mix of +1 and -1, the sum of the products is -1, so E = J. How many such states? Let's see, states 2 through 7: that's 6 states. So 2 states with energy -3J and 6 states with energy J.

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-βE}. So:

Z = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(J)}

Wait, hold on. Wait, E is -3J for states 1 and 8, so when we compute e^{-βE}, that's e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}. Similarly, for the other states, E is J, so e^{-β*J}.

Therefore, Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}

Is that right? Let me verify with an example. For state 1, E = -3J, so exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3βJ. For state 2, E = J, so exponent is -β*J. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, we can factor out e^{-βJ}:

Z = e^{-βJ}(2e^{4βJ} + 6) = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

But maybe it's better to leave it as is. Let me check if there's another way to compute this without enumerating all states. Maybe by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think. Let me denote the sum as K = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J*K. So Z = sum_{all states} e^{βJ K}

So we can compute Z by finding the number of states with each possible K value, then multiply by e^{βJ K} and sum.

So first, what are the possible values of K?

Each term S_iS_j can be +1 or -1. So K is the sum of three terms each ±1. So possible values of K can be 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, but let's check.

Wait, if all three terms are +1, K=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, K=1. If one is +1 and two are -1, K=-1. If all three are -1, K=-3. So possible K values: 3, 1, -1, -3.

But wait, in our previous enumeration, we found that K was either 3 or -1. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, in the states we calculated, K was 3 for all spins aligned (either all +1 or all -1), and K was -1 for the other states. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, when we have two +1 and one -1, the sum K was -1. Wait, but according to the possible K values, if two terms are +1 and one is -1, K would be 1. But in our case, when we have two +1 spins and one -1, the sum K was -1. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought is wrong.

Wait, let's take an example. Let's take state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum K = +1 -1 -1 = -1. So even though two spins are +1 and one is -1, the sum K is -1. Similarly, if two spins are -1 and one is +1, what's K?

Take state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum K = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So in this case, two -1s and one +1, sum K is -1. So actually, regardless of whether you have two +1s and one -1 or two -1s and one +1, the sum K is -1. So the possible K values are 3 and -1. Wait, but how?

Wait, let's see. Let me compute K for all possible combinations. Let's consider the number of +1 and -1 spins. If all three spins are +1, K=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, K= -1. If one is +1 and two are -1, K= -1. If all three are -1, K=3. So actually, K can only be 3 or -1. So the possible values of K are 3 and -1. Therefore, the number of states with K=3 is 2 (all +1 or all -1), and the number of states with K=-1 is 6 (the remaining 6 states). So that's why in our enumeration, we had two states with E=-3J (K=3) and six states with E=J (K=-1). Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, that's the answer. But let me check if there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all states, maybe using some symmetry or variable substitution.

Alternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see if I can relate this to the square of the total spin or something. The total spin is S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is ±1, S_i^2 = 1. Therefore, S^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S^2 - 3)/2. Therefore, E = -J*( (S^2 - 3)/2 ) = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2.

Therefore, the energy can be written in terms of the square of the total spin. Then the partition function can be written as sum_{S} g(S) e^{-βE}, where g(S) is the number of states with total spin S. But the total spin S can take values from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, but since each spin is ±1, the possible total spin values are S = 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, no. Wait, S is the sum of three spins each ±1, so possible values are 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), -3 (all -1). So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3. But actually, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let me check:

If all three are +1: sum = 3

If two +1, one -1: sum = 1

If one +1, two -1: sum = -1

If all three -1: sum = -3

So yes, possible S values: 3,1,-1,-3. Then, the number of states for each S:

- S=3: 1 state (all +1)

- S=1: C(3,1)=3 states (choosing which spin is -1)

- S=-1: C(3,1)=3 states (choosing which spin is +1)

- S=-3: 1 state (all -1)

Wait, but in our previous enumeration, we had two states with K=3 (all +1 and all -1), but here S=3 and S=-3. Wait, but in the energy expression, E is written in terms of S^2. Let me see:

E = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2

Therefore, for a given S, the energy is E = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2. Therefore, the energy depends only on the magnitude of S^2. So for S=3 or S=-3, S^2=9, so E = - (J/2)*9 + (3J)/2 = (-9J/2 + 3J/2) = (-6J/2) = -3J. For S=1 or S=-1, S^2=1, so E = - (J/2)*1 + (3J)/2 = (-J/2 + 3J/2) = (2J/2) = J. Therefore, the energy is the same for S=3 and S=-3 (both -3J) and for S=1 and S=-1 (both J). Therefore, the number of states with energy -3J is the number of states with S=3 or S=-3, which is 1 +1=2. The number of states with energy J is the number of states with S=1 or S=-1, which is 3 +3=6. Therefore, this matches our previous result. Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, this method also gives the same result. So that's a good consistency check.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the partition function using the fact that the system is small and we can use variable substitution. Let me see. Let's consider variables S1, S2, S3. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over S1, S2, S3 of e^{βJ(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. 

Alternatively, we can write this as the product of terms? Wait, but the exponent is a sum of products, not a product of terms. So it's not straightforward. However, maybe we can use some algebraic manipulation. Let me think.

Alternatively, note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2. Wait, let's check:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)

Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

But since each S_i^2 =1, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 =3. Therefore,

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ S^2 -3 ] /2, where S = S1 + S2 + S3. Which is the same as before. Therefore, E = -J*( [S^2 -3]/2 ) = - (J/2) S^2 + (3J)/2. So we can write the partition function as sum_{S} g(S) e^{β ( (J/2) S^2 - (3J)/2 ) }.

But since S can be 3,1,-1,-3, and g(S) is the number of states with total spin S, which we already determined as 2 for S=±3 and 6 for S=±1. Therefore, this again gives the same result.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the system is symmetric under permutation of spins, so we can group the states by the number of up spins. Let's see. Let me consider the number of spins that are +1. Let n be the number of +1 spins. Then n can be 0,1,2,3.

For n=0: all spins are -1. Then S1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3, E=-3J. So one state.

For n=1: one spin +1, two spins -1. Let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Suppose S1=+1, S2=S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum=-1-1+1=-1. So E=J. Similarly for other positions of the single +1 spin. There are C(3,1)=3 such states.

For n=2: two spins +1, one spin -1. Let's take S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1-1-1=-1. So E=J. Similarly for other positions of the -1 spin. There are C(3,2)=3 such states.

For n=3: all spins +1. Sum=3, E=-3J. One state.

Therefore, total states:

n=0:1 state, E=-3J

n=1:3 states, E=J

n=2:3 states, E=J

n=3:1 state, E=-3J

Therefore, total partition function Z=1*e^{3βJ} + (3+3)*e^{-βJ} +1*e^{3βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Same result. So this method also works. So regardless of the approach, we get Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, the answer should be Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

But let me check once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of states. For n=1 and n=2, each gives 3 states, so 3+3=6 states with E=J. For n=0 and n=3, each gives 1 state, so 1+1=2 states with E=-3J. Yes, that's correct. So the partition function is indeed 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, we can factor this expression. Let's see:

Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{βJ(3)} +6e^{βJ(-1)}

Alternatively, factor out 2e^{-βJ}:

Z=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)

But not sure if that's necessary. The problem just asks for the partition function, so either form is acceptable, but the expanded form is probably better.

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of hyperbolic functions. Let me see:

Note that e^{3βJ} + e^{-βJ} is similar to hyperbolic functions, but with different exponents. However, since the coefficients are different (2 and 6), it might not lead to a simplification. Let me check:

Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)

Alternatively, maybe factor 2e^{-βJ}:

=2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} +3)

But I don't think this simplifies further. So the answer is Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, I'm confident that this is the correct partition function.

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) (each taking values \( \pm 1 \)) with energy given by \( E = -J [S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3] \), we need to consider all possible states of the system. 

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The energy for each state is calculated as follows:

1. **State (+1, +1, +1):**
   \[
   E = -J [1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1] = -3J
   \]
2. **State (+1, +1, -1):**
   \[
   E = -J [1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot (-1)] = J
   \]
3. **State (+1, -1, +1):**
   \[
   E = -J [1 \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot 1] = J
   \]
4. **State (+1, -1, -1):**
   \[
   E = -J [1 \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1)] = J
   \]
5. **State (-1, +1, +1):**
   \[
   E = -J [(-1) \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1] = J
   \]
6. **State (-1, +1, -1):**
   \[
   E = -J [(-1) \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot (-1)] = J
   \]
7. **State (-1, -1, +1):**
   \[
   E = -J [(-1) \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot 1] = J
   \]
8. **State (-1, -1, -1):**
   \[
   E = -J [(-1) \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1)] = -3J
   \]

The energies for the eight states are either \( -3J \) or \( J \). There are 2 states with energy \( -3J \) and 6 states with energy \( J \).

The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
\]

Thus, the partition function is:
\[
\boxed{Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

= 1
   Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   E = -J × 3 = -3J

So, the energies for the eight states are:
1. -3J
2. J
3. J
4. J
5. J
6. J
7. J
8. -3J

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-βE}. Let's compute each term:

1. For energy -3J: e^{-β(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}
2. For energy J: e^{-βJ}
3. Similarly, states 3 to 7 all have energy J, so each contributes e^{-βJ}
4. State 8: same as state 1, e^{3βJ}

Counting the number of each term:
- There are 2 states with energy -3J (states 1 and 8)
- There are 6 states with energy J (states 2 to 7)

Therefore, the partition function Z is:
Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}

But wait, let me check again. Wait, in the list above, states 1 and 8 have energy -3J, so each contributes e^{-β(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}. Then, the other six states (2 through 7) each have energy J, so each contributes e^{-βJ}. Therefore, the total is indeed 2*e^{3βJ} + 6*e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all states. Let me think. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each of these products can be either +1 or -1. Let me see if there's a way to express the sum in terms of variables that can be more easily summed over.

Alternatively, note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be related to the square of the total spin. Let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. That would be S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i^2 = 1. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2. Therefore, the energy E can be written as E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ] = -J/2 ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) = (3J/2) - (J/2)(S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Let's see. The total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3 can take values from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, but since each spin is ±1, the possible sums are actually -3, -1, +1, +3. Wait, let's check:

Possible values of S1 + S2 + S3:

If all three are +1: 3

Two +1 and one -1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1

One +1 and two -1: -1

All three -1: -3

So the possible values of S are 3, 1, -1, -3. Therefore, the square of S is 9, 1, 1, 9. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 is either 9 or 1. Therefore, the energy E can be written as (3J/2) - (J/2)(9) = (3J/2 - 9J/2) = -3J when S^2 = 9 (i.e., when all spins are aligned), and (3J/2) - (J/2)(1) = (3J - J)/2 = J when S^2 = 1 (i.e., when there are two spins of one kind and one of the other). Therefore, this confirms the earlier calculation that the energy is either -3J or J. The number of states with energy -3J is 2 (all +1 or all -1), and the number of states with energy J is 6 (each of the other possibilities). Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, since the energy depends only on the sum of the products of spins, which in turn depends on the number of aligned spins. But perhaps the first method is sufficient.

Therefore, the final answer is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}.

For states 1 and 8, X = 3 (since all spins are aligned, so each product is +1, sum is 3). For the other six states, X = -1. Wait, in the previous calculation, when the energy was J, that corresponds to X = -1, since E = -JX. So, if E = J, then X = -1. If E = -3J, then X = 3.\n\nSo, X can be 3 or -1, with multiplicities 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute this without enumerating all states.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables like S1 + S2 + S3. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, note that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i^2 = 1, this becomes 3 + 2X.

The number of states for each M:\n\n- M=3: 1 state (all +1)\n\n- M=1: 3 choose 1 = 3 states (one -1, two +1)\n\n- M=-1: 3 choose 2 = 3 states (two -1, one +1)\n\n- M=-3: 1 state (all -1)\n\nBut according to our previous enumeration, states with M=3 and M=-3 correspond to X=3, and the rest correspond to X=-1. Let's check:\n\nIf M=3, then X = (3^2 -3)/2 = (9 -3)/2 = 3. Similarly, M=-3, same since squared: X=3.\n\nFor M=1: X = (1^2 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nSimilarly, M=-1: X = ((-1)^2 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nTherefore, X=3 when |M|=3, and X=-1 when |M|=1.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicity of X=3 is 2 (since M=3 and M=-3, each with 1 state, so total 2 states), and multiplicity of X=-1 is 6 (since M=1 and M=-1, each with 3 states, so total 6 states). Therefore, same as before.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}\n\nSo, that's the partition function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of hyperbolic functions. Let's see:\n\nNote that e^{3βJ} + e^{-βJ} can be written in terms of cosh, but since we have coefficients 2 and 6, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, factor:\n\nZ = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3)\n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary. The answer is likely expected in the expanded form.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's a different approach. For example, using the property of the partition function for interacting spins. But since the interaction is between all pairs, it's a three-spin system with pairwise interactions.

Let me see if that helps. Let me denote P = S1S2S3. Then, note that S1S2 = P/S3, S1S3 = P/S2, S2S3 = P/S1. But since each S_i is ±1, 1/S_i = S_i. Therefore, S1S2 = P*S3, S1S3 = P*S2, S2S3 = P*S1. Therefore, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = P(S1 + S2 + S3). Therefore, E = -J*P*(S1 + S2 + S3)\n\nBut since P = S1S2S3, which is ±1, and S1 + S2 + S3 = M, the magnetization.

So, E = -J*(-1)*(-3) = -3J, which matches. For M=1, which is two +1 and one -1, P = S1S2S3 = (+1)(+1)(-1) = -1. So, E = -J*(-1)*1 = J, which matches.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) with energy \( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we need to consider all possible states of the system. Each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), leading to \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. 

We calculate the energy for each state and then use the partition function formula \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \).

1. **Enumerate all states and their energies:**
   - **State 1 (+++):** \( E = -3J \)
   - **State 2 (++-):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 3 (+-+):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 4 (+--):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 5 (-++):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 6 (-+-):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 7 (--+):** \( E = J \)
   - **State 8 (---):** \( E = -3J \)

2. **Calculate the partition function:**
   - States 1 and 8 each contribute \( e^{3\beta J} \).
   - States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each contribute \( e^{-\beta J} \).

Summing these contributions, we get:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

Thus, the partition function \( Z \) is:
\[
\boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   E = -J*3 = -3J

So, summarizing the energies:

- States 1 and 8 have energy -3J
- States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 have energy J

Therefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-βE}. Let's compute each term:

For states 1 and 8 (energy -3J):
Each contributes e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}

For states 2 through 7 (energy J):
Each contributes e^{-β*J} = e^{-βJ}

So, the total Z is 2*e^{3βJ} + 6*e^{-βJ}

But wait, let me check again. The energy for states 1 and 8 is -3J, so when we plug into the exponential, it's e^{-βE} = e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}. Correct. For the other six states, E = J, so e^{-β*J}. So, yes, 2 terms with e^{3βJ} and 6 terms with e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, this can be written as Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}

But perhaps we can factor this expression. Let's see:

Factor out 2e^{-Jβ}:

Z = 2e^{-Jβ}(e^{4Jβ} + 3)

But not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of hyperbolic functions? Let's see:

But perhaps the answer is just 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, check if there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all states. Let me think.

Alternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see if there's a way to compute the partition function by considering possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me denote the sum as X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then, E = -JX, so Z = sum_{all states} e^{βJX}

So, Z = sum_{X} g(X) e^{βJX}, where g(X) is the number of states with a given X.

So, if I can compute the possible values of X and their multiplicities, that would help.

From the previous enumeration, we saw that X can be 3 or -1. For states 1 and 8, X = 3 (since all spins are aligned, so each product is +1, sum is 3). For the other six states, X = -1. Wait, in the previous calculation, when the energy was J, that corresponds to X = -1, since E = -JX. So, if E = J, then X = -1. If E = -3J, then X = 3.

So, X can be 3 or -1, with multiplicities 2 and 6, respectively.

Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute this without enumerating all states. Let me try.

Note that for three spins, the sum X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me see if there's a relationship between X and the total magnetization or something else.

Alternatively, note that S1, S2, S3 are ±1. Let me consider variables:

Let me denote S1, S2, S3 as variables each taking ±1. Let me compute X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Alternatively, note that X can be written as S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = S1(S2 + S3) + S2S3.

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables like S1 + S2 + S3. Let me see.

Alternatively, note that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i^2 = 1, this becomes 3 + 2X. Therefore, X = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3]/2.

Therefore, X = [M^2 - 3]/2, where M = S1 + S2 + S3.

So, if I can compute the possible values of M, then I can compute X.

Possible values of M:

Each S_i is ±1, so M can be -3, -1, 1, 3.

But for three spins:

Possible M values:

- All three spins +1: M=3

- Two +1, one -1: M=1

- One +1, two -1: M=-1

- All three spins -1: M=-3

So, M can be ±3, ±1. The number of states for each M:

- M=3: 1 state (all +1)

- M=1: 3 choose 1 = 3 states (one -1, two +1)

- M=-1: 3 choose 2 = 3 states (two -1, one +1)

- M=-3: 1 state (all -1)

But according to our previous enumeration, states with M=3 and M=-3 correspond to X=3, and the rest correspond to X=-1. Let's check:

If M=3, then X = (3^2 -3)/2 = (9 -3)/2 = 3. Similarly, M=-3, same since squared: X=3.

For M=1: X = (1^2 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

Similarly, M=-1: X = ((-1)^2 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

Therefore, X=3 when |M|=3, and X=-1 when |M|=1.

Therefore, the multiplicity of X=3 is 2 (since M=3 and M=-3, each with 1 state, so total 2 states), and multiplicity of X=-1 is 6 (since M=1 and M=-1, each with 3 states, so total 6 states). Therefore, same as before.

Therefore, Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

So, that's the partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of hyperbolic functions. Let's see:

Note that e^{3βJ} + e^{-βJ} can be written in terms of cosh, but since we have coefficients 2 and 6, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, factor:

Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3)

But perhaps that's not necessary. The answer is likely expected in the expanded form.

Alternatively, check if there's a different approach. For example, using the property of the partition function for interacting spins. But since the interaction is between all pairs, it's a three-spin system with pairwise interactions. However, the given energy is a sum of pairwise products, which is similar to the Ising model on a triangle.

In the Ising model, the partition function can sometimes be calculated using transfer matrices or other methods, but for three spins, enumeration is straightforward.

Alternatively, note that the energy can be written as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me consider variables such as the products of spins. Let me think about possible configurations.

Alternatively, note that for three spins, the product S1S2S3 can be either +1 or -1. Let me see if that helps. Let me denote P = S1S2S3. Then, note that S1S2 = P/S3, S1S3 = P/S2, S2S3 = P/S1. But since each S_i is ±1, 1/S_i = S_i. Therefore, S1S2 = P*S3, S1S3 = P*S2, S2S3 = P*S1. Therefore, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = P(S1 + S2 + S3). Therefore, E = -J*P*(S1 + S2 + S3)

But since P = S1S2S3, which is ±1, and S1 + S2 + S3 = M, the magnetization. Therefore, E = -J*P*M

But M can be ±3, ±1, and P can be ±1. However, note that P and M are related. For example, if all spins are +1, then P=1 and M=3. If two are +1 and one is -1, then P = (-1) and M=1. Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, then P=(-1) and M=-1. If all are -1, then P=(-1)^3 = -1 and M=-3. Wait, but in that case, P*M would be:

For M=3, P=1: P*M=3

For M=1, P=-1: P*M=-1

For M=-1, P=-1: P*M=1

For M=-3, P=-1: P*M=3

Therefore, E = -J*P*M, which would be:

For M=3: E = -J*1*3 = -3J

For M=1: E = -J*(-1)*1 = J

For M=-1: E = -J*(-1)*(-1) = -J

For M=-3: E = -J*(-1)*(-3) = -3J

Wait, but this seems conflicting with previous results. Wait, in our previous calculation, when M=-3, which is all spins -1, the energy was -3J. But according to this formula, E = -J*P*M. For M=-3, P = S1S2S3 = (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1. So, E = -J*(-1)*(-3) = -3J, which matches. For M=1, which is two +1 and one -1, P = S1S2S3 = (+1)(+1)(-1) = -1. So, E = -J*(-1)*1 = J, which matches. For M=-1, which is two -1 and one +1, P = (-1)(-1)(+1) = +1. Wait, hold on. Wait, if two are -1 and one is +1, then S1S2S3 = (-1)(-1)(+1) = +1. Therefore, E = -J*(+1)*(-1) = J. Wait, but in our previous calculation, when M=-1, the energy was J. Wait, but according to this formula, E = -J*P*M. For M=-1 and P=+1, E = -J*(+1)*(-1) = J. Which matches. For M=1 and P=-1, E = J. For M=-3 and P=-1, E = -3J. For M=3 and P=1, E = -3J. So, the energies are:

- For M=3: E=-3J

- For M=1: E=J

- For M=-1: E=J

- For M=-3: E=-3J

Therefore, the energies are the same as before. So, the multiplicity for E=-3J is 2 (M=3 and M=-3, each with 1 state), and multiplicity for E=J is 6 (M=1 and M=-1, each with 3 states). Therefore, the partition function is indeed Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the result is the same. So, the answer is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ} = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Alternatively, factor out 2e^{-βJ}:

Z = 2e^{-βJ}(e^{4βJ} + 3)

But whether this is a simpler form is debatable. The problem just asks for the partition function, so either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first form is more straightforward.

Alternatively, check if there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify with one example. For example, take state 2: (+1, +1, -1). Then, S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So, E = -J*(-1) = J. Correct. Similarly, state 8: all -1. Each product is 1, sum is 3, E=-3J. Correct.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

**Final Answer**
The partition function \( Z \) is \boxed{2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}}.
