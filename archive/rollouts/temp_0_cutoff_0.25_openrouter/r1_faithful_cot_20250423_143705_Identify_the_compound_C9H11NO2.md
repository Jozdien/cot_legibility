# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out what this compound is. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me start by looking at the IR data first. There are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or an amide. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl group, so maybe an ester or a ketone. But since there's also an N-H, maybe it's an amide? Wait, but amides usually have carbonyl around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. Let me note that.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's go through each peak:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Like in an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. So maybe an ethyl ester? Because esters often have OCH2CH3, where the CH3 is a triplet.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. A broad singlet with 2H. Broad could mean exchange, maybe NH2. But where are the protons? If it's NH2, maybe in an amide or amine. But earlier, the IR had N-H stretches, so maybe this is an NH2 group. But why is it a singlet? If it's an NH2 adjacent to something, but maybe it's deshielded. Wait, but in the NMR, NH2 protons can be broad due to exchange. But the integration is 2H, which matches NH2. But the chemical shift at 4.0 ppm. Wait, NH2 in amines are usually around 1-3 ppm, but if it's an amide, maybe upfield shifted? Or maybe it's an alcohol? But the IR didn't show a broad O-H stretch. The IR had medium bands at 3420 and 3325, which are more like N-H stretches. So maybe it's an amide. But amide protons are usually around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in some cases. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but a broad singlet? Maybe if it's adjacent to an electronegative atom and split into a singlet. Wait, but OCH2 would usually be around 3-4 ppm. But a broad singlet? Maybe if it's part of an ester, like OCH2CO, but then the splitting might be different. Hmm.

Next, 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. That's probably a CH2 next to a CH3. So if the 1.20 ppm is a CH3, then the quartet at 4.5 would be the adjacent CH2. So maybe an ethyl group, OCH2CH3. But then the quartet would be from the OCH2CH3, where the CH2 is split by the adjacent CH3. But wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as a triplet and the CH2 as a quartet. So that matches the 1.20 triplet (CH3) and 4.5 quartet (OCH2). But then the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 usually. Hmm, 4.5 is a bit upfield for an ester OCH2? Or maybe it's part of another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen and a nitrogen? Like in a urethane or something else.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets with 2H each suggest that there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring, which is typical for para substitution. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm might be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like a nitro group or an ester group in the para position. Wait, but the molecular formula has one N and two O's. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that would take two O's and one N, but then the remaining would be C9H11... Let's see. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that uses one N and two O's. Then the rest would be C9H11. But that seems a lot. Wait, maybe it's an amide. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a para-substituted benzene ring with an ester group and an amino group. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check. Ethyl para-aminobenzoate would have the structure NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's count: C6 (benzene) + COO (2 O's) + CH2CH3 (ethyl) + NH2. So C6 + 3 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) + 1 (NH2) but wait, the COO is part of the benzene, so the total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10? Wait, no. Wait, the benzoate is C6H5COO-, so that's 7 carbons. Then the ethyl ester would add 2 more (OCH2CH3), so total 7 + 2 = 9 carbons. Plus the NH2 is on the benzene. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: C: 9, H: 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 has 5 H) + 2 (NH2) = 12? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H5, then COOCH2CH3 is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which is 3 O's but in the formula we have two O's. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, ethyl para-aminobenzoate: the structure is NH2-C6H4-CO-O-CH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C6 (benzene) + COO (from the ester) + CH2CH3 (ethyl) + NH2. So carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10? Wait, no. Wait, the benzene ring is C6, then the COO is part of the carboxylic acid ester: so the carboxylic acid is -COO-, so that's two oxygens, and the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. So the total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's count again.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. As an ethyl ester, it would be C7H6O2 (benzoic acid) minus H (from -OH) plus OCH2CH3. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O? Wait, maybe better to count directly. The ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 1 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9 carbons. Yes! So C9. Then hydrogens: benzene (5 H, since it's para-substituted with COO and NH2?), wait, no. Wait, the benzene ring in para-aminobenzoate would have NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. So the benzene ring is C6H4, with two substituents. So each substituent takes one H, so 6 - 2 = 4 H on the ring. Then the COOEt group: OCH2CH3 has 5 H (the ethyl group: 2+3=5?), wait, OCH2CH3 has 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3. So total 5 H. Then the NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. Which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Perfect! So the formula matches.

Now check the IR. The NH2 group would have N-H stretches around 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, which are the medium to strong bands. The ester carbonyl would be at 1720 cm⁻¹, which matches the strong band. So that fits.

Now the NMR. Let's see:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group. The ethyl ester's CH3 is next to the OCH2, so it's split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2. The integration is 3H, which matches.

4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The CH2 is adjacent to the CH3, so split into a quartet. The chemical shift around 4.5 is a bit high for an ethyl ester's OCH2, which is usually around 4.1-4.3, but maybe if there's deshielding from the adjacent groups, it could be upshifted. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) would be the NH2 group. Amine protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but in an aromatic amine (aniline derivative), the NH2 protons can be broad due to exchange and might appear around 4 ppm. However, in para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine, which is typically deprotonated? Wait, no. Para-aminobenzoic acid is a carboxylic acid with an amino group. Its ester would have the NH2 group. But in the ester form, the NH2 is still present as -NH2. However, aromatic amines (anilines) typically have NH2 protons that are deshielded and appear around 3-5 ppm as broad peaks due to exchange with water. But in the case of para-aminobenzoate ester, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the protons would be broad, maybe as a singlet if they're equivalent. The integration of 2H matches two protons, which is the NH2. So that fits.

The aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). In para-substituted benzene with two groups, the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing groups would be deshielded. For example, if there's an ester group (COOEt) and an NH2 group in para positions, the ester is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it would be downfield. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be upfield. Wait, but in para-aminobenzoate ester, the ester group is at the para position relative to the NH2. So the ring would have two substituents: COOEt and NH2, para to each other. The remaining protons on the ring are the two ortho to COOEt and two ortho to NH2. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded (downfield), and the NH2 is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be shielded (upfield). So the two protons next to COOEt would be at higher ppm (like 8.0) and the two next to NH2 would be at lower ppm (like 7.0). That matches the NMR peaks: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between the two sets would be meta coupling, but in para-substituted rings, the protons are in pairs that are adjacent to each substituent, so each pair is ortho to one substituent and meta to the other. The coupling constant for para-substituted aromatic protons would be J = around 8-9 Hz, which would give a doublet. So that fits.

Putting it all together, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Let me confirm the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Benzocaine is C9H11NO2. Yes. The structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The IR has the NH2 stretches and the ester carbonyl. The NMR matches the ethyl group, the NH2 as a broad singlet, and the aromatic protons split into two doublets. So this must be benzocaine.

Let's try to determine the identity of this compound. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Beginning with the IR data, there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, which likely indicate N-H stretching vibrations, possibly from an amine or amide functional group. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, potentially from an ester or ketone. However, this frequency is higher than typical amide carbonyls (1650-1700 cm⁻¹), so it's more consistent with an ester or ketone. I should make note of this.

Looking at the ¹H NMR spectrum:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm integrating for 3H likely represents a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, as in an ethyl group. The triplet pattern indicates it's neighboring a CH2 that appears as a quartet. This could be part of an ethyl ester structure (OCH2CH3), where the methyl typically appears as a triplet.

The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating for 2H is puzzling. The broadness might indicate exchange processes, suggesting NH2. The integration of 2H supports this assignment. However, the chemical shift of 4.0 ppm is somewhat unusual for NH2 in amines (typically 1-3 ppm) or amides (usually 6-8 ppm). Alternatively, this could be an OCH2 group, but the broad singlet pattern is unexpected. If it's adjacent to an electronegative atom and appears as a singlet, that might explain it, but OCH2 typically resonates around 3-4 ppm.

The quartet at 4.5 ppm integrating for 2H likely represents a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 group. This could be the CH2 portion of an ethyl group (OCH2CH3), where the CH2 is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3. In an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 appearing as a quartet due to coupling with the CH3.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's attempt to determine what this compound might be. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. I'll begin by examining the IR data. There are medium to strong absorption bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, which are likely N-H stretches, possibly indicating an amine or an amide. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, therefore it could be an ester or a ketone. But since there's an N-H stretch as well, it might be an amide. However, typically, amides have carbonyl stretches around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹, while 1720 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of an ester or ketone. I'll make a note of that.

Now onto the 1H NMR data. Let's analyze each peak:

At 1.20 ppm, there's a triplet corresponding to 3H. This could indicate a methyl group next to a CH2 group, like in an ethyl group. The triplet suggests proximity to a CH2 that forms a quartet. This could hint at an ethyl ester, as esters often contain an OCH2CH3 group, where the CH3 appears as a triplet.

At 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet for 2H. The broadness could indicate proton exchange, possibly suggesting an NH2 group. But where are the attached protons? If it's an NH2 group, it might be part of an amide or amine. Earlier in the IR spectrum, there were N-H stretches, so maybe it's indeed an NH2 group. But why is it appearing as a singlet? It might be an NH2 adjacent to something that shields or de-shields it. However, in NMR, NH2 protons can appear broad due to exchange processes, with an integration of 2H fitting an NH2 group. Yet, the 4.0 ppm chemical shift is puzzling since NH2 groups in amines usually appear between 1-3 ppm. In an amide, it might shift upfield. Or could it be an alcohol? But the IR didn't display a broad O-H stretch, only medium bands at 3420 and 3325 indicative of N-H rather than O-H stretches. It could be an amide, but amide protons normally appear between 6-8 ppm, despite potential variations. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm signal might denote an OCH2 group, fitting the broad singlet profile possibly due to an adjacent electronegative atom, altering the typical splitting pattern. An OCH2 signal usually appears between 3-4 ppm, potentially seen in an ester as OCH2CO, though the splitting should differ.

Next is the 4.5 ppm quartet, corresponding to 2H. The quartet probably indicates a CH2 group next to a CH3. If the 1.20 ppm peak represents a CH3, then this 4.5 ppm quartet could be the adjoining CH2. This suggests an ethyl group, OCH2CH3, where the CH2 is split by the neighboring CH3. In an ethyl ester, this OCH2CH3 quartet arises from the adjacent CH3 splitting.

But here it's 4.5 ppm. Maybe the ethyl group is part of something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But why quartet? If it's adjacent to a CH3, but maybe there's another splitting. Wait, maybe the quartet is from coupling with two different groups. Hmm.\n\nThen the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets with 2H each suggest that there are two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm might be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro or ester groups. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm could be adjacent to an electron-donating group. Wait, but if it's para-substituted, maybe one substituent is electron-withdrawing and the other is electron-donating? But in para positions, the substituents would be opposite each other. Wait, but maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a nitro group in the para position would deshield the adjacent protons. Wait, but the downfield protons are at 8.0 ppm, which is typical for nitro groups. Let me check: nitro groups in para position would cause the adjacent protons to be around 8.0 ppm. So maybe the benzene ring has a nitro group in the para position, and another substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: benzene ring (C6H5), then we have C3H6NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's part of the formula. So maybe the structure is something like para-nitrobenzene with an ethyl ester or something. Let's see.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That would be one benzene ring (3 degrees) plus two double bonds or rings. Wait, but a benzene ring is 4 degrees (3 double bonds count as 3, but each ring is one, so benzene is 3 rings (no, wait, degrees of unsaturation: each ring or double bond is 1. Benzene has 3 double bonds and one ring, so total 4 degrees. Wait, no: degrees of unsaturation formula counts each ring or double bond as 1. So benzene (three double bonds in a ring) counts as 4 degrees: one ring plus three double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is: each double bond (or ring) is 1 degree. A triple bond is 2. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring. Wait, but actually, the ring itself is one degree, and each double bond is another. Wait, no, actually, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for benzene (C6H6): (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14 -6)/2 = 8/2 =4. So 4 degrees of unsaturation. So benzene accounts for 4, so the remaining 1 degree must be from another double bond or ring. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Let me check again: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees. So benzene (4) plus one more, maybe an ester group (which is a double bond). So the structure is likely a benzene ring with substituents, an ester group, and an amine or amide.\n\nWait, but the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is an ester. So maybe the compound is an ester. Let's think. If there's a benzene ring with a nitro group (para), and an ester group. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-nitrobenzoate. That would be O2NC6H4COOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula: C9H9NO4. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe not that. Wait, maybe there's an ethyl group attached to an amide? Let's see. If it's a benzamide with an ethyl group. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO, so N-ethyl would be C9H11NO. But the formula here is C9H11NO2. So we need an extra oxygen. Maybe it's an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid with an amino group. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's phenylethylamine derivative. But with a nitro group and an ester? Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the NMR again: the aromatic protons are two doublets. So para-substituted. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4. The downfield protons (8.0 ppm) are likely adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like nitro. The upfield (7.0 ppm) could be adjacent to an electron-donating group. Wait, but if there's a nitro group in the para position, then the adjacent protons would be at around 8.0. Wait, maybe the substituents are nitro and another group. Wait, but the molecular formula has N and O. Let's see. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's one N and two O. Then the remaining O would be in the ester. So maybe the structure is para-nitrobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Wait, but that would be O2NC6H4COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H9NO4. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's two more H and two fewer O. Hmm. Not matching. So maybe not a nitro group. Wait, maybe it's an amide. Let's see. If there's a CONH2 group. Then the formula would have an amide. Let's see. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be NH2C6H4COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester? No, the NMR shows a triplet for CH3. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) suggests an ethyl group. So maybe the ester is ethyl, but then the formula would have three O (from COOEt). But the given formula has two O. So maybe not an ester. Wait, but the IR has a strong band at 1720, which is more like ester or ketone. If it's a ketone, then maybe a benzophenone derivative, but where's the N?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the carbonyl is an amide. But amide carbonyl is usually lower. Wait, maybe it's an acetylated amine. For example, acetanilide. Acetanilide is C8H9NO. The formula here is C9H11NO2. So one more CH2O. Hmm. Maybe ethyl acetanilide? But how?\n\nWait, let's think about the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If that's the case, maybe the compound is a primary amide. For example, benzamide with an ethyl group. But benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethyl group would make C9H9NO. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So two more H and one more O. Hmm. Maybe it's a carbamate. Carbamate ester? Like ethyl carbamate. But with a benzene ring. For example, phenyl carbamate ethyl ester. But I'm not sure. Let's see. The carbamate would be OCONHR. If it's OCONH2 as a substituent on benzene, then the formula would be C7H7NO3. Adding an ethyl group might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a urethane, like ethyl phenylurethane. But I need to check the formula. Alternatively, maybe it's a glycine ethyl ester attached to a benzene ring. For example, phenylglycine ethyl ester. Glycine is NH2CH2COOH. The ethyl ester would be NH2CH2COOEt. If that's attached to a benzene ring, maybe as a substituent. Wait, but then the formula would be C6H5-CH2-NH2-COOEt. That would be C11H15NO3. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. That would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. The formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is acetylated? So it's acetylamino benzoic acid ethyl ester. Then the formula would be C11H13NO4. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's count the atoms again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 carbons. Let's break it down. Suppose there's a benzene ring (6C), then we have 3C, 11H, 1N, 2O. The 3C could be a -CH2CH2O- group? Wait, but with an N. Maybe a -NH-CO-O- group? Like a carbamate. For example, if the benzene ring has a carbamate group (O-CONH-) attached, and then an ethyl group. Let's see. Benzene (6C) + OCONH-CH2CH3. That would be 6C + (O, C, O, N, 2C, 3H). Wait, maybe OCONHCH2CH3. So the carbamate would be OCONHCH2CH3. Then the total formula would be C6H5O2NCH2CH3. That's C8H10NO3. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ester, and there's an amide. Let's see. Suppose we have a benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt) and an NH2 group. Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2). That would be C9H11NO3. Again, one more O than given. So not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the carbonyl is not an ester but a ketone. Then the O count would be different. For example, a benzophenone with an ethyl group and an amine. But I'm not sure. Let's think. If there's a ketone (C=O), then the O is one. The other O could be in an ether or alcohol. But the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch. The IR has N-H stretches. So maybe the O is in an amide. Wait, but amide has both N and O. If the carbonyl is an amide, then the IR would have a carbonyl around 1650-1700. But the IR here is 1720, which is higher, more like ester or ketone. Hmm. Maybe the carbonyl is an ester, and there's an amide elsewhere. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is a methyl ester with an ethyl group and an amide. Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose we have a benzene ring with a substituent that's a -COOEt group and another substituent that's a -NH2 group. Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2). That's C9H11NO3. Again, one more O. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, maybe the compound is a cyclic amide, like a lactam. For example, a five-membered ring lactam with a benzene ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted pyrrolidone. But I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets. That's typical for para-substituted benzene. So two substituents in para positions. Let's say one is an ester group (COOEt) and the other is an amino group (NH2). Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2) which is C9H11NO3. Again, extra O. So maybe the substituent is not an amino group but something else with N. Like a nitro group? Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NO2), which is C9H9NO5. No, that's even worse.\n\nWait, maybe the substituents are a methoxy group and an amide. But methoxy is OCH3. Let's see. If one substituent is OCH3 and the other is CONH2. Then the formula would be C6H4(OCH3)(CONH2). That's C8H8NO3. Adding an ethyl group somewhere? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ethylamide. Like -NHCOCH2CH3. Then the substituents on benzene could be -COOEt and -NHCOCH2CH3. But that would make the formula C6H4(COOEt)(NHCOCH2CH3) which is C12H15NO5. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the compound is not a benzene ring with two substituents, but a benzene ring with one substituent that has multiple groups. For example, a substituent like -CH2CH2OCO-... Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's look back at the NMR. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If that's the case, maybe the structure has a primary amide group. Then the carbonyl would be a CONH2. But the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Hmm. Maybe it's a tertiary amide? No, tertiary amides don't have N-H. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. So it's a primary or secondary amide. But primary amide's carbonyl is around 1680-1650. So maybe the 1720 is an ester, and the N-H is from an amine. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group.\n\nWait, let's think of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. The formula is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. How can that be? Unless there's a different group. Wait, maybe the amine is not -NH2 but -NH- connected to something else. For example, if it's a methylamine group. But then where's the O?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a benzocaine, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. But benzocaine's formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, wait, let me check. Benzocaine: NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Yes! Because the benzoic acid is C7H6O2, then esterifying with ethanol gives C7H5O2 (from acid) + C2H5O (from ethanol) → C9H10O2, but with an NH2 group replacing a hydrogen, so adding one N and one H. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches!\n\nSo let's check the data. IR: the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹. The N-H stretches (amine) at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The amine would be a primary amine, so two N-H stretches. The NMR: the ethyl group in the ester would give a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The NH2 group would be a broad singlet. But in benzocaine, the NH2 is para to the ester. However, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are usually around 6-7 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe in this case, it's shifted. Wait, but the NMR here shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position. Wait, benzocaine is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the NH2 is para to the ester. The aromatic protons would be two doublets: the ones adjacent to the NH2 (which is electron-donating) would be upfield, and those adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield. Wait, but in benzocaine, the ester is at the para position to the NH2. So the ester is at position 4, and the NH2 is at position 1. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But since it's para-substituted, the protons ortho to the ester (positions 3 and 5) would be downfield, and those meta to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be upfield. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests that the two sets of protons are each coupled to one another, which would happen if they are adjacent. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituents would be split into two doublets. For example, if substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), then the protons at 2,3,5,6 would be in two pairs. The protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent at 1, and protons at 3 and 5 adjacent to substituent at 4. But depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts would differ. If substituent at 1 is NH2 (electron-donating), the protons ortho to it (2 and 6) would be upfield, and the substituent at 4 is COOEt (electron-withdrawing), so protons ortho to it (3 and 5) would be downfield. So the NMR would show two doublets: one upfield (7.0 ppm) for 2 and 6, and one downfield (8.0 ppm) for 3 and 5. That matches the given NMR data. \n\nNow, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are typically deshielded and appear as a broad peak around 6-7 ppm. But in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't align. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position but in another position. Or maybe it's an alkyl amine. Wait, but the molecular formula and other data fit benzocaine. Maybe the NH2 in this case is part of a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak at 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another group. Wait, the integration is 2H. If it's an NH2, that's two protons. But in benzocaine, the NH2 is usually around 6 ppm. However, maybe the sample is in a different solvent or there's exchange broadening. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but then the carbonyl would be lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate. But that would have a nitro group, which would make the formula C9H9NO4. Doesn't match. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe the nitro is not present. \n\nWait, going back to benzocaine. Let's check the NMR shifts. In benzocaine, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2-4.4 ppm. The given data has the quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is slightly upfield. The aromatic protons: in benzocaine, the protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) are around 8.0 ppm (as in ethyl benzoate), and those ortho to the NH2 are around 6.6 ppm. But the given data has 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Close enough, considering solvent and substituent effects. The NH2 protons in benzocaine are usually around 6.5 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe in this case, they are at 4.0 ppm. That seems off. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position. Wait, if the NH2 is in the meta position relative to the ester, would that change the shifts? Or maybe it's an alkyl amine instead of an aromatic amine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is phenacetin, which is another para-substituted benzene. Phenacetin is ethoxyacetophenone with an amide. Wait, phenacetin is p-ethoxyacetanilide. The formula is C10H13NO2. Close but not matching. Our compound is C9H11NO2. So one less CH2. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the possible functional groups. The IR shows ester (1720) and NH2 (3420, 3325). So maybe an ethyl ester and a primary amine. The benzene ring is para-substituted with these groups. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine) fits except for the NH2 shift. But maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring. Wait, if the NH2 is part of an ethyl group, like in ethyl glycinate. But then how is it connected? Maybe the structure is something like ethyl 4-(aminomethyl)benzoate. That would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group and a CH2NH2 group. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (6C) + COOEt (3C, 2O) + CH2NH2 (1C, 1N). Total C: 6+3+1=10. Wait, no. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. Then it's benzocaine. But the NH2 shift is off. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but then the carbonyl would be lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl phenylcarbamate. Carbamate is OCONH2. So phenyl carbamate ethyl ester would be C6H5OCO-NH2-OEt? No, carbamate is OCONHR. If it's OCONH2, then ethyl phenylcarbamate would be C6H5OCONH2. But that's C7H7NO3. Adding an ethyl group? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is a methyl group attached to the nitrogen. Like ethyl N-methyl-4-aminobenzoate. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: COOEt (3C, 2O), N-methyl (1C, 1N), benzene (6C). So total C: 3+1+6=10. No, that's 10C. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the NH2 is part of a side chain. For example, the compound could be something like ethyl 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzoate. Then the formula would be C6H4-COOEt-CH2CH2NH2. That's C11H15NO2. No, too many carbons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a glycine ethyl ester attached to the benzene. Like benzoylglycine ethyl ester. That would be C6H5-CO-NH-CH2-COOEt. The formula would be C11H13NO4. Not matching.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me recap. The compound has:\n\n- An ethyl group (triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5)\n- A para-substituted benzene with two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm)\n- A carbonyl (ester at 1720)\n- NH2 (IR and NMR at 4.0 ppm)\n\nThe only structure that fits the molecular formula and the ester is benzocaine, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The discrepancy is the NH2 shift. But maybe in this case, the NH2 is exchanging and appears at a different shift. Or perhaps the solvent is different. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another group. Wait, the integration is 2H. If it's a CH2 group, but why a broad singlet? Maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom and exchanging. For example, OCH2O, but that's usually in acetals. Or maybe it's an NH in a secondary amine. But secondary amines usually have one N-H. Wait, but the IR shows two N-H bands, which suggests a primary amine (two N-H stretches). So the 4.0 ppm must be NH2. But why is it at 4.0? Maybe it's an alkyl amine, like -CH2NH2. The CH2NH2 group. The protons on the CH2 would be around 3-4 ppm, but the NH2 would be around 1.5-2.5 ppm. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a sulfonamide, but the formula doesn't include sulfur. \n\nWait, another thought: the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could be an -OCH2O- group, but that's usually in acetals and would be around 4-5 ppm as a singlet. But the integration is 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group next to oxygen, like OCH2CO. But in the NMR, that would be a quartet if next to a CH3. But here it's a singlet. Maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's rare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an -NH- group in a secondary amine, but then the integration would be 1H. But it's 2H. So maybe two NH groups? Unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine), and the NH2 protons are accidentally integrated at 4.0 ppm due to some exchange or solvent effect. Even though typically they are around 6-7 ppm, maybe in DMSO or another solvent, they shift. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different structure. \n\nGiven that all other data points to benzocaine, and the molecular formula matches, I think that's the answer, despite the NH2 shift discrepancy. Maybe the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is actually the NH2, and the shift is due to the solvent or concentration. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. \n\nSo, putting it all together: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine). The structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt) and an amino group (NH2) in the para position. The NMR shows the ethyl group, the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet. The IR confirms the ester and NH2 groups. Therefore, the compound is benzocaine.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444386, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6583, prompt_tokens=796, total_tokens=7379, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine)**. Here's the analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂)**:  
   - Indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation (one benzene ring and one double bond, likely from an ester).

2. **IR Data**:  
   - **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: N-H stretches from a primary amine (-NH₂).  
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong ester carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

3. **¹H NMR**:  
   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Methyl group (-CH₃) in an ethyl ester (-OCH₂CH₃), split as a triplet by adjacent CH₂.  
   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Methylene group (-OCH₂-) in the ethyl ester, split as a quartet by the CH₃.  
   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet from -NH₂ protons (exchange broadening typical for amines).  
   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Para-substituted aromatic protons. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester (-COOEt), while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group.

4. **Structure Confirmation**:  
   - The para-substitution pattern, ester group, and primary amine align with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula matches (C₉H₁₁NO₂), and the spectral data are consistent with this structure. The slight discrepancy in the -NH₂ chemical shift (4.0 ppm instead of ~6-7 ppm) may arise from solvent effects or exchange broadening.

**Answer**:  
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine)**.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

1.20 ppm triplet (CH3) and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here it's 4.5 ppm. Maybe the ethyl group is part of something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But why quartet? If it's adjacent to a CH3, but maybe there's another splitting. Wait, maybe the quartet is from coupling with two different groups. Hmm.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets with 2H each suggest that there are two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm might be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro or ester groups. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm could be adjacent to an electron-donating group. Wait, but if it's para-substituted, maybe one substituent is electron-withdrawing and the other is electron-donating? But in para positions, the substituents would be opposite each other. Wait, but maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a nitro group in the para position would deshield the adjacent protons. Wait, but the downfield protons are at 8.0 ppm, which is typical for nitro groups. Let me check: nitro groups in para position would cause the adjacent protons to be around 8.0 ppm. So maybe the benzene ring has a nitro group in the para position, and another substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: benzene ring (C6H5), then we have C3H6NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's part of the formula. So maybe the structure is something like para-nitrobenzene with an ethyl ester or something. Let's see.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That would be one benzene ring (3 degrees) plus two double bonds or rings. Wait, but a benzene ring is 4 degrees (3 double bonds count as 3, but each ring is one, so benzene is 3 rings (no, wait, degrees of unsaturation: each ring or double bond is 1. Benzene has 3 double bonds and one ring, so total 4 degrees. Wait, no: degrees of unsaturation formula counts each ring or double bond as 1. So benzene (three double bonds in a ring) counts as 4 degrees: one ring plus three double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is: each double bond (or ring) is 1 degree. A triple bond is 2. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring. Wait, but actually, the ring itself is one degree, and each double bond is another. Wait, no, actually, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for benzene (C6H6): (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14 -6)/2 = 8/2 =4. So 4 degrees of unsaturation. So benzene accounts for 4, so the remaining 1 degree must be from another double bond or ring. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Let me check again: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees. So benzene (4) plus one more, maybe an ester group (which is a double bond). So the structure is likely a benzene ring with substituents, an ester group, and an amine or amide.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is an ester. So maybe the compound is an ester. Let's think. If there's a benzene ring with a nitro group (para), and an ester group. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-nitrobenzoate. That would be O2NC6H4COOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula: C9H9NO4. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe not that. Wait, maybe there's an ethyl group attached to an amide? Let's see. If it's a benzamide with an ethyl group. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO, so N-ethyl would be C9H11NO. But the formula here is C9H11NO2. So we need an extra oxygen. Maybe it's an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid with an amino group. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe it's phenylethylamine derivative. But with a nitro group and an ester? Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR again: the aromatic protons are two doublets. So para-substituted. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4. The downfield protons (8.0 ppm) are likely adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like nitro. The upfield (7.0 ppm) could be adjacent to an electron-donating group. Wait, but if there's a nitro group in the para position, then the adjacent protons would be at around 8.0. Wait, maybe the substituents are nitro and another group. Wait, but the molecular formula has N and O. Let's see. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's one N and two O. Then the remaining O would be in the ester. So maybe the structure is para-nitrobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Wait, but that would be O2NC6H4COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H9NO4. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's two more H and two fewer O. Hmm. Not matching. So maybe not a nitro group. Wait, maybe it's an amide. Let's see. If there's a CONH2 group. Then the formula would have an amide. Let's see. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be NH2C6H4COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester? No, the NMR shows a triplet for CH3. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) suggests an ethyl group. So maybe the ester is ethyl, but then the formula would have three O (from COOEt). But the given formula has two O. So maybe not an ester. Wait, but the IR has a strong band at 1720, which is more like ester or ketone. If it's a ketone, then maybe a benzophenone derivative, but where's the N?

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is an amide. But amide carbonyl is usually lower. Wait, maybe it's an acetylated amine. For example, acetanilide. Acetanilide is C8H9NO. The formula here is C9H11NO2. So one more CH2O. Hmm. Maybe ethyl acetanilide? But how?

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If that's the case, maybe the compound is a primary amide. For example, benzamide with an ethyl group. But benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethyl group would make C9H9NO. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So two more H and one more O. Hmm. Maybe it's a carbamate. Carbamate ester? Like ethyl carbamate. But with a benzene ring. For example, phenyl carbamate ethyl ester. But I'm not sure. Let's see. The carbamate would be OCONHR. If it's OCONH2 as a substituent on benzene, then the formula would be C7H7NO3. Adding an ethyl group might complicate.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a urethane, like ethyl phenylurethane. But I need to check the formula. Alternatively, maybe it's a glycine ethyl ester attached to a benzene ring. For example, phenylglycine ethyl ester. Glycine is NH2CH2COOH. The ethyl ester would be NH2CH2COOEt. If that's attached to a benzene ring, maybe as a substituent. Wait, but then the formula would be C6H5-CH2-NH2-COOEt. That would be C11H15NO3. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. That would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. The formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is acetylated? So it's acetylamino benzoic acid ethyl ester. Then the formula would be C11H13NO4. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait, let's count the atoms again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 carbons. Let's break it down. Suppose there's a benzene ring (6C), then we have 3C, 11H, 1N, 2O. The 3C could be a -CH2CH2O- group? Wait, but with an N. Maybe a -NH-CO-O- group? Like a carbamate. For example, if the benzene ring has a carbamate group (O-CONH-) attached, and then an ethyl group. Let's see. Benzene (6C) + OCONH-CH2CH3. That would be 6C + (O, C, O, N, 2C, 3H). Wait, maybe OCONHCH2CH3. So the carbamate would be OCONHCH2CH3. Then the total formula would be C6H5O2NCH2CH3. That's C8H10NO3. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ester, and there's an amide. Let's see. Suppose we have a benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt) and an NH2 group. Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2). That would be C9H11NO3. Again, one more O than given. So not matching.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is not an ester but a ketone. Then the O count would be different. For example, a benzophenone with an ethyl group and an amine. But I'm not sure. Let's think. If there's a ketone (C=O), then the O is one. The other O could be in an ether or alcohol. But the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch. The IR has N-H stretches. So maybe the O is in an amide. Wait, but amide has both N and O. If the carbonyl is an amide, then the IR would have a carbonyl around 1650-1700. But the IR here is 1720, which is higher, more like ester or ketone. Hmm. Maybe the carbonyl is an ester, and there's an amide elsewhere. But how?

Wait, maybe the structure is a methyl ester with an ethyl group and an amide. Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose we have a benzene ring with a substituent that's a -COOEt group and another substituent that's a -NH2 group. Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2). That's C9H11NO3. Again, one more O. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, maybe the compound is a cyclic amide, like a lactam. For example, a five-membered ring lactam with a benzene ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted pyrrolidone. But I need to think differently.

Wait, the NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets. That's typical for para-substituted benzene. So two substituents in para positions. Let's say one is an ester group (COOEt) and the other is an amino group (NH2). Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2) which is C9H11NO3. Again, extra O. So maybe the substituent is not an amino group but something else with N. Like a nitro group? Then the formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NO2), which is C9H9NO5. No, that's even worse.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a methoxy group and an amide. But methoxy is OCH3. Let's see. If one substituent is OCH3 and the other is CONH2. Then the formula would be C6H4(OCH3)(CONH2). That's C8H8NO3. Adding an ethyl group somewhere? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ethylamide. Like -NHCOCH2CH3. Then the substituents on benzene could be -COOEt and -NHCOCH2CH3. But that would make the formula C6H4(COOEt)(NHCOCH2CH3) which is C12H15NO5. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the compound is not a benzene ring with two substituents, but a benzene ring with one substituent that has multiple groups. For example, a substituent like -CH2CH2OCO-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's look back at the NMR. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If that's the case, maybe the structure has a primary amide group. Then the carbonyl would be a CONH2. But the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Hmm. Maybe it's a tertiary amide? No, tertiary amides don't have N-H. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. So it's a primary or secondary amide. But primary amide's carbonyl is around 1680-1650. So maybe the 1720 is an ester, and the N-H is from an amine. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group.

Wait, let's think of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. The formula is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one less O. How can that be? Unless there's a different group. Wait, maybe the amine is not -NH2 but -NH- connected to something else. For example, if it's a methylamine group. But then where's the O?

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzocaine, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. But benzocaine's formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, wait, let me check. Benzocaine: NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Yes! Because the benzoic acid is C7H6O2, then esterifying with ethanol gives C7H5O2 (from acid) + C2H5O (from ethanol) → C9H10O2, but with an NH2 group replacing a hydrogen, so adding one N and one H. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches!

So let's check the data. IR: the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹. The N-H stretches (amine) at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The amine would be a primary amine, so two N-H stretches. The NMR: the ethyl group in the ester would give a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The NH2 group would be a broad singlet. But in benzocaine, the NH2 is para to the ester. However, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are usually around 6-7 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe in this case, it's shifted. Wait, but the NMR here shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position. Wait, benzocaine is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the NH2 is para to the ester. The aromatic protons would be two doublets: the ones adjacent to the NH2 (which is electron-donating) would be upfield, and those adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield. Wait, but in benzocaine, the ester is at the para position to the NH2. So the ester is at position 4, and the NH2 is at position 1. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But since it's para-substituted, the protons ortho to the ester (positions 3 and 5) would be downfield, and those meta to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be upfield. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests that the two sets of protons are each coupled to one another, which would happen if they are adjacent. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituents would be split into two doublets. For example, if substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), then the protons at 2,3,5,6 would be in two pairs. The protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent at 1, and protons at 3 and 5 adjacent to substituent at 4. But depending on the substituents, their chemical shifts would differ. If substituent at 1 is NH2 (electron-donating), the protons ortho to it (2 and 6) would be upfield, and the substituent at 4 is COOEt (electron-withdrawing), so protons ortho to it (3 and 5) would be downfield. So the NMR would show two doublets: one upfield (7.0 ppm) for 2 and 6, and one downfield (8.0 ppm) for 3 and 5. That matches the given NMR data. 

Now, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are typically deshielded and appear as a broad peak around 6-7 ppm. But in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't align. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position but in another position. Or maybe it's an alkyl amine. Wait, but the molecular formula and other data fit benzocaine. Maybe the NH2 in this case is part of a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak at 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another group. Wait, the integration is 2H. If it's an NH2, that's two protons. But in benzocaine, the NH2 is usually around 6 ppm. However, maybe the sample is in a different solvent or there's exchange broadening. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but then the carbonyl would be lower. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate. But that would have a nitro group, which would make the formula C9H9NO4. Doesn't match. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe the nitro is not present. 

Wait, going back to benzocaine. Let's check the NMR shifts. In benzocaine, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2-4.4 ppm. The given data has the quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is slightly upfield. The aromatic protons: in benzocaine, the protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) are around 8.0 ppm (as in ethyl benzoate), and those ortho to the NH2 are around 6.6 ppm. But the given data has 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Close enough, considering solvent and substituent effects. The NH2 protons in benzocaine are usually around 6.5 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe in this case, they are at 4.0 ppm. That seems off. Wait, maybe the NH2 is not in the para position. Wait, if the NH2 is in the meta position relative to the ester, would that change the shifts? Or maybe it's an alkyl amine instead of an aromatic amine. 

Alternatively, maybe the compound is phenacetin, which is another para-substituted benzene. Phenacetin is ethoxyacetophenone with an amide. Wait, phenacetin is p-ethoxyacetanilide. The formula is C10H13NO2. Close but not matching. Our compound is C9H11NO2. So one less CH2. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the possible functional groups. The IR shows ester (1720) and NH2 (3420, 3325). So maybe an ethyl ester and a primary amine. The benzene ring is para-substituted with these groups. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine) fits except for the NH2 shift. But maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring. Wait, if the NH2 is part of an ethyl group, like in ethyl glycinate. But then how is it connected? Maybe the structure is something like ethyl 4-(aminomethyl)benzoate. That would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group and a CH2NH2 group. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (6C) + COOEt (3C, 2O) + CH2NH2 (1C, 1N). Total C: 6+3+1=10. Wait, no. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. Then it's benzocaine. But the NH2 shift is off. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but then the carbonyl would be lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl phenylcarbamate. Carbamate is OCONH2. So phenyl carbamate ethyl ester would be C6H5OCO-NH2-OEt? No, carbamate is OCONHR. If it's OCONH2, then ethyl phenylcarbamate would be C6H5OCONH2. But that's C7H7NO3. Adding an ethyl group? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a methyl group attached to the nitrogen. Like ethyl N-methyl-4-aminobenzoate. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: COOEt (3C, 2O), N-methyl (1C, 1N), benzene (6C). So total C: 3+1+6=10. No, that's 10C. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the NH2 is part of a side chain. For example, the compound could be something like ethyl 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzoate. Then the formula would be C6H4-COOEt-CH2CH2NH2. That's C11H15NO2. No, too many carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a glycine ethyl ester attached to the benzene. Like benzoylglycine ethyl ester. That would be C6H5-CO-NH-CH2-COOEt. The formula would be C11H13NO4. Not matching.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me recap. The compound has:

- An ethyl group (triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5)
- A para-substituted benzene with two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm)
- A carbonyl (ester at 1720)
- NH2 (IR and NMR at 4.0 ppm)

The only structure that fits the molecular formula and the ester is benzocaine, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The discrepancy is the NH2 shift. But maybe in this case, the NH2 is exchanging and appears at a different shift. Or perhaps the solvent is different. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another group. Wait, the integration is 2H. If it's a CH2 group, but why a broad singlet? Maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom and exchanging. For example, OCH2O, but that's usually in acetals. Or maybe it's an NH in a secondary amine. But secondary amines usually have one N-H. Wait, but the IR shows two N-H bands, which suggests a primary amine (two N-H stretches). So the 4.0 ppm must be NH2. But why is it at 4.0? Maybe it's an alkyl amine, like -CH2NH2. The CH2NH2 group. The protons on the CH2 would be around 3-4 ppm, but the NH2 would be around 1.5-2.5 ppm. Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a sulfonamide, but the formula doesn't include sulfur. 

Wait, another thought: the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could be an -OCH2O- group, but that's usually in acetals and would be around 4-5 ppm as a singlet. But the integration is 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group next to oxygen, like OCH2CO. But in the NMR, that would be a quartet if next to a CH3. But here it's a singlet. Maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's rare. 

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an -NH- group in a secondary amine, but then the integration would be 1H. But it's 2H. So maybe two NH groups? Unlikely. 

Wait, maybe the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine), and the NH2 protons are accidentally integrated at 4.0 ppm due to some exchange or solvent effect. Even though typically they are around 6-7 ppm, maybe in DMSO or another solvent, they shift. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different structure. 

Given that all other data points to benzocaine, and the molecular formula matches, I think that's the answer, despite the NH2 shift discrepancy. Maybe the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is actually the NH2, and the shift is due to the solvent or concentration. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. 

So, putting it all together: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine). The structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt) and an amino group (NH2) in the para position. The NMR shows the ethyl group, the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet. The IR confirms the ester and NH2 groups. Therefore, the compound is benzocaine.

The substituent causing the downfield shift (8.0 ppm) could be a nitro group (-NO2) or an ester group. However, the molecular formula includes one N and two O atoms. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that would account for one N and two O's, leaving the other O in an ester group (COO). Let's check the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2) and an ester (COO), then the formula would need to account for that. Let's count:\n\nNitro group: NO2 (1N, 2O)\nEster: COO (2O)\nBut the molecular formula has only 1N and 2O. Wait, that's a problem. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's 1N and 2O. Then the ester (COO) would add another 2O, but the total O in the formula is 2. So that's a conflict. Therefore, the nitro group is not possible here. Alternatively, maybe the N is in an amide or amine group.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3) plus a carbonyl (1) and maybe a double bond or ring (1). But the aromatic ring accounts for 4 (three double bonds in benzene), but benzene is considered as 3 degrees (each ring and three double bonds count as 3). Wait, degrees of unsaturation formula: each ring or double bond is 1, each triple bond is 2. So benzene (3 double bonds) is 3 degrees. Then a carbonyl (double bond) is another, making 4. Then maybe another ring or double bond. Wait, total degrees here are 5. So benzene (3) + carbonyl (1) + another ring (1) would make 5. Alternatively, maybe an amide group (which has a double bond from the carbonyl). Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and an amino group. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid (C7H6O2) esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH) would give C9H10O2. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. So there's an extra N and an extra H. If instead of benzoic acid, it's para-aminobenzoic acid, then the acid would be C7H7NO2. Esterifying with ethanol would give C9H11NO2. That matches the molecular formula. So ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the structure.\n\nEthyl para-aminobenzoate would have the structure:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-O-CH2CH3\n|\nNH2\n|\nBenzene ring\n\nBut wait, the substituents on the benzene would be the ester (COOEt) and the amino group (NH2) in para positions. Let's check the NMR.\n\nThe aromatic protons would be two doublets. The amino group is in the para position relative to the ester. The protons adjacent to the amino group (ortho to NH2) would be deshielded? Wait, the amino group is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons would be upfield. The protons adjacent to the ester (ortho to COOEt) would be deshielded (downfield). So in the NMR, the two doublets would be for the two sets of aromatic protons. The ones next to the ester (COOEt) would be downfield (8.0 ppm), and those next to the NH2 would be upfield (7.0 ppm). That matches the given NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).\n\nNow, the NH2 group. In the IR, the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ are likely N-H stretches. The amino group would have two N-H stretches, which can be medium to strong. The ester carbonyl would be at 1720 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR data.\n\nIn the ¹H NMR, the NH2 protons. However, in the NMR data provided, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). But NH2 protons in amines are usually around 1-3 ppm if aliphatic, but aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) have NH2 protons that are broad and can be around 4 ppm or higher. However, in para-aminobenzoate ester, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine. However, aromatic amines (like aniline) typically have NH2 protons that are broad due to exchange with water, but their chemical shifts can vary. However, in the case of para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives, the NH2 is often de-shielded and can appear around 4-5 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated (as in acetanilide), but that would require an additional O and a CH3CO group, which would change the molecular formula. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Let's check: ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. The structure is:\n\nPh-COO-Et with NH2 in the para position. So the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring. In such cases, the NH2 protons are typically broad singlets in the range of 3.5-5.5 ppm, depending on the substitution. So 4.0 ppm is plausible. However, sometimes these protons can exchange rapidly and be very broad or even not observed. But the data here shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which could correspond to the NH2 group. However, in aromatic amines, the NH2 protons are usually more downfield than aliphatic amines. Wait, but in aniline, the NH2 protons are around 3.5-4.0 ppm as a broad peak. So this matches.\n\nThe other NMR signals: the triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the OCH2CH3. The chemical shift for OCH2 in an ester is typically around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but here it's 4.5 ppm. Maybe due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl and the aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps there's another group affecting it. But the splitting makes sense: the CH2 adjacent to the O would be split by the adjacent CH3 into a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So that fits.\n\nThe broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is the NH2. However, in some cases, the NH2 protons might be split into a singlet if they are not split by neighboring protons, but in reality, they are usually broad due to exchange. So the data seems to fit ethyl para-aminobenzoate.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a methyl ester? Let's check. If the ester were methyl, the molecular formula would be C8H9NO2, which doesn't match. So ethyl is correct.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe it's a benzamide derivative. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. But the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Benzamide is C7H7NO, adding an ethyl group (C2H5) would give C9H12NO, which doesn't match. Alternatively, ethyl benzoylcarbamate? Not sure. Let me check the molecular formula again. C9H11NO2. The ethyl para-aminobenzoate seems to fit.\n\nAnother check: the integration. The aromatic protons are 4H total (2H each at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). The ethyl group (3H + 2H), the NH2 (2H), and the OCH2 (2H). Wait, total H's: 3 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (NH2) + 4 (aromatic) = 11 H, which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic with the structure ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let me confirm the NMR shifts.\n\nBenzocaine's NMR:\n\n- The ethyl group: CH3 as a triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm, OCH2 as a quartet around 4.2-4.4 ppm. The given data has OCH2 at 4.5 ppm, which is slightly upfield but possible. The NH2 protons as a broad peak around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons: the two protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8.0 ppm), and the two ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm). This matches the given data.\n\nThe IR carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ester C=O), and the N-H stretches at ~3400 cm⁻¹. So this all fits.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is a bit high for an ester OCH2, which is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm. However, if there's an electron-withdrawing group nearby, it could shift upfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen or nitrogen.

The doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, each integrating for 2H, suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between the two doublets (each with two protons) indicates that the substituents are in the para positions. The downfield shift of the protons at 8.0 ppm suggests they are deshielded, possibly by an electron-withdrawing group like a nitro group or an ester. The 7.0 ppm protons are more shielded, perhaps adjacent to an electron-donating group.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. The substituent causing the downfield shift (8.0 ppm) could be a nitro group (-NO2) or an ester group. However, the molecular formula includes one N and two O atoms. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that would account for one N and two O's, leaving the other O in an ester group (COO). Let's check the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2) and an ester (COO), then the formula would need to account for that. Let's count:

Nitro group: NO2 (1N, 2O)
Ester: COO (2O)
But the molecular formula has only 1N and 2O. Wait, that's a problem. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that's 1N and 2O. Then the ester (COO) would add another 2O, but the total O in the formula is 2. So that's a conflict. Therefore, the nitro group is not possible here. Alternatively, maybe the N is in an amide or amine group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3) plus a carbonyl (1) and maybe a double bond or ring (1). But the aromatic ring accounts for 4 (three double bonds in benzene), but benzene is considered as 3 degrees (each ring and three double bonds count as 3). Wait, degrees of unsaturation formula: each ring or double bond is 1, each triple bond is 2. So benzene (3 double bonds) is 3 degrees. Then a carbonyl (double bond) is another, making 4. Then maybe another ring or double bond. Wait, total degrees here are 5. So benzene (3) + carbonyl (1) + another ring (1) would make 5. Alternatively, maybe an amide group (which has a double bond from the carbonyl). Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and an amino group. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid (C7H6O2) esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH) would give C9H10O2. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. So there's an extra N and an extra H. If instead of benzoic acid, it's para-aminobenzoic acid, then the acid would be C7H7NO2. Esterifying with ethanol would give C9H11NO2. That matches the molecular formula. So ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the structure.

Ethyl para-aminobenzoate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH3
|
NH2
|
Benzene ring

But wait, the substituents on the benzene would be the ester (COOEt) and the amino group (NH2) in para positions. Let's check the NMR.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The amino group is in the para position relative to the ester. The protons adjacent to the amino group (ortho to NH2) would be deshielded? Wait, the amino group is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons would be upfield. The protons adjacent to the ester (ortho to COOEt) would be deshielded (downfield). So in the NMR, the two doublets would be for the two sets of aromatic protons. The ones next to the ester (COOEt) would be downfield (8.0 ppm), and those next to the NH2 would be upfield (7.0 ppm). That matches the given NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).

Now, the NH2 group. In the IR, the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ are likely N-H stretches. The amino group would have two N-H stretches, which can be medium to strong. The ester carbonyl would be at 1720 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR data.

In the ¹H NMR, the NH2 protons. However, in the NMR data provided, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). But NH2 protons in amines are usually around 1-3 ppm if aliphatic, but aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) have NH2 protons that are broad and can be around 4 ppm or higher. However, in para-aminobenzoate ester, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine. However, aromatic amines (like aniline) typically have NH2 protons that are broad due to exchange with water, but their chemical shifts can vary. However, in the case of para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives, the NH2 is often de-shielded and can appear around 4-5 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated (as in acetanilide), but that would require an additional O and a CH3CO group, which would change the molecular formula. But the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Let's check: ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. The structure is:

Ph-COO-Et with NH2 in the para position. So the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring. In such cases, the NH2 protons are typically broad singlets in the range of 3.5-5.5 ppm, depending on the substitution. So 4.0 ppm is plausible. However, sometimes these protons can exchange rapidly and be very broad or even not observed. But the data here shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which could correspond to the NH2 group. However, in aromatic amines, the NH2 protons are usually more downfield than aliphatic amines. Wait, but in aniline, the NH2 protons are around 3.5-4.0 ppm as a broad peak. So this matches.

The other NMR signals: the triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the OCH2CH3. The chemical shift for OCH2 in an ester is typically around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but here it's 4.5 ppm. Maybe due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl and the aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps there's another group affecting it. But the splitting makes sense: the CH2 adjacent to the O would be split by the adjacent CH3 into a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So that fits.

The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is the NH2. However, in some cases, the NH2 protons might be split into a singlet if they are not split by neighboring protons, but in reality, they are usually broad due to exchange. So the data seems to fit ethyl para-aminobenzoate.

Alternatively, could it be a methyl ester? Let's check. If the ester were methyl, the molecular formula would be C8H9NO2, which doesn't match. So ethyl is correct.

Another possibility: maybe it's a benzamide derivative. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. But the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Benzamide is C7H7NO, adding an ethyl group (C2H5) would give C9H12NO, which doesn't match. Alternatively, ethyl benzoylcarbamate? Not sure. Let me check the molecular formula again. C9H11NO2. The ethyl para-aminobenzoate seems to fit.

Another check: the integration. The aromatic protons are 4H total (2H each at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). The ethyl group (3H + 2H), the NH2 (2H), and the OCH2 (2H). Wait, total H's: 3 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (NH2) + 4 (aromatic) = 11 H, which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2. So that's correct.

Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic with the structure ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let me confirm the NMR shifts.

Benzocaine's NMR:

- The ethyl group: CH3 as a triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm, OCH2 as a quartet around 4.2-4.4 ppm. The given data has OCH2 at 4.5 ppm, which is slightly upfield but possible. The NH2 protons as a broad peak around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons: the two protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8.0 ppm), and the two ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm). This matches the given data.

The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ester C=O), and the N-H stretches at ~3400 cm⁻¹. So this all fits. Therefore, the compound is benzocaine, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Alternatively, if it's part of an amide, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen or nitrogen.\n\nThen, the aromatic signals: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling between the two doublets suggests that each pair is adjacent, so para substitution. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm protons might indicate electron-withdrawing groups, such as a nitro group or an ester. Alternatively, if there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the protons ortho to it would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. For example, in nitrobenzene, the ortho and para protons are deshielded. But in this case, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think. If there's a substituent in the para position, the two protons adjacent (ortho) would be deshielded, and the meta protons would be shielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the two sets of protons would be equivalent. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the two ortho protons are equivalent, and the two meta protons are equivalent. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, which would correspond to two pairs of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, leading to two doublets. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) might be the meta protons, and the downfield (8.0 ppm) the ortho protons. Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene with a single substituent, the ortho and para protons are equivalent. Wait, no. If there's a single substituent in the para position, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons: the two ortho and the two meta. But in reality, for a monosubstituted benzene, the ortho and para protons are not equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is at position 4, so positions 2, 3, 5, 6. The ortho positions would be 2 and 6, which are equivalent. The meta positions would be 3 and 5, which are equivalent. So, the NMR would show two doublets if the coupling is between adjacent protons. Wait, but in reality, for a para-substituted benzene, the splitting would be more complex. However, in the case of a para-substituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitro group, the ortho protons are deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta protons are shielded. Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-donating group, the ortho and para protons are shielded. But in this case, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's consider possible substituents. If the substituent is an ester group (COOR), which is electron-withdrawing, then the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. However, the ester group is usually meta-directing. Wait, but in terms of substituent effects, an ester group (COOR) is a meta-directing group. So, if the substituent is in the para position, perhaps the ester is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. If there's a benzene ring (C6H5), then the remaining atoms would be C3H6NO2. Let's see. If the substituent is a COOEt group (ethyl ester), that would be COOCH2CH3. Then, the substituent would be OCOCH2CH3. The formula for that group would be OCOC2H5, which is O2C3H5. So, the benzene ring (C6H5) plus O2C3H5 would give C9H10O2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra NH. Therefore, perhaps the substituent is a CONH2 group (amide) with an ethyl ester? Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that includes an amide and an ester. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is phenylacetamide with an ester. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus a carbonyl (1 degree) and maybe a ring or double bond. But since the benzene ring accounts for 3, and the carbonyl (from the ester or amide) accounts for 1, that's 4. The remaining one could be another double bond or a ring. But the NMR doesn't show any other doublet or triplet that would suggest a double bond. So maybe it's a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an amide or ester.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and an amide. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the structure would be NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. Let's check the IR and NMR data.\n\nIR: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the ester carbonyl. The medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ would be the N-H stretches of the amine. However, in para-aminobenzoate, the amine is part of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative), which typically shows N-H stretches around 3400 cm⁻¹. But in the IR data, the bands are at 3420 and 3325, which could be the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the NH2 group. However, aromatic amines (anilines) usually have weaker N-H stretches compared to aliphatic amines. The problem states medium to strong intensity, which might fit. Alternatively, if the NH2 is part of an amide, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine, not an amide. Let's check the NMR.\n\n1H NMR: The ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.0-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2-1.4 ppm. The given data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). Wait, but in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 group's CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet, and the CH3 is around 1.2-1.3 ppm as a triplet. The quartet at 4.5 ppm here is a bit upfield, but maybe due to the adjacent aromatic ring or other substituents. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is not part of the ester. Let's see. The NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate would be on the benzene ring. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with an NH2 group, the ortho protons would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-aminobenzoate, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt. Wait, no. If the substituent is NH2 in the para position, then the other substituent (COOEt) would be in the para position as well? Wait, no. The structure would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. So, the amino group and the ester are on adjacent carbons? No, in para-aminobenzoate, the amino group is in the para position relative to the ester. Wait, the benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So, the COOEt is in the para position relative to the NH2. So, the benzene ring has an NH2 group at position 4 and a COOEt group at position 1. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, 6. The protons adjacent to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho to the NH2 and meta to the COOEt. The protons adjacent to the COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho to the COOEt and meta to the NH2. The NH2 is an electron-donating group, which would activate the ring and direct substituents to the ortho and para positions. However, the COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group, which is meta-directing. But in this case, the substituents are already in the para positions. The NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's consider the coupling. In para-aminobenzoate, the protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded due to the electron-donating effect of NH2, but the COOEst group is electron-withdrawing. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to coupling between adjacent protons. Let me think of the actual shifts. The NH2 group is electron-donating, so the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. The COOEt group is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho and para protons to it would be deshielded. But since both substituents are para to each other, the protons adjacent to the NH2 (ortho to NH2, which is meta to COOEt) would experience a different environment than those adjacent to the COOEt (ortho to COOEt, meta to NH2). The protons ortho to the COOEst would be more deshielded and appear downfield. So, perhaps the 8.0 ppm doublet corresponds to the protons ortho to the COOEst, and the 7.0 ppm doublet corresponds to the protons ortho to the NH2. That would make sense. The NH2 group donates electrons, making the adjacent protons less deshielded (upfield), while the COOEst withdraws electrons, making adjacent protons more deshielded (downfield). So, the two doublets would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data.\n\nNow, the NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate would typically show a singlet in the NMR, but since it's on the aromatic ring, the protons on the NH2 might exchange rapidly and not show up in the NMR, or they might be broad. However, in the given NMR data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, that doesn't fit. The NH2 protons in aniline derivatives are usually around 3-5 ppm as a broad peak due to exchange, but in this case, the integration is 2H, which matches NH2. However, the chemical shift at 4.0 ppm is a bit low for aromatic amines. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine. If the NH2 were part of an amide, the chemical shift would be different. Let me check. In an amide, the NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm as broad peaks. But here, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring but in another part of the molecule. Let's consider another possibility. Suppose the compound is phenylethylamine derivative with an ester. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's think of another structure. Maybe it's a benzamide. For example, ethyl benzamide. The structure would be Ph-CONH-OEt? No, that's not right. Wait, benzamide is Ph-CONH2. If it's ethyl benzamide, perhaps Ph-CONH-Et. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (C6H5), CONHCH2CH3. That would be C6H5-CONHCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That fits. Let's check the IR and NMR.\n\nIR: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the amide carbonyl. Wait, but amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹. However, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720. So maybe this is an ester and an amide. Wait, but ethyl benzamide would have an amide group (CONH-Et), so the carbonyl would be around 1680 cm⁻¹. The IR here shows 1720, which is more like an ester. Therefore, maybe the compound is an ethyl ester with an amide group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Let's think. A carbamate (urethane) has the structure O=C(NR2)O-. For example, ethyl carbamate would be O=C(NH2)OCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C3H7NO2. But our compound is C9H11NO2, so perhaps a benzyl carbamate? Wait, benzyl carbamate would be PhCH2O(CO)NH2. The formula would be C8H9NO2. Not matching. Alternatively, phenyl carbamate: O=C(NH2)OPh. That would be C7H7NO2. Still not matching. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a para-nitrobenzoate ester. Wait, but the molecular formula includes a nitrogen. If it's para-nitro, then the formula would have an additional NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count again. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the formula is C9H11NO2. That's correct. Let's check again. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3 gives C8H8O2. Adding an NH2 group (as in para-aminobenzoic acid) would make it C8H9NO2. Then, esterifying with ethanol would give C9H11NO2. Yes, that works. So ethyl para-aminobenzoate would have the formula C9H11NO2. Now, the NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons in aromatic amines are typically broad but may not always be observed in the NMR if they are exchanging rapidly. However, in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If that's the NH2, the chemical shift is a bit low. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine. Let me check typical NMR shifts for para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives. In ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe under certain conditions, such as in DMSO, they can be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, if the sample is in CDCl3, the NH2 protons might be broad and appear around 4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated, but that would change the molecular formula. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Let's think again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH2 group. If the NH2 is adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, it might shift upfield. For example, in a urea or a carbamate. But the molecular formula doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. If the structure is something like Ph-CO-NH2, which is benzamide. Then, the NH2 would be around 6-7 ppm as a broad peak. But the given data has a peak at 4.0 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a methylene group. For example, a structure like CH2NH2. But where would that fit? Let's consider another approach. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the benzene ring (C6H5), leaving C3H6NO2. The remaining atoms could be a propyl group with an amide and an ester. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe the compound is a phenylalanine ethyl ester. Phenylalanine is an amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Yes! Wait, phenylalanine's molecular formula is C9H11NO2. But phenylalanine is an amino acid, which would have an NH2 and a COOH group. However, if it's the ethyl ester of phenylalanine, the formula would be C9H11NO2 (since the ethyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3, so the formula would be C9H11NO2). Let's check. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2 as well? Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. The free acid is C9H11NO2. Wait, no. Wait, phenylalanine's molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O (from esterification) minus H2O. Wait, the formula of phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. When esterified with ethanol, the formula becomes C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O = C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. Let's compute: C9 + C2 = C11, H11 + H5 = H16, N1, O2 + O1 - O1 = O2. Wait, no. Wait, the esterification reaction is: RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O. So, the acid (RCOOH) has formula Cn+1H2n+1NO2 (for phenylalanine, n=8? Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. The acid form is H2N-C8H7-COOH. So, when esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH2CH3, so the formula becomes H2N-C8H7-COOCH2CH3. The original phenylalanine is C9H11NO2 (H2N-CH(CH2Ph)COOH). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count. Phenylalanine's structure is H2N-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH2CH3, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. So, adding C2H5O (which is C2H5O) and subtracting H2O (H2O). The original formula is C9H11NO2. Adding C2H5O (C2H5O) would give C11H16NO3, then subtract H2O (H2O) gives C11H14NO2. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe the ethyl ester of phenylalanine would have a different formula. Therefore, perhaps the compound isn't phenylalanine ethyl ester. Let me check the molecular formula again. The given formula is C9H11NO2. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. If it's the ethyl ester, the formula would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. Wait, the acid is C9H11NO2 (which includes the COOH group). The ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with -OCH2CH3. So, the formula would be C9H11NO2 - O (from COOH) + OCH2CH3. So, subtracting O and adding OCH2CH3. The original formula is C9H11NO2. The COOH is -COOH (which is O2H). Replacing with OCH2CH3 (which is O2C2H5). So, the change is replacing H (from COOH) with C2H5. So, the formula becomes C9H11NO2 - H + C2H5 = C9+2 H11-1+5 NO2 = C11H15NO2. Which doesn't match the given formula. Therefore, it's not phenylalanine ethyl ester.\n\nLet me return to the initial thought of ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The molecular formula matches. The IR shows the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the NH2 stretches. The NMR shows the ethyl group (triplet at 1.2 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm), the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. However, the NH2 in para-aminobenzoate is on the benzene ring, and its protons are typically more downfield. But maybe in this case, due to the ester group's electron-withdrawing effect, the NH2 protons are shifted upfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring. Let's consider another structure. Suppose the compound is a methyl ester of a substituted benzamide. For example, benzamide with an ethyl group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's think of a structure with a benzene ring, an amide, and an ester. For example, ethyl (benzamido)acetate. But that might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Let's think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: 5. Benzene (3), carbonyl (1), and another double bond or ring (1). Let's consider a benzene ring, a carbonyl (ester), and an amide group. For example, N-ethyl benzamide. That would be Ph-CONH-CH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check. Benzene (C6H5), CONHCH2CH3: C6 + (CONHCH2CH3) which is C3H7NO. Total: C9H12NO. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So, missing an oxygen. Therefore, that's not correct. Alternatively, ethyl benzamide would be Ph-CONH2, which is C8H9NO2. Then, ethyl ester would be Ph-COOCH2CH3, which is C9H10O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra NH. Therefore, combining both an amide and an ester. For example, ethyl (N-methyl)benzamide. But that would change the formula. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted acetanilide. Acetanilide is Ph-NHCOCH3. The formula is C8H9NO. If we have an ethyl ester instead of methyl, it would be Ph-NHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO3. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substitution. Let's think again. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H), which is characteristic of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is likely the OCH2 of an ester. The aromatic protons are two doublets, suggesting para substitution. The NH2 group is at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but if the NH2 is part of an amide, then the structure would have a CONH2 group. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's the same as ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's confirm the NMR shifts. The ethyl group would be OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3), quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The NH2 protons would be a broad peak. However, in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons in aromatic amines are typically broad and can appear around 4-5 ppm, depending on the solvent and concentration. If the sample is in DMSO-d6, the NH2 protons might be around 6 ppm, but in CDCl3, they might be lower. However, sometimes NH2 protons can be difficult to observe if they are exchanging rapidly with water. But in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which could correspond to the NH2 group. The IR shows N-H stretches, which would align with this. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the ester carbonyl. Therefore, putting it all together, the compound is likely ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Let me verify the molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) = C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches. The IR has the ester carbonyl and NH2 stretches. The NMR has the ethyl group signals, the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet. This seems to fit. Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as ethyl para-aminobenzoate.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444796, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6164, prompt_tokens=777, total_tokens=6941, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is a bit high for an ethyl ester's OCH2, which is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but maybe there's an electron-withdrawing group nearby, shifting it upfield. Alternatively, if it's part of an amide, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen or nitrogen.

Then, the aromatic signals: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling between the two doublets suggests that each pair is adjacent, so para substitution. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm protons might indicate electron-withdrawing groups, such as a nitro group or an ester. Alternatively, if there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the protons ortho to it would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. For example, in nitrobenzene, the ortho and para protons are deshielded. But in this case, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think. If there's a substituent in the para position, the two protons adjacent (ortho) would be deshielded, and the meta protons would be shielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the two sets of protons would be equivalent. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the two ortho protons are equivalent, and the two meta protons are equivalent. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, which would correspond to two pairs of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, leading to two doublets. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) might be the meta protons, and the downfield (8.0 ppm) the ortho protons. Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene with a single substituent, the ortho and para protons are equivalent. Wait, no. If there's a single substituent in the para position, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons: the two ortho and the two meta. But in reality, for a monosubstituted benzene, the ortho and para protons are not equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is at position 4, so positions 2, 3, 5, 6. The ortho positions would be 2 and 6, which are equivalent. The meta positions would be 3 and 5, which are equivalent. So, the NMR would show two doublets if the coupling is between adjacent protons. Wait, but in reality, for a para-substituted benzene, the splitting would be more complex. However, in the case of a para-substituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitro group, the ortho protons are deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta protons are shielded. Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-donating group, the ortho and para protons are shielded. But in this case, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's consider possible substituents. If the substituent is an ester group (COOR), which is electron-withdrawing, then the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. However, the ester group is usually meta-directing. Wait, but in terms of substituent effects, an ester group (COOR) is a meta-directing group. So, if the substituent is in the para position, perhaps the ester is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. If there's a benzene ring (C6H5), then the remaining atoms would be C3H6NO2. Let's see. If the substituent is a COOEt group (ethyl ester), that would be COOCH2CH3. Then, the substituent would be OCOCH2CH3. The formula for that group would be OCOC2H5, which is O2C3H5. So, the benzene ring (C6H5) plus O2C3H5 would give C9H10O2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra NH. Therefore, perhaps the substituent is a CONH2 group (amide) with an ethyl ester? Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that includes an amide and an ester. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is phenylacetamide with an ester. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus a carbonyl (1 degree) and maybe a ring or double bond. But since the benzene ring accounts for 3, and the carbonyl (from the ester or amide) accounts for 1, that's 4. The remaining one could be another double bond or a ring. But the NMR doesn't show any other doublet or triplet that would suggest a double bond. So maybe it's a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an amide or ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and an amide. Let's see. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the structure would be NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. Let's check the IR and NMR data.

IR: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the ester carbonyl. The medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ would be the N-H stretches of the amine. However, in para-aminobenzoate, the amine is part of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative), which typically shows N-H stretches around 3400 cm⁻¹. But in the IR data, the bands are at 3420 and 3325, which could be the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the NH2 group. However, aromatic amines (anilines) usually have weaker N-H stretches compared to aliphatic amines. The problem states medium to strong intensity, which might fit. Alternatively, if the NH2 is part of an amide, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine, not an amide. Let's check the NMR.

1H NMR: The ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.0-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2-1.4 ppm. The given data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). Wait, but in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 group's CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet, and the CH3 is around 1.2-1.3 ppm as a triplet. The quartet at 4.5 ppm here is a bit upfield, but maybe due to the adjacent aromatic ring or other substituents. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is not part of the ester. Let's see. The NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate would be on the benzene ring. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with an NH2 group, the ortho protons would be deshielded. Wait, but in para-aminobenzoate, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt. Wait, no. If the substituent is NH2 in the para position, then the other substituent (COOEt) would be in the para position as well? Wait, no. The structure would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. So, the amino group and the ester are on adjacent carbons? No, in para-aminobenzoate, the amino group is in the para position relative to the ester. Wait, the benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So, the COOEt is in the para position relative to the NH2. So, the benzene ring has an NH2 group at position 4 and a COOEt group at position 1. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, 6. The protons adjacent to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho to the NH2 and meta to the COOEt. The protons adjacent to the COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho to the COOEt and meta to the NH2. The NH2 is an electron-donating group, which would activate the ring and direct substituents to the ortho and para positions. However, the COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group, which is meta-directing. But in this case, the substituents are already in the para positions. The NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's consider the coupling. In para-aminobenzoate, the protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded due to the electron-donating effect of NH2, but the COOEst group is electron-withdrawing. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to coupling between adjacent protons. Let me think of the actual shifts. The NH2 group is electron-donating, so the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. The COOEt group is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho and para protons to it would be deshielded. But since both substituents are para to each other, the protons adjacent to the NH2 (ortho to NH2, which is meta to COOEt) would experience a different environment than those adjacent to the COOEt (ortho to COOEt, meta to NH2). The protons ortho to the COOEst would be more deshielded and appear downfield. So, perhaps the 8.0 ppm doublet corresponds to the protons ortho to the COOEst, and the 7.0 ppm doublet corresponds to the protons ortho to the NH2. That would make sense. The NH2 group donates electrons, making the adjacent protons less deshielded (upfield), while the COOEst withdraws electrons, making adjacent protons more deshielded (downfield). So, the two doublets would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

Now, the NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate would typically show a singlet in the NMR, but since it's on the aromatic ring, the protons on the NH2 might exchange rapidly and not show up in the NMR, or they might be broad. However, in the given NMR data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, that doesn't fit. The NH2 protons in aniline derivatives are usually around 3-5 ppm as a broad peak due to exchange, but in this case, the integration is 2H, which matches NH2. However, the chemical shift at 4.0 ppm is a bit low for aromatic amines. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine. If the NH2 were part of an amide, the chemical shift would be different. Let me check. In an amide, the NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm as broad peaks. But here, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring but in another part of the molecule. Let's consider another possibility. Suppose the compound is phenylethylamine derivative with an ester. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's think of another structure. Maybe it's a benzamide. For example, ethyl benzamide. The structure would be Ph-CONH-OEt? No, that's not right. Wait, benzamide is Ph-CONH2. If it's ethyl benzamide, perhaps Ph-CONH-Et. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (C6H5), CONHCH2CH3. That would be C6H5-CONHCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That fits. Let's check the IR and NMR.

IR: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the amide carbonyl. Wait, but amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹. However, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720. So maybe this is an ester and an amide. Wait, but ethyl benzamide would have an amide group (CONH-Et), so the carbonyl would be around 1680 cm⁻¹. The IR here shows 1720, which is more like an ester. Therefore, maybe the compound is an ethyl ester with an amide group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Let's think. A carbamate (urethane) has the structure O=C(NR2)O-. For example, ethyl carbamate would be O=C(NH2)OCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C3H7NO2. But our compound is C9H11NO2, so perhaps a benzyl carbamate? Wait, benzyl carbamate would be PhCH2O(CO)NH2. The formula would be C8H9NO2. Not matching. Alternatively, phenyl carbamate: O=C(NH2)OPh. That would be C7H7NO2. Still not matching. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a para-nitrobenzoate ester. Wait, but the molecular formula includes a nitrogen. If it's para-nitro, then the formula would have an additional NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count again. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the formula is C9H11NO2. That's correct. Let's check again. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3 gives C8H8O2. Adding an NH2 group (as in para-aminobenzoic acid) would make it C8H9NO2. Then, esterifying with ethanol would give C9H11NO2. Yes, that works. So ethyl para-aminobenzoate would have the formula C9H11NO2. Now, the NH2 group in para-aminobenzoate is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons in aromatic amines are typically broad but may not always be observed in the NMR if they are exchanging rapidly. However, in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If that's the NH2, the chemical shift is a bit low. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. Wait, but in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is an aromatic amine. Let me check typical NMR shifts for para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives. In ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe under certain conditions, such as in DMSO, they can be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, if the sample is in CDCl3, the NH2 protons might be broad and appear around 4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated, but that would change the molecular formula. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Let's think again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH2 group. If the NH2 is adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, it might shift upfield. For example, in a urea or a carbamate. But the molecular formula doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. If the structure is something like Ph-CO-NH2, which is benzamide. Then, the NH2 would be around 6-7 ppm as a broad peak. But the given data has a peak at 4.0 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a methylene group. For example, a structure like CH2NH2. But where would that fit? Let's consider another approach. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the benzene ring (C6H5), leaving C3H6NO2. The remaining atoms could be a propyl group with an amide and an ester. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe the compound is a phenylalanine ethyl ester. Phenylalanine is an amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Yes! Wait, phenylalanine's molecular formula is C9H11NO2. But phenylalanine is an amino acid, which would have an NH2 and a COOH group. However, if it's the ethyl ester of phenylalanine, the formula would be C9H11NO2 (since the ethyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3, so the formula would be C9H11NO2). Let's check. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2 as well? Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. The free acid is C9H11NO2. Wait, no. Wait, phenylalanine's molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O (from esterification) minus H2O. Wait, the formula of phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. When esterified with ethanol, the formula becomes C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O = C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. Let's compute: C9 + C2 = C11, H11 + H5 = H16, N1, O2 + O1 - O1 = O2. Wait, no. Wait, the esterification reaction is: RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O. So, the acid (RCOOH) has formula Cn+1H2n+1NO2 (for phenylalanine, n=8? Wait, phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. The acid form is H2N-C8H7-COOH. So, when esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH2CH3, so the formula becomes H2N-C8H7-COOCH2CH3. The original phenylalanine is C9H11NO2 (H2N-CH(CH2Ph)COOH). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count. Phenylalanine's structure is H2N-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH2CH3, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. So, adding C2H5O (which is C2H5O) and subtracting H2O (H2O). The original formula is C9H11NO2. Adding C2H5O (C2H5O) would give C11H16NO3, then subtract H2O (H2O) gives C11H14NO2. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe the ethyl ester of phenylalanine would have a different formula. Therefore, perhaps the compound isn't phenylalanine ethyl ester. Let me check the molecular formula again. The given formula is C9H11NO2. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. If it's the ethyl ester, the formula would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. Wait, the acid is C9H11NO2 (which includes the COOH group). The ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with -OCH2CH3. So, the formula would be C9H11NO2 - O (from COOH) + OCH2CH3. So, subtracting O and adding OCH2CH3. The original formula is C9H11NO2. The COOH is -COOH (which is O2H). Replacing with OCH2CH3 (which is O2C2H5). So, the change is replacing H (from COOH) with C2H5. So, the formula becomes C9H11NO2 - H + C2H5 = C9+2 H11-1+5 NO2 = C11H15NO2. Which doesn't match the given formula. Therefore, it's not phenylalanine ethyl ester.

Let me return to the initial thought of ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The molecular formula matches. The IR shows the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the NH2 stretches. The NMR shows the ethyl group (triplet at 1.2 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm), the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. However, the NH2 in para-aminobenzoate is on the benzene ring, and its protons are typically more downfield. But maybe in this case, due to the ester group's electron-withdrawing effect, the NH2 protons are shifted upfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring. Let's consider another structure. Suppose the compound is a methyl ester of a substituted benzamide. For example, benzamide with an ethyl group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's think of a structure with a benzene ring, an amide, and an ester. For example, ethyl (benzamido)acetate. But that might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Let's think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: 5. Benzene (3), carbonyl (1), and another double bond or ring (1). Let's consider a benzene ring, a carbonyl (ester), and an amide group. For example, N-ethyl benzamide. That would be Ph-CONH-CH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check. Benzene (C6H5), CONHCH2CH3: C6 + (CONHCH2CH3) which is C3H7NO. Total: C9H12NO. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So, missing an oxygen. Therefore, that's not correct. Alternatively, ethyl benzamide would be Ph-CONH2, which is C8H9NO2. Then, ethyl ester would be Ph-COOCH2CH3, which is C9H10O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra NH. Therefore, combining both an amide and an ester. For example, ethyl (N-methyl)benzamide. But that would change the formula. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted acetanilide. Acetanilide is Ph-NHCOCH3. The formula is C8H9NO. If we have an ethyl ester instead of methyl, it would be Ph-NHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO3. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substitution. Let's think again. The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H), which is characteristic of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is likely the OCH2 of an ester. The aromatic protons are two doublets, suggesting para substitution. The NH2 group is at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but if the NH2 is part of an amide, then the structure would have a CONH2 group. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's the same as ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's confirm the NMR shifts. The ethyl group would be OCH2CH3: triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3), quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The NH2 protons would be a broad peak. However, in ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons in aromatic amines are typically broad and can appear around 4-5 ppm, depending on the solvent and concentration. If the sample is in DMSO-d6, the NH2 protons might be around 6 ppm, but in CDCl3, they might be lower. However, sometimes NH2 protons can be difficult to observe if they are exchanging rapidly with water. But in the given data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which could correspond to the NH2 group. The IR shows N-H stretches, which would align with this. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the ester carbonyl. Therefore, putting it all together, the compound is likely ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Let me verify the molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) = C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches. The IR has the ester carbonyl and NH2 stretches. The NMR has the ethyl group signals, the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet. This seems to fit. Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as ethyl para-aminobenzoate.
