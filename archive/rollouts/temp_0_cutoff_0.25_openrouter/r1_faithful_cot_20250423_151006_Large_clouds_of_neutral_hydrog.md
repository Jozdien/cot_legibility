To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (rest wavelength **1216 Å**) is detectable with **optical ground-based telescopes**, we need to ensure the observed wavelength shifts into the optical range. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Observed Wavelength Requirement**:  
   Ground-based optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from **~3000 Å (near-UV)** to **~10000 Å (near-IR)**. The atmosphere blocks UV light below **~3000 Å**, so the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted to at least this wavelength.

2. **Redshift Formula**:  
   The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
   \]  
   Solving for redshift \(z\):  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
   \]

3. **Calculation**:  
   For \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å}\):  
   \[
   z = \frac{3000}{1216} - 1 \approx 1.47
   \]  
   However, practical observations often use the **U-band (~3600 Å)** as the lower limit for optical sensitivity. Using this:  
   \[
   z = \frac{3600}{1216} - 1 \approx 1.96
   \]  
   Rounding to a commonly cited value, the lower limit is **\(z \approx 2\)**.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   While the strict calculation gives \(z \approx 1.5\), astronomical convention often uses **\(z \geq 2\)** as the lower limit because the Lyman alpha forest becomes prominent at this redshift, and observations align with the U-band sensitivity of ground-based telescopes.

**Answer**:  
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately **\(z \geq 2\)**.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, such that we can detect them with ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about redshifts and the Lyman alpha line.

First, the Lyman alpha emission line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV light because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of it. So, for the light to be detectable from the ground, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical range. That makes sense. So the question is, how much redshift is needed to move 1216 Angstroms into the optical window?

Wait, what's the typical wavelength range for optical telescopes? I think the visible spectrum is roughly from about 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). But ground-based observations also have atmospheric transmission windows. Let me check: the atmosphere is mostly transparent in the visible range, but starts to absorb in the near-infrared. However, specific bands like U, B, V, R, I correspond to different parts of the spectrum. The U band is around 3600 Angstroms, but atmospheric transmission might be an issue there. Maybe the practical lower limit for ground-based optical is around 3000 Angstroms? Wait, no, the atmosphere blocks UV below about 3000 Angstroms. So if the original wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, we need to redshift it so that the observed wavelength is above 3000 Angstroms?

But wait, maybe the optical range considered here starts at around 4000 Angstroms. Let me confirm. The human eye can see from about 4000 (violet) to 7000 (red). But telescopes can detect a bit beyond that, especially into the near-infrared, but for optical telescopes, the detectors are usually sensitive in the visible range. However, the atmosphere does transmit some UV, but only up to about 3000 Angstroms. Wait, no, the ozone layer absorbs most of the UV below 3000 Angstroms. So ground-based telescopes can't observe below roughly 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, to observe the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms, it needs to be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms. So the redshift z is given by the formula:

observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z)

So solving for z:

z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1

If the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed wavelength needs to be at least 3000 Angstroms, then:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467

So z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift would be approximately 1.47. But wait, maybe the optical range starts at a longer wavelength. For example, if the optical telescopes can only detect light starting at 4000 Angstroms, then:

z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.289 - 1 ≈ 2.289

So z ≈ 2.29. Hmm, so which is it? Is the cutoff at 3000 or 4000 Angstroms?

I need to recall the atmospheric transmission. The atmosphere is opaque to UV light below 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. So any light with wavelength longer than 3000 Angstroms can reach the ground. However, optical telescopes typically observe in the range from about 3000 Angstroms (near-UV) to 10000 Angstroms (near-infrared). But the term "optical" might sometimes refer to the visible range, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So this is a bit ambiguous. However, in astronomy, the U-band is around 3600 Angstroms, which is considered part of the optical window. So perhaps the atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms, but the standard optical filters start at U (3600), B (4400), etc.

But the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes". If the atmosphere allows transmission down to 3000 Angstroms, then the lower limit would be z ≈ 1.47. However, if the telescope's instruments are only sensitive to the visible range (4000-7000), then z ≈ 2.29. But I think in practice, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, like the U-band at ~3000-4000 Angstroms. So maybe the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the U-band. Let's check.

If the U-band starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z = 3000 / 1216 -1 ≈ 1.47. If the U-band is around 3600, then z = 3600 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.96. Wait, 3600 / 1216 is approximately 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96? Wait, 1216 * (1 + z) = 3600. So 1 + z = 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 1216 * (1 + z) = observed wavelength. So if observed wavelength is 3600, then 1 + z = 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. Hmm, so if the U-band is at 3600, then z ≈ 1.96. But I need to check the exact cutoff.

Alternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is around 3100 Angstroms. Let me look up the atmospheric transmission. From what I remember, the Earth's atmosphere becomes opaque below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. So the near-UV from 3000-4000 Angstroms is called the near-ultraviolet and is observable by ground-based telescopes, but with some atmospheric absorption. So the U-band is typically around 3000-4000 Angstroms. So if we take the lower end of the U-band as 3000 Angstroms, then the minimum redshift would be z ≈ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. But if the instrument's sensitivity starts at a higher wavelength, say 3500 Angstroms, then z would be higher.

But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is detectable. So the lower limit would correspond to the smallest redshift that shifts the Lyman alpha line into the observable range of ground-based optical telescopes. Therefore, the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. Assuming the atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. However, if the atmospheric transmission is poor just above 3000 Angstroms and the practical limit is higher, say 3200 Angstroms, then z would be (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.63 -1 ≈ 1.63.

But perhaps the standard approach is to use 912 Angstroms (Lyman limit) and Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. Wait, but the question is about Lyman alpha. So maybe the standard lower limit for Lyman alpha forest observations is z ≈ 1.7? Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the Balmer break is at 3646 Angstroms, which is in the near-UV. But that's a different concept. Maybe the key is that the Lyman alpha line needs to be redshifted into the visible range. If the visible range starts at 4000 Angstroms, then z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. But if the telescope can observe down to 3600 Angstroms (U-band), then z ≈ 2.0. But I need to confirm.

Wait, let's look up the typical redshift for Lyman alpha forest observations. The Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts where the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical. The lower redshift limit is when the Lyman alpha line is at 3600 Angstroms, which corresponds to z ≈ 2. So z ≈ 1.96. Therefore, the lower limit is around z ≈ 2. But maybe the answer is z ≈ 1.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the atmospheric transmission window. If the atmosphere transmits down to 3000 Angstroms, then z = 3000 / 1216 -1 ≈ 1.47. But maybe in practice, due to atmospheric absorption and instrumental sensitivity, the lower limit is higher. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) can observe down to about 3100 Angstroms. So if we take 3100 Angstroms as the lower limit, then z = 3100 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.55 -1 ≈ 1.55. So z ≈ 1.55.

But different sources might give slightly different numbers. For example, in some textbooks, the lower redshift limit for Lyman alpha forest observations is z ≈ 0.3, but that's when the quasar itself is at higher redshift, and the forest is from intervening clouds. Wait, no, the Lyman alpha forest is from intervening clouds at lower redshifts than the quasar. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the clouds. So to observe the Lyman alpha absorption, the quasar must be at a redshift higher than the cloud. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the clouds (the absorbers) such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with ground-based telescopes. So the cloud's Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into the optical. So the cloud's redshift z_abs must satisfy:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_abs) >= lambda_min

where lambda_min is the minimum observable wavelength for the telescope. If lambda_min is 3600 Angstroms (U-band), then:

1 + z_abs = 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z_abs ≈ 1.96. If lambda_min is 3000, then z_abs ≈ 1.47.

But which is the correct lambda_min? I think the standard answer is that the Lyman alpha forest is observed in the optical for quasars at z > 2, but that refers to the quasar's redshift. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Suppose a quasar is at redshift z_qso. The Lyman alpha absorption from intervening clouds at redshift z_abs < z_qso will be observed at wavelength:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_abs)

To observe this in the optical, say at 3600 Angstroms, then z_abs >= (3600 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.96. Therefore, the lower limit on z_abs is about 1.96. But if the quasar is at a higher redshift, we can see absorbers at lower z_abs, but their Lyman alpha would be at longer wavelengths. Wait, no. The observed wavelength depends only on the absorber's redshift. If the absorber is at z_abs, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z_abs). To detect this with a ground-based telescope, this wavelength must be in the optical range. So the minimum z_abs is when 1216*(1+z_abs) is equal to the shortest observable wavelength, which is around 3000-3600 Angstroms.

If we take 3600 Angstroms as the start of the optical window (U-band), then z_abs ≈ 1.96. If we take 4000 Angstroms (start of visible light), then z_abs ≈ 2.29. However, in practice, ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3100 Angstroms (near-UV), so using 3100 Angstroms:

z_abs = (3100 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.55 -1 ≈ 1.55.

But different sources might use different values. For example, in the textbook "Introduction to Cosmology" by Barbara Ryden, she mentions that Lyman alpha absorption lines from z ≈ 0.3 would be observed at 1216 * 1.3 ≈ 1580 Angstroms, which is still in the UV. So to get to 3000 Angstroms, z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is around z ≈ 1.5.

But I need to check if there's a standard value. For example, the Lyman break is at 912 Angstroms, and galaxies at z > 3 have their Lyman break redshifted to 912*(1+z) > 3650 Angstroms, which is the Balmer break. But that's the Lyman break galaxy technique. However, for Lyman alpha absorption, the relevant wavelength is 1216 Angstroms.

In observational cosmology, the Lyman-alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with redshifts z > 2, allowing the forest to be in the optical. So for a quasar at z=2, the Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*3=3648 Angstroms, which is in the U-band. Therefore, absorbers along the line of sight with z_abs < z_qso will have their Lyman alpha absorption at wavelengths less than 3648*(1+z_abs)/(1+z_qso). Wait, no. The observed wavelength of the absorption is 1216*(1+z_abs). So if the quasar is at z_qso, the absorption from a cloud at z_abs must have 1216*(1+z_abs) < 1216*(1+z_qso), which is always true since z_abs < z_qso. But to observe the absorption, the observed wavelength must be in the observable range of the telescope. So the minimum z_abs is when 1216*(1+z_abs) is at the lower end of the telescope's range.

If the telescope can observe down to 3000 Angstroms, then z_abs >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. But if the quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_qso=3, then the Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*4=4864 Angstroms (blue light), and absorbers with z_abs from 0 to 3 would have their Lyman alpha absorption from 1216 to 4864 Angstroms. But the lower redshift absorbers (z_abs <1.47) would have their Lyman alpha absorption below 3000 Angstroms, which is unobservable from the ground. Therefore, only absorbers with z_abs >=1.47 would have their Lyman alpha absorption above 3000 Angstroms, making them detectable.

Therefore, the lower limit on z_abs is approximately 1.47. But often, this is rounded to z=1.5 or z=1.47. However, in some contexts, the limit is taken as z≈2 because the Lyman alpha forest becomes prominent at higher redshifts, but that's a different consideration. The question specifically asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected, so it's purely about the wavelength shift.

Therefore, the answer is z ≈ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. To express this precisely, 3000 Angstroms is approximate. If we use 3100 Angstroms (a more realistic cutoff due to atmospheric absorption), then z ≈ (3100 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.55. But since the problem asks for an estimate, 1.5 is acceptable. However, let's calculate it exactly.

3000 Angstroms:

z = 3000 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 = 1.467 ≈ 1.47

3200 Angstroms:

z = 3200 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.63 -1 = 1.63

3600 Angstroms:

z = 3600 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.96 -1 = 1.96

But the key is, what is the minimum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe. If it's 3000 Angstroms, then z≈1.47. If it's 3600, then z≈1.96. I think the standard cutoff is around 3200 Angstroms, where the atmosphere becomes transparent enough. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) covers from about 3100 Angstroms to 11000 Angstroms. So if we take 3100 Angstroms as the lower limit, then z≈1.55. But since the problem says "estimate", we can approximate.

Alternatively, the commonly quoted lower redshift for Lyman alpha forest observations is z≈0.3, but that's when using space telescopes. For ground-based, the lower limit is higher. For example, in the article "The Lyman-alpha Forest in the Spectra of Quasars" by Rauch, it mentions that ground-based observations can detect Lyman-alpha absorption for redshifts z>1.5. So maybe the answer is z≈1.5.

Given that, I think the answer is approximately z=1.5. But to be precise, using 1216*(1+z)=3600 (U-band), z≈1.96, but that might be overestimating. Alternatively, using 3000 Angstroms, z≈1.47. Since the problem says "estimate", either 1.5 or 2.0 could be reasonable, but I need to see which is more accurate.

Wait, another approach: the atmospheric cutoff is at about 3000 Angstroms. So anything above that can be observed. Therefore, the minimum redshift is when 1216*(1+z) = 3000. Solving for z:

z = (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 ≈ 1.467, which is approximately 1.47. So rounding to two significant figures, 1.5.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.5. So the answer is z ≈ 1.5. But I should check if standard educational resources give this value. For example, in the textbook "Galaxies in the Universe: An Introduction" by Sparke & Gallagher, they mention that Lyman alpha absorption systems with redshifts z > 1.7 can be observed from the ground. But that might be a more conservative estimate considering instrumental sensitivity. However, the question asks for the lower limit, which is the minimum redshift where the wavelength is just barely observable. Therefore, 1.47 is technically correct, but it's often rounded to 1.5 or 2.0 depending on context.

Alternatively, considering that the Lyman alpha line is a strong absorption feature, maybe you need it to be in a region where the atmosphere is transparent enough. The atmospheric transmission drops significantly below 3200 Angstroms due to ozone. So if we take 3200 Angstroms as the practical limit, then z ≈ (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.63. Rounded to 1.6 or 1.7.

But since the problem asks for an estimate, and given that different sources might use slightly different cutoff wavelengths, the most reasonable answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. However, I've also seen in some lecture notes that the lower limit is z ≈ 2. For example, here's a reasoning: the Lyman alpha line at rest frame 1216 Angstroms needs to be redshifted into the optical range, which is roughly 4000-7000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimum redshift is 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29, so z ≈ 2.29. But that would be if the optical range starts at 4000. However, this contradicts the fact that ground-based telescopes can observe down to 3000 Angstroms.

I think the confusion comes from what is considered "optical". If "optical" refers to the visible spectrum (4000-7000), then the lower limit is z≈2.29. If it includes near-UV (3000-4000), then z≈1.47. The problem says "optical ground-based telescopes". In astronomy, the optical window usually includes the near-UV to near-infrared, roughly 3000-10000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit would be z≈1.47. However, some sources might define optical as visible light, hence the higher redshift.

But given that the problem mentions "optical" and not specifying, and considering that ground-based telescopes can observe in the near-UV (U-band), the correct lower limit is z≈1.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately z=1.5. But to be precise, let's do the exact calculation:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z)

For lambda_obs >= 3000 Angstroms:

1 + z >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467

z >= 1.467

So approximately 1.47, which rounds to 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit is z≈1.5.

But wait, another point: the Lyman alpha line is in the UV, but when it's redshifted, it's the absorption line that's being detected in the quasar's spectrum. The quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the absorber. So the observed wavelength of the absorption is 1216*(1 + z_abs). To detect this, the observed wavelength must be within the telescope's range. If the telescope can go down to 3000 Angstroms, then z_abs >=1.47. But the quasar must be at a redshift higher than z_abs, so that the absorption happens blueward of the quasar's Lyman alpha emission. But the question is only about the lower limit on the absorber's redshift, not the quasar's. So as long as the absorber's Lyman alpha is redshifted into the observable range, regardless of the quasar's redshift. Wait, no. The absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_abs). The quasar's emission lines are at longer wavelengths. For example, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_qso). So to have the absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_abs) < 1216*(1 + z_qso), which is automatically true since z_abs < z_qso. But the absorption line must be at a wavelength observable by the telescope. Therefore, the absorber's redshift must satisfy 1216*(1 + z_abs) >= lambda_min, where lambda_min is the minimum observable wavelength. The quasar's redshift just needs to be higher than z_abs, but that's a separate consideration.

Therefore, focusing on the absorber: the lower limit on z_abs is when 1216*(1 + z_abs) = lambda_min. Taking lambda_min as 3000 Angstroms gives z_abs ≈1.47. If lambda_min is 3600, z≈1.96. But since the question is about ground-based optical telescopes, which can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms, the answer is z≈1.5.

However, I recall that in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed starting at z≈2 for ground-based telescopes because below that, the absorption lines are in the UV and not observable. So maybe the standard answer is z≈2. Let me verify.

Looking up a reference: According to the University of Oregon's astronomy notes, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 1.7, observable from the ground. Another source mentions that for z > 2, the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So perhaps the accepted lower limit is around z=1.7 or z=2.0. But why the discrepancy?

If we take the U-band as starting at 3600 Angstroms, then z= (3600 /1216)-1≈1.96, which is approximately 2.0. So rounding up, z≈2.0. Therefore, the lower limit is z≈2.0. This is probably the answer expected here, as it's a commonly cited value.

But why is there a difference between 1.47 and 2.0? It depends on whether you consider the atmospheric cutoff at 3000 or 3600 Angstroms. If the problem states "optical" and the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms, then z≈2.29. But since the U-band is part of the optical observations, and it starts at 3600, z≈1.96 is more accurate. However, in many educational resources, the round number z=2 is used as the lower limit for ground-based observations of the Lyman alpha forest.

Given that, I think the expected answer is z≈2. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2. But to reconcile the calculations, if we take 3600 Angstroms:

z = 3600 /1216 -1 ≈2.96 -1=1.96≈2.0.

Yes, rounding to z=2.0. Therefore, the answer is z≈2.0.

But I need to make sure. Let's see: 1216*(1+2)=1216*3=3648 Angstroms, which is in the U-band (3600-4000 Angstroms). Since the U-band is part of the optical window, this makes sense. Therefore, the lower limit is z=2.0.

So the answer is z≈2. Therefore, the lower limit is redshift 2.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, such that we can detect them with ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about redshifts and the Lyman alpha line.

First, the Lyman alpha emission line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV light because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of it. So, for the light to be detectable from the ground, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical range. That makes sense. So the question is, how much redshift is needed to move 1216 Angstroms into the optical window?

Wait, what's the typical wavelength range for optical telescopes? I think the visible spectrum is roughly from about 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). But ground-based observations also have atmospheric transmission windows. Let me check: the atmosphere is mostly transparent in the visible range, but starts to absorb in the near-infrared. However, specific bands like U, B, V, R, I correspond to different parts of the spectrum. The U band is around 3600 Angstroms, but atmospheric transmission might be an issue there. Maybe the practical lower limit for ground-based optical is around 3000 Angstroms? Wait, no, the atmosphere blocks UV below about 3000 Angstroms. So if the original wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, we need to redshift it so that the observed wavelength is above 3000 Angstroms?

But wait, maybe the optical range considered here starts at around 4000 Angstroms. Let me confirm. The human eye can see from about 4000 (violet) to 7000 (red). But telescopes can detect a bit beyond that, especially into the near-infrared, but for optical telescopes, the detectors are usually sensitive in the visible range. However, the atmosphere does transmit some UV, but only up to about 3000 Angstroms. Wait, no, the ozone layer absorbs most of the UV below 3000 Angstroms. So ground-based telescopes can't observe below roughly 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, to observe the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms, it needs to be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms. So the redshift z is given by the formula:

observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z)

So solving for z:

z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1

If the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed wavelength needs to be at least 3000 Angstroms, then:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467

So z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift would be approximately 1.47. But wait, maybe the optical range starts at a longer wavelength. For example, if the optical telescopes can only detect light starting at 4000 Angstroms, then:

z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.289 - 1 ≈ 2.289

So z ≈ 2.29. Hmm, so which is it? Is the cutoff at 3000 or 4000 Angstroms?

I need to recall the atmospheric transmission. The atmosphere is opaque to UV light below 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. So any light with wavelength longer than 3000 Angstroms can reach the ground. However, optical telescopes typically observe in the range from about 3000 Angstroms (near-UV) to 10000 Angstroms (near-infrared). But the term "optical" might sometimes refer to the visible range, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So this is a bit ambiguous. However, in astronomy, the U-band is around 3600 Angstroms, which is considered part of the optical window. So perhaps the atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms, but the standard optical filters start at U (3600), B (4400), etc.

But the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes". If the atmosphere allows transmission down to 3000 Angstroms, then the lower limit would be z ≈ 1.47. However, if the telescope's instruments are only sensitive to the visible range (4000-7000), then z ≈ 2.29. But I think in practice, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, like the U-band at ~3000-4000 Angstroms. So maybe the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the U-band. Let's check.

If the U-band starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z = 3000 / 1216 -1 ≈ 1.47. If the U-band is around 3600, then z = 3600 / 1216 -1 ≈ 2.96. Wait, 3600 / 1216 is approximately 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96? Wait, 1216 * (1 + z) = 3600. So 1 + z = 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 1216 * (1 + z) = observed wavelength. So if observed wavelength is 3600, then 1 + z = 3600 / 1216 ≈ 2.96, so z ≈ 1.96. Hmm, so if the U-band is at 3600, then z ≈ 1.96. But I need to check the exact cutoff.

Alternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is around 3100 Angstroms. Let me look up the atmospheric transmission. From what I remember, the Earth's atmosphere becomes opaque below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. So the near-UV from 3000-4000 Angstroms is called the near-ultraviolet and is observable by ground-based telescopes, but with some atmospheric absorption. So the U-band is typically around 3000-4000 Angstroms. So if we take the lower end of the U-band as 3000 Angstroms, then the minimum redshift would be z ≈ (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. But if the instrument's sensitivity starts at a high

I need to determine the minimum redshift for detecting neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength using ground-based optical telescopes. Let me work through this systematically.

The Lyman alpha emission line has a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, which falls in the ultraviolet range. Since Earth's atmosphere absorbs most UV light, this wavelength must be redshifted into a range detectable by ground-based telescopes.

I should clarify what wavelength range is observable from the ground. The visible spectrum spans roughly from 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). However, ground-based telescopes can detect slightly beyond this range. The atmosphere's ozone layer blocks most UV radiation below approximately 3000 Angstroms, setting a practical lower limit for ground-based observations.

To calculate the minimum redshift needed, I'll use the formula:
observed wavelength = rest wavelength × (1 + z)

Rearranging to solve for z:
z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1

If the atmospheric cutoff is at 3000 Angstroms, then:
z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467

So the minimum redshift would be approximately z ≈ 1.47 in this case.

However, if the practical limit for optical telescopes begins at the U-band (around 3600 Angstroms), the calculation would be:
z = (3600 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.96 - 1 ≈ 1.96

And if we consider only the standard visible range starting at 4000 Angstroms:
z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.289 - 1 ≈ 2.289

The ambiguity lies in determining the exact cutoff for "optical ground-based telescopes." In astronomy, the U-band (approximately 3000-4000 Angstroms) is generally considered part of the optical window, though with some atmospheric absorption. If we take the lower end of the U-band as 3000 Angstroms, then the minimum redshift would be z ≈ 1.47. But if the telescope's instrumentation is optimized for the visible range starting around 4000 Angstroms, then the minimum redshift would be closer to z ≈ 2.29.

Alright, I need to determine the minimum redshift for neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb quasar light at the Lyman alpha wavelength to be detectable with ground-based optical telescopes. Let's start by reviewing my knowledge of redshifts and the Lyman alpha line.

The Lyman alpha emission line is situated at 1216 Angstroms in the ultraviolet spectrum. Unfortunately, ground-based optical telescopes can't detect UV light since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of it. Therefore, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical range to be detectable. This means we need to figure out the amount of redshift required to shift 1216 Angstroms into the optical window.

What are the typical wavelength ranges for optical telescopes? The visible spectrum extends approximately from 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). Ground-based observations must also consider atmospheric transmission windows. The atmosphere is mostly transparent in the visible range, but absorbs in the near-infrared. Specific bands like U, B, V, R, and I correspond to different spectrum regions. The U band is centered around 3600 Angstroms, but atmospheric transmission could be an issue there. Practically, the lower limit for optical observation might be 3000 Angstroms. However, the atmosphere blocks UV below about 3000 Angstroms. To observe the original 1216 Angstroms, it needs to be redshifted above 3000 Angstroms.

Considering that the optical range likely begins around 4000 Angstroms, let's confirm. Human vision ranges from about 4000 (violet) to 7000 (red), but telescopes can extend slightly into the near-infrared. For optical telescopes, detectors are typically sensitive in the visible range. Although the atmosphere transmits some UV, it only does so up to about 3000 Angstroms, as the ozone layer absorbs most UV below that. As a result, ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 3000 Angstroms. The Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms must be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms for detection:

z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1

Given the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, with the observed wavelength requiring a minimum of 3000 Angstroms:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47

Thus, the lower redshift limit would be approximately 1.47. Alternatively, if the optical telescopes detect starting at 4000 Angstroms:

z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.29

Which option is correct: 3000 or 4000 Angstroms as the cutoff?

Atmospheric conditions entail opacity below 3000 Angstroms due to ozone absorption. This means light with wavelengths above 3000 Angstroms can reach the ground. Optical telescopes generally observe from around 3000 Angstroms (near-UV) to 10000 Angstroms (near-infrared). However, "optical" can also refer strictly to the 4000-7000 Angstrom visible range. In astronomy, the U-band at about 3600 Angstroms is considered part of the optical spectrum. Consequently, while the atmospheric cutoff might be about 3000 Angstroms, standard optical filters typically initiate at the U band (3600 Angstroms), B band (4400 Angstroms), etc.

Given "optical ground-based telescopes," if atmospheric transmission allows down to 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. If telescope instrumentation is limited to the visible range (4000-7000 Angstroms), then z ≈ 2.29. In practice, however, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, such as the U-band between 3000-4000 Angstroms. Thus, the lower limit likely aligns with the Lyman alpha line redshifting into the U-band. Let's review.

If the U-band begins at 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. If at 3600 Angstroms, z ≈ 1.96:

z = (3600 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.96

However, verify the precise cutoff. Alternatively, the atmospheric cutoff at around 3100 Angstroms suggests atmospheric opacity below roughly 3000 Angstroms, due to ozone. The near-UV from 3000-4000 Angstroms remains observable by ground-based telescopes, albeit with some atmospheric absorption. The U-band generally covers 3000-4000 Angstroms. So for the lower end of the U-band (3000 Angstroms), the minimum redshift would be z ≈ 1.47. If telescope sensitivity starts higher...

The cloud\'s redshift is such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed at a wavelength detectable by optical telescopes.\n\nSo, for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So again, if the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z), and we need that to be >= 3000 Angstroms (assuming that\'s the lower limit of what\'s observable from the ground), then z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47.

However, I should verify this. Let me think about the Lyman break. The Lyman break is at 912 Angstroms, and when galaxies are at high redshift, the break moves into the optical. But here we are talking about the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. For instance, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar\'s light has redshifted the Lyman alpha absorption lines into the visible range. So quasars at z > 0.3 would have Lyman alpha emission at 1216*(1+0.3)= 1580.8 Angstroms, which is still UV. But we can\'t observe that from the ground. So the quasars need to be at higher redshifts so that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical.\n\nWait, but the clouds themselves are causing absorption. So if the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z). To observe this from the ground, 1216*(1+z) must be in the optical range. So if the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on z is approximately 1.47.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. The Lyman alpha line is in the UV. To shift it to the optical, say 4000 Angstroms, the redshift is (4000 - 1216)/1216 = 2784 / 1216 ≈ 2.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But if the atmosphere allows observations down to 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. So which is correct?\n\nI think the key here is that the atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms. So technically, if the observed wavelength is above 3000 Angstroms, it can be detected. Therefore, the lower limit on z is (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2, because quasars need to be bright and at high enough redshift to have their UV light (which is absorbed by the clouds) redshifted into the optical. But the question is about the lower limit. So if a cloud is at z ≈ 1.47, then its Lyman alpha absorption would be at 3000 Angstroms, which is the edge of the atmospheric transmission. So maybe in reality, the lower limit is a bit higher to account for instrumental sensitivity. But the problem asks for an estimate, so perhaps 1.5 is acceptable. But let\'s compute it more accurately.\n\n1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The observed wavelength needs to be at least 3000 Angstroms. So:\n\n1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467\n\nTherefore, z ≈ 1.467. So approximately 1.47. If we take 3000 as the lower limit, then z ≈ 1.47. If we take 3600 Angstroms (which is the U-band), then z ≈ (3600 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.96 -1 ≈ 1.96. But the U-band is around 3600-4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, the U-band is typically 3000-4000, but centered around 3600. So maybe the effective wavelength is 3600. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum redshift needed to get the wavelength into the observable range. Therefore, the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. If the atmospheric cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. If the instruments can\'t observe below 4000, then z ≈ 2.29. But since the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes", and optical usually includes the near-UV (U-band), which starts around 3000, I think the correct lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. However, in many textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is considered to start at z ≈ 2, because below that, the absorption is in the UV and not observable. Wait, but that might be for the quasar\'s own emission. Let me check.\n\nFor example, quasars emit strongly in the UV, and if they are at redshift z, their rest-frame UV emission is redshifted to optical wavelengths. Therefore, to observe the Lyman alpha absorption from intervening clouds, the clouds must be at a lower redshift than the quasar. The lower limit on the cloud\'s redshift would be such that the Lyman alpha absorption is redshifted into the optical. So if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, the cloud\'s Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z_cloud). To observe this in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be greater than 3000 Angstroms (assuming atmospheric cutoff at 3000). Therefore, z_cloud >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. However, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so z_quasar > z_cloud. Therefore, to observe such absorption, the quasar must be at z_quasar > 1.47, but the cloud can be at z_cloud >=1.47. Wait, but the problem is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the clouds (the absorbers) such that they can be detected with optical telescopes. So the answer is z_cloud >= ~1.47. But in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed at higher redshifts, but the question is about the lower limit. So the calculation gives z ≈ 1.47. But maybe the number is usually quoted as z ≈ 0.3 or something? Wait, no. Wait, if the cloud is at z=0.3, then the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216*(1+0.3)=1580 Angstroms, which is still in the UV, not observable from the ground. So indeed, the lower limit is around z=1.47. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. But let me check with another source.\n\nWait, another way: The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). The optical range is approximately 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So to get 121.6 nm into 400 nm, the redshift is (400 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. But if we consider the near-UV, say 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), then z = (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 ≈ 1.467. So depending on the telescope\'s range. Since the question says "optical", which is 400-700 nm, then z ≈ 2.29. But some telescopes can observe into the near-UV, down to 300 nm. So perhaps the answer depends on the definition. However, in standard astronomical terms, the optical window is considered to be from about 300 nm to 1100 nm (U to I bands). Therefore, the lower limit would be z ≈ (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 1.47. So the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. But let me check standard literature.\n\nUpon recalling, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar\'s redshift is high enough that the Lyman-alpha emission is redshifted into the visible. The forest itself consists of absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at lower redshifts. The lower limit for the forest is around z ≈ 0.1, but those lines are in the UV and not observable from the ground. Therefore, the observable Lyman-alpha forest starts at redshifts where the absorption lines are redshifted into the optical. So the lower redshift limit would be when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Angstroms, so z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the answer is z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, the Lyman-alpha forest is more prominently observed at higher redshifts (z > 2), but the question is about the lower limit. So the calculation gives z ≈ 1.47, which is approximately 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit is around z ≈ 1.5.\n\nBut to be precise, let\'s compute it exactly:\n\nz = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1\n\nIf observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 = 1.467\n\nSo approximately 1.47. If we take 3600 Angstroms (U-band), then z ≈ 1.96. But since the question asks for the lower limit, we should take the minimum observed wavelength possible with optical telescopes, which is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. Rounding to two significant figures, that\'s approximately 1.5. However, sometimes in astronomy, this is approximated as z ≈ 0.4, but that doesn\'t make sense because 1216*(1+0.4)=1702 Angstroms, still in the UV. So no, 0.4 is too low. Therefore, the correct lower limit is approximately 1.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe lower limit on the redshift is approximately \\boxed{1.5}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446526, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2663, prompt_tokens=1431, total_tokens=4094, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range observable by these telescopes. 

Optical ground-based telescopes can observe light in the wavelength range from approximately 3000 Angstroms (near-ultraviolet) to 7000 Angstroms (near-infrared). The key is to redshift the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Angstroms) into this observable range.

Using the redshift formula:
\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

We need the observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{observed}}\) to be at least 3000 Angstroms (the lower limit of the optical range for ground-based telescopes). Plugging in the values:

\[
z = \frac{3000 \, \text{Angstroms}}{1216 \, \text{Angstroms}} - 1 \approx 2.467 - 1 \approx 1.467
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately:

\[
\boxed{1.5}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

enough wavelength, say 3500 Angstroms, then z would be higher.

But the question is asking for the lower limit. So the lower limit would correspond to the shortest observable wavelength in the optical range. If the shortest wavelength we can detect is 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. However, if the actual cutoff is higher, say 3200 Angstroms, then z would be (3200 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.63 -1 ≈ 1.63. But I need to be precise here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra, and the quasars themselves are at higher redshifts. But the question is about the clouds themselves. The clouds are at some redshift, and we observe the absorption in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. The cloud's redshift is such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed at a wavelength detectable by optical telescopes.

So, for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So again, if the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z), and we need that to be >= 3000 Angstroms (assuming that's the lower limit of what's observable from the ground), then z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. So z ≈ 1.47. But if the lower limit of the optical is 4000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 2.29.

But in reality, ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms, so the lower limit would be z ≈ 1.47. However, I should verify this. Let me think about the Lyman break. The Lyman break is at 912 Angstroms, and when galaxies are at high redshift, the break moves into the optical. But here we are talking about the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. For instance, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar's light has redshifted the Lyman alpha absorption lines into the visible range. So quasars at z > 0.3 would have Lyman alpha emission at 1216*(1+0.3)= 1580.8 Angstroms, which is still UV. But we can't observe that from the ground. So the quasars need to be at higher redshifts so that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical.

Wait, but the clouds themselves are causing absorption. So if the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z). To observe this from the ground, 1216*(1+z) must be in the optical range. So if the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on z is approximately 1.47.

But let me check with another approach. The Lyman alpha line is in the UV. To shift it to the optical, say 4000 Angstroms, the redshift is (4000 - 1216)/1216 = 2784 / 1216 ≈ 2.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But if the atmosphere allows observations down to 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. So which is correct?

I think the key here is that the atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms. So technically, if the observed wavelength is above 3000 Angstroms, it can be detected. Therefore, the lower limit on z is (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2, because quasars need to be bright and at high enough redshift to have their UV light (which is absorbed by the clouds) redshifted into the optical. But the question is about the lower limit. So if a cloud is at z ≈ 1.47, then its Lyman alpha absorption would be at 3000 Angstroms, which is the edge of the atmospheric transmission. So maybe in reality, the lower limit is a bit higher to account for instrumental sensitivity. But the problem asks for an estimate, so perhaps 1.5 is acceptable. But let's compute it more accurately.

1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The observed wavelength needs to be at least 3000 Angstroms. So:

1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467

Therefore, z ≈ 1.467. So approximately 1.47. If we take 3000 as the lower limit, then z ≈ 1.47. If we take 3600 Angstroms (which is the U-band), then z ≈ (3600 / 1216) -1 ≈ 2.96 -1 ≈ 1.96. But the U-band is around 3600-4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, the U-band is typically 3000-4000, but centered around 3600. So maybe the effective wavelength is 3600. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum redshift needed to get the wavelength into the observable range. Therefore, the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. If the atmospheric cutoff is 3000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 1.47. If the instruments can't observe below 4000, then z ≈ 2.29. But since the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes", and optical usually includes the near-UV (U-band), which starts around 3000, I think the correct lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. However, in many textbooks, the Lyman alpha forest is considered to start at z ≈ 2, because below that, the absorption is in the UV and not observable. Wait, but that might be for the quasar's own emission. Let me check.

For example, quasars emit strongly in the UV, and if they are at redshift z, their rest-frame UV emission is redshifted to optical wavelengths. Therefore, to observe the Lyman alpha absorption from intervening clouds, the clouds must be at a lower redshift than the quasar. The lower limit on the cloud's redshift would be such that the Lyman alpha absorption is redshifted into the optical. So if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z_cloud). To observe this in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be greater than 3000 Angstroms (assuming atmospheric cutoff at 3000). Therefore, z_cloud >= (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47. However, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so z_quasar > z_cloud. Therefore, to observe such absorption, the quasar must be at z_quasar > 1.47, but the cloud can be at z_cloud >=1.47. Wait, but the problem is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the clouds (the absorbers) such that they can be detected with optical telescopes. So the answer is z_cloud >= ~1.47. But in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed at higher redshifts, but the question is about the lower limit. So the calculation gives z ≈ 1.47. But maybe the number is usually quoted as z ≈ 0.3 or something? Wait, no. Wait, if the cloud is at z=0.3, then the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216*(1+0.3)=1580 Angstroms, which is still in the UV, not observable from the ground. So indeed, the lower limit is around z=1.47. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. But let me check with another source.

Wait, another way: The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). The optical range is approximately 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So to get 121.6 nm into 400 nm, the redshift is (400 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. But if we consider the near-UV, say 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), then z = (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 2.467 -1 ≈ 1.467. So depending on the telescope's range. Since the question says "optical", which is 400-700 nm, then z ≈ 2.29. But some telescopes can observe into the near-UV, down to 300 nm. So perhaps the answer depends on the definition. However, in standard astronomical terms, the optical window is considered to be from about 300 nm to 1100 nm (U to I bands). Therefore, the lower limit would be z ≈ (300 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 1.47. So the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.5. But let me check standard literature.

Upon recalling, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar's redshift is high enough that the Lyman-alpha emission is redshifted into the visible. The forest itself consists of absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at lower redshifts. The lower limit for the forest is around z ≈ 0.1, but those lines are in the UV and not observable from the ground. Therefore, the observable Lyman-alpha forest starts at redshifts where the absorption lines are redshifted into the optical. So the lower redshift limit would be when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Angstroms, so z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the answer is z ≈ 1.5. However, in practice, the Lyman-alpha forest is more prominently observed at higher redshifts (z > 2), but the question is about the lower limit. So the calculation gives z ≈ 1.47, which is approximately 1.5. Therefore, the lower limit is around z ≈ 1.5.

But to be precise, let's compute it exactly:

z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1

If observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 = 1.467

So approximately 1.47. If we take 3600 Angstroms (U-band), then z ≈ 1.96. But since the question asks for the lower limit, we should take the minimum observed wavelength possible with optical telescopes, which is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. Rounding to two significant figures, that's approximately 1.5. However, sometimes in astronomy, this is approximated as z ≈ 0.4, but that doesn't make sense because 1216*(1+0.4)=1702 Angstroms, still in the UV. So no, 0.4 is too low. Therefore, the correct lower limit is approximately 1.5.

**Final Answer**
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \boxed{1.5}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To estimate the lower redshift limit for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption (rest wavelength 1216 Å) with ground-based optical telescopes, we need the observed wavelength to fall within the telescope's detectable range. 

**Key Steps:**
1. **Determine the Observational Window:** Ground-based optical telescopes typically detect light from ~3000 Å (near-UV) to ~10000 Å (near-infrared). The critical lower limit is set by atmospheric UV absorption, which starts becoming transparent around 3000 Å.
2. **Apply Redshift Formula:**  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \times (1 + z)
   \]
   Solving for \( z \):
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
   \]
3. **Calculate for 3000 Å Cutoff:**  
   \[
   z = \frac{3000}{1216} - 1 \approx 1.47
   \]

**Conclusion:**  
The lower redshift limit is approximately **\( z \approx 1.5 \)**. This ensures the Lyman-alpha line is redshifted beyond the atmospheric UV cutoff into the observable optical range.

**Answer:**  
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(\boxed{1.5}\).

In astronomy, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra. For a quasar at redshift z_qso, the Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at wavelengths 1216*(1+z_cloud) in the observed frame.

But let me check the exact atmospheric transmission.\n\nUpon reflection, the Earth\'s atmosphere is opaque to UV light below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. Therefore, ground-based telescopes can\'t observe light below this wavelength. Hence, the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. However, some sources might state that the atmospheric cutoff is around 3100 Angstroms. Let me check.\n\nAccording to standard references, the atmospheric cutoff is approximately 3000 Angstroms. The ozone layer absorbs UV radiation below 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, ground-based observations in the UV are limited to wavelengths above 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms must be redshifted to 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ (3000 / 1216) ≈ 2.467 - 1 = 1.467. So approximately z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.\n\nBut wait, some sources might use 912 Angstroms as the Lyman limit, but here it\'s Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. So the calculation is correct. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at higher redshifts. For example, quasars with z > 2 have their Lyman alpha emission line redshifted into the optical. But perhaps the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 4000 Angstroms, then z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. But that seems higher. Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact definitions.\n\nWait, the problem states that the clouds are absorbing the quasar\'s light. So the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. The cloud\'s redshift is such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed at a wavelength that is detectable. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. To be detected in optical, this observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So the lower limit on the cloud\'s redshift is when (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms is equal to the shortest detectable wavelength in optical, which is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, solving for z: z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.\n\nBut in reality, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra where the quasar\'s redshift is higher than the cloud\'s. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the quasar must be at a higher redshift. However, the problem is only about the cloud\'s redshift. The cloud\'s Lyman alpha absorption line will be at (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. To observe this with a ground-based optical telescope, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. Therefore, the minimum z is when (1 + z) * 1216 ≥ 3000. So z ≥ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈ 1.47. However, if the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 2.29. But since ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms (near-UV), the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.\n\nBut let me verify with an example. For instance, quasars with z > 0.47 will have their Lyman alpha emission line at 1216 * (1 + 0.47) ≈ 1790 Angstroms, which is still in the UV. To reach 3000 Angstroms, z ≈ 1.47. So yes, that seems right. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. However, sometimes the Lyman alpha break is considered to be at 912 Angstroms, but that\'s the Lyman limit. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47. But let me compute it more accurately. 3000 divided by 1216 is approximately 2.467. Subtract 1 gives z ≈ 1.467. So rounding to two decimal places, z ≈ 1.47. Alternatively, if the atmospheric cutoff is 3200 Angstroms, then z ≈ (3200 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.63 - 1 = 1.63. But I think 3000 is the standard cutoff. Let me check a reference.\n\nUpon checking, the Earth\'s atmosphere becomes opaque below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. Therefore, ground-based telescopes can observe in the near-UV from 3000-4000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimum observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower redshift limit is z ≈ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.47. However, in some contexts, the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms (violet), which would require z ≈ 2.29. But since telescopes can observe down to 3000 Angstroms, even if it\'s near-UV, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.\n\nBut the question specifies "optical ground-based telescopes". The optical window is generally considered to be from ~3000 Angstroms (near-UV) to ~10000 Angstroms (near-infrared). So if the telescope can observe in the near-UV, then 3000 Angstroms is the lower limit. Therefore, the minimum redshift is z ≈ 1.47. However, sometimes "optical" is taken as the visible range (4000-7000), but in astronomy, the U-band (3000-4000) is part of optical observations. Therefore, the answer is z ≈ 1.47. To confirm, let\'s compute 1216*(1+1.47) = 1216*2.47 ≈ 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. So the answer is approximately z ≥ 1.5.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range detectable by these telescopes. 

Ground-based optical telescopes can observe wavelengths from approximately 3000 Angstroms (near-ultraviolet) to 10000 Angstroms (near-infrared), as the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most ultraviolet light below 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the Lyman alpha wavelength must be redshifted into this detectable range.

The redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Setting the observed wavelength to the minimum detectable wavelength (3000 Angstroms), we get:
\[
z = \frac{3000}{1216} - 1 \approx 2.467 - 1 = 1.467
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 1.47 \).

\[
\boxed{1.47}
\]

but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff. Therefore, if the atmosphere cuts off below 3000 Angstroms, then the minimum observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. But let me check the exact atmospheric transmission.

Upon reflection, the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to UV light below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. Therefore, ground-based telescopes can't observe light below this wavelength. Hence, the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted to at least 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. However, some sources might state that the atmospheric cutoff is around 3100 Angstroms. Let me check.

According to standard references, the atmospheric cutoff is approximately 3000 Angstroms. The ozone layer absorbs UV radiation below 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, ground-based observations in the UV are limited to wavelengths above 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms must be redshifted to 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ (3000 / 1216) ≈ 2.467 - 1 = 1.467. So approximately z ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.

But wait, some sources might use 912 Angstroms as the Lyman limit, but here it's Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. So the calculation is correct. However, in practice, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at higher redshifts. For example, quasars with z > 2 have their Lyman alpha emission line redshifted into the optical. But perhaps the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 4000 Angstroms, then z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. But that seems higher. Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact definitions.

Wait, the problem states that the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. The cloud's redshift is such that its Lyman alpha absorption is observed at a wavelength that is detectable. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. To be detected in optical, this observed wavelength must be in the optical range. So the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is when (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms is equal to the shortest detectable wavelength in optical, which is around 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, solving for z: z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.

But in reality, the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra where the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the quasar must be at a higher redshift. However, the problem is only about the cloud's redshift. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line will be at (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms. To observe this with a ground-based optical telescope, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. Therefore, the minimum z is when (1 + z) * 1216 ≥ 3000. So z ≥ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately z ≈ 1.47. However, if the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms, then z ≈ 2.29. But since ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms (near-UV), the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.

But let me verify with an example. For instance, quasars with z > 0.47 will have their Lyman alpha emission line at 1216 * (1 + 0.47) ≈ 1790 Angstroms, which is still in the UV. To reach 3000 Angstroms, z ≈ 1.47. So yes, that seems right. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. However, sometimes the Lyman alpha break is considered to be at 912 Angstroms, but that's the Lyman limit. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47. But let me compute it more accurately. 3000 divided by 1216 is approximately 2.467. Subtract 1 gives z ≈ 1.467. So rounding to two decimal places, z ≈ 1.47. Alternatively, if the atmospheric cutoff is 3200 Angstroms, then z ≈ (3200 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.63 - 1 = 1.63. But I think 3000 is the standard cutoff. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, the Earth's atmosphere becomes opaque below about 3000 Angstroms due to ozone. Therefore, ground-based telescopes can observe in the near-UV from 3000-4000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimum observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower redshift limit is z ≈ (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.47. Therefore, the answer is approximately z ≈ 1.47. However, in some contexts, the optical range is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms (violet), which would require z ≈ 2.29. But since telescopes can observe down to 3000 Angstroms, even if it's near-UV, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47.

But the question specifies "optical ground-based telescopes". The optical window is generally considered to be from ~3000 Angstroms (near-UV) to ~10000 Angstroms (near-infrared). So if the telescope can observe in the near-UV, then 3000 Angstroms is the lower limit. Therefore, the minimum redshift is z ≈ 1.47. However, sometimes "optical" is taken as the visible range (4000-7000), but in astronomy, the U-band (3000-4000) is part of optical observations. Therefore, the answer is z ≈ 1.47. To confirm, let's compute 1216*(1+1.47) = 1216*2.47 ≈ 3000 Angstroms. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. So the answer is approximately z ≥ 1.5. But let me check with exact calculation.

3000 / 1216 = 2.467. So z = 1.467. So approximately 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit is z ≈ 1.47. So the answer is z ≈ 1.47. But in some cases, people might round it to 1.5. However, the exact value is approximately 1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47. So the answer is \boxed{1.47}

**Final Answer**
The lower limit on the redshift is \boxed{1.47}.
