To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3(16.00 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.869 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = \( \frac{0.1 \text{ g}}{106.869 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.0009356 \text{ mol} \)

2. **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = \( 3 \times 0.0009356 \approx 0.0028068 \text{ mol} \)

3. **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**
   - Volume = \( \frac{0.0028068 \text{ mol}}{0.1 \text{ mol/dm³}} = 0.028068 \text{ dm³} = 28.068 \text{ cm³} \)
   - Rounded to one decimal place, the volume is 28.1 cm³.

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution:**
   - Concentration of Fe³⁺ in solution = \( \frac{0.0009356 \text{ mol}}{0.1 \text{ L}} = 0.009356 \text{ M} \)
   - Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes in water: \( \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \)
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ (6.3×10⁻³⁸) and Kw (1×10⁻¹⁴):
     - \( K = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6.3 \times 10^{-38}} \approx 1.587 \times 10^{-5} \)
     - \( [\text{H}^+]^3 = K \times [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = 1.587 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.009356 \approx 1.484 \times 10^{-7} \)
     - \( [\text{H}^+] \approx \sqrt[3]{1.484 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M} \)
     - pH = \( -\log(5.3 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.28 \)

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and also find the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's start by recalling some chemistry concepts here.

First, Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide, which is a weak base, right? And we're using a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or HNO3. The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would be a neutralization reaction. The general equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Since the acid is monobasic, each molecule donates one H+ ion. So, for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+ to neutralize it. That makes sense because Fe(OH)3 has three hydroxide ions.

First, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16.00 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)). Let me compute that:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3*16 = 48
H: 3*1.008 = 3.024
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Let me check that calculation again. 0.1 divided by 106.874. Let me use a calculator: 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Yeah, that seems right.

Since the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/dm³. Since we need 0.0028068 mol of H+, the volume of acid required would be moles / concentration = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 dm³, which is 28.068 cm³. So approximately 28.07 cm³. But wait, the problem says "minimum volume" needed. Is there anything else I need to consider here?

Wait, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution might still be acidic or basic, but the question is about the minimum volume required to dissolve it. So, perhaps we just need the stoichiometric amount. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and we're adding a strong acid, the reaction should go to completion. So, the stoichiometric amount should be sufficient. Therefore, 28.07 cm³ is the minimum volume. But let me double-check.

But wait, when you dissolve Fe(OH)3 in acid, you form Fe³+ ions. However, Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. So, the resulting solution might be acidic. But the question is asking for the pH of the resulting solution. So, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, we need to calculate the pH considering the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But first, let's confirm the volume. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. The acid volume is 28.07 cm³, so the remaining volume would be water? Wait, the problem says "to prepare the solution" with 100 cm³ total volume. So, does that mean that the acid is added to a certain volume, and then diluted to 100 cm³? Or is the total volume the sum of the acid and water?

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..."

So, the total volume of the solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume plus the water added should make up 100 cm³. Wait, but actually, when you mix the acid with some water and the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. But the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its volume is negligible. So, the volume of the acid plus the volume of water added would be approximately 100 cm³. But the question is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed. So, if we add V cm³ of acid, then the rest (100 - V) cm³ is water. But the acid is a solution, so when you mix V cm³ of 0.1 M acid with (100 - V) cm³ of water, the total volume is 100 cm³. However, the moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.1 * V / 1000 (since Molarity is moles per liter). Wait, but we need 0.0028068 moles of H+.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. So, in V cm³ (which is V/1000 liters), the moles of H+ would be 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.0001V moles. We need 0.0028068 moles. So, 0.0001V = 0.0028068 → V = 0.0028068 / 0.0001 = 28.068 cm³. So, that's the same as before. But then, if we add 28.068 cm³ of acid, and then add water to make up to 100 cm³, the total volume is 100 cm³. But the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume". So, the acid is part of that 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid required is 28.068 cm³, and the rest is water. So, the minimum volume is approximately 28.07 cm³. So, that's the first part.

But wait, maybe there's a catch here. Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product, Ksp. Even after adding the stoichiometric amount of acid, maybe some Fe(OH)3 remains undissolved because the solution becomes saturated? But the problem states "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3", so we need to ensure that all of it dissolves. Therefore, perhaps we need to add excess acid to make sure that the solution is acidic enough to prevent precipitation of Fe(OH)3. But the question says "minimum volume", so it's the stoichiometric amount. However, in reality, because Fe³+ hydrolyzes, the pH might be low enough that no precipitation occurs. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ ions, which can hydrolyze to form Fe(OH)3 again if the pH is too high. Therefore, to prevent precipitation, the pH must be low enough to keep Fe³+ in solution. Therefore, the minimum acid required is not just the stoichiometric amount but also enough to lower the pH below the point where Fe(OH)3 would precipitate. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the problem is from a textbook, so maybe it's expecting just the stoichiometric calculation. But let's check both possibilities.

First, if we only consider the stoichiometric amount:

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356 mol

Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol

Volume of 0.1 M acid = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

But if we need to consider the hydrolysis of Fe³+:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The K for this reaction is related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and Kw. The solubility product Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3. The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression for hydrolysis is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But since [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, it's considered 1 in the expression, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But K can also be calculated using Kw and Ksp. Since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3, and Kw = [H+][OH⁻], so [OH⁻] = Kw / [H+]. Substituting into Ksp:

Ksp = [Fe³+]*(Kw / [H+])^3 = [Fe³+]*Kw^3 / [H+]^3

Rearranging, [H+]^3 = [Fe³+]*Kw^3 / Ksp

But the hydrolysis K is [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp

Therefore, K = Kw^3 / Ksp

But I need the value of Ksp for Fe(OH)3. Let me recall. Fe(OH)3 has a very low solubility. The Ksp is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C.

So, Ksp = 6.3×10^-38

Kw = 1×10^-14

Therefore, K = (1×10^-14)^3 / 6.3×10^-38 = 1×10^-42 / 6.3×10^-38 ≈ 1.587×10^-5

So, K = 1.587×10^-5

But K for the hydrolysis reaction is [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587×10^-5

So, [H+]^3 = 1.587×10^-5 * [Fe³+]

In the solution after dissolution, the concentration of Fe³+ is moles / volume. The moles of Fe³+ is 0.0009356 mol, and the total volume is 0.1 L (100 cm³). So, [Fe³+] = 0.0009356 / 0.1 = 0.009356 M

Therefore, [H+]^3 = 1.587×10^-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587×10^-5 * 9.356×10^-3 ≈ 1.484×10^-7

Taking cube root: [H+] ≈ (1.484×10^-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3×10^-3 M

Therefore, pH = -log(5.3×10^-3) ≈ 2.28

But wait, this pH is due to the hydrolysis of Fe³+. However, in the solution, we also have excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but if we added the stoichiometric amount of acid, the H+ from the acid would exactly neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3. But in reality, the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

So, the H+ from the acid is used up in this reaction, and the resulting solution contains Fe³+ and the counterion from the acid (like Cl- if using HCl). Then, the Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H+.

So, the H+ in the solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But wait, if we added exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+, then all H+ is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3, and the only H+ present is from the hydrolysis of Fe³+. Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But in that case, the pH would be around 2.28 as calculated above.

But let's check if that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that after neutralization, the solution is just Fe³+ in water, and the pH is due to the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But let's confirm the steps:

1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

2. Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol

3. Volume of 0.1 M H+ needed: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³

4. Total solution volume: 100 cm³, so [Fe³+] = 0.0009356 / 0.1 = 0.009356 M

5. Fe³+ hydrolyzes: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

6. K for hydrolysis = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

7. So, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5

8. Plug in [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M:

[H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7

[H+] ≈ (1.484e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M

pH ≈ -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

So, the pH would be approximately 2.28.

But wait, is this correct? Let me check the hydrolysis calculation again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the standard approach for hydrolysis.

For the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

This is the first hydrolysis step. However, Fe³+ can undergo multiple hydrolysis steps, but the first one is the most significant. The equilibrium constant for the first hydrolysis step is often given as K1.

But I might not have the exact K1 value. However, using Ksp and Kw is another approach.

Alternatively, the hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

As calculated before, K = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ 1.587e-5

So, with [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M,

[H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7

[H+] ≈ 5.3e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.28

This seems reasonable. Fe³+ is a strongly hydrolyzing ion, so the solution should be quite acidic.

Therefore, the minimum volume of acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

But let me check if the Ksp value I used is correct. Different sources might have slightly different values for Fe(OH)3's Ksp. For example, some sources cite Ksp for Fe(OH)3 as 2.79×10^-39, which would significantly affect the calculation. Wait, this discrepancy could be a problem.

Wait, let me confirm the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Iron(III) hydroxide has a very low solubility. Different sources might report different values due to different crystalline forms or experimental conditions. For example, some sources give Ksp ≈ 6.3×10^-38, others might say 1×10^-38 or 2.8×10^-39. This can drastically change the hydrolysis calculation.

If Ksp is 2.8×10^-39, then K = (1e-14)^3 / 2.8e-39 ≈ 1e-42 / 2.8e-39 ≈ 3.57e-4

Then, [H+]^3 = 3.57e-4 * 0.009356 ≈ 3.57e-4 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 3.34e-6

[H+] ≈ (3.34e-6)^(1/3) ≈ 1.49e-2 M, pH ≈ 1.83

That's a significant difference. So, the pH calculation is very sensitive to the Ksp value. Since the problem doesn't provide Ksp, maybe we are supposed to ignore the hydrolysis and just calculate the pH based on the excess H+?

Wait, but if we add the stoichiometric amount of acid, there is no excess H+. The H+ from the acid is exactly consumed by the Fe(OH)3. Then, the only H+ present is from the hydrolysis of Fe³+. Therefore, we must consider hydrolysis. But without the Ksp value given in the problem, how are we supposed to know which value to use?

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to assume that all the H+ is consumed and that the solution is neutral? That can't be right because Fe³+ is acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution is just Fe³+ and water, and the pH is calculated based on the hydrolysis. But since the Ksp isn't provided, maybe we are to use a standard value or there's another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the solution is simply the result of dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid, and the pH is due to the Fe³+ concentration. But without Ksp, we can't calculate it. Therefore, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the hydrolysis and state that the pH is 1 (since it's a strong acid), but that doesn't make sense because the acid is consumed.

Alternatively, maybe after the reaction, the solution contains Fe³+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (like Cl- from HCl), which doesn't affect pH. Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But since the problem doesn't provide Ksp, maybe we are supposed to state that the pH is acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis, but can't calculate the exact value. However, the problem does ask for the pH of the resulting solution, so they must expect a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps we are to use a standard Ksp value. Let me check common Ksp values for Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, the solubility product of iron(III) hydroxide is often listed around 6×10^-38. For example, 6.3×10^-38 is a commonly cited value. Let's proceed with that.

So, using Ksp = 6.3×10^-38,

K = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

Then, [H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7

[H+] ≈ 5.3e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.28

So, approximately pH 2.28.

Alternatively, if the problem expects a different approach, maybe considering that after neutralization, the solution is FeCl3 (if HCl is used), and FeCl3 is a strong acid salt, so it hydrolyzes to produce H+.

But the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M, and each Fe³+ can produce 3 H+ ions through hydrolysis, but in reality, it's stepwise and not all three H+ are released. However, for estimation, maybe we can consider that each Fe³+ produces 3 H+.

But that would be an oversimplification. The actual hydrolysis is complicated, but using the Ksp and Kw relation is more accurate.

Given that, the pH is approximately 2.28.

So, summarizing:

Minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed: ≈28.1 cm³

pH of resulting solution: ≈2.28

But let me check if the initial calculation of the acid volume is correct, considering the total volume.

Wait, when we add V cm³ of acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3, and then dilute to 100 cm³, the moles of H+ needed are still 0.0028068 mol. The concentration of H+ in the acid is 0.1 M, so moles = 0.1 * V / 1000. Setting that equal to 0.0028068:

0.1 * V / 1000 = 0.0028068 → V = (0.0028068 * 1000) / 0.1 = 28.068 cm³

Yes, that's correct. So, the acid volume is 28.068 cm³, and the total solution is made up to 100 cm³. Therefore, the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.

Therefore, the hydrolysis calculation is as before, leading to pH ≈2.28.

Therefore, the answers are approximately 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28.

But let me verify once more.

Another approach: Let's assume that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with H+, the solution contains Fe^3+ and the anion from the acid (e.g., Cl^-). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

K1 = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+]

The value of K1 for Fe^3+ is approximately 6.5×10^-3. But this is the first hydrolysis constant. If we use this value, then:

K1 = 6.5e-3 = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+]

Assuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)^2+ is x, and [H+] is also x, and [Fe^3+] is 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356 (since x is small), then:

6.5e-3 ≈ x^2 / 0.009356

x^2 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.08e-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.08e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3

Therefore, [H+] ≈7.8e-3 M, pH ≈2.11

This is different from the previous calculation. So, which one is correct?

The discrepancy arises because using K1 (the first hydrolysis constant) versus using Ksp and Kw. The K1 approach gives a pH of ~2.1, while the Ksp approach gives ~2.3. The difference is due to different constants used.

But since the problem doesn't provide any equilibrium constants, it's unclear which method to use. However, in many textbooks, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is often approximated using the first hydrolysis constant, which is on the order of 10^-3. Therefore, leading to a pH around 2.1.

But without being given the constants, it's challenging. However, since the problem is likely expecting us to use the Ksp approach (as Ksp is more fundamental), but since Ksp wasn't given, maybe we are to ignore hydrolysis and state that pH is 1? Wait, no, because the acid is exactly neutralized. If we add stoichiometric H+, the solution should be neutral if the salt is from a strong acid and strong base. But Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and the acid is strong, so the salt FeCl3 is acidic. Therefore, the pH should be less than 7. But without hydrolysis constants, we can't compute it exactly. However, the problem expects an answer, so they must assume that we use Ksp = 6.3e-38.

Alternatively, maybe the question is designed to realize that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes, but the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis. However, since the problem doesn't give Ksp, perhaps we are to state that the pH is very low, but can't compute it numerically. But the question asks for the pH, so they must expect a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps we are to assume that all H+ from the acid is consumed, and the solution is neutral? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the excess H+ determines the pH. Wait, but if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount, there is no excess H+. The H+ is all consumed. Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Given that, and assuming that the problem expects us to use Ksp = 6.3e-38, then pH ≈2.28. Alternatively, if using the first hydrolysis constant K1 =6.5e-3, pH≈2.1. Since the problem is likely at an introductory level, maybe they expect us to recognize that Fe^3+ hydrolysis leads to an acidic solution and perhaps estimate the pH based on the concentration.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009356 M. If each Fe^3+ releases 3 H+, then the concentration of H+ would be 3*0.009356 =0.02807 M, pH≈1.55. But this is an oversimplification because hydrolysis is not 100%, but it's a common approximation for polyprotic acids. However, Fe^3+ hydrolysis is stepwise and doesn't release all 3 H+ ions completely.

Alternatively, considering that each Fe^3+ releases one H+:

[H+] = sqrt(K1 * [Fe^3+]) = sqrt(6.5e-3 * 0.009356) ≈ sqrt(6.08e-5) ≈ 0.0078 M, pH≈2.11

But without being given K1, this is speculative.

Given the confusion here, and since the problem is likely expecting the stoichiometric volume and pH from hydrolysis using Ksp, I'll proceed with the initial calculation:

Minimum volume ≈28.1 cm³, pH≈2.28.

But to present the answer properly, I should use more precise calculations.

First, precise molar mass of Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol

O: 16.00 *3 =48.00 g/mol

H: 1.008 *3=3.024 g/mol

Total:55.845 +48.00 +3.024=106.869 g/mol

Moles of Fe(OH)3:0.1 /106.869≈0.0009356 mol

Moles of H+ needed:3*0.0009356≈0.0028068 mol

Volume of 0.1 M acid:0.0028068 /0.1=0.028068 L=28.068 cm³≈28.1 cm³

For pH:

Ksp=6.3e-38

Kw=1e-14

K=Kw³ /Ksp=(1e-14)^3 /6.3e-38≈1.587e-5

[Fe³+]=0.0009356 mol /0.1 L=0.009356 M

[H+]^3=1.587e-5 *0.009356≈1.484e-7

[H+]= (1.484e-7)^(1/3)

Calculate cube root of 1.484e-7:

1e-7 is (1e-7)^(1/3)=4.64e-3

1.484e-7 is 1.484 times that, so 4.64e-3 * (1.484)^(1/3)

1.484^(1/3)≈1.14

So, 4.64e-3 *1.14≈5.29e-3 M

pH=-log(5.29e-3)=2.28

Therefore, the answers are:

Minimum volume:28.1 cm³

pH:2.28

Rounded to two decimal places for pH, and one decimal for volume (since 0.1 cm³ precision is reasonable).

But the problem might expect the volume as an integer. 28.068 cm³ is approximately 28.1 cm³, which is 28.1 cm³. Depending on significant figures, the given data is 0.1 g (one significant figure), 100 cm³ (two or three?), 0.1 M (two significant figures). The molar mass calculation uses atomic weights with more sig figs, so the limiting is probably two sig figs from the 0.1 M and 0.1 g. But 0.1 g is one sig fig, which would make the moles of Fe(OH)3 one sig fig, leading to volume as 0.03 L (30 cm³). But that seems too approximate. However, in practice, maybe they expect two decimal places for the volume (28.07 cm³) and two decimal places for pH.

But given the problem's data, perhaps the answer should be 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28.

Alternatively, if they consider that 0.1 g has one significant figure, the volume would be 30 cm³ and pH around 2.3. But that's speculative.

Given that, I think the precise answer is 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and also find the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's start by recalling some chemistry concepts here.

First, Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide, which is a weak base, right? And we're using a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or HNO3. The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would be a neutralization reaction. The general equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Since the acid is monobasic, each molecule donates one H+ ion. So, for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+ to neutralize it. That makes sense because Fe(OH)3 has three hydroxide ions.

First, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16.00 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)). Let me compute that:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3*16 = 48
H: 3*1.008 = 3.024
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Let me check that calculation again. 0.1 divided by 106.874. Let me use a calculator: 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Yeah, that seems right.

Since the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/dm³. Since we need 0.0028068 mol of H+, the volume of acid required would be moles / concentration = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 dm³, which is 28.068 cm³. So approximately 28.07 cm³. But wait, the problem says "minimum volume" needed. Is there anything else I need to consider here?

Wait, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution might still be acidic or basic, but the question is about the minimum volume required to dissolve it. So, perhaps we just need the stoichiometric amount. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and we're adding a strong acid, the reaction should go to completion. So, the stoichiometric amount should be sufficient. Therefore, 28.07 cm³ is the minimum volume. But let me double-check.

But wait, when you dissolve Fe(OH)3 in acid, you form Fe³+ ions. However, Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. So, the resulting solution might be acidic. But the question is asking for the pH of the resulting solution. So, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, we need to calculate the pH considering the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But first, let's confirm the volume. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. The acid volume is 28.07 cm³, so the remaining volume would be water? Wait, the problem says "to prepare the solution" with 100 cm³ total volume. So, does that mean that the acid is added to a certain volume, and then diluted to 100 cm³? Or is the total volume the sum of the acid and water?

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..."

So, the total volume of the solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume plus the water added should make up 100 cm³. Wait, but actually, when you mix the acid with some water and the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. But the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its volume is negligible. So, the volume of the acid plus the volume of water added would be approximately 100 cm³. But the question is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed. So, if we add V cm³ of acid, then the rest (100 - V) cm³ is water. But the acid is a solution, so when you mix V cm³ of 0.1 M acid with (100 - V) cm³ of water, the total volume is 100 cm³. However, the moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.1 * V / 1000 (since Molarity is moles per liter). Wait, but we need 0.0028068 moles of H+.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. So, in V cm³ (which is V/1000 liters), the moles of H+ would be 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.0001V moles. We need 0.0028068 moles. So, 0.0001V = 0.0028068 → V = 0.0028068 / 0.0001 = 28.068 cm³. So, that's the same as before. But then, if we add 28.068 cm³ of acid, and then add water to make up to 100 cm³, the total volume is 100 cm³. But the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume". So, the acid is part of that 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid required is 28.068 cm³, and the rest is water. So, the minimum volume is approximately 28.07 cm³. So, that's the first part.

But wait, maybe there's a catch here. Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product, Ksp. Even after adding the stoichiometric amount of acid, maybe some Fe(OH)3 remains undissolved because the solution becomes saturated? But the problem states "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3", so we need to ensure that all of it dissolves. Therefore, perhaps we need to add excess acid to make sure that the solution is acidic enough to prevent precipitation of Fe(OH)3. But the question says "minimum volume", so it's the stoichiometric amount. However, in reality, because Fe³+ hydrolyzes, the pH might be low enough that no precipitation occurs. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the aci

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the quantity of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in a 100 cm³ solution, as well as calculate the pH of the resulting solution. I'll approach this systematically using chemistry principles.

Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide, a weak base. When it reacts with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO3), a neutralization reaction occurs. The equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Since the acid is monobasic, each molecule contributes one H+ ion, meaning we need three moles of H+ for each mole of Fe(OH)3 due to its three hydroxide ions.

To find the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams, I'll calculate its molar mass:
Fe: 55.85 g/mol
O: 3×16 = 48 g/mol
H: 3×1.008 = 3.024 g/mol
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol

Therefore, moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

Since the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the H+ needed is 3 × 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol.

With a 0.1 M acid concentration (0.1 mol/dm³), the volume required is:
moles / concentration = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 dm³, which equals 28.068 cm³, or approximately 28.07 cm³.

I need to consider whether this is truly the minimum volume required. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base reacting with a strong acid, the reaction should proceed to completion, so the stoichiometric amount should be sufficient. Thus, 28.07 cm³ appears to be the minimum volume needed.

However, it's important to note that Fe³+ ions formed in solution can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, potentially making the solution acidic. This factor would need to be considered when calculating the pH of the final solution.

The problem states we're dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm³. Therefore, we would add 28.07 cm³ of the 0.1 M acid, and the remainder would be water to reach the total 100 cm³ volume. Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its volume contribution is negligible.

In summary, the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed is approximately 28.07 cm³.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is necessary to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in a 100 cm³ solution, as well as find the pH of the final solution. Let's begin by revisiting some chemistry principles.

Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide and is considered a weak base. We're using a strong monobasic acid like HCl or HNO3. The neutralization reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid can be represented as Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Given that the acid is monobasic, each molecule provides one H+ ion, meaning we need three moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3 to achieve neutralization. This is logical since Fe(OH)3 contains three hydroxide ions.

Next, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is computed as follows: Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16.00 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)). Calculating these:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3*16 = 48
H: 3*1.008 = 3.024
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

Thus, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol. Double-checking this, 0.1 divided by 106.874 equals approximately 0.0009356 mol.

Since 3 moles of H+ are required per mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol of H+.

Given the acid is 0.1 M, which equals 0.1 mol/dm³, the volume of acid required is moles / concentration = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 dm³, or 28.068 cm³, approximately 28.07 cm³. The problem specifies the "minimum volume" needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, suggesting that the stoichiometric amount is sufficient, as the reaction proceeds to completion when using a strong acid with a weak base.

However, when dissolving Fe(OH)3, Fe³+ ions are formed, which can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, potentially resulting in an acidic solution. For the pH calculation, consider the hydrolysis effect of Fe³+.

Addressing the issue of solution volume, the problem states, "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." This indicates the total volume including the acid and water added should be 100 cm³. The volume of acid to water makes up this 100 cm³, acknowledging that the solid volume of Fe(OH)3 is negligible. Thus, 28.07 cm³ of acid mixed with the remaining water makes up the 100 cm³ total solution. Therefore, 28.07 cm³ is the minimum volume of acid required.

Since the task specifies the stoichiometric condition, any excess would only account for practical considerations like ensuring complete dissolution, given Fe³+ hydrolysis. Yet, theoretically, 28.07 cm³ provides the necessary minimum for successful dissolution in an acidic environment, preventing Fe(OH)3 precipitation under these conditions.

If the pH is too high, Fe(OH)3 will precipitate. Therefore, to prevent precipitation, the pH must be low enough that the product of [Fe³+] and [OH-]^3 is less than Ksp.\n\nBut since we are dissolving the Fe(OH)3 completely, we need to add enough acid not only to neutralize the hydroxide but also to suppress the hydrolysis so that Fe(OH)3 doesn\'t re-precipitate. Wait, but if we add the stoichiometric amount, then the solution would contain Fe³+ ions, which hydrolyze to produce H+ ions. Therefore, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the minimum volume of acid required to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. If we add just the stoichiometric amount, the solution would have Fe³+ and the corresponding anion from the acid (like Cl- if using HCl). The hydrolysis of Fe³+ would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. However, if the pH is such that the concentration of OH- is high enough to exceed the Ksp of Fe(OH)3, then some Fe(OH)3 would precipitate. Therefore, to ensure all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the acid must be added in sufficient quantity to not only neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3 but also to provide enough H+ to keep the solution acidic enough that Fe(OH)3 doesn\'t re-precipitate.\n\nTherefore, the stoichiometric amount might not be sufficient. We might need to add excess acid. But the problem says "minimum volume", so perhaps the stoichiometric amount is considered sufficient here, assuming that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ doesn\'t cause precipitation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the hydrolysis and just consider the stoichiometry. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.\n\nThe solubility product of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. Let\'s see. If we dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe³+ would be:\n\nMoles of Fe³+ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol in 0.1 L, so concentration is 0.0009356 / 0.1 = 0.009356 M.\n\nSo, [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M. The Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.\n\nSo, solving for [OH-]:\n\n[OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = (6.3×10^-38) / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10^-36\n\nTherefore, [OH-] ≈ (6.73×10^-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10^-12 M\n\nThen, [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1×10^-14 / 1.88×10^-12 ≈ 5.32×10^-3 M\n\npH = -log(5.32×10^-3) ≈ 2.27\n\nSo, the pH of the solution would be approximately 2.27. Therefore, if we add just the stoichiometric amount of acid, the pH would be around 2.27, which is sufficiently acidic to keep Fe³+ in solution, as the Ksp is not exceeded. Therefore, the minimum volume is indeed the stoichiometric amount, 28.07 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.27.\n\nBut let\'s verify this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the required moles of H+:\n\n0.1 g Fe(OH)3 / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol Fe(OH)3\n\nEach Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+:\n\n0.0009356 * 3 ≈ 0.0028068 mol H+\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nTotal solution volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M\n\nThen, using Ksp for Fe(OH)3:\n\nKsp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38\n\n[OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38 / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10^-36\n\n[OH-] ≈ (6.73×10^-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10^-12 M\n\n[H+] = 1e-14 / 1.88e-12 ≈ 5.32e-3 M\n\npH = -log(5.32e-3) ≈ 2.27\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 2.27.\n\nSo, the minimum volume of acid needed is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.27.\n\nBut let me check if the initial assumption is correct. When we add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M H+ to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. So, the concentration of H+ contributed by the acid is 0.0028068 mol in 0.1 L, which is 0.028068 M. But wait, no. Wait, the H+ from the acid is used to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, so the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. However, the Fe³+ then hydrolyzes to produce H+.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. When we add H+ to react with Fe(OH)3, the H+ is consumed to form water. The resulting solution contains Fe³+ ions, which then hydrolyze to produce H+.\n\nSo, the H+ in the solution after the reaction is not the H+ from the acid, but the H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nTherefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n\n2. Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol\n\n3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³\n\n4. After reaction, Fe³+ concentration: 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M\n\n5. Fe³+ hydrolysis: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\n6. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions. The extent of hydrolysis depends on the Ksp.\n\n7. Using Ksp, calculate [OH-] and then [H+], which gives pH ≈ 2.27\n\nTherefore, the pH is indeed around 2.27, and the minimum volume is 28.07 cm³.\n\nBut let me check if the hydrolysis calculation is correct. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+, so the concentration of H+ is related to the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe³+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its activity is 1, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nWait, let\'s derive it properly.\n\nThe solubility product is Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction can be written as:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression would be:\n\nK = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut K can be related to Kw and Ksp. Since Kw = [H+][OH-], so [OH-] = Kw / [H+]\n\nSubstitute into Ksp:\n\nKsp = [Fe³+](Kw / [H+])^3\n\nRearranged:\n\n[H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nTherefore,\n\n[H+] = ( [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp )^(1/3)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n[Fe³+] = 0.009356 M\n\nKw = 1e-14\n\nKsp = 6.3e-38\n\n[H+] = (0.009356 * (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 )^(1/3)\n\nFirst compute numerator: 0.009356 * 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 = 0.009356 / 6.3e-38 * 1e-42\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n(0.009356) * (1e-14)^3 = 0.009356 * 1e-42 = 9.356e-45\n\nThen divide by Ksp: 9.356e-45 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.485e-7\n\nThen take cube root: (1.485e-7)^(1/3) ≈ (1.485)^(1/3) * 1e-7^(1/3) ≈ 1.14 * 1e-2.333 ≈ 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 0.0053\n\nSo, [H+] ≈ 0.0053 M, which gives pH ≈ -log(0.0053) ≈ 2.28\n\nWhich matches the previous calculation. So, pH ≈ 2.28.\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any other factor I might have missed. For example, the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acid is a straightforward neutralization reaction, but sometimes, depending on the acid, the anion might form complexes with Fe³+, which could affect solubility. However, the problem states it\'s a monobasic strong acid, like HCl or HNO3. If it\'s HCl, Cl- can form complexes with Fe³+ (like FeCl4^-), which might increase solubility. However, since we\'re asked for the minimum volume, and the problem likely expects a stoichiometric answer without considering complexation, unless specified. Since it\'s a strong monobasic acid, and the question is probably expecting us to ignore such complexities, we can proceed with the previous answer.\n\nTherefore, the minimum volume is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut let me check the exact value for the volume. The moles of H+ needed are 0.0028068 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. Rounding to two decimal places, 28.07 cm³. But maybe to two significant figures? The given data is 0.1 g and 0.1 M, which are two significant figures. So, the answer should be 28 cm³. Wait, 0.1 g has one significant figure, 0.1 M is also one significant figure. But the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is known more precisely. Hmm, the problem might expect an answer with more decimals, but usually, in such problems, unless specified, we can go with two decimal places for the volume (since the molarity is given as 0.1 M, which is one decimal place, but the mass is 0.1 g, one decimal place). However, in the calculation, the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 106.874 g/mol, which is more precise. The final answer\'s precision is limited by the given data. Since both 0.1 g and 0.1 M have one significant figure, but the result is 28.07 cm³, which is about 28.1 cm³ (three significant figures). But maybe the answer should be given with two significant figures, as 28 cm³. However, in many cases, for such problems, even if the data has one significant figure, the answer is given with more decimals, but the correct approach is to match the least number of significant figures. However, 0.1 g and 0.1 M are both one significant figure, so the answer should be 30 cm³? Wait, 28.07 rounds to 28 cm³ (two significant figures) or 28.1 cm³ (three significant figures). But 0.1 has one significant figure, so the answer should be 30 cm³? Wait, no. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, the mass is 0.1 g (1 sig fig), molarity is 0.1 M (1 sig fig), molar mass is 106.874 (5 sig figs). So, the moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356, which is 9.356e-4, which we should consider as 9e-4 (1 sig fig). Then, moles of H+ needed is 3 * 9e-4 = 3e-3 (still 1 sig fig).

To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

2. **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.0028068 mol

3. **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**
   - Volume = moles / concentration = 0.0028068 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.028068 dm³ = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution:**
   - Concentration of Fe³⁺ in 100 cm³ = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ (6.3×10⁻³⁸):
     - [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (6.3×10⁻³⁸) / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10⁻³⁶
     - [OH⁻] ≈ (6.73×10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10⁻¹² M
     - [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.88×10⁻¹² ≈ 5.32×10⁻³ M
     - pH = -log(5.32×10⁻³) ≈ 2.28

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

, the solution contains Fe³+ ions, which can hydrolyze:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

This hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, which lower the pH. If the pH is too high, Fe(OH)3 will precipitate. Therefore, to prevent precipitation, the pH must be low enough that the product of [Fe³+] and [OH-]^3 is less than Ksp.

But since we are dissolving the Fe(OH)3 completely, we need to add enough acid not only to neutralize the hydroxide but also to suppress the hydrolysis so that Fe(OH)3 doesn't re-precipitate. Wait, but if we add the stoichiometric amount, then the solution would contain Fe³+ ions, which hydrolyze to produce H+ ions. Therefore, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But the problem is asking for the minimum volume of acid required to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. If we add just the stoichiometric amount, the solution would have Fe³+ and the corresponding anion from the acid (like Cl- if using HCl). The hydrolysis of Fe³+ would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. However, if the pH is such that the concentration of OH- is high enough to exceed the Ksp of Fe(OH)3, then some Fe(OH)3 would precipitate. Therefore, to ensure all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the acid must be added in sufficient quantity to not only neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3 but also to provide enough H+ to keep the solution acidic enough that Fe(OH)3 doesn't re-precipitate.

Therefore, the stoichiometric amount might not be sufficient. We might need to add excess acid. But the problem says "minimum volume", so perhaps the stoichiometric amount is considered sufficient here, assuming that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ doesn't cause precipitation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the hydrolysis and just consider the stoichiometry. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

The solubility product of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. Let's see. If we dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe³+ would be:

Moles of Fe³+ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol in 0.1 L, so concentration is 0.0009356 / 0.1 = 0.009356 M.

So, [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M. The Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.

So, solving for [OH-]:

[OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = (6.3×10^-38) / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10^-36

Therefore, [OH-] ≈ (6.73×10^-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10^-12 M

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1×10^-14 / 1.88×10^-12 ≈ 5.32×10^-3 M

pH = -log(5.32×10^-3) ≈ 2.27

So, the pH of the solution would be approximately 2.27. Therefore, if we add just the stoichiometric amount of acid, the pH would be around 2.27, which is sufficiently acidic to keep Fe³+ in solution, as the Ksp is not exceeded. Therefore, the minimum volume is indeed the stoichiometric amount, 28.07 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.27.

But let's verify this step by step.

First, calculate the required moles of H+:

0.1 g Fe(OH)3 / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol Fe(OH)3

Each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+:

0.0009356 * 3 ≈ 0.0028068 mol H+

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.07 cm³

Total solution volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M

Then, using Ksp for Fe(OH)3:

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38

[OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38 / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10^-36

[OH-] ≈ (6.73×10^-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10^-12 M

[H+] = 1e-14 / 1.88e-12 ≈ 5.32e-3 M

pH = -log(5.32e-3) ≈ 2.27

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.27.

So, the minimum volume of acid needed is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.27.

But let me check if the initial assumption is correct. When we add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M H+ to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. So, the concentration of H+ contributed by the acid is 0.0028068 mol in 0.1 L, which is 0.028068 M. But wait, no. Wait, the H+ from the acid is used to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, so the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. However, the Fe³+ then hydrolyzes to produce H+.

Wait, this is a crucial point. When we add H+ to react with Fe(OH)3, the H+ is consumed to form water. The resulting solution contains Fe³+ ions, which then hydrolyze to produce H+.

So, the H+ in the solution after the reaction is not the H+ from the acid, but the H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

2. Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol

3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³

4. After reaction, Fe³+ concentration: 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M

5. Fe³+ hydrolysis: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

6. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions. The extent of hydrolysis depends on the Ksp.

7. Using Ksp, calculate [OH-] and then [H+], which gives pH ≈ 2.27

Therefore, the pH is indeed around 2.27, and the minimum volume is 28.07 cm³.

But let me check if the hydrolysis calculation is correct. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+, so the concentration of H+ is related to the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Alternatively, we can consider the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe³+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its activity is 1, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp

Wait, let's derive it properly.

The solubility product is Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+

The equilibrium expression would be:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But K can be related to Kw and Ksp. Since Kw = [H+][OH-], so [OH-] = Kw / [H+]

Substitute into Ksp:

Ksp = [Fe³+](Kw / [H+])^3

Rearranged:

[H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp

Therefore,

[H+] = ( [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp )^(1/3)

Plugging in the numbers:

[Fe³+] = 0.009356 M

Kw = 1e-14

Ksp = 6.3e-38

[H+] = (0.009356 * (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 )^(1/3)

First compute numerator: 0.009356 * 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 = 0.009356 / 6.3e-38 * 1e-42

Wait, let me compute step by step:

(0.009356) * (1e-14)^3 = 0.009356 * 1e-42 = 9.356e-45

Then divide by Ksp: 9.356e-45 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.485e-7

Then take cube root: (1.485e-7)^(1/3) ≈ (1.485)^(1/3) * 1e-7^(1/3) ≈ 1.14 * 1e-2.333 ≈ 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 0.0053

So, [H+] ≈ 0.0053 M, which gives pH ≈ -log(0.0053) ≈ 2.28

Which matches the previous calculation. So, pH ≈ 2.28.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

So, putting it all together, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

But let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acid is a straightforward neutralization reaction, but sometimes, depending on the acid, the anion might form complexes with Fe³+, which could affect solubility. However, the problem states it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl or HNO3. If it's HCl, Cl- can form complexes with Fe³+ (like FeCl4^-), which might increase solubility. However, since we're asked for the minimum volume, and the problem likely expects a stoichiometric answer without considering complexation, unless specified. Since it's a strong monobasic acid, and the question is probably expecting us to ignore such complexities, we can proceed with the previous answer.

Therefore, the minimum volume is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.28.

But let me check the exact value for the volume. The moles of H+ needed are 0.0028068 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. Rounding to two decimal places, 28.07 cm³. But maybe to two significant figures? The given data is 0.1 g and 0.1 M, which are two significant figures. So, the answer should be 28 cm³. Wait, 0.1 g has one significant figure, 0.1 M is also one significant figure. But the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is known more precisely. Hmm, the problem might expect an answer with more decimals, but usually, in such problems, unless specified, we can go with two decimal places for the volume (since the molarity is given as 0.1 M, which is one decimal place, but the mass is 0.1 g, one decimal place). However, in the calculation, the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 106.874 g/mol, which is more precise. The final answer's precision is limited by the given data. Since both 0.1 g and 0.1 M have one significant figure, but the result is 28.07 cm³, which is about 28.1 cm³ (three significant figures). But maybe the answer should be given with two significant figures, as 28 cm³. However, in many cases, for such problems, even if the data has one significant figure, the answer is given with more decimals, but the correct approach is to match the least number of significant figures. However, 0.1 g and 0.1 M are both one significant figure, so the answer should be 30 cm³? Wait, 28.07 rounds to 28 cm³ (two significant figures) or 28.1 cm³ (three significant figures). But 0.1 has one significant figure, so the answer should be 30 cm³? Wait, no. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, the mass is 0.1 g (1 sig fig), molarity is 0.1 M (1 sig fig), molar mass is 106.874 (5 sig figs). So, the moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356, which is 9.356e-4, which we should consider as 9e-4 (1 sig fig). Then, moles of H+ needed is 3 * 9e-4 = 3e-3 (still 1 sig fig). Then volume is 3e-3 / 0.1 = 0.03 L = 30 cm³ (1 sig fig). But this seems too approximate. However, in real exams, sometimes they expect to not round until the end. Let me check the exact calculation again.

Original mass: 0.1 g (could be 0.1 ± 0.05 g)

Molar mass: 106.874 g/mol (exact value depends on atomic weights, but for the purpose here, precise)

Molarity of acid: 0.1 M (could be 0.1 ± 0.05 M)

But in the absence of explicit error ranges, typically, in such problems, the answer is expected to be given to the same decimal places as the least precise measurement. Since 0.1 has one decimal place, but in terms of significant figures, it's one. However, in many textbooks, they might consider 0.1 as having one significant figure, so the answer should be 30 cm³. But in reality, the calculation gives 28.07 cm³, which is approximately 28.1 cm³. Since the question is from a problem set, maybe they expect the precise answer. Let me check the initial data again.

Wait, the problem says 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 and 0.1 M acid. Both are given to one decimal place, but 0.1 g is two significant figures if the precision is to the tenths place. Wait, 0.1 g is one significant figure. Similarly, 0.1 M is one significant figure. Therefore, the answer should be rounded to one significant figure, which would be 30 cm³. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects two decimal places in the answer for volume, as it's in cm³, and pH to two decimal places. Let me see examples.

In many similar problems, even if the data is given with one significant figure, the answer is presented with two or three, acknowledging that the molar masses are known more precisely. For example, the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is calculated using atomic weights from the periodic table, which are known to at least four significant figures. Therefore, the limiting factor is the mass and concentration. However, since both 0.1 g and 0.1 M have one significant figure, the answer should technically be rounded to one significant figure. But in practice, maybe two. Let's see:

If 0.1 g is considered as ±0.05 g, and 0.1 M as ±0.05 M, then the answer has a large uncertainty. But since this is a theoretical problem, not a lab calculation, they might expect the precise answer. Therefore, I think the answer is expected to be 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28. But let me check with exact values.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the hydrolysis and just calculate the pH based on the excess H+.

Wait, but in the stoichiometric calculation, all H+ is consumed to neutralize Fe(OH)3. Then, the solution contains Fe³+ and the anion (Cl- or NO3-). If we assume that Fe³+ does not hydrolyze, then the pH would be 7? No, that's not correct. Because Fe³+ is a strong Lewis acid and will hydrolyze, producing H+ ions. Therefore, the pH must be calculated considering the hydrolysis.

But if we didn't consider hydrolysis, and just assumed that all H+ is consumed, then there's no H+ left, which is not the case. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the hydrolysis.

Therefore, the pH is indeed around 2.28.

So, summarizing:

Volume of acid needed: 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

pH of resulting solution: ≈ 2.28

But let me check if the Ksp value I used is correct. Different sources might have slightly different values for Fe(OH)3's Ksp. For example, some sources list it as 2.79×10^-39 for amorphous Fe(OH)3. But the value I used, 6.3×10^-38, is also a common one. Let me confirm.

Upon checking, the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 is actually highly dependent on the form (amorphous vs. crystalline) and can vary widely. For example, amorphous Fe(OH)3 has a higher Ksp (around 10^-38 to 10^-36), while crystalline forms have lower Ksp (around 10^-42). Since the problem doesn't specify, it's safer to use the commonly cited value for amorphous Fe(OH)3, which is around 6.3×10^-38. However, if a different Ksp is used, the pH would change. But given that the problem doesn't provide a specific Ksp value, we have to proceed with the commonly accepted value.

Assuming Ksp = 6.3×10^-38, the pH calculation is as before, around 2.28.

Therefore, the final answers are:

Minimum volume of acid: 28.1 cm³

pH of resulting solution: 2.28

But let me check if the problem expects the pH to be calculated considering the dilution. Wait, when we add 28.07 cm³ of acid to the solution and dilute to 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M as calculated. But if the acid is added and then made up to 100 cm³, the total volume is 100 cm³. So, the Fe³+ concentration is correct.

Alternatively, if the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution, then the volume of acid plus the initial volume would be more than 100 cm³. But the problem states "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume", which implies that the total volume after adding acid and dissolving is 100 cm³. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the total volume as 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.

Therefore, the previous calculations hold.

In conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered as a series of steps, but for simplicity, we can approximate it using the formula for the first hydrolysis step:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Ka) for this reaction can be found using the relation Kw / Ksp, but I might need to look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known. Let me recall: Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. However, this is the solubility product for Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻. The Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.\n\nBut for the hydrolysis of Fe³+, the relevant equilibrium is Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+, and the corresponding Ka can be calculated using Kw and Ksp. Let\'s see:\n\nFrom the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.\n\nIf we consider the reverse reaction of Fe³+ acting as an acid: Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.\n\nBut this is a bit more complex. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered stepwise. The first hydrolysis step is:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Ka1\n\nThe Ka1 can be calculated using Kw / Ksp^(1/3). Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the relationship between Ksp and the hydrolysis constant (Kh) for the first step. Let\'s see:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction: Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Kh = [Fe(OH)²+][H+] / [Fe³+]\n\nBut how is this related to Ksp? Let\'s consider the dissolution reaction and the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nThe dissolution reaction gives Fe³+ and OH⁻. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ produces H+ and Fe(OH)²+. If we combine the dissolution reaction with the reverse of the hydrolysis reaction, perhaps we can find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3, and Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14, we can express [OH⁻] as Kw / [H+]. Substituting into Ksp:\n\nKsp = [Fe³+] (Kw / [H+])^3\n\nRearranging, [H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nBut this might not directly help. Alternatively, if we consider the solution after dissolution, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, so the pH will be determined by this hydrolysis.\n\nGiven that the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M, we can set up an equilibrium expression. Let\'s denote the concentration of H+ produced as x. Then:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+\n\nInitial: 0.009356 M, 0, 0\n\nChange: -x, +x, +x\n\nEquilibrium: 0.009356 - x, x, x\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is needed. Alternatively, using the relation between Ksp and Kw. Let\'s see:\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered as the reverse of the base dissociation of Fe(OH)3. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its conjugate acid (Fe³+) is a strong acid. The Ka for Fe³+ can be calculated using Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3. However, Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, so it can donate three OH⁻ ions. But this complicates things. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 is a very weak base (low solubility), its conjugate acid (Fe³+) is a strong acid. However, the exact value of Ka for Fe³+ hydrolysis is needed.\n\nLooking up, the hydrolysis constant for Fe³+ (first step) is approximately Ka = 6.5×10^-3. Wait, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, using Ksp and Kw.\n\nLet me try to calculate it. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻; Ksp = 6.3×10^-38\n\nThe reverse reaction is Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s); K = 1/Ksp\n\nBut the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Kh\n\nThis can be considered as the combination of:\n\nFe³+ + OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)²+; K1\n\nAnd H2O ⇌ H+ + OH⁻; Kw\n\nBut combining these, we get:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Kh = K1 * Kw\n\nBut I\'m not sure about K1. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between Ksp and Kh.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+; Kh\n\nThe equilibrium expression is Kh = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant (activity = 1), so Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut Kh is related to Ksp and Kw. Let\'s see:\n\nFrom the dissolution reaction, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3\n\nFrom the hydrolysis reaction, Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14, so [OH⁻] = Kw / [H+]\n\nSubstituting into Ksp:\n\nKsp = [Fe³+] (Kw / [H+])^3\n\nRearranging:\n\n[H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nBut from the hydrolysis reaction, Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = ( [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp ) / [Fe³+] ) = Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nTherefore, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ (1e-42) / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nSo Kh ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nBut Kh is equal to [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nWait, but in the hydrolysis reaction, if we consider the reaction Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, then Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut according to the calculation, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nTherefore, [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5\n\nGiven that [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M, we can solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7\n\nTaking the cube root: [H+] ≈ (1.484e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M\n\nTherefore, pH = -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28\n\nBut wait, this seems a bit low. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nThen, [H+]^3 = Kh * [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7\n\nCube root of 1.484e-7: Let\'s compute 1.484e-7 = 1.484 × 10^-7\n\nCube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3\n\nMultiply by cube root of 1.484: cube root of 1.484 ≈ 1.14\n\nSo total [H+] ≈ 1.14 × 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.3e-3 M, which gives pH ≈ 2.28\n\nThis seems plausible. However, this assumes that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the only source of H+ ions. But we also added excess acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Wait, no. The acid added is exactly the stoichiometric amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O\n\nSo the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, and the resulting solution contains Fe³+ and water. However, Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H+ ions. Therefore, the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nBut wait, if we added exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is consumed in the neutralization reaction, and the solution should be neutral? No, because Fe³+ is a strong acid (its conjugate base is weak), so it hydrolyzes to produce H+.\n\nTherefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nBut let\'s confirm. The acid (H+) is used to neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3. The reaction consumes 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3, producing Fe³+ and water. The resulting solution contains Fe³+ ions and the counterion from the acid (e.g., Cl- if HCl is used). Since the acid is strong and monobasic, the counterion (Cl-) is a spectator ion and doesn\'t affect pH. Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nSo the calculation above for pH ≈ 2.28 seems correct. However, let\'s check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for pH of a solution of a metal ion that hydrolyzes:\n\npH = 0.5*(pKa - log C)\n\nWhere pKa is for the hydrolysis reaction, and C is the concentration of the metal ion.\n\nBut first, we need the pKa of Fe³+. From the previous calculation, we found that Kh = 1.587e-5, which corresponds to the reaction Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is Kh = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]\n\nAssuming that [Fe(OH)²+] ≈ [H+] = x, and [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356 (since x is small compared to 0.009356), then:\n\nKh ≈ x² / 0.009356 = 1.587e-5\n\nSolving for x² = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7\n\nx ≈ sqrt(1.484e-7) ≈ 3.85e-4 M\n\nBut this gives [H+] ≈ 3.85e-4 M, pH ≈ 3.41\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous result. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, there\'s confusion here. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can occur in multiple steps. The first step is Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+ (Ka1), and the second step is Fe(OH)²+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)2+ + H+ (Ka2), and the third step is Fe(OH)2+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + H+ (Ka3). However, the first hydrolysis step is the most significant contributor to acidity.\n\nBut earlier, when considering the overall reaction Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, we found Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ 1.587e-5, leading to [H+] ≈ 5.3e-3 M and pH ≈ 2.28. However, when considering only the first hydrolysis step and making the approximation that [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009356 M, we get [H+] ≈ 3.85e-4 M and pH ≈ 3.41.\n\nThis discrepancy arises because the first approach considers all three hydrolysis steps contributing to H+ production, while the second approach only considers the first step. In reality, the first hydrolysis step is the primary contributor, but subsequent steps also contribute, though to a lesser extent. However, the exact calculation requires knowing the individual Ka values for each step, which I might not have at hand.\n\nAlternatively, using the value of Ka1 for Fe³+ hydrolysis. A quick check in standard references shows that the first hydrolysis constant (Ka1) for Fe³+ is approximately 6.5×10^-3. Let\'s use this value.\n\nSo, Ka1 = 6.5e-3 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of H+ and Fe(OH)²+:\n\n6.5e-3 = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x << 0.009356, then:\n\nx² ≈ 6.5e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 6.0814e-5\n\nx ≈ sqrt(6.0814e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3 M\n\nThen, [H+] ≈ 7.8e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.11\n\nThis is closer to the first calculation. However, this uses a different Ka value. It seems the discrepancy comes from different sources of Ka. Let\'s clarify.\n\nIf Ka1 is 6.5e-3, then the pH would be around 2.1. If using the Ksp-derived Kh, we get pH ≈ 2.28. If using the stepwise approach with only the first hydrolysis step and a different Ka, we get pH ≈ 2.11. These are all in the same ballpark, around pH 2.1 to 2.4.\n\nHowever, to get an accurate answer, we need the correct value of Ka1 for Fe³+ hydrolysis. According to some sources, the first hydrolysis constant (pKa1) for Fe³+ is around 2.19, which would correspond to Ka1 ≈ 6.5e-3 (since pKa = -log(Ka), so Ka = 10^-2.19 ≈ 6.5e-3). Therefore, using Ka1 = 6.5e-3 is reasonable.\n\nUsing this, let\'s proceed:\n\nKa1 = 6.5e-3 = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x is not negligible compared to 0.009356, we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\nx² = 6.5e-3 * (0.009356 - x)\n\nx² + 6.5e-3 x - 6.5e-3 * 0.009356 = 0\n\nCalculating the constant term:\n\n6.5e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 6.0814e-5\n\nSo the equation is x² + 6.5e-3 x - 6.0814e-5 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-6.5e-3 ± sqrt((6.5e-3)^2 + 4*1*6.0814e-5)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n(6.5e-3)^2 + 4*1*6.0814e-5 = 4.225e-5 + 2.43256e-4 = 2.85506e-4\n\nsqrt(2.85506e-4) ≈ 0.0169\n\nThus,\n\nx = [-6.5e-3 ± 0.0169]/2\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\nx = ( -6.5e-3 + 0.0169 ) / 2 ≈ (0.0104) / 2 ≈ 0.0052 M\n\nSo [H+] ≈ 0.0052 M, pH ≈ -log(0.0052) ≈ 2.28\n\nThis matches the initial calculation using the Ksp-derived Kh. Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut wait, this seems inconsistent with the Ka1 value. If pKa1 is 2.19, then pH should be around 2.19 when [Fe³+] is 1 M. But here, [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M, so the pH would be lower than pKa1. Wait, no. The pH depends on the concentration. Let me think.\n\nThe pKa is a measure of the acid\'s strength. For a solution of Fe³+ in water, the pH can be estimated using the formula for a weak acid:\n\npH = 0.5*(pKa - log C)\n\nWhere C is the concentration of Fe³+.\n\nGiven pKa ≈ 2.19, C = 0.009356 M\n\npH = 0.5*(2.19 - log(0.009356)) = 0.5*(2.19 - (-2.03)) = 0.5*(4.22) = 2.11\n\nThis is close to the quadratic solution of 2.28, but there\'s a discrepancy. The exact value depends on the method used. However, given that the quadratic solution gave pH ≈ 2.28 and the approximation gives pH ≈ 2.11, the actual pH is likely around 2.2.\n\nConsidering the possible approximations and the given data, I\'ll proceed with the quadratic solution result of pH ≈ 2.28, which is approximately 2.3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.3.\n\nBut let\'s check once more for any errors. The key steps are:\n\n1. Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n2. Moles of H+ needed: 3 × 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol\n3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³\n4. Concentration of Fe³+ in 100 cm³: 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M\n5. Hydrolysis of Fe³+ leading to [H+] ≈ 0.0052 M, pH ≈ 2.28\n\nAll steps seem correct. Therefore, the answers are:\n\nMinimum volume of acid: approximately 28.1 cm³\n\npH of resulting solution: approximately 2.28\n\nRounding to two decimal places, pH 2.28, and volume to one decimal place, 28.1 cm³. However, depending on significant figures. The given data has 0.1 g (two significant figures), 100 cm³ (two or three, ambiguous), 0.1 M (two). So the volume should be reported as 28 cm³ (two significant figures), and pH as 2.3 (two decimal places, but significant figures might be two as well). However, pH is typically reported to two decimal places when possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the original problem statement:\n\n"We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?"\n\nThe data given:\n\n- 0.1 g Fe(OH)3: two significant figures\n- 100 cm³: ambiguous, could be two or three (if it\'s 100. cm³, then three)\n- 0.1 M acid: two significant figures\n\nAssuming 0.1 g and 0.1 M are two significant figures, and 100 cm³ is two, then the answers should be to two significant figures.\n\nVolume: 28 cm³ (28.07 rounds to 28.1, but with two sig figs, it\'s 28 cm³)\n\npH: calculated as 2.28, which would be 2.3 (two significant figures)\n\nHowever, sometimes pH is reported with more decimals, but given the input data, two significant figures are appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the molar mass calculation:\n\nFe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.008\n\nFe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*17.008 = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol\n\n0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol (four sig figs, but 0.1 g is two, so it\'s 0.00094 mol, two sig figs)\n\nThen moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.00094 = 0.0028 mol (two sig figs)\n\nVolume: 0.0028 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028 L = 28 cm³ (two sig figs)\n\nFor pH, using 0.009356 M Fe³+ (but this is from 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L, which is three sig figs from the moles, but the original data is two sig figs. So perhaps the concentration is 0.0094 M (two sig figs). Then, using Ka1 = 6.5e-3 (two sig figs), the calculation would be:\n\nKa1 = 6.5e-3 = x² / (0.0094 - x)\n\nAssuming x << 0.0094:\n\nx² ≈ 6.5e-3 * 0.0094 ≈ 6.11e-5\n\nx ≈ sqrt(6.11e-5) ≈ 0.00782 M\n\npH = -log(0.00782) ≈ 2.11\n\nBut with two sig figs, pH ≈ 2.1\n\nHowever, this is inconsistent with the previous result. The discrepancy arises from the precision of the data. Given the input data has two significant figures, the pH should be reported to two decimal places but with two significant figures. However, pH is a logarithmic scale, and the number after the decimal is considered significant. For example, pH 2.1 is one decimal place but implies two significant figures. If the calculation gives pH 2.28 with two sig figs, it would be 2.3. But if the input data limits it to two sig figs, the pH might be reported as 2.3.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the data\'s significant figures, the answers are:\n\nMinimum volume: 28 cm³\n\npH: 2.3\n\nBut I need to confirm once more. The moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol, which with two sig figs is 0.00094 mol. Then, moles H+ = 0.0028 mol. Volume = 0.0028 / 0.1 = 0.028 L = 28 cm³.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The pH calculation will depend on the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution and its hydrolysis. Let's proceed to calculate the pH.

First, calculate the concentration of Fe³+ in the 100 cm³ solution. The moles of Fe³+ are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, which is 0.0009356 mol. The concentration is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.009356 M.

Fe³+ undergoes hydrolysis in water: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions, which lower the pH. The extent of hydrolysis depends on the hydrolysis constant (Kh) for Fe³+. However, since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its conjugate acid (Fe³+) is a strong acid. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered as a series of steps, but for simplicity, we can approximate it using the formula for the first hydrolysis step:

Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

The equilibrium constant (Ka) for this reaction can be found using the relation Kw / Ksp, but I might need to look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known. Let me recall: Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. However, this is the solubility product for Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻. The Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.

But for the hydrolysis of Fe³+, the relevant equilibrium is Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+, and the corresponding Ka can be calculated using Kw and Ksp. Let's see:

From the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10^-38.

If we consider the reverse reaction of Fe³+ acting as an acid: Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.

But this is a bit more complex. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered stepwise. The first hydrolysis step is:

Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Ka1

The Ka1 can be calculated using Kw / Ksp^(1/3). Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.

Alternatively, the relationship between Ksp and the hydrolysis constant (Kh) for the first step. Let's see:

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

The equilibrium expression for this is Kh = [Fe(OH)²+][H+] / [Fe³+]

But how is this related to Ksp? Let's consider the dissolution reaction and the hydrolysis reaction.

The dissolution reaction gives Fe³+ and OH⁻. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ produces H+ and Fe(OH)²+. If we combine the dissolution reaction with the reverse of the hydrolysis reaction, perhaps we can find a relationship.

Alternatively, since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3, and Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14, we can express [OH⁻] as Kw / [H+]. Substituting into Ksp:

Ksp = [Fe³+] (Kw / [H+])^3

Rearranging, [H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp

But this might not directly help. Alternatively, if we consider the solution after dissolution, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, so the pH will be determined by this hydrolysis.

Given that the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M, we can set up an equilibrium expression. Let's denote the concentration of H+ produced as x. Then:

Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

Initial: 0.009356 M, 0, 0

Change: -x, +x, +x

Equilibrium: 0.009356 - x, x, x

The Ka for this reaction is needed. Alternatively, using the relation between Ksp and Kw. Let's see:

The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered as the reverse of the base dissociation of Fe(OH)3. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its conjugate acid (Fe³+) is a strong acid. The Ka for Fe³+ can be calculated using Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3. However, Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, so it can donate three OH⁻ ions. But this complicates things. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 is a very weak base (low solubility), its conjugate acid (Fe³+) is a strong acid. However, the exact value of Ka for Fe³+ hydrolysis is needed.

Looking up, the hydrolysis constant for Fe³+ (first step) is approximately Ka = 6.5×10^-3. Wait, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, using Ksp and Kw.

Let me try to calculate it. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻; Ksp = 6.3×10^-38

The reverse reaction is Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s); K = 1/Ksp

But the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is:

Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Kh

This can be considered as the combination of:

Fe³+ + OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)²+; K1

And H2O ⇌ H+ + OH⁻; Kw

But combining these, we get:

Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; Kh = K1 * Kw

But I'm not sure about K1. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between Ksp and Kh.

Alternatively, considering that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+; Kh

The equilibrium expression is Kh = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant (activity = 1), so Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But Kh is related to Ksp and Kw. Let's see:

From the dissolution reaction, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3

From the hydrolysis reaction, Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14, so [OH⁻] = Kw / [H+]

Substituting into Ksp:

Ksp = [Fe³+] (Kw / [H+])^3

Rearranging:

[H+]^3 = [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp

But from the hydrolysis reaction, Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = ( [Fe³+] Kw^3 / Ksp ) / [Fe³+] ) = Kw^3 / Ksp

Therefore, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ (1e-42) / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

So Kh ≈ 1.587e-5

But Kh is equal to [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

Wait, but in the hydrolysis reaction, if we consider the reaction Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, then Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But according to the calculation, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ 1.587e-5

Therefore, [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5

Given that [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M, we can solve for [H+]:

[H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7

Taking the cube root: [H+] ≈ (1.484e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M

Therefore, pH = -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

But wait, this seems a bit low. Let me check the calculations again.

First, Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

Then, [H+]^3 = Kh * [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7

Cube root of 1.484e-7: Let's compute 1.484e-7 = 1.484 × 10^-7

Cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3

Multiply by cube root of 1.484: cube root of 1.484 ≈ 1.14

So total [H+] ≈ 1.14 × 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.3e-3 M, which gives pH ≈ 2.28

This seems plausible. However, this assumes that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the only source of H+ ions. But we also added excess acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Wait, no. The acid added is exactly the stoichiometric amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

So the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, and the resulting solution contains Fe³+ and water. However, Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H+ ions. Therefore, the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But wait, if we added exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is consumed in the neutralization reaction, and the solution should be neutral? No, because Fe³+ is a strong acid (its conjugate base is weak), so it hydrolyzes to produce H+.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But let's confirm. The acid (H+) is used to neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3. The reaction consumes 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3, producing Fe³+ and water. The resulting solution contains Fe³+ ions and the counterion from the acid (e.g., Cl- if HCl is used). Since the acid is strong and monobasic, the counterion (Cl-) is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH. Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So the calculation above for pH ≈ 2.28 seems correct. However, let's check with another approach.

Alternatively, using the formula for pH of a solution of a metal ion that hydrolyzes:

pH = 0.5*(pKa - log C)

Where pKa is for the hydrolysis reaction, and C is the concentration of the metal ion.

But first, we need the pKa of Fe³+. From the previous calculation, we found that Kh = 1.587e-5, which corresponds to the reaction Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Kh = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]

Assuming that [Fe(OH)²+] ≈ [H+] = x, and [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356 (since x is small compared to 0.009356), then:

Kh ≈ x² / 0.009356 = 1.587e-5

Solving for x² = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7

x ≈ sqrt(1.484e-7) ≈ 3.85e-4 M

But this gives [H+] ≈ 3.85e-4 M, pH ≈ 3.41

Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Which one is correct?

Wait, there's confusion here. The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can occur in multiple steps. The first step is Fe³+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H+ (Ka1), and the second step is Fe(OH)²+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)2+ + H+ (Ka2), and the third step is Fe(OH)2+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + H+ (Ka3). However, the first hydrolysis step is the most significant contributor to acidity.

But earlier, when considering the overall reaction Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, we found Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp ≈ 1.587e-5, leading to [H+] ≈ 5.3e-3 M and pH ≈ 2.28. However, when considering only the first hydrolysis step and making the approximation that [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009356 M, we get [H+] ≈ 3.85e-4 M and pH ≈ 3.41.

This discrepancy arises because the first approach considers all three hydrolysis steps contributing to H+ production, while the second approach only considers the first step. In reality, the first hydrolysis step is the primary contributor, but subsequent steps also contribute, though to a lesser extent. However, the exact calculation requires knowing the individual Ka values for each step, which I might not have at hand.

Alternatively, using the value of Ka1 for Fe³+ hydrolysis. A quick check in standard references shows that the first hydrolysis constant (Ka1) for Fe³+ is approximately 6.5×10^-3. Let's use this value.

So, Ka1 = 6.5e-3 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]

Assuming x is the concentration of H+ and Fe(OH)²+:

6.5e-3 = x² / (0.009356 - x)

Assuming x << 0.009356, then:

x² ≈ 6.5e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 6.0814e-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.0814e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3 M

Then, [H+] ≈ 7.8e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.11

This is closer to the first calculation. However, this uses a different Ka value. It seems the discrepancy comes from different sources of Ka. Let's clarify.

If Ka1 is 6.5e-3, then the pH would be around 2.1. If using the Ksp-derived Kh, we get pH ≈ 2.28. If using the stepwise approach with only the first hydrolysis step and a different Ka, we get pH ≈ 2.11. These are all in the same ballpark, around pH 2.1 to 2.4.

However, to get an accurate answer, we need the correct value of Ka1 for Fe³+ hydrolysis. According to some sources, the first hydrolysis constant (pKa1) for Fe³+ is around 2.19, which would correspond to Ka1 ≈ 6.5e-3 (since pKa = -log(Ka), so Ka = 10^-2.19 ≈ 6.5e-3). Therefore, using Ka1 = 6.5e-3 is reasonable.

Using this, let's proceed:

Ka1 = 6.5e-3 = x² / (0.009356 - x)

Assuming x is not negligible compared to 0.009356, we can solve the quadratic equation:

x² = 6.5e-3 * (0.009356 - x)

x² + 6.5e-3 x - 6.5e-3 * 0.009356 = 0

Calculating the constant term:

6.5e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 6.0814e-5

So the equation is x² + 6.5e-3 x - 6.0814e-5 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-6.5e-3 ± sqrt((6.5e-3)^2 + 4*1*6.0814e-5)] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

(6.5e-3)^2 + 4*1*6.0814e-5 = 4.225e-5 + 2.43256e-4 = 2.85506e-4

sqrt(2.85506e-4) ≈ 0.0169

Thus,

x = [-6.5e-3 ± 0.0169]/2

Taking the positive root:

x = ( -6.5e-3 + 0.0169 ) / 2 ≈ (0.0104) / 2 ≈ 0.0052 M

So [H+] ≈ 0.0052 M, pH ≈ -log(0.0052) ≈ 2.28

This matches the initial calculation using the Ksp-derived Kh. Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

But wait, this seems inconsistent with the Ka1 value. If pKa1 is 2.19, then pH should be around 2.19 when [Fe³+] is 1 M. But here, [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M, so the pH would be lower than pKa1. Wait, no. The pH depends on the concentration. Let me think.

The pKa is a measure of the acid's strength. For a solution of Fe³+ in water, the pH can be estimated using the formula for a weak acid:

pH = 0.5*(pKa - log C)

Where C is the concentration of Fe³+.

Given pKa ≈ 2.19, C = 0.009356 M

pH = 0.5*(2.19 - log(0.009356)) = 0.5*(2.19 - (-2.03)) = 0.5*(4.22) = 2.11

This is close to the quadratic solution of 2.28, but there's a discrepancy. The exact value depends on the method used. However, given that the quadratic solution gave pH ≈ 2.28 and the approximation gives pH ≈ 2.11, the actual pH is likely around 2.2.

Considering the possible approximations and the given data, I'll proceed with the quadratic solution result of pH ≈ 2.28, which is approximately 2.3.

Therefore, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.3.

But let's check once more for any errors. The key steps are:

1. Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol
2. Moles of H+ needed: 3 × 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol
3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³
4. Concentration of Fe³+ in 100 cm³: 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M
5. Hydrolysis of Fe³+ leading to [H+] ≈ 0.0052 M, pH ≈ 2.28

All steps seem correct. Therefore, the answers are:

Minimum volume of acid: approximately 28.1 cm³

pH of resulting solution: approximately 2.28

Rounding to two decimal places, pH 2.28, and volume to one decimal place, 28.1 cm³. However, depending on significant figures. The given data has 0.1 g (two significant figures), 100 cm³ (two or three, ambiguous), 0.1 M (two). So the volume should be reported as 28 cm³ (two significant figures), and pH as 2.3 (two decimal places, but significant figures might be two as well). However, pH is typically reported to two decimal places when possible.

But let's check the original problem statement:

"We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?"

The data given:

- 0.1 g Fe(OH)3: two significant figures
- 100 cm³: ambiguous, could be two or three (if it's 100. cm³, then three)
- 0.1 M acid: two significant figures

Assuming 0.1 g and 0.1 M are two significant figures, and 100 cm³ is two, then the answers should be to two significant figures.

Volume: 28 cm³ (28.07 rounds to 28.1, but with two sig figs, it's 28 cm³)

pH: calculated as 2.28, which would be 2.3 (two significant figures)

However, sometimes pH is reported with more decimals, but given the input data, two significant figures are appropriate.

But wait, the molar mass calculation:

Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00, H: 1.008

Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*17.008 = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol

0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol (four sig figs, but 0.1 g is two, so it's 0.00094 mol, two sig figs)

Then moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.00094 = 0.0028 mol (two sig figs)

Volume: 0.0028 mol / 0.1 M = 0.028 L = 28 cm³ (two sig figs)

For pH, using 0.009356 M Fe³+ (but this is from 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L, which is three sig figs from the moles, but the original data is two sig figs. So perhaps the concentration is 0.0094 M (two sig figs). Then, using Ka1 = 6.5e-3 (two sig figs), the calculation would be:

Ka1 = 6.5e-3 = x² / (0.0094 - x)

Assuming x << 0.0094:

x² ≈ 6.5e-3 * 0.0094 ≈ 6.11e-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.11e-5) ≈ 0.00782 M

pH = -log(0.00782) ≈ 2.11

But with two sig figs, pH ≈ 2.1

However, this is inconsistent with the previous result. The discrepancy arises from the precision of the data. Given the input data has two significant figures, the pH should be reported to two decimal places but with two significant figures. However, pH is a logarithmic scale, and the number after the decimal is considered significant. For example, pH 2.1 is one decimal place but implies two significant figures. If the calculation gives pH 2.28 with two sig figs, it would be 2.3. But if the input data limits it to two sig figs, the pH might be reported as 2.3.

In conclusion, considering the data's significant figures, the answers are:

Minimum volume: 28 cm³

pH: 2.3

But I need to confirm once more. The moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol, which with two sig figs is 0.00094 mol. Then, moles H+ = 0.0028 mol. Volume = 0.0028 / 0.1 = 0.028 L = 28 cm³. For pH, using [Fe³+] = 0.0094 M and Ka1 = 6.5e-3, solving the quadratic:

x² + 6.5e-3 x - 6.5e-3 * 0.0094 = 0

x² + 0.0065x - 0.0000611 = 0

Discriminant: (0.0065)^2 + 4*1*0.0000611 ≈ 0.00004225 + 0.0002444 ≈ 0.00028665

sqrt(0.00028665) ≈ 0.01693

x = [-0.0065 + 0.01693]/2 ≈ 0.01043/2 ≈ 0.005215 M

pH = -log(0.005215) ≈ 2.28

Rounded to two significant figures, pH 2.3.

Therefore, the final answers are 28 cm³ and pH 2.3.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..." So, the total solution after adding acid and water is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume (V) plus the water volume equals 100 cm³. But when you add acid to water, the volumes are not strictly additive, but in dilute solutions, the approximation holds. However, since the problem is likely expecting a straightforward answer, we can proceed under the assumption that the acid volume is part of the 100 cm³ total. Wait, but the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume... of a 0.1 M... acid that is needed to prepare the solution". So, perhaps the acid is added to some water to make up 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid (V) is the amount needed to provide the H+ ions, and then the rest is water. So, the total volume is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume is V, and the rest (100 - V) cm³ is water. But the acid is 0.1 M, so the moles of H+ are 0.1 * V (in dm³). Wait, but V is in cm³, so 0.1 * (V/1000) = moles of H+.\n\nBut earlier, we calculated that we need 0.0028068 mol of H+ to neutralize the Fe(OH)3. Therefore, 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.0028068. Solving for V: V = (0.0028068 / 0.1) * 1000 = 28.068 cm³. So, the acid volume is approximately 28.07 cm³. Then, the total solution volume is 100 cm³, so the remaining volume (100 - 28.07 = 71.93 cm³) is water. However, when you mix 28.07 cm³ of acid with 71.93 cm³ of water, the total volume might not be exactly 100 cm³ due to volume contraction or expansion, but the problem likely ignores this and assumes additive volumes. Therefore, the answer for the minimum volume of acid is approximately 28.1 cm³.\n\nNow, moving on to the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ ions. Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThis hydrolysis releases H+ ions, making the solution acidic. To calculate the pH, we need to determine the concentration of H+ from this hydrolysis.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The total solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 dm³). The moles of Fe³+ are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, which is 0.0009356 mol. Therefore, [Fe³+] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.009356 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be represented in steps, but the first hydrolysis step is the most significant:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant, Ka, which is related to the hydrolysis constant. The value of Ka for Fe³+ can be found in tables. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its conjugate acid (Fe³+) will have a Ka. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known, which is the solubility product. Let\'s recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. However, the relationship between Ksp and the hydrolysis constant (Ka) is as follows:\n\nFor the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.\n\nBut the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the reverse of the dissolution of Fe(OH)3. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this hydrolysis reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+]. Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its activity is 1, so K = [H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+]. But K can also be related to Ksp and Kw. Since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 and Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14. Therefore, rearranging Ksp: [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+]. Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH⁻] = Kw / ( (Ksp / [Fe³+])^(1/3) ). Therefore, [H+] = Kw / ( (Ksp / [Fe³+])^(1/3) ) = Kw * ( [Fe³+] / Ksp )^(1/3 )\n\nTaking the cube root:\n\n[H+] = ( Kw^3 * [Fe³+] / Ksp )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let\'s consider the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nBut K can be found using the relationship between Ksp and Kw. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.\n\nThe reverse reaction is Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ↔ Fe(OH)3(s), with K = 1/Ksp.\n\nBut the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.\n\nThis can be considered as the combination of the reverse dissolution reaction and the autoionization of water:\n\nFe³+ + 3OH⁻ ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) (K = 1/Ksp)\n\nand\n\n3H2O ↔ 3H3O+ + 3OH⁻ (K = (Kw)^3)\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H3O+\n\nThe overall K is (1/Ksp) * (Kw)^3 = ( (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp\n\nBut since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, the expression becomes K = [H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3) / Ksp\n\nTherefore, K = (1e-14)^3 / (6.3e-38) ≈ (1e-42) / (6.3e-38) ≈ 1.58e-5\n\nSo, K ≈ 1.58e-5\n\nTherefore, the expression is [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.58e-5\n\nWe know [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M. Let\'s plug that in:\n\n[H+]^3 = 1.58e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.58e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ (1.58 * 9.356) e-8 ≈ 14.78e-8 ≈ 1.478e-7\n\nTaking the cube root:\n\n[H+] ≈ (1.478e-7)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 1.478e-7 = 1.478 * 10^-7\n\nThe cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3\n\nMultiply by cube root of 1.478 ≈ 1.14\n\nSo, [H+] ≈ 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.29e-3 M\n\nTherefore, pH = -log(5.29e-3) ≈ 2.28\n\nBut let\'s check this calculation more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute 1.58e-5 * 0.009356:\n\n1.58e-5 * 0.009356 = 1.58 * 0.009356 * 1e-5 = 0.01478 * 1e-5 = 1.478e-7\n\nSo, [H+]^3 = 1.478e-7\n\nCube root of 1.478e-7:\n\nFirst, express 1.478e-7 as 147.8e-9. The cube root of 147.8 is approximately 5.28 (since 5^3=125, 5.3^3=148. So, cube root of 147.8 ≈ 5.28). Then, cube root of 1e-9 is 1e-3. Therefore, cube root of 147.8e-9 ≈ 5.28e-3. So, [H+] ≈ 5.28e-3 M. Then, pH = -log(5.28e-3) ≈ 2.28.\n\nAlternatively, using calculator:\n\nlog(5.28e-3) = log(5.28) + log(1e-3) ≈ 0.723 + (-3) = -2.277, so pH ≈ 2.277 ≈ 2.28.\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut wait, let\'s verify if this approach is correct. The assumption here is that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the main source of H+ ions. However, in the solution, we also have H+ ions from the acid added. Wait, but in the neutralization reaction, we added just enough H+ to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. The H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction to form Fe³+ and water. Therefore, the only H+ present in the solution after dissolution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nBut wait, when we add the acid (H+ ions) to Fe(OH)3, the H+ reacts with OH- from Fe(OH)3 to form water. The stoichiometric amount of H+ added is exactly enough to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, converting it into Fe³+ and water. Therefore, the solution after neutralization should contain Fe³+ ions and the counterion from the acid (e.g., Cl- if HCl is used), but since the acid is strong and monobasic, the counterion is a spectator ion and doesn\'t affect the pH. Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nTherefore, the calculation above for pH ≈ 2.28 is correct.\n\nBut let\'s cross-validate. Suppose we have 0.009356 M Fe³+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+.\n\nThe Ka for Fe³+ is given by Ka = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]\n\nBut the value of Ka for Fe³+ is approximately 6.3e-3 (different sources may vary, but let\'s check). Wait, perhaps I confused Ksp with Ka earlier. Let me check standard values.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 2.79e-39 (but values can vary depending on the source and the form of Fe(OH)3; amorphous vs. crystalline). However, earlier I used 6.3e-38, which might be incorrect. Let me verify.\n\nWait, according to some sources, the solubility product (Ksp) for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38. However, other sources might report different values. For example, the CRC Handbook lists different Ksp values for different forms: for amorphous Fe(OH)3, Ksp ≈ 2.79×10^-39, and for crystalline Fe(OH)3, Ksp ≈ 1×10^-36. The exact value can affect the calculation. Let\'s proceed with the value given in the problem or as per standard data. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, perhaps we need to use the Ksp value to derive the hydrolysis constant.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 as 6.3×10^-38, then:\n\nKw = 1e-14\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction\'s K is Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5, which is approximately 1.59e-5, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, using this K, we have:\n\n[H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.59e-5\n\n[H+]^3 = 1.59e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.487e-7\n\n[H+] ≈ (1.487e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M\n\npH ≈ -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28\n\nAlternatively, if we use a different Ksp, say 1e-36, then K = (1e-14)^3 / 1e-36 = 1e-42 / 1e-36 = 1e-6\n\nThen, [H+]^3 = 1e-6 * 0.009356 ≈ 9.356e-9\n\n[H+] ≈ (9.356e-9)^(1/3) ≈ 2.1e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.68\n\nBut since the problem doesn\'t specify the Ksp, perhaps we need to use the one that\'s commonly referenced. If the Ksp is 6.3e-38, then pH ≈ 2.28. However, if the Ksp is higher (more soluble), the pH would be higher (less acidic). Given that Fe(OH)3 is a very insoluble compound, the Ksp is very small, so using 6.3e-38 is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut let\'s check another approach. The concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions. For each Fe³+ ion, it can produce up to 3 H+ ions, but the hydrolysis occurs in steps. The first hydrolysis step is the most significant:\n\nFe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa1 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]\n\nThe value of Ka1 for Fe³+ is approximately 6.3e-3 (from some sources). Wait, if Ka1 is 6.3e-3, then:\n\nKa1 = 6.3e-3 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]\n\nAssuming that [H+] ≈ [Fe(OH)²+] (since each Fe³+ that hydrolyzes releases one H+), and let x be the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis. Then:\n\n6.3e-3 = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.009356, we can approximate 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356:\n\n6.3e-3 ≈ x² / 0.009356\n\nx² ≈ 6.3e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 5.89e-5\n\nx ≈ sqrt(5.89e-5) ≈ 7.67e-3 M\n\nThen, [H+] ≈ 7.67e-3 M, pH ≈ -log(7.67e-3) ≈ 2.11\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result. Which approach is correct?\n\nThe discrepancy arises from using different values of Ka. If we use the Ka1 value of Fe³+ as 6.3e-3 (from some sources), we get a different pH. However, the earlier approach using Ksp and Kw gives a different result. This suggests that the problem might require using the Ksp approach, as the hydrolysis constant can be related to Ksp and Kw.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrolysis and consider that the solution is neutral, but that can\'t be right because Fe³+ is a strong hydrolyzing ion. However, if the problem assumes that after neutralization, the solution is simply Fe³+ in water with the counterion, and we need to account for the H+ from hydrolysis.\n\nBut given the two different methods yielding different pH values, there\'s ambiguity. However, the first method using Ksp and Kw is more thermodynamically consistent, as it relates the solubility product with the hydrolysis. The second method using a literature Ka1 value might be more empirical. Since the problem doesn\'t provide specific constants, perhaps we need to proceed with the Ksp approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution is simply Fe(NO3)3 or FeCl3, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nBut without the exact Ka value, it\'s challenging. However, given that FeCl3 solutions are known to be quite acidic, with pH around 2-3 for moderate concentrations. Our calculated pH of ~2.28 using the Ksp method aligns with that. The other method using Ka1=6.3e-3 gives pH≈2.11, which is also in the same ballpark.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely expecting a calculation based on Ksp and Kw, let\'s stick with the first method. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.28.\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, let\'s redo the calculation step-by-step.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Ksp of Fe(OH)3 = 6.3×10^-38\n- Kw = 1.0×10^-14\n- [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M\n\nHydrolysis reaction: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+\n\nEquilibrium constant K = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nSo, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5\n\nTherefore, [H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7\n\n[H+] = (1.484e-7)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root:\n\n1.484e-7 = 1.484 × 10^-7\n\nCube root of 1.484 ≈ 1.14 (since 1.1^3=1.331, 1.14^3≈1.48)\n\nCube root of 10^-7 = 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64 × 10^-3\n\nMultiply them: 1.14 × 4.64 × 10^-3 ≈ 5.29 × 10^-3 M\n\npH = -log(5.29e-3) ≈ 2.28\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum volume of acid required is \\boxed{28.1} cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is \\boxed{2.28}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447796, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4862, prompt_tokens=813, total_tokens=5675, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of total volume using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**:
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

2. **Determine moles of H⁺ required**:
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol

3. **Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid needed**:
   - Volume = moles / concentration = 0.0028068 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.028068 dm³ = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution**:
   - Concentration of Fe³⁺ in solution = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.009356 M
   - Hydrolysis reaction: Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O ↔ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H₃O⁺
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ (6.3×10⁻³⁸) and Kw (1.0×10⁻¹⁴):
     - K = (Kw³) / Ksp = (1e-14)³ / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5
     - [H⁺]³ = K × [Fe³⁺] = 1.587e-5 × 0.009356 ≈ 1.484e-7
     - [H⁺] ≈ (1.484e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.29e-3 M
     - pH = -log(5.29e-3) ≈ 2.28

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

However, perhaps the problem assumes that the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution, meaning the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume is part of that 100 cm³. Wait, the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..." So, the total solution after adding acid and water is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume (V) plus the water volume equals 100 cm³. But when you add acid to water, the volumes are not strictly additive, but in dilute solutions, the approximation holds. However, since the problem is likely expecting a straightforward answer, we can proceed under the assumption that the acid volume is part of the 100 cm³ total. Wait, but the problem says "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume... of a 0.1 M... acid that is needed to prepare the solution". So, perhaps the acid is added to some water to make up 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid (V) is the amount needed to provide the H+ ions, and then the rest is water. So, the total volume is 100 cm³. Therefore, the acid volume is V, and the rest (100 - V) cm³ is water. But the acid is 0.1 M, so the moles of H+ are 0.1 * V (in dm³). Wait, but V is in cm³, so 0.1 * (V/1000) = moles of H+.

But earlier, we calculated that we need 0.0028068 mol of H+ to neutralize the Fe(OH)3. Therefore, 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.0028068. Solving for V: V = (0.0028068 / 0.1) * 1000 = 28.068 cm³. So, the acid volume is approximately 28.07 cm³. Then, the total solution volume is 100 cm³, so the remaining volume (100 - 28.07 = 71.93 cm³) is water. However, when you mix 28.07 cm³ of acid with 71.93 cm³ of water, the total volume might not be exactly 100 cm³ due to volume contraction or expansion, but the problem likely ignores this and assumes additive volumes. Therefore, the answer for the minimum volume of acid is approximately 28.1 cm³.

Now, moving on to the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ ions. Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

This hydrolysis releases H+ ions, making the solution acidic. To calculate the pH, we need to determine the concentration of H+ from this hydrolysis.

First, calculate the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The total solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 dm³). The moles of Fe³+ are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, which is 0.0009356 mol. Therefore, [Fe³+] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.009356 M.

The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be represented in steps, but the first hydrolysis step is the most significant:

Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant, Ka, which is related to the hydrolysis constant. The value of Ka for Fe³+ can be found in tables. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its conjugate acid (Fe³+) will have a Ka. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known, which is the solubility product. Let's recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38 at 25°C. However, the relationship between Ksp and the hydrolysis constant (Ka) is as follows:

For the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.

But the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the reverse of the dissolution of Fe(OH)3. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.

The equilibrium constant for this hydrolysis reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+]. Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its activity is 1, so K = [H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+]. But K can also be related to Ksp and Kw. Since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 and Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1e-14. Therefore, rearranging Ksp: [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+]. Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH⁻] = Kw / ( (Ksp / [Fe³+])^(1/3) ). Therefore, [H+] = Kw / ( (Ksp / [Fe³+])^(1/3) ) = Kw * ( [Fe³+] / Ksp )^(1/3 )

Taking the cube root:

[H+] = ( Kw^3 * [Fe³+] / Ksp )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But K can be found using the relationship between Ksp and Kw. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.

The reverse reaction is Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ↔ Fe(OH)3(s), with K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+.

This can be considered as the combination of the reverse dissolution reaction and the autoionization of water:

Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) (K = 1/Ksp)

and

3H2O ↔ 3H3O+ + 3OH⁻ (K = (Kw)^3)

Adding these two equations:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H3O+

The overall K is (1/Ksp) * (Kw)^3 = ( (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, the expression becomes K = [H3O+]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3) / Ksp

Therefore, K = (1e-14)^3 / (6.3e-38) ≈ (1e-42) / (6.3e-38) ≈ 1.58e-5

So, K ≈ 1.58e-5

Therefore, the expression is [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.58e-5

We know [Fe³+] is 0.009356 M. Let's plug that in:

[H+]^3 = 1.58e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.58e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ (1.58 * 9.356) e-8 ≈ 14.78e-8 ≈ 1.478e-7

Taking the cube root:

[H+] ≈ (1.478e-7)^(1/3)

Calculating that:

First, 1.478e-7 = 1.478 * 10^-7

The cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3

Multiply by cube root of 1.478 ≈ 1.14

So, [H+] ≈ 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.29e-3 M

Therefore, pH = -log(5.29e-3) ≈ 2.28

But let's check this calculation more accurately.

First, compute 1.58e-5 * 0.009356:

1.58e-5 * 0.009356 = 1.58 * 0.009356 * 1e-5 = 0.01478 * 1e-5 = 1.478e-7

So, [H+]^3 = 1.478e-7

Cube root of 1.478e-7:

First, express 1.478e-7 as 147.8e-9. The cube root of 147.8 is approximately 5.28 (since 5^3=125, 5.3^3=148. So, cube root of 147.8 ≈ 5.28). Then, cube root of 1e-9 is 1e-3. Therefore, cube root of 147.8e-9 ≈ 5.28e-3. So, [H+] ≈ 5.28e-3 M. Then, pH = -log(5.28e-3) ≈ 2.28.

Alternatively, using calculator:

log(5.28e-3) = log(5.28) + log(1e-3) ≈ 0.723 + (-3) = -2.277, so pH ≈ 2.277 ≈ 2.28.

Therefore, the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

But wait, let's verify if this approach is correct. The assumption here is that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is the main source of H+ ions. However, in the solution, we also have H+ ions from the acid added. Wait, but in the neutralization reaction, we added just enough H+ to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. The H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction to form Fe³+ and water. Therefore, the only H+ present in the solution after dissolution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But wait, when we add the acid (H+ ions) to Fe(OH)3, the H+ reacts with OH- from Fe(OH)3 to form water. The stoichiometric amount of H+ added is exactly enough to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, converting it into Fe³+ and water. Therefore, the solution after neutralization should contain Fe³+ ions and the counterion from the acid (e.g., Cl- if HCl is used), but since the acid is strong and monobasic, the counterion is a spectator ion and doesn't affect the pH. Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Therefore, the calculation above for pH ≈ 2.28 is correct.

But let's cross-validate. Suppose we have 0.009356 M Fe³+.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+.

The Ka for Fe³+ is given by Ka = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]

But the value of Ka for Fe³+ is approximately 6.3e-3 (different sources may vary, but let's check). Wait, perhaps I confused Ksp with Ka earlier. Let me check standard values.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 2.79e-39 (but values can vary depending on the source and the form of Fe(OH)3; amorphous vs. crystalline). However, earlier I used 6.3e-38, which might be incorrect. Let me verify.

Wait, according to some sources, the solubility product (Ksp) for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38. However, other sources might report different values. For example, the CRC Handbook lists different Ksp values for different forms: for amorphous Fe(OH)3, Ksp ≈ 2.79×10^-39, and for crystalline Fe(OH)3, Ksp ≈ 1×10^-36. The exact value can affect the calculation. Let's proceed with the value given in the problem or as per standard data. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we need to use the Ksp value to derive the hydrolysis constant.

Alternatively, if we use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 as 6.3×10^-38, then:

Kw = 1e-14

The hydrolysis reaction's K is Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5, which is approximately 1.59e-5, as calculated earlier.

Therefore, using this K, we have:

[H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.59e-5

[H+]^3 = 1.59e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.487e-7

[H+] ≈ (1.487e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M

pH ≈ -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

Alternatively, if we use a different Ksp, say 1e-36, then K = (1e-14)^3 / 1e-36 = 1e-42 / 1e-36 = 1e-6

Then, [H+]^3 = 1e-6 * 0.009356 ≈ 9.356e-9

[H+] ≈ (9.356e-9)^(1/3) ≈ 2.1e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.68

But since the problem doesn't specify the Ksp, perhaps we need to use the one that's commonly referenced. If the Ksp is 6.3e-38, then pH ≈ 2.28. However, if the Ksp is higher (more soluble), the pH would be higher (less acidic). Given that Fe(OH)3 is a very insoluble compound, the Ksp is very small, so using 6.3e-38 is reasonable.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

But let's check another approach. The concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009356 M. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions. For each Fe³+ ion, it can produce up to 3 H+ ions, but the hydrolysis occurs in steps. The first hydrolysis step is the most significant:

Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka1 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]

The value of Ka1 for Fe³+ is approximately 6.3e-3 (from some sources). Wait, if Ka1 is 6.3e-3, then:

Ka1 = 6.3e-3 = [Fe(OH)²+][H+]/[Fe³+]

Assuming that [H+] ≈ [Fe(OH)²+] (since each Fe³+ that hydrolyzes releases one H+), and let x be the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis. Then:

6.3e-3 = (x)(x) / (0.009356 - x)

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.009356, we can approximate 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356:

6.3e-3 ≈ x² / 0.009356

x² ≈ 6.3e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 5.89e-5

x ≈ sqrt(5.89e-5) ≈ 7.67e-3 M

Then, [H+] ≈ 7.67e-3 M, pH ≈ -log(7.67e-3) ≈ 2.11

But this contradicts the previous result. Which approach is correct?

The discrepancy arises from using different values of Ka. If we use the Ka1 value of Fe³+ as 6.3e-3 (from some sources), we get a different pH. However, the earlier approach using Ksp and Kw gives a different result. This suggests that the problem might require using the Ksp approach, as the hydrolysis constant can be related to Ksp and Kw.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrolysis and consider that the solution is neutral, but that can't be right because Fe³+ is a strong hydrolyzing ion. However, if the problem assumes that after neutralization, the solution is simply Fe³+ in water with the counterion, and we need to account for the H+ from hydrolysis.

But given the two different methods yielding different pH values, there's ambiguity. However, the first method using Ksp and Kw is more thermodynamically consistent, as it relates the solubility product with the hydrolysis. The second method using a literature Ka1 value might be more empirical. Since the problem doesn't provide specific constants, perhaps we need to proceed with the Ksp approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution is simply Fe(NO3)3 or FeCl3, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But without the exact Ka value, it's challenging. However, given that FeCl3 solutions are known to be quite acidic, with pH around 2-3 for moderate concentrations. Our calculated pH of ~2.28 using the Ksp method aligns with that. The other method using Ka1=6.3e-3 gives pH≈2.11, which is also in the same ballpark.

Given that the problem is likely expecting a calculation based on Ksp and Kw, let's stick with the first method. Therefore, pH ≈ 2.28.

But to ensure accuracy, let's redo the calculation step-by-step.

Given:

- Ksp of Fe(OH)3 = 6.3×10^-38
- Kw = 1.0×10^-14
- [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M

Hydrolysis reaction: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H3O+

Equilibrium constant K = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

So, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5

Therefore, [H+]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009356 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.356e-3 ≈ 1.484e-7

[H+] = (1.484e-7)^(1/3)

Calculating the cube root:

1.484e-7 = 1.484 × 10^-7

Cube root of 1.484 ≈ 1.14 (since 1.1^3=1.331, 1.14^3≈1.48)

Cube root of 10^-7 = 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64 × 10^-3

Multiply them: 1.14 × 4.64 × 10^-3 ≈ 5.29 × 10^-3 M

pH = -log(5.29e-3) ≈ 2.28

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

In conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.
