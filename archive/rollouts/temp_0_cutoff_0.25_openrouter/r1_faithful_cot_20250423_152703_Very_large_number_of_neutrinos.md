# Original Question

Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

Let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)
(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)

The pp-III branch in the Sun's core produces boron-8 (B-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to ~15 MeV. If this branch stops, B-8 neutrino production ceases. The 8.5-minute delay corresponds to the light travel time from the Sun to Earth, meaning neutrinos detected now reflect the shutdown state. 

**Key points:**
1. **Be-7 Neutrinos (pp-II branch):** The Be-7 electron capture produces a monoenergetic neutrino line at **861 keV**, which falls entirely within **band 2 (800–900 keV)**. This flux remains unaffected since the pp-II branch continues.
2. **B-8 Neutrinos (pp-III branch):** These neutrinos are eliminated. Their contribution to the **700–800 keV (band 1)** and **800–900 keV (band 2)** ranges is negligible compared to Be-7, even before shutdown.
3. **Other Sources:** The pp and CNO neutrinos contribute minimally to these energy bands. The pp neutrinos (<420 keV) are too low, and CNO neutrinos (mostly >1 MeV) have negligible flux in these ranges.

**Conclusion:**  
Band 1 (700–800 keV) has no significant neutrino flux after the shutdown, while band 2 (800–900 keV) retains the full Be-7 neutrino flux. The ratio **Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2)** is approximately **0**.

**Answer:**  
\boxed{0}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the neutrino fluxes between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the pp-III branch is. 

From what I remember, the Sun's energy production comes primarily from the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions. There are different branches in the pp chain: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. Each branch has different reactions and produces neutrinos with different energy spectra. 

The pp-III branch, if I'm not mistaken, is part of the chain that involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus combines with a helium-4 nucleus to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then undergoes beta-plus decay to produce a high-energy neutrino. Wait, no, maybe that's the pp-II or pp-III. Let me get this straight. 

The main branches are:

1. **pp-I**: This is the primary branch where two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4, two protons. The neutrinos here are from the initial pp fusion, which have lower energies, up to about 0.42 MeV.

2. **pp-II**: This branch involves He-3 reacting with He-4 to form Be-7. Then Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then combines with a proton to form two He-4. The neutrinos here are from the electron capture in Be-7, which have a monoenergetic line around 0.86 MeV (861 keV).

3. **pp-III**: This is the branch where Be-7 captures a proton instead, forming B-8, which then beta-decays into Be-8*, emitting a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 decay produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, with a peak around 6-7 MeV. Wait, but the question is about 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Those are lower energies. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the branches.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact reactions. Let me think again. The pp-III branch is the one that produces boron-8 neutrinos. The B-8 decay produces the highest energy solar neutrinos, with a maximum energy around 15 MeV. But the energy bands in the question are 700-900 keV, which is 0.7-0.9 MeV. That's much lower. So maybe the pp-III branch isn't the main source of neutrinos in that energy range. 

Wait, but the pp-III branch produces B-8 neutrinos, which have higher energies. The lower energy neutrinos come from the pp fusion (pp-I) and the Be-7 electron capture (pp-II). So if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the high-energy neutrinos (like the B-8 ones) would stop, but the lower energy ones (pp and Be-7) would continue. But the question is about the flux ratio between 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. 

Wait, but the Be-7 neutrinos are monoenergetic at 861 keV. So that's in the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The pp neutrinos have a continuous spectrum up to about 420 keV, so they don't contribute to either band. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum up to 15 MeV, but their flux is much lower. However, if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be produced. But the Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) would still be there. 

Wait, but the pp-III branch is the one that produces B-8. So if pp-III stops, B-8 production stops. But the Be-7 from pp-II would still produce the 861 keV neutrinos. So the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would have the Be-7 neutrinos, which are at 861 keV. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) would have... what? The pp neutrinos only go up to 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The B-8 neutrinos, which are higher energy, but if pp-III is stopped, those are gone. Wait, but maybe there are other sources? 

Wait, the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III is stopped, but pp-I, pp-II, and CNO continue. But the CNO neutrinos are higher energy than the pp ones, but their flux in the Sun is much lower compared to the pp chain. 

But the energy bands in question are 0.7-0.9 MeV. The Be-7 neutrinos are at 0.861 MeV, so that's in band 2. The pp neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV, so they don't reach 0.7 MeV. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum that starts from lower energies? Wait, no. The B-8 decay produces a beta spectrum with a maximum energy around 15 MeV, but the average is lower. But even the lowest energy B-8 neutrinos would be above 0 MeV, but the spectrum is continuous. However, the flux of B-8 neutrinos is much lower than the Be-7 and pp neutrinos. 

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 production stops. So the only neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be the Be-7 neutrinos at 0.861 MeV, which are all in band 2 (800-900 keV). So band 1 (700-800 keV) would have no neutrinos from Be-7, because that's below 800 keV. Wait, 0.861 MeV is 861 keV, which is in band 2. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV. The Be-7 line is at 0.861 MeV, so it's in band 2. Therefore, if pp-III is stopped, the B-8 neutrinos (which have higher energies) are gone, but the Be-7 neutrinos remain. 

But wait, the B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum. So even though their maximum is 15 MeV, their flux at lower energies (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) might be non-zero. But how significant is that? 

Wait, the B-8 neutrino spectrum: the decay is B-8 → Be-8* + e+ + ν_e. The maximum neutrino energy is around 15 MeV, but the spectrum is a continuous distribution. The number of neutrinos decreases with decreasing energy. So at lower energies (like 0.7-0.9 MeV), the flux from B-8 would be very low compared to the Be-7 line. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 production stops. So the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be present. Therefore, in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, the only neutrinos would be the Be-7 line at 0.861 MeV. So in band 1 (700-800 keV), there would be no neutrinos from Be-7 (since 0.861 MeV is 861 keV, which is in band 2). The pp neutrinos don't reach that high. The CNO neutrinos might have some in that range, but their flux is much lower. 

Wait, but the question says "all other reactions remained as they were". So pp-I and pp-II are still active. The pp-III is stopped. So the Be-7 from pp-II would still produce the 0.861 MeV neutrinos. The B-8 from pp-III would stop. 

Therefore, in band 1 (700-800 keV), there are no neutrinos from Be-7 (since that's at 861 keV), and the B-8 neutrinos are gone. The pp neutrinos only go up to 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, but their flux is negligible compared to the pp chain. So in band 1, the flux would be almost zero. In band 2, the flux would be the Be-7 line. 

But wait, the Be-7 line is a single energy, so all the neutrinos are at 861 keV. Therefore, in band 2 (800-900 keV), which includes 861 keV, the flux would be the full flux of Be-7 neutrinos. In band 1 (700-800 keV), there's nothing. So the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be approximately zero. 

But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The pp-III branch is responsible for B-8 production. If it's stopped, then B-8 neutrinos stop. The Be-7 neutrinos are from the pp-II branch, which is still active. The Be-7 electron capture produces a neutrino at 861 keV. So all the neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would be from Be-7, and band 1 (700-800 keV) would have no neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio would be zero. 

But the question says "approximate ratio". However, maybe there's another source. Let me think again. Are there any other neutrino sources in those energy bands? 

The pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) produces a neutrino at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than both bands. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with higher energies as well. The hep neutrinos are very high energy but extremely low flux. 

Wait, the pp reaction produces neutrinos up to 0.42 MeV, which is 420 keV, so below both bands. The Be-7 is at 861 keV. The B-8 has a continuous spectrum up to 15 MeV. So in the 700-800 keV range, the only possible contribution would be from the lower end of the B-8 spectrum. But if pp-III is stopped, then B-8 isn't produced, so those neutrinos are gone. 

Therefore, in band 1, there are no neutrinos. In band 2, there's the Be-7 line. So the ratio would be zero. But the answer can't be zero. Maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, but the time factor: the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the time delay is the light travel time from the Sun to Earth, which is about 8.3 minutes. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the core would have already passed Earth, and the ones we're detecting now would be from after the shutdown. Wait, no. Let's think. 

The Sun is about 8.3 light-minutes away. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the light (and neutrinos) from the moment it stopped would just now be arriving. So the neutrinos we receive now (at the time of the question) are those that were produced 8.5 minutes ago in the Sun's core. But if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the production of B-8 would have ceased 8.5 minutes ago. However, the B-8 has a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So any B-8 produced would decay almost immediately. Therefore, the B-8 neutrinos we receive now would have been produced in the last fraction of a second before the shutdown. But since the shutdown was 8.5 minutes ago, the B-8 neutrinos would have already passed Earth. So after the shutdown, no more B-8 is produced, so the B-8 neutrino flux would drop to zero after the light travel time. 

But the question is about the flux now, 8.5 minutes after the shutdown. So the B-8 neutrinos would have already stopped arriving, because the production stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and the travel time is 8.5 minutes. So the B-8 neutrinos we receive now would be from after the shutdown, but since the shutdown stopped production, there are no B-8 neutrinos arriving now. 

Therefore, the current flux of B-8 neutrinos is zero. The Be-7 neutrinos, which are from the pp-II branch, which is still active, would still be arriving. The Be-7 has a longer half-life? Wait, Be-7 in the Sun is produced in the pp-II branch. Let me check. 

In the pp-II branch, He-3 + He-4 → Be-7. Then Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then reacts with a proton to form two He-4. The electron capture of Be-7 has a half-life of about 53 days. So the Be-7 in the Sun's core would have a much longer lifetime compared to the solar fusion timescales. Therefore, the production of Be-7 would continue as part of the pp-II branch, and the electron capture would happen over a longer period. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, which is the branch where Be-7 captures a proton to form B-8, then the Be-7 would not be consumed by that reaction. So more Be-7 would be available for the pp-II branch. Wait, but the pp-II and pp-III branches are alternatives. The Be-7 can either capture an electron (pp-II) or capture a proton (pp-III). If pp-III is stopped, then all Be-7 would go through pp-II. 

But the pp-II branch's Be-7 electron capture has a half-life of 53 days, so the neutrinos from Be-7 are produced over a longer time. However, the Sun's core is dense enough that the electron capture rate is faster due to the high electron density. Wait, but in reality, the solar Be-7 electron capture occurs at a rate determined by the density and temperature, not just the half-life. So in the Sun, the Be-7 is consumed quickly via either electron capture (pp-II) or proton capture (pp-III). If pp-III is stopped, then all Be-7 would go through electron capture, increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. 

But the question states that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The Be-7 that was previously being used in pp-III is now being used in pp-II. However, the timescale for the pp-II branch is much longer (due to the 53-day half-life), but in the Sun's core, the electron capture is accelerated. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. 

In the Sun, the Be-7 produced in the pp-II branch can either capture an electron (pp-II) or a proton (pp-III). The rate of these reactions depends on the density and temperature. If the pp-III branch is suddenly stopped, perhaps because the proton capture rate drops to zero, then all Be-7 would undergo electron capture. However, the electron capture rate in the Sun's core is actually quite fast because of the high electron density. The actual lifetime of Be-7 in the Sun is much shorter than 53 days. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, the Be-7 that would have gone into B-8 via proton capture now remains and undergoes electron capture. But since the electron capture is already part of the pp-II branch, which is still active, the flux of Be-7 neutrinos would increase because more Be-7 is available. Wait, but the pp-III branch is a separate path. The production of Be-7 is from He-3 + He-4. If pp-III is stopped, then the Be-7 isn't being consumed by proton capture, so more Be-7 would accumulate until it starts undergoing electron capture. But the timescale for this might be longer than 8.5 minutes. 

Wait, but the problem states that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The neutrinos we receive now are from the core 8.5 minutes ago. So if the shutdown happened 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced after the shutdown (which would be the current ones arriving) would reflect the state of the core after the shutdown. 

But the Be-7 neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch. If the pp-III branch is stopped, then the Be-7 that would have gone into B-8 is now available for electron capture. However, the timescale for the Be-7 to undergo electron capture is important. If the electron capture is fast (which it is in the Sun's core), then the Be-7 would start producing more neutrinos via pp-II. But since the shutdown was only 8.5 minutes ago, which is much shorter than the 53-day half-life, but in the Sun's core, the actual rate is much faster. 

Wait, but the electron capture rate in the Sun's core for Be-7 is determined by the electron density. The solar core's electron density is about 10^26 cm^-3. The electron capture rate is proportional to the electron density. The laboratory half-life of Be-7 is 53 days, but in the Sun, the density is so high that the rate is much higher. Let me check the approximate lifetime. 

The formula for the electron capture rate is λ = ln(2) / t_1/2 * (n_e / n_0), where n_0 is the density in the lab. Wait, no, the actual rate is given by λ = n_e * σ * v, where σ is the cross-section and v is the velocity. But I'm not sure of the exact numbers. However, I recall that in the Sun, the Be-7 electron capture occurs on a timescale of about a few hundred days, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the timescale is shorter. 

If the Be-7 in the Sun has a lifetime of, say, a few weeks, then 8.5 minutes is negligible. So the amount of Be-7 that would have decayed via electron capture in 8.5 minutes would be very small. Therefore, even if the pp-III branch is stopped, the increase in Be-7 neutrino flux would be negligible. Therefore, the Be-7 neutrino flux would remain roughly the same as before. 

But wait, the production rate of Be-7 is from He-3 + He-4. If the pp-III branch is stopped, then the Be-7 isn't being consumed by proton capture, so the Be-7 abundance would increase over time. But again, 8.5 minutes is too short for significant accumulation. 

Therefore, the main point is that the B-8 neutrinos (from pp-III) would stop arriving, but the Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) would remain. The B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum, but in the 700-900 keV range, their flux is negligible compared to the Be-7 line. 

Wait, but the B-8 neutrino spectrum does have some flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. Let me check the approximate flux. The B-8 neutrino flux is about 5% of the total solar neutrino flux. The Be-7 flux is about 10% (but I need to check exact numbers). 

Wait, the standard solar model fluxes are approximately:

- pp: ~6×10^10 cm^-2 s^-1

- pep: ~1.4×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1

- Be-7: ~5×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1

- B-8: ~5×10^6 cm^-2 s^-1

- CNO: ~5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1

So the B-8 flux is much lower than Be-7. The Be-7 flux is about 5×10^9, and B-8 is 5×10^6. So even if B-8 has some flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, it's negligible compared to Be-7. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, the B-8 flux drops to zero. The Be-7 flux remains. So in the 800-900 keV band (band 2), the flux is dominated by Be-7. In the 700-800 keV band (band 1), there's no Be-7 (since it's at 861 keV), and the B-8 flux is gone. The only other possible source is the pep neutrinos at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than both bands. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies as well. 

Therefore, the flux in band 1 would be zero, and band 2 would have the Be-7 flux. So the ratio would be zero. But the problem says "approximate ratio". Maybe there's a small contribution from other sources, but they are negligible. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing that the B-8 decay produces some neutrinos in the lower energy range. Let's consider the B-8 neutrino spectrum. The B-8 decay has a maximum neutrino energy of about 15 MeV, but the spectrum is continuous. The number of neutrinos decreases with energy. The differential flux (number per energy interval) peaks at lower energies. However, even so, the total flux of B-8 is much lower than Be-7. 

For example, the B-8 neutrino flux is about 5×10^6 cm^-2 s^-1, while Be-7 is 5×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1. So even if a fraction of B-8 neutrinos are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, their contribution would be negligible compared to Be-7. 

But if the pp-III is stopped, then B-8 flux is zero. So band 1 (700-800 keV) has no flux, band 2 (800-900 keV) has Be-7 flux. Therefore, the ratio is zero. 

But the problem might expect a different answer. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is the one that produces the B-8 neutrinos, and the pp-II produces the Be-7 neutrinos. If pp-III is stopped, then B-8 stops, but pp-II continues. The Be-7 neutrinos are still there. 

The Be-7 neutrino line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2 (800-900 keV). So band 2 has all the Be-7 neutrinos. Band 1 (700-800 keV) has no neutrinos from Be-7. The B-8 neutrinos, which are stopped, might have had some contribution in band 1 and band 2. But since B-8 is stopped, those contributions are gone. 

But wait, the B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum. Let's say the B-8 spectrum has a certain number of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If B-8 is stopped, then those neutrinos disappear. But compared to the Be-7 flux, which is much higher, the loss of B-8 neutrinos in band 2 would be negligible. However, in band 1, the B-8 might have been the only source. 

Wait, but the B-8 flux is 5×10^6 cm^-2 s^-1, and the Be-7 is 5×10^9. So even if B-8 had, say, 1% of its flux in band 1 (700-800 keV), that would be 5×10^4, which is negligible compared to Be-7's 5×10^9. But if B-8 is stopped, then band 1's flux would drop from 5×10^4 to zero, but band 2's flux remains at 5×10^9. So the ratio would be approximately zero. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another source. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos, but their flux is about 5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, which is lower than Be-7. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies, but maybe some are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. However, the CNO neutrinos are from beta decays of N-13, O-15, etc., which have higher Q-values, so their neutrinos have higher energies. For example, N-13 decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV, O-15 up to 1.7 MeV, and F-17 up to 1.74 MeV. So the CNO neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be part of their spectra. 

But the CNO flux is about 5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, which is an order of magnitude less than Be-7's 5×10^9. So even if CNO contributes to both bands, the ratio would be dominated by Be-7 in band 2 and CNO in band 1. But the CNO flux is spread over a range, so the flux in band 1 would be a fraction of 5×10^8. Let's say half of the CNO neutrinos are in band 1 (unlikely, but for estimation), that's 2.5×10^8. Band 2 would have Be-7 at 5×10^9 plus CNO in that range. But Be-7 is a line at 861 keV, so all 5×10^9 are in band 2. The CNO in band 2 might be a small fraction. 

So the ratio would be (CNO_band1) / (Be7_band2 + CNO_band2) ≈ (2.5×10^8) / (5×10^9) ≈ 0.05. But this is a rough estimate. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were, so CNO is still active. But the question is about the ratio after stopping pp-III. 

But the original ratio (before stopping pp-III) would have B-8 contributing to both bands. But since B-8 is stopped, the ratio becomes (CNO_band1) / (Be7_band2 + CNO_band2). But if CNO's contribution is much smaller than Be-7, then the ratio is approximately CNO_band1 / Be7_band2. If CNO_band1 is, say, 1×10^8 and Be7_band2 is 5×10^9, the ratio is 0.02. But the problem might consider that without B-8, the flux in band 1 is negligible, so the ratio is approximately zero. 

But the answer might be 0. However, in reality, there might be a small contribution from CNO, but the problem states that flavor changes don't matter, so we don't have to consider neutrino oscillations. 

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch stopping affects the production of Be-7. Wait, no. The pp-III branch is He-3 + He-4 → Be-7, then Be-7 + p → B-8. If pp-III is stopped, then Be-7 is not consumed by proton capture. But Be-7 is still produced in the pp-II branch via He-3 + He-4 → Be-7. Wait, no, the pp-II and pp-III branches are both part of the same initial steps. Let me clarify the pp chain. 

The pp chain starts with p + p → d + e+ + ν_e (pp neutrinos). Then d + p → He-3. Then He-3 can either combine with another He-3 to form He-4 + 2p (pp-I), or He-3 + He-4 → Be-7 (pp-II and pp-III). 

If He-3 + He-4 → Be-7, then Be-7 can either capture an electron (pp-II) to become Li-7, which then reacts with a proton to form two He-4, or capture a proton (pp-III) to become B-8, which decays into Be-8* + e+ + ν_e (B-8 neutrino). 

So if the pp-III branch (Be-7 + p → B-8) is stopped, then all Be-7 would undergo electron capture (pp-II). Therefore, the production rate of Be-7 would remain the same (since He-3 + He-4 → Be-7 continues), but the destruction of Be-7 is only via pp-II. 

However, the timescale for Be-7 to undergo electron capture is important. If the electron capture is fast, then the Be-7 abundance doesn't accumulate, and the Be-7 neutrino flux remains the same. If the electron capture is slow, then Be-7 would accumulate, increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. 

But in the Sun, the Be-7 electron capture rate is determined by the core's electron density. The laboratory half-life is 53 days, but in the Sun's core, the density is high enough that the capture rate is much faster. The actual lifetime of Be-7 in the Sun is about a few hundred days. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the Be-7 would start to accumulate until the electron capture rate balances the production rate. 

But 8.5 minutes is too short for any significant accumulation. Therefore, the Be-7 neutrino flux would remain approximately the same as before. 

Therefore, the only change is the disappearance of B-8 neutrinos. 

In the energy bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Previously had B-8 neutrinos (small flux) and possibly CNO (smaller flux). Now only CNO.

- Band 2 (800-900 keV): Previously had Be-7 (large flux) and B-8 (small). Now only Be-7.

But since B-8's contribution was negligible compared to Be-7, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) becomes (CNO_band1) / (Be7_band2). 

Assuming CNO contributes equally to both bands, but given that CNO neutrinos have higher energies, their contribution to band 1 might be small. For example, if CNO has a flux of 5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, and the spectrum is such that a small fraction is in band 1, say 10%, that's 5×10^7. Be-7 in band 2 is 5×10^9. So the ratio is 5×10^7 / 5×10^9 = 0.01. 

But the problem says "approximate ratio". If the answer options are numerical, but since it's an open response, the answer is approximately 0. However, the problem might expect the ratio to be 0 because the Be-7 line is entirely in band 2, and band 1 has no flux. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the Be-7 line is entirely in band 2. Let's check the energy: 861 keV is 0.861 MeV, which is 861 keV. Band 2 is 800-900 keV, so 861 keV is within band 2. Therefore, all Be-7 neutrinos are in band 2. Band 1 (700-800 keV) has no Be-7 neutrinos. 

The B-8 neutrinos, which are now gone, had a small flux in both bands, but their contribution was negligible. The CNO neutrinos might have a small flux in band 1, but it's much smaller than Be-7 in band 2. 

Therefore, the ratio is approximately (CNO_band1) / (Be7_band2) ≈ negligible, so the ratio is approximately 0. 

But the problem might want the answer as 0, but in reality, it's a very small number. However, given the options (if it were multiple choice), but since it's open, the answer is approximately zero. 

But the question says "approximate ratio". If the answer is zero, but in reality, there's a tiny bit from CNO, but the problem might consider it zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the energy ranges. Let me confirm: 

Be-7 neutrino energy: 861 keV (0.861 MeV). 

Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV). 

Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). 

So 861 keV is in band 2. Therefore, band 2 has all the Be-7 neutrinos. Band 1 has none. 

The B-8 neutrinos, which are now gone, had a spectrum that extends down to low energies. The B-8 neutrino spectrum's differential flux at 700-800 keV is non-zero, but the total number in that band is much less than Be-7. 

But since B-8 is stopped, band 1 loses that small contribution, making the flux in band 1 even smaller. 

Therefore, the ratio is Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. 

But the problem might want the answer as 0. However, in some contexts, the ratio could be considered as 0.1 or something if there's a miscalculation. But based on the analysis, it's zero.

Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the neutrino fluxes between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the pp-III branch is. 

From what I remember, the Sun's energy production comes primarily from the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions. There are different branches in the pp chain: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. Each branch has different reactions and produces neutrinos with different energy spectra. 

The pp-III branch, if I'm not mistaken, is part of the chain that involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus combines with a helium-4 nucleus to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then undergoes beta-plus decay to produce a high-energy neutrino. Wait, no, maybe that's the pp-II or pp-III. Let me get this straight. 

The main branches are:

1. **pp-I**: This is the primary branch where two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4, two protons. The neutrinos here are from the initial pp fusion, which have lower energies, up to about 0.42 MeV.

2. **pp-II**: This branch involves He-3 reacting with He-4 to form Be-7. Then Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then combines with a proton to form two He-4. The neutrinos here are from the electron capture in Be-7, which have a monoenergetic line around 0.86 MeV (861 keV).

3. **pp-III**: This is the branch where Be-7 captures a proton instead, forming B-8, which then beta-decays into Be-8*, emitting a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 decay produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, with a peak around 6-7 MeV. Wait, but the question is about 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Those are lower energies. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the branches.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact reactions. Let me think again. The pp-III branch is the one that produces boron-8 neutrinos. The B-8 decay produces the highest energy solar neutrinos, with a maximum energy around 15 MeV. But the energy bands in the question are 700-900 keV, which is 0.7-0.9 MeV. That's much lower. So maybe the pp-III branch isn't the main source of neutrinos in that energy range. 

Wait, but the pp-III branch produces B-8 neutrinos, which have higher energies. The lower energy neutrinos come from the pp fusion (pp-I) and the Be-7 electron capture (pp-II). So if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the high-energy neutrinos (like the B-8 ones) would stop, but the lower energy ones (pp and Be-7) would continue. But the question is about the flux ratio between 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. 

Wait, but the Be-7 neutrinos are monoenergetic at 861 keV. So that's in the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The pp neutrinos have a continuous spectrum up to about 420 keV, so they don't contribute to either band. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum up to 15 MeV, but their flux is much lower. However, if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be produced. But the Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) would still be there. 

Wait, but the pp-III branch is the one that produces B-8. So if pp-III stops, B-8 production stops. But the Be-7 from pp-II would still produce the 861 keV neutrinos. So the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would have the Be-7 neutrinos, which are at 861 keV. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) would have... what? The pp neutrinos only go up to 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The B-8 neutrinos, which are higher energy, but if pp-III is stopped, those are gone. Wait, but maybe there are other sources? 

Wait, the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III is stopped, but pp-I, pp-II, and CNO continue. But the CNO neutrinos are higher energy than the pp ones, but their flux in the Sun is much lower compared to the pp chain. 

But the energy bands in question are 0.7-0.9 MeV. The Be-7 neutrinos are at 0.861 MeV, so that's in band 2. The pp neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV, so they don't reach 0.7 MeV. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum that starts from lower energies? Wait, no. The B-8 decay produces a beta spectrum with a maximum energy around 15 MeV, but the average is lower. But even the lowest energy B-8 neutrinos would be above 0 MeV, but the spectrum is continuous. However, the flux of B-8 neutrinos is much lower than the Be-7 and pp neutrinos. 

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 production stops. So the only neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be the Be-7 neutrinos at 0.861 MeV, which are all in band 2 (800-900 keV). So band 1 (700-800 keV) would have no neutrinos from Be-7, because that's below 800 keV. Wait, 0.861 MeV is 861 keV, which is in band 2. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV. The Be-7 line is at 0.861 MeV, so it's in band 2. Therefore, if pp-III is stopped, the B-8 neutrinos (which have higher energies) are gone, but the Be-7 neutrinos remain. 

But wait, the B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum. So even though their maximum is 15 MeV, their flux at lower energies (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) might be non-zero. But how significant is that? 

Wait, the B-8 neutrino spectrum: the decay is B-8 → Be-8* + e+ + ν_e. The maximum neutrino energy is around 15 MeV, but the spectrum is a continuous distribution. The number of neutrinos decreases with decreasing energy. So at lower energies (like 0.7-0.9 MeV), the flux from B-8 would be very low compared to the Be-7 line. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 production stops. So the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be present. Therefore, in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, the only neutrinos would be the Be-7 line at 0.861 MeV. So in band 1 (700-800 keV), there would be no neutrinos from Be-7 (since 0.861 MeV is 861 keV, which is in band 2). The pp neutrinos don't reach that high. The CNO neutrinos might have some in that range, but their flux is much lower. 

Wait, but the question says "all other reactions remained as they were". So pp-I and pp-II are still active. The pp-III is stopped. So the Be-7 from pp-II would still produce the 0.861 MeV neutrinos. The B-8 from pp-III would stop. 

Therefore, in band 1 (700-800 keV), there are no neutrinos from Be-7 (since that's at 861 keV), and the B-8 neutrinos are gone. The pp neutrinos only go up to 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, but their flux is negligible compared to the pp chain. So in band 1, the flux would be almost zero

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes between two energy bands—700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2)—considering that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core ceased functioning approximately 8.5 minutes ago. Let me review what the pp-III branch entails.

The Sun generates energy primarily through proton-proton (pp) chain reactions, which include several branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch involves different reactions and produces neutrinos with distinct energy spectra.

To clarify the branches:

1. **pp-I**: This primary branch involves two He-3 nuclei combining to form He-4 and two protons. Neutrinos from the initial pp fusion have relatively low energies, up to approximately 0.42 MeV.

2. **pp-II**: In this branch, He-3 reacts with He-4 to produce Be-7. Subsequently, Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then combines with a proton to form two He-4 nuclei. The electron capture in Be-7 generates monoenergetic neutrinos at around 0.86 MeV (861 keV).

3. **pp-III**: This branch involves Be-7 capturing a proton instead, forming B-8, which then undergoes beta-decay into Be-8*, emitting a high-energy neutrino. B-8 decay produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV, peaking around 6-7 MeV.

The energy bands in question (700-900 keV) are in the lower energy range compared to the maximum neutrino energies from B-8 decay. The pp-III branch specifically produces B-8 neutrinos, which have the highest energies among solar neutrinos, reaching up to 15 MeV. If the pp-III branch stops, B-8 production ceases, eliminating these high-energy neutrinos.

The Be-7 neutrinos from pp-II are monoenergetic at 861 keV, placing them in band 2 (800-900 keV). The pp neutrinos from pp-I only reach up to 420 keV, so they don't contribute to either band in question.

B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum. While their maximum energy is approximately 15 MeV, their distribution extends to lower energies, though their flux decreases at lower energy levels. In the 700-900 keV range, the B-8 neutrino contribution would be relatively small compared to the Be-7 line.

If the pp-III branch stops, B-8 production ceases, but the pp-I and pp-II branches continue operating as before. Therefore, the Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV from pp-II would still be present in band 2. In band 1 (700-800 keV), there would be almost no neutrinos since Be-7 neutrinos are at 861 keV (in band 2), pp neutrinos don't reach these energies, and B-8 neutrinos are no longer being produced. The CNO cycle might contribute some neutrinos in this range, but their flux is negligible compared to the pp chain.

In conclusion, with pp-III stopped, band 1 would have almost zero neutrino flux, while band 2 would still contain the Be-7 neutrinos.

Alright, I need to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), assuming the Sun's core stopped the pp-III branch about 8.5 minutes ago. Let's start by reviewing what the pp-III branch entails.

The Sun primarily generates energy through the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions, which include branches like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch facilitates distinct reactions and results in neutrinos with different energy spectra.

From my understanding, the pp-III branch involves helium-3 merging with helium-4 to produce beryllium-7, which captures a proton to become boron-8 that then undergoes beta-plus decay to emit a high-energy neutrino. Hold on, that might be the pp-II or pp-III. Let me clarify.

The main branches are:

1. **pp-I**: The primary branch, where two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4, two protons. These neutrinos are from the initial pp fusion, typically at lower energies, up to about 0.42 MeV.

2. **pp-II**: In this branch, He-3 reacts with He-4 to form Be-7, which absorbs an electron to become Li-7, then combines with a proton to yield two He-4. The neutrinos originate from Be-7's electron capture, providing a monoenergetic line around 0.86 MeV (861 keV).

3. **pp-III**: This branch has Be-7 capturing a proton to form B-8, which beta-decays into Be-8* and emits a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 decay yields a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, peaking around 6-7 MeV. But the question involves 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, which are lower energies. Maybe I am confusing branches.

Let me sort this out. The pp-III branch produces boron-8 neutrinos, which are the highest energy solar neutrinos, peaking at around 15 MeV. Yet the discussed bands are 0.7-0.9 MeV, which is much lower. Possibly, the pp-III branch isn't the primary source of neutrinos in that energy range.

The B-8 neutrinos stopped with the cessation of the pp-III branch, whereas the Be-7 neutrinos from pp-II persist. The 800-900 keV band (band 2) retains the Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV. The 700-800 keV band (band 1), however, lacks contribution from the Be-7 neutrinos, as it is just under 800 keV. The pp neutrinos only reach as high as 420 keV, leaving them out of both bands.

Considering other sources, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos, but their contribution is minor compared to the pp chain. With the shutdown of pp-III, the B-8 neutrinos are absent, leaving the Be-7 neutrinos as the primary contributors in the 800-900 keV range.

To sum up, with the pp-III branch stopped, band 2 (800-900 keV) includes the Be-7 neutrinos at 0.861 MeV. Band 1 (700-800 keV) is devoid of contributions from the Be-7 neutrinos, and the B-8 neutrinos are no longer present due to the halted production. The pp neutrinos do not reach these energies, and CNO neutrinos, despite their presence, have low flux. Therefore, the flux in band 1 is nearly zero.

In band 2 (800-900 keV), the Be-7 neutrinos are present. \n\nTherefore, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be approximately zero. But the question is about the ratio, so maybe it\'s not exactly zero but very small. However, the problem states that flavor changes do not play a role, so we don\'t have to consider neutrino oscillations. \n\nBut wait, the time factor: the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the time delay for neutrinos from the Sun\'s core to Earth is about 8.3 minutes (since the Sun-Earth distance is about 1 AU, which light takes about 8.3 minutes to traverse). So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch would have already passed Earth, and now we would start seeing the absence of those neutrinos. \n\nBut the Be-7 neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch, which is still active. The Be-7 neutrinos have a much shorter production timescale? Wait, the timescale for the pp chain reactions: the pp-I chain takes about 10^9 years for a proton to undergo fusion, but once the chain is ongoing, the reactions happen continuously. However, the production of B-8 in the pp-III branch is a much rarer branch, accounting for about 0.02% of the total solar neutrinos. \n\nBut if the pp-III branch is suddenly stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos would cease immediately (since their production stops), and after 8.5 minutes, we would no longer detect them. The Be-7 neutrinos, which are part of the pp-II branch, would still be produced, so their flux remains. \n\nTherefore, in the energy bands:\n\n- Band 1 (700-800 keV): No significant sources. The B-8 neutrinos that might have contributed here are gone. The pp and CNO neutrinos don\'t reach this energy. \n\n- Band 2 (800-900 keV): The Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV are present. \n\nTherefore, the flux ratio would be approximately zero. But the problem might expect a numerical ratio. However, since the Be-7 line is entirely in band 2, and band 1 has no flux, the ratio is zero. But maybe there\'s a small contribution from other processes? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy ranges. Let me check the exact energies. The Be-7 electron capture produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is within band 2 (800-900 keV). The pp neutrinos have a maximum energy of about 420 keV, so they don\'t reach 700 keV. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with higher energies, but the main CNO neutrinos are from the decay of N-13 (maximum energy ~1.2 MeV), O-15 (~1.7 MeV), and F-17 (~1.7 MeV). These have fluxes much lower than the pp and Be-7 neutrinos. \n\nSo in the 700-800 keV band (band 1), the only possible contributors would be the tail of the CNO neutrinos. Let\'s say N-13 decay has a maximum neutrino energy of 1.2 MeV, so the spectrum would extend down to lower energies. The flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range from CNO might be non-zero but very small compared to the Be-7 line. \n\nBut the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So if pp-III is stopped, but CNO is still active. However, the CNO flux is much lower. For example, the standard solar model predicts that the Be-7 neutrino flux is about 5% of the total pp flux, and the B-8 is about 0.01% of the total. The CNO neutrinos are even less, maybe around 1% of the total. But in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, the CNO neutrinos might have some contribution. \n\nBut if we\'re comparing band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV), and band 2 has the Be-7 line at 861 keV, which is a strong line, while band 1 has a small contribution from CNO, then the ratio would be roughly (CNO flux in band1) / (Be-7 flux). \n\nBut the CNO flux in band1 would be a small fraction of the total CNO flux. Let\'s say the N-13 neutrino spectrum is a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range would be a fraction of the total N-13 flux. Similarly for O-15 and F-17. But since the total CNO flux is already much smaller than the Be-7 flux, the ratio would be very small. \n\nBut the problem might be expecting us to consider that without pp-III (B-8), the only neutrinos in these bands are Be-7 (band2) and nothing in band1, so the ratio is zero. However, maybe there\'s a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch stopping affects the production of Be-7? Wait, the pp-III branch is He-3 + He-4 → Be-7, then Be-7 + p → B-8. If pp-III stops, does that mean that the Be-7 is not being consumed? Wait, no. The pp-III branch is the path where Be-7 captures a proton to become B-8. If that stops, then Be-7 would accumulate and perhaps undergo electron capture (pp-II branch) more. Wait, but the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So if pp-III is stopped, but pp-II continues. \n\nWait, the pp chain branches after He-3 is produced. In the pp-I branch, two He-3 combine to make He-4. In the pp-II and pp-III branches, He-3 reacts with He-4 to make Be-7. Then, in pp-II, Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then reacts with a proton to make two He-4. In pp-III, Be-7 captures a proton to become B-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a high-energy neutrino. \n\nSo if the pp-III branch is stopped, that means the Be-7 doesn\'t capture a proton to become B-8. Instead, all the Be-7 would go through the pp-II branch (electron capture). Therefore, the production rate of Be-7 would remain the same, but instead of some fraction going to B-8, all of it goes to Li-7. \n\nBut the problem states that the pp-III branch is stopped, but all other reactions remain as they were. Wait, that might be contradictory. If pp-III is stopped, then the Be-7 can\'t capture protons anymore, so the branching ratio changes. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were". Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the pp-III branch is the only one that stops, but the other branches (pp-I, pp-II) continue as before. But in reality, if pp-III stops, the Be-7 would have to go through pp-II. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were", which might mean that the rates of other reactions are unchanged. So perhaps the production of Be-7 is the same, but the pp-III branch (Be-7 + p → B-8) stops. Therefore, the Be-7 would accumulate, but the problem states that other reactions remain as they were. This is a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simplified, and we are to assume that stopping pp-III only removes the B-8 neutrinos, but leaves the Be-7 and pp neutrinos unchanged. But in reality, stopping pp-III would increase the Be-7 abundance, leading to more Be-7 electron captures (pp-II), thus increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were", so perhaps the Be-7 neutrino flux remains the same. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let\'s try to proceed. If pp-III is stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) remain. The pp neutrinos (from pp-I) remain. The CNO neutrinos remain. \n\nIn the energy bands:\n\n- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Possible sources are CNO neutrinos (N-13, O-15, F-17) with a small flux.\n\n- Band 2 (800-900 keV): Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV, which is a significant flux.\n\nAssuming that the CNO flux in band1 is negligible compared to the Be-7 flux in band2, the ratio would be approximately zero. However, if there\'s any residual flux in band1 from other processes, the ratio would be very small. \n\nBut the problem might be expecting us to recognize that the Be-7 line is in band2, and without B-8 (which contributes a continuous spectrum), the only neutrinos in these bands are Be-7 in band2 and nothing in band1. Therefore, the ratio is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a misunderstanding in the energy ranges. Let me check the exact energy of Be-7 neutrinos. The electron capture of Be-7 produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is indeed in band2 (800-900 keV). So band2 has the entire Be-7 flux, and band1 has nothing. \n\nTherefore, the flux ratio would be Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. But since the problem is multiple-choice, maybe the answer is approximately zero, but in terms of options, it might be <<1. However, the problem says "approximate ratio", so maybe the answer is 0. But in reality, there might be a tiny contribution from CNO, but the question says flavor changes don\'t matter, so perhaps we can ignore that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the time factor of 8.5 minutes is important. Neutrinos travel at nearly light speed, so 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to reach Earth from the Sun. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the core after the shutdown would just now be arriving. But the B-8 neutrinos have a short lifetime. Wait, B-8 has a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So once the B-8 is produced, it decays almost immediately. Therefore, the B-8 neutrino flux would stop almost immediately after the pp-III branch stops, because B-8 decays quickly. So after 8.5 minutes, the B-8 neutrinos would have ceased, and we would observe the absence. \n\nTherefore, the current flux in band1 and band2 would be:\n\n- Band1: Only possible contributions from CNO (very small).\n\n- Band2: Be-7 neutrinos (unchanged, since pp-II is still active).\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately zero. \n\nBut the problem might want a numerical value. If the Be-7 flux is F, and the CNO flux in band1 is negligible, then the ratio is 0. If there\'s a small CNO contribution, maybe 0.1 or something, but I think the answer is 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the Be-7 production is increased because the pp-III branch is a sink for Be-7. If pp-III stops, more Be-7 would go through pp-II, increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. But the problem states "all other reactions remained as they were", which might imply that the flux from other branches is unchanged. So perhaps the Be-7 flux remains the same. \n\nIn that case, the ratio is 0. But I need to confirm. \n\nYes, I think the answer is that the ratio is approximately zero because band1 has no significant neutrino flux, and band2 has the Be-7 line.

The pp-III branch in the Sun's proton-proton chain produces high-energy boron-8 (B⁸) neutrinos via the reaction sequence:  
¹He³ + ¹He⁴ → ⁷Be + γ, followed by ⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ. The ⁸B subsequently decays, emitting neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. However, the **700–900 keV energy range** is dominated by the monoenergetic ⁷Be neutrino line at **861 keV** (from the pp-II branch), not the B⁸ neutrinos.  

If the pp-III branch stops:  
1. **B⁸ neutrino production ceases**, removing their negligible contribution to the 700–900 keV range.  
2. The **⁷Be neutrino flux (861 keV) remains unaffected** (since pp-II continues).  
3. The pp-I neutrinos (≤420 keV) and CNO neutrinos (minor flux) do not contribute significantly to the 700–900 keV bands.  

Thus, in **band 1 (700–800 keV)**, there is effectively **no flux**, while **band 2 (800–900 keV)** retains the full ⁷Be neutrino flux.  

**Flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) ≈ 0.**  

$\boxed{0}$

. In band 2 (800-900 keV), the Be-7 neutrinos are present. 

Therefore, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be approximately zero. But the question is about the ratio, so maybe it's not exactly zero but very small. However, the problem states that flavor changes do not play a role, so we don't have to consider neutrino oscillations. 

But wait, the time factor: the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the time delay for neutrinos from the Sun's core to Earth is about 8.3 minutes (since the Sun-Earth distance is about 1 AU, which light takes about 8.3 minutes to traverse). So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch would have already passed Earth, and now we would start seeing the absence of those neutrinos. 

But the Be-7 neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch, which is still active. The Be-7 neutrinos have a much shorter production timescale? Wait, the timescale for the pp chain reactions: the pp-I chain takes about 10^9 years for a proton to undergo fusion, but once the chain is ongoing, the reactions happen continuously. However, the production of B-8 in the pp-III branch is a much rarer branch, accounting for about 0.02% of the total solar neutrinos. 

But if the pp-III branch is suddenly stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos would cease immediately (since their production stops), and after 8.5 minutes, we would no longer detect them. The Be-7 neutrinos, which are part of the pp-II branch, would still be produced, so their flux remains. 

Therefore, in the energy bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): No significant sources. The B-8 neutrinos that might have contributed here are gone. The pp and CNO neutrinos don't reach this energy. 

- Band 2 (800-900 keV): The Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV are present. 

Therefore, the flux ratio would be approximately zero. But the problem might expect a numerical ratio. However, since the Be-7 line is entirely in band 2, and band 1 has no flux, the ratio is zero. But maybe there's a small contribution from other processes? 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy ranges. Let me check the exact energies. The Be-7 electron capture produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is within band 2 (800-900 keV). The pp neutrinos have a maximum energy of about 420 keV, so they don't reach 700 keV. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with higher energies, but the main CNO neutrinos are from the decay of N-13 (maximum energy ~1.2 MeV), O-15 (~1.7 MeV), and F-17 (~1.7 MeV). These have fluxes much lower than the pp and Be-7 neutrinos. 

So in the 700-800 keV band (band 1), the only possible contributors would be the tail of the CNO neutrinos. Let's say N-13 decay has a maximum neutrino energy of 1.2 MeV, so the spectrum would extend down to lower energies. The flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range from CNO might be non-zero but very small compared to the Be-7 line. 

But the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So if pp-III is stopped, but CNO is still active. However, the CNO flux is much lower. For example, the standard solar model predicts that the Be-7 neutrino flux is about 5% of the total pp flux, and the B-8 is about 0.01% of the total. The CNO neutrinos are even less, maybe around 1% of the total. But in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, the CNO neutrinos might have some contribution. 

But if we're comparing band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV), and band 2 has the Be-7 line at 861 keV, which is a strong line, while band 1 has a small contribution from CNO, then the ratio would be roughly (CNO flux in band1) / (Be-7 flux). 

But the CNO flux in band1 would be a small fraction of the total CNO flux. Let's say the N-13 neutrino spectrum is a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range would be a fraction of the total N-13 flux. Similarly for O-15 and F-17. But since the total CNO flux is already much smaller than the Be-7 flux, the ratio would be very small. 

But the problem might be expecting us to consider that without pp-III (B-8), the only neutrinos in these bands are Be-7 (band2) and nothing in band1, so the ratio is zero. However, maybe there's a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch stopping affects the production of Be-7? Wait, the pp-III branch is He-3 + He-4 → Be-7, then Be-7 + p → B-8. If pp-III stops, does that mean that the Be-7 is not being consumed? Wait, no. The pp-III branch is the path where Be-7 captures a proton to become B-8. If that stops, then Be-7 would accumulate and perhaps undergo electron capture (pp-II branch) more. Wait, but the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So if pp-III is stopped, but pp-II continues. 

Wait, the pp chain branches after He-3 is produced. In the pp-I branch, two He-3 combine to make He-4. In the pp-II and pp-III branches, He-3 reacts with He-4 to make Be-7. Then, in pp-II, Be-7 captures an electron to become Li-7, which then reacts with a proton to make two He-4. In pp-III, Be-7 captures a proton to become B-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a high-energy neutrino. 

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, that means the Be-7 doesn't capture a proton to become B-8. Instead, all the Be-7 would go through the pp-II branch (electron capture). Therefore, the production rate of Be-7 would remain the same, but instead of some fraction going to B-8, all of it goes to Li-7. 

But the problem states that the pp-III branch is stopped, but all other reactions remain as they were. Wait, that might be contradictory. If pp-III is stopped, then the Be-7 can't capture protons anymore, so the branching ratio changes. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were". Hmm, this is confusing. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the pp-III branch is the only one that stops, but the other branches (pp-I, pp-II) continue as before. But in reality, if pp-III stops, the Be-7 would have to go through pp-II. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were", which might mean that the rates of other reactions are unchanged. So perhaps the production of Be-7 is the same, but the pp-III branch (Be-7 + p → B-8) stops. Therefore, the Be-7 would accumulate, but the problem states that other reactions remain as they were. This is a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified, and we are to assume that stopping pp-III only removes the B-8 neutrinos, but leaves the Be-7 and pp neutrinos unchanged. But in reality, stopping pp-III would increase the Be-7 abundance, leading to more Be-7 electron captures (pp-II), thus increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. But the problem says "all other reactions remained as they were", so perhaps the Be-7 neutrino flux remains the same. 

This is a bit tricky. Let's try to proceed. If pp-III is stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) remain. The pp neutrinos (from pp-I) remain. The CNO neutrinos remain. 

In the energy bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Possible sources are CNO neutrinos (N-13, O-15, F-17) with a small flux.

- Band 2 (800-900 keV): Be-7 neutrinos at 861 keV, which is a significant flux.

Assuming that the CNO flux in band1 is negligible compared to the Be-7 flux in band2, the ratio would be approximately zero. However, if there's any residual flux in band1 from other processes, the ratio would be very small. 

But the problem might be expecting us to recognize that the Be-7 line is in band2, and without B-8 (which contributes a continuous spectrum), the only neutrinos in these bands are Be-7 in band2 and nothing in band1. Therefore, the ratio is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the energy ranges. Let me check the exact energy of Be-7 neutrinos. The electron capture of Be-7 produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is indeed in band2 (800-900 keV). So band2 has the entire Be-7 flux, and band1 has nothing. 

Therefore, the flux ratio would be Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. But since the problem is multiple-choice, maybe the answer is approximately zero, but in terms of options, it might be <<1. However, the problem says "approximate ratio", so maybe the answer is 0. But in reality, there might be a tiny contribution from CNO, but the question says flavor changes don't matter, so perhaps we can ignore that. 

Alternatively, maybe the time factor of 8.5 minutes is important. Neutrinos travel at nearly light speed, so 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to reach Earth from the Sun. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the core after the shutdown would just now be arriving. But the B-8 neutrinos have a short lifetime. Wait, B-8 has a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So once the B-8 is produced, it decays almost immediately. Therefore, the B-8 neutrino flux would stop almost immediately after the pp-III branch stops, because B-8 decays quickly. So after 8.5 minutes, the B-8 neutrinos would have ceased, and we would observe the absence. 

Therefore, the current flux in band1 and band2 would be:

- Band1: Only possible contributions from CNO (very small).

- Band2: Be-7 neutrinos (unchanged, since pp-II is still active).

Therefore, the ratio is approximately zero. 

But the problem might want a numerical value. If the Be-7 flux is F, and the CNO flux in band1 is negligible, then the ratio is 0. If there's a small CNO contribution, maybe 0.1 or something, but I think the answer is 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the Be-7 production is increased because the pp-III branch is a sink for Be-7. If pp-III stops, more Be-7 would go through pp-II, increasing the Be-7 neutrino flux. But the problem states "all other reactions remained as they were", which might imply that the flux from other branches is unchanged. So perhaps the Be-7 flux remains the same. 

In that case, the ratio is 0. But I need to confirm. 

Yes, I think the answer is that the ratio is approximately zero because band1 has no significant neutrino flux, and band2 has the Be-7 line. Therefore, Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0.

However, perhaps there\'s a small contribution from other sources. Wait, but the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. The CNO cycle is another process, but in the Sun, the CNO cycle contributes a small fraction compared to the pp chain. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies (e.g., 13N, 15O, 17F decays), but their fluxes are much lower. For the energy bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, the main contributors would be Be-7 (861 keV) and possibly some from B-8 if they were present. But since B-8 production has stopped, only Be-7 remains. Therefore, band 2 (800-900 keV) has the Be-7 line, and band 1 (700-800 keV) has no significant flux. Thus, the ratio would be approximately zero. However, maybe there\'s a small contribution from other processes. Let me check the energy ranges again.\n\nWait, the pp-III branch produces B-8, which decays into two He-4 and emits a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 neutrino spectrum starts from very low energies (near zero) up to ~15 MeV, with a peak at higher energies. However, the flux in the 700-900 keV range from B-8 would be lower compared to the Be-7 line. If the pp-III branch stops, then B-8 neutrinos disappear. So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), the only possible sources would be the tail of the pp neutrinos (but they only go up to 420 keV) and maybe CNO neutrinos. However, the CNO neutrinos (like from 13N decay) have energies up to ~1.2 MeV, but their flux is much lower than the pp chain. The main CNO neutrinos are from 13N (up to 1.2 MeV), 15O (up to 1.7 MeV), and 17F (up to 1.7 MeV). The fluxes for these are about two orders of magnitude lower than the Be-7 flux. So, even if there\'s a small contribution from CNO in band 1, it\'s negligible compared to the Be-7 flux in band 2. Therefore, the flux in band 1 would be almost zero, and band 2 would have the Be-7 flux, making the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. The pp-III branch is stopped, but pp-I and pp-II continue. So, the Be-7 neutrinos (861 keV) are still present. The B-8 neutrinos (which would have a small contribution in band 1 and 2) are gone. But the main contribution in band 2 is Be-7, and in band 1, there\'s nothing. Therefore, the ratio would be approximately zero. But maybe the question is expecting a ratio based on the fact that B-8 neutrinos in those bands would have a certain ratio if they were present, but since they are stopped, the ratio is different. Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 neutrinos are not produced. So, the only neutrinos in those bands would be from Be-7 (band 2) and maybe CNO (band 1 and 2). But the CNO flux is much smaller. Let me check the standard solar neutrino fluxes. The Be-7 neutrino flux is about 4.84×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1, while the B-8 flux is about 5.05×10^6 cm^-2 s^-1. The CNO fluxes are even lower: 13N (~2.78×10^8), 15O (~2.05×10^8), and 17F (~5.82×10^6). Wait, but these numbers might be outdated. Let me recall. The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by pp neutrinos (~6×10^10 cm^-2 s^-1), then Be-7 (~4.8×10^9), then pep (~1.44×10^8), then CNO (13N ~3×10^8, 15O ~2×10^8, 17F ~6×10^6), and B-8 ~5×10^6. So, in the energy range 700-800 keV (band 1), the main contributors would be:\n\n- B-8 neutrinos: their spectrum extends down to low energies. The flux in band 1 would be a fraction of the total B-8 flux. Let\'s say the B-8 spectrum is roughly flat at low energies, but actually, the spectrum peaks at higher energies. The differential flux at 700-800 keV would be lower than the peak. However, if B-8 is stopped, then this contribution disappears.\n\n- CNO neutrinos: 13N decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV. The average energy is around 0.71 MeV. So, 13N neutrinos would contribute to band 1 (700-800 keV) and part of band 2. Similarly, 15O and 17F have higher energies. But the flux of CNO neutrinos is about 10% of the Be-7 flux. Wait, Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, and CNO (13N +15O +17F) is about 3×10^8 +2×10^8 +6×10^6 ≈ 5×10^8, which is about 10% of Be-7. So, if B-8 is stopped, then in band 1, the flux would be from CNO (mostly 13N) and perhaps a tiny bit from pep (pep neutrinos are monoenergetic at 1.44 MeV, so they don\'t contribute to these bands). The pep neutrinos are at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than both bands. So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), the main contribution would be from 13N decay. The 13N neutrino flux is about 3×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, and their average energy is ~0.71 MeV. The spectrum of 13N is a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in 700-800 keV would be a fraction of the total 13N flux. Let\'s approximate that maybe 50% of 13N neutrinos are in 700-800 keV. So, ~1.5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1. In band 2 (800-900 keV), the Be-7 flux is 4.8×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1 (mono at 861 keV), and the 13N neutrinos in that band would be a smaller fraction. Let\'s say 800-900 keV is from 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. The 13N spectrum up to 1.2 MeV would have some contribution here. The 13N flux in 800-900 keV might be, say, 25% of the total 13N flux (since the average is 0.71 MeV, so the higher end would have fewer). So, 0.25×3×10^8 = 7.5×10^7. Then, total flux in band 2 would be Be-7 (4.8×10^9) plus 13N (7.5×10^7). So, approximately 4.875×10^9. The flux in band 1 would be 1.5×10^8. Then the ratio would be (1.5×10^8)/(4.875×10^9) ≈ 0.03. But wait, this is considering CNO contributions. However, the problem states that only the pp-III branch is stopped; all other reactions remain. So, the CNO cycle is part of the other reactions and continues. But in the Sun, the CNO cycle is a minor contributor compared to the pp chain. However, in the energy bands considered, the main contributor to band 2 is Be-7 (from pp-II), and to band 1, it\'s CNO (13N). But the problem says that flavor changes don\'t matter, so we can ignore neutrino oscillations. But the key point is that if pp-III stops, B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (band 2) remain. The CNO neutrinos (band 1 and 2) remain. But the CNO flux is much smaller than Be-7. So, in band 1, the flux would be dominated by CNO (13N), and in band 2, dominated by Be-7. Therefore, the ratio would be roughly (13N flux in band 1) / (Be-7 flux in band 2). If 13N flux in band 1 is ~1.5×10^8 and Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. But the problem might be expecting us to ignore CNO contributions, assuming they are negligible. If that\'s the case, then band 1 would have almost no flux, and the ratio would be approximately zero. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. But in the standard solar model, the CNO cycle contributes a small fraction. However, in the energy bands given, the Be-7 line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2. Band 1 (700-800 keV) would have some CNO neutrinos but no pp or B-8 neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio would be the CNO flux in band 1 divided by the Be-7 flux in band 2. Given that CNO flux is about 10% of Be-7 flux, and assuming that a fraction of CNO is in band 1, the ratio might be around 0.1 or less. But precise numbers would require knowing the exact neutrino spectra. However, the problem might be designed to recognize that stopping pp-III removes B-8 neutrinos, which have a continuous spectrum. But in the energy bands 700-900 keV, the dominant source is Be-7 (861 keV) in band 2. Band 1 would have negligible flux from other processes. Therefore, the ratio would be approximately zero. But the answer might not be zero. Let me think again. The pp-III branch produces B-8, which decays into neutrinos up to 15 MeV. The B-8 neutrino spectrum has a certain flux in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges. If pp-III stops, those B-8 neutrinos disappear. The remaining neutrinos in those bands would be from other sources. But the main source in band 2 is Be-7 (861 keV), and in band 1, there\'s nothing significant. Therefore, the ratio would be Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. However, the problem states that the pp-III branch is stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the time delay is negligible (Earth-Sun distance is about 8.3 light-minutes, so 8.5 minutes ago would mean the neutrinos produced after the shutdown haven\'t reached us yet. Wait, the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away. If the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the core after the shutdown would not have reached Earth yet. Therefore, the neutrinos we are receiving now were produced 8.5 minutes ago. But the pp-III branch has a timescale. The B-8 neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch, which involves the decay of B-8 with a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So, the production of B-8 neutrinos is almost instantaneous once the B-8 is formed. If the pp-III branch stops (i.e., the reaction producing B-8 stops), then B-8 would decay away within a few seconds. Therefore, 8.5 minutes is more than enough time for the B-8 neutrinos to cease. Therefore, the current neutrino flux would not include any B-8 neutrinos. So, the flux in both bands would be from other sources. But as before, band 2 has Be-7 (861 keV), and band 1 has CNO (13N) neutrinos. The ratio would then be (13N flux in band 1) / (Be-7 flux in band 2). If the 13N flux in band 1 is, say, 1.5×10^8 and Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. But the problem might expect us to ignore CNO and consider that only Be-7 remains, making the ratio zero. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. But in the standard solar model, the CNO flux is much smaller than Be-7. Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The pp-III branch produces B-8 neutrinos. If it stops, those neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) are unaffected. The Be-7 line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2. Therefore, band 2 has Be-7 neutrinos, and band 1 has nothing. So the ratio is zero. But the answer options might not include zero. Wait, the problem says "approximate ratio". If the answer is zero, but in reality, there\'s a tiny flux from CNO, but the question says "do not play a role here" regarding flavor changes. Maybe we are to assume that only the pp chain is considered. If pp-III is stopped, then B-8 neutrinos are gone. The Be-7 neutrinos are in band 2. The pp neutrinos are below 420 keV. Therefore, band 1 has no flux, band 2 has Be-7. So the ratio is zero. But the problem might expect that answer. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake. Wait, the pp-III branch is the one that produces B-8, which then decays into two He-4 and emits a neutrino. The B-8 decay produces a continuous spectrum. The Be-7 from pp-II produces a line at 861 keV. If pp-III stops, B-8 production stops, so the B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos remain. Therefore, in band 2 (800-900 keV), we have the Be-7 line at 861 keV. In band 1 (700-800 keV), there are no neutrinos from the pp chain. The CNO cycle might contribute, but the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. However, the CNO neutrinos (like from 13N decay) have a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The 13N neutrino average energy is about 0.71 MeV, so a significant portion would be in band 1. The flux of 13N is about 3×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, while Be-7 is 4.8×10^9. So, the ratio would be (3×10^8)/(4.8×10^9) ≈ 0.0625, but considering that only part of the 13N spectrum is in band 1, say half, then ~1.5×10^8, ratio ~0.03. But the problem might not expect considering CNO, as it\'s part of the other reactions. However, the question specifically mentions that all other reactions remain, so CNO is included. But the original pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, and the CNO cycle is a separate process. If the problem assumes that only the pp chain is considered, then stopping pp-III would leave Be-7 and pp neutrinos. But pp neutrinos are below 420 keV. Therefore, band 1 has no flux, band 2 has Be-7. So ratio is zero. But the problem might expect that answer. However, the standard solar neutrino flux includes contributions from CNO even if small. But given the problem\'s phrasing, maybe we are to ignore CNO and consider only the pp chain branches. The question says "all other reactions remained as they were", so CNO is still there. But the answer might require knowing that Be-7 is in band 2 and nothing else, so ratio is zero. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a misunderstanding. Let me check the energy of Be-7 neutrinos. The electron capture in Be-7 produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is within band 2 (800-900 keV). Therefore, band 2 has that line. Band 1 (700-800 keV) has no line sources. The only possible sources are the tails of other neutrino spectra. But B-8 is stopped, so their contribution is gone. The CNO neutrinos (13N) have a spectrum up to 1.2 MeV, so they would contribute to both bands. However, their flux is much lower than Be-7. If we consider the flux in band 1 as coming from 13N and band 2 from Be-7, the ratio would be roughly (13N flux * fraction in band 1) / (Be-7 flux). Assuming 13N flux is ~3×10^8, and Be-7 is ~5×10^9. If half of 13N is in band 1, then 1.5×10^8. The ratio is 1.5×10^8 / 5×10^9 = 0.03. So approximately 0.03. But the options might be 0.1, 0.03, or similar. However, the problem might expect the answer to be approximately zero, considering that CNO contribution is negligible. But given that the CNO flux is about 6% of Be-7 flux (3×10^8 vs 5×10^9), and part of that is in band 1, the ratio would be around 0.03. But the closest approximate answer would be 0.03, which is roughly 1/30. However, the problem might expect the answer to be zero. But since the question mentions "approximate ratio", and considering that in reality there is a small contribution from CNO, but the problem might be designed to ignore CNO and consider only the pp chain. In that case, the answer is zero. But the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. However, the original question is from the pp-III branch stopping. The pp-III is part of the pp chain, and the CNO cycle is a different process. If the problem assumes that the CNO cycle is negligible, then the answer is zero. But given that the CNO cycle is a separate process and the problem says all other reactions remain, including CNO, then the answer should consider CNO contributions. But without specific data on the exact neutrino fluxes in those bands, it\'s hard to be precise. However, given that the Be-7 flux is much larger than CNO fluxes, and the CNO contribution in band 1 is a fraction of their total flux, the ratio is likely small but non-zero. If forced to approximate, maybe the answer is around 0.1 or 0.03. But I need to recall the approximate neutrino fluxes. Let me check:\n\nStandard solar model neutrino fluxes (from memory, in cm^-2 s^-1):\n\n- pp: ~6×10^10\n\n- pep: ~1.4×10^8\n\n- Be-7: ~4.8×10^9\n\n- B-8: ~5×10^6\n\n- N-13: ~3×10^8\n\n- O-15: ~2×10^8\n\n- F-17: ~6×10^6\n\nSo, CNO total is ~5.06×10^8. Be-7 is 4.8×10^9. So CNO is about 10% of Be-7. Now, the 13N spectrum peaks around 0.7 MeV, so in band 1 (700-800 keV), a significant portion of 13N neutrinos would be there. Let\'s say half of the 13N flux is in band 1: 1.5×10^8. Then, band 1 flux is 1.5×10^8, band 2 is Be-7 (4.8×10^9) plus the remaining 13N in band 2. If 13N\'s spectrum up to 1.2 MeV, then from 800-900 keV, it\'s 0.8-0.9 MeV. The fraction of 13N neutrinos in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be the integral from 0.8 to 0.9 of the spectrum. The 13N spectrum is a beta decay spectrum with endpoint 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be less than the number below 0.8 MeV. Let\'s approximate that 30% of 13N neutrinos are in 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, 0.3×3×10^8 = 9×10^7. Then, band 2 flux is Be-7 (4.8×10^9) + 9×10^7 ≈ 4.89×10^9. Band 1 flux is 1.5×10^8. The ratio is 1.5×10^8 / 4.89×10^9 ≈ 0.03. So approximately 3%. Therefore, the ratio is about 0.03, which is 3/100 or 1/33. But the problem asks for the approximate ratio. If the options are order-of-magnitude, 0.03 is ~0.03, which could be approximated as 0.03 or 1/30. However, the problem might expect the answer to be zero, assuming that CNO is negligible. But given the problem\'s phrasing that all other reactions remain, including CNO, the answer should consider CNO. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 0.03. But since the problem is hypothetical and possibly simplified, the intended answer might be zero. However, given the data, I think the correct approximate ratio is about 0.03, so the answer is approximately 0.03, which is 3/100. But the problem might expect a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the B-8 neutrinos contribute to both bands. If pp-III is stopped, those contributions disappear. Let\'s calculate the ratio before and after. Before stopping pp-III, the flux in band 1 and 2 would have contributions from B-8 and Be-7. After stopping, only Be-7 remains in band 2 and CNO in band 1. But the question is about the ratio after the stop. If before the stop, the flux in band 1 would be B-8 and CNO, and band 2 would be B-8 and Be-7. But the problem is about the ratio after the stop. So, post-stop, band 1: CNO (mostly 13N), band 2: Be-7. The ratio is CNO_band1 / Be7_band2. Given that CNO_band1 is ~1.5×10^8 and Be7_band2 is ~4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.03, which is roughly 1/30. But the problem might want the answer as "approximately 0.03" or "about 0.03". However, since the user hasn\'t provided options, but asks to write the ratio, I should state it as approximately 0.03. But maybe the answer is zero. Given the ambiguity, but based on calculations considering CNO, the ratio is approximately 0.03. However, another angle: the time factor. The pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The Sun is 8.3 light-minutes away. So, neutrinos take about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. If the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the last neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch would have had 8.5 - 8.3 = 0.2 minutes to escape the Sun. But the Sun\'s core is dense, and neutrinos escape immediately. However, the B-8 production involves a timescale. The B-8 is produced via Be-7 + p → B-8 + gamma. The B-8 then decays with a half-life of ~0.77 seconds. So, if the pp-III branch stops (i.e., no more B-8 production), the existing B-8 would decay within seconds. Therefore, after 8.5 minutes, all B-8 would have decayed, and no B-8 neutrinos would be arriving. Therefore, the current flux has no B-8 contribution. Thus, the flux in band 1 and 2 is from other sources. As before, band 2 has Be-7, band 1 has CNO. The ratio is ~0.03. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.03, which is 3/100. But the problem might expect this as 0.03 or 1/30. However, in terms of order of magnitude, it\'s about 0.03. So, the flux ratio is approximately 0.03. But since the question says "approximate", maybe round to 0.03 or 0.1. But given the calculation, 0.03 is more accurate. However, in some contexts, people approximate CNO as ~10% of Be-7, so if band 1 has half of CNO, that\'s 5%, so 0.05. But my earlier estimate was 0.03. Given the uncertainty, the safest approximate answer is that the ratio is approximately 0.03, so the answer is \\boxed{0.03}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447761, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5866, prompt_tokens=853, total_tokens=6719, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The pp-III branch in the Sun's core produces high-energy neutrinos via the decay of Boron-8 (B-8), which has a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. If this branch stops, B-8 neutrinos cease, leaving only neutrinos from other processes. 

- **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**: Dominated by the monoenergetic Be-7 neutrinos (861 keV) from the pp-II branch, with a flux of ~4.8×10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹.
- **Band 1 (700-800 keV)**: Primarily receives contributions from the CNO cycle (mostly 13N decay), with a flux of ~1.5×10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ (assuming half of the 13N flux falls in this range).

The ratio of fluxes is calculated as:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Flux (Band 1)}}{\text{Flux (Band 2)}} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^8}{4.8 \times 10^9} \approx 0.03
\]

**Answer**: \boxed{0.03}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Therefore, the flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) would be approximately zero. However, perhaps there's a small contribution from other sources. Wait, but the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. The CNO cycle is another process, but in the Sun, the CNO cycle contributes a small fraction compared to the pp chain. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies (e.g., 13N, 15O, 17F decays), but their fluxes are much lower. For the energy bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, the main contributors would be Be-7 (861 keV) and possibly some from B-8 if they were present. But since B-8 production has stopped, only Be-7 remains. Therefore, band 2 (800-900 keV) has the Be-7 line, and band 1 (700-800 keV) has no significant flux. Thus, the ratio would be approximately zero. However, maybe there's a small contribution from other processes. Let me check the energy ranges again.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces B-8, which decays into two He-4 and emits a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 neutrino spectrum starts from very low energies (near zero) up to ~15 MeV, with a peak at higher energies. However, the flux in the 700-900 keV range from B-8 would be lower compared to the Be-7 line. If the pp-III branch stops, then B-8 neutrinos disappear. So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), the only possible sources would be the tail of the pp neutrinos (but they only go up to 420 keV) and maybe CNO neutrinos. However, the CNO neutrinos (like from 13N decay) have energies up to ~1.2 MeV, but their flux is much lower than the pp chain. The main CNO neutrinos are from 13N (up to 1.2 MeV), 15O (up to 1.7 MeV), and 17F (up to 1.7 MeV). The fluxes for these are about two orders of magnitude lower than the Be-7 flux. So, even if there's a small contribution from CNO in band 1, it's negligible compared to the Be-7 flux in band 2. Therefore, the flux in band 1 would be almost zero, and band 2 would have the Be-7 flux, making the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. The pp-III branch is stopped, but pp-I and pp-II continue. So, the Be-7 neutrinos (861 keV) are still present. The B-8 neutrinos (which would have a small contribution in band 1 and 2) are gone. But the main contribution in band 2 is Be-7, and in band 1, there's nothing. Therefore, the ratio would be approximately zero. But maybe the question is expecting a ratio based on the fact that B-8 neutrinos in those bands would have a certain ratio if they were present, but since they are stopped, the ratio is different. Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 neutrinos are not produced. So, the only neutrinos in those bands would be from Be-7 (band 2) and maybe CNO (band 1 and 2). But the CNO flux is much smaller. Let me check the standard solar neutrino fluxes. The Be-7 neutrino flux is about 4.84×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1, while the B-8 flux is about 5.05×10^6 cm^-2 s^-1. The CNO fluxes are even lower: 13N (~2.78×10^8), 15O (~2.05×10^8), and 17F (~5.82×10^6). Wait, but these numbers might be outdated. Let me recall. The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by pp neutrinos (~6×10^10 cm^-2 s^-1), then Be-7 (~4.8×10^9), then pep (~1.44×10^8), then CNO (13N ~3×10^8, 15O ~2×10^8, 17F ~6×10^6), and B-8 ~5×10^6. So, in the energy range 700-800 keV (band 1), the main contributors would be:

- B-8 neutrinos: their spectrum extends down to low energies. The flux in band 1 would be a fraction of the total B-8 flux. Let's say the B-8 spectrum is roughly flat at low energies, but actually, the spectrum peaks at higher energies. The differential flux at 700-800 keV would be lower than the peak. However, if B-8 is stopped, then this contribution disappears.

- CNO neutrinos: 13N decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV. The average energy is around 0.71 MeV. So, 13N neutrinos would contribute to band 1 (700-800 keV) and part of band 2. Similarly, 15O and 17F have higher energies. But the flux of CNO neutrinos is about 10% of the Be-7 flux. Wait, Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, and CNO (13N +15O +17F) is about 3×10^8 +2×10^8 +6×10^6 ≈ 5×10^8, which is about 10% of Be-7. So, if B-8 is stopped, then in band 1, the flux would be from CNO (mostly 13N) and perhaps a tiny bit from pep (pep neutrinos are monoenergetic at 1.44 MeV, so they don't contribute to these bands). The pep neutrinos are at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than both bands. So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), the main contribution would be from 13N decay. The 13N neutrino flux is about 3×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, and their average energy is ~0.71 MeV. The spectrum of 13N is a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in 700-800 keV would be a fraction of the total 13N flux. Let's approximate that maybe 50% of 13N neutrinos are in 700-800 keV. So, ~1.5×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1. In band 2 (800-900 keV), the Be-7 flux is 4.8×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1 (mono at 861 keV), and the 13N neutrinos in that band would be a smaller fraction. Let's say 800-900 keV is from 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. The 13N spectrum up to 1.2 MeV would have some contribution here. The 13N flux in 800-900 keV might be, say, 25% of the total 13N flux (since the average is 0.71 MeV, so the higher end would have fewer). So, 0.25×3×10^8 = 7.5×10^7. Then, total flux in band 2 would be Be-7 (4.8×10^9) plus 13N (7.5×10^7). So, approximately 4.875×10^9. The flux in band 1 would be 1.5×10^8. Then the ratio would be (1.5×10^8)/(4.875×10^9) ≈ 0.03. But wait, this is considering CNO contributions. However, the problem states that only the pp-III branch is stopped; all other reactions remain. So, the CNO cycle is part of the other reactions and continues. But in the Sun, the CNO cycle is a minor contributor compared to the pp chain. However, in the energy bands considered, the main contributor to band 2 is Be-7 (from pp-II), and to band 1, it's CNO (13N). But the problem says that flavor changes don't matter, so we can ignore neutrino oscillations. But the key point is that if pp-III stops, B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (band 2) remain. The CNO neutrinos (band 1 and 2) remain. But the CNO flux is much smaller than Be-7. So, in band 1, the flux would be dominated by CNO (13N), and in band 2, dominated by Be-7. Therefore, the ratio would be roughly (13N flux in band 1) / (Be-7 flux in band 2). If 13N flux in band 1 is ~1.5×10^8 and Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. But the problem might be expecting us to ignore CNO contributions, assuming they are negligible. If that's the case, then band 1 would have almost no flux, and the ratio would be approximately zero. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. But in the standard solar model, the CNO cycle contributes a small fraction. However, in the energy bands given, the Be-7 line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2. Band 1 (700-800 keV) would have some CNO neutrinos but no pp or B-8 neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio would be the CNO flux in band 1 divided by the Be-7 flux in band 2. Given that CNO flux is about 10% of Be-7 flux, and assuming that a fraction of CNO is in band 1, the ratio might be around 0.1 or less. But precise numbers would require knowing the exact neutrino spectra. However, the problem might be designed to recognize that stopping pp-III removes B-8 neutrinos, which have a continuous spectrum. But in the energy bands 700-900 keV, the dominant source is Be-7 (861 keV) in band 2. Band 1 would have negligible flux from other processes. Therefore, the ratio would be approximately zero. But the answer might not be zero. Let me think again. The pp-III branch produces B-8, which decays into neutrinos up to 15 MeV. The B-8 neutrino spectrum has a certain flux in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges. If pp-III stops, those B-8 neutrinos disappear. The remaining neutrinos in those bands would be from other sources. But the main source in band 2 is Be-7 (861 keV), and in band 1, there's nothing significant. Therefore, the ratio would be Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. However, the problem states that the pp-III branch is stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the time delay is negligible (Earth-Sun distance is about 8.3 light-minutes, so 8.5 minutes ago would mean the neutrinos produced after the shutdown haven't reached us yet. Wait, the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away. If the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the core after the shutdown would not have reached Earth yet. Therefore, the neutrinos we are receiving now were produced 8.5 minutes ago. But the pp-III branch has a timescale. The B-8 neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch, which involves the decay of B-8 with a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So, the production of B-8 neutrinos is almost instantaneous once the B-8 is formed. If the pp-III branch stops (i.e., the reaction producing B-8 stops), then B-8 would decay away within a few seconds. Therefore, 8.5 minutes is more than enough time for the B-8 neutrinos to cease. Therefore, the current neutrino flux would not include any B-8 neutrinos. So, the flux in both bands would be from other sources. But as before, band 2 has Be-7 (861 keV), and band 1 has CNO (13N) neutrinos. The ratio would then be (13N flux in band 1) / (Be-7 flux in band 2). If the 13N flux in band 1 is, say, 1.5×10^8 and Be-7 is 4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. But the problem might expect us to ignore CNO and consider that only Be-7 remains, making the ratio zero. However, the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. But in the standard solar model, the CNO flux is much smaller than Be-7. Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The pp-III branch produces B-8 neutrinos. If it stops, those neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) are unaffected. The Be-7 line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2. Therefore, band 2 has Be-7 neutrinos, and band 1 has nothing. So the ratio is zero. But the answer options might not include zero. Wait, the problem says "approximate ratio". If the answer is zero, but in reality, there's a tiny flux from CNO, but the question says "do not play a role here" regarding flavor changes. Maybe we are to assume that only the pp chain is considered. If pp-III is stopped, then B-8 neutrinos are gone. The Be-7 neutrinos are in band 2. The pp neutrinos are below 420 keV. Therefore, band 1 has no flux, band 2 has Be-7. So the ratio is zero. But the problem might expect that answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the pp-III branch is the one that produces B-8, which then decays into two He-4 and emits a neutrino. The B-8 decay produces a continuous spectrum. The Be-7 from pp-II produces a line at 861 keV. If pp-III stops, B-8 production stops, so the B-8 neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos remain. Therefore, in band 2 (800-900 keV), we have the Be-7 line at 861 keV. In band 1 (700-800 keV), there are no neutrinos from the pp chain. The CNO cycle might contribute, but the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. However, the CNO neutrinos (like from 13N decay) have a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The 13N neutrino average energy is about 0.71 MeV, so a significant portion would be in band 1. The flux of 13N is about 3×10^8 cm^-2 s^-1, while Be-7 is 4.8×10^9. So, the ratio would be (3×10^8)/(4.8×10^9) ≈ 0.0625, but considering that only part of the 13N spectrum is in band 1, say half, then ~1.5×10^8, ratio ~0.03. But the problem might not expect considering CNO, as it's part of the other reactions. However, the question specifically mentions that all other reactions remain, so CNO is included. But the original pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, and the CNO cycle is a separate process. If the problem assumes that only the pp chain is considered, then stopping pp-III would leave Be-7 and pp neutrinos. But pp neutrinos are below 420 keV. Therefore, band 1 has no flux, band 2 has Be-7. So ratio is zero. But the problem might expect that answer. However, the standard solar neutrino flux includes contributions from CNO even if small. But given the problem's phrasing, maybe we are to ignore CNO and consider only the pp chain branches. The question says "all other reactions remained as they were", so CNO is still there. But the answer might require knowing that Be-7 is in band 2 and nothing else, so ratio is zero. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the energy of Be-7 neutrinos. The electron capture in Be-7 produces a neutrino at 861 keV (0.861 MeV), which is within band 2 (800-900 keV). Therefore, band 2 has that line. Band 1 (700-800 keV) has no line sources. The only possible sources are the tails of other neutrino spectra. But B-8 is stopped, so their contribution is gone. The CNO neutrinos (13N) have a spectrum up to 1.2 MeV, so they would contribute to both bands. However, their flux is much lower than Be-7. If we consider the flux in band 1 as coming from 13N and band 2 from Be-7, the ratio would be roughly (13N flux * fraction in band 1) / (Be-7 flux). Assuming 13N flux is ~3×10^8, and Be-7 is ~5×10^9. If half of 13N is in band 1, then 1.5×10^8. The ratio is 1.5×10^8 / 5×10^9 = 0.03. So approximately 0.03. But the options might be 0.1, 0.03, or similar. However, the problem might expect the answer to be approximately zero, considering that CNO contribution is negligible. But given that the CNO flux is about 6% of Be-7 flux (3×10^8 vs 5×10^9), and part of that is in band 1, the ratio would be around 0.03. But the closest approximate answer would be 0.03, which is roughly 1/30. However, the problem might expect the answer to be zero. But since the question mentions "approximate ratio", and considering that in reality there is a small contribution from CNO, but the problem might be designed to ignore CNO and consider only the pp chain. In that case, the answer is zero. But the problem states that all other reactions remain, so CNO is still active. However, the original question is from the pp-III branch stopping. The pp-III is part of the pp chain, and the CNO cycle is a different process. If the problem assumes that the CNO cycle is negligible, then the answer is zero. But given that the CNO cycle is a separate process and the problem says all other reactions remain, including CNO, then the answer should consider CNO contributions. But without specific data on the exact neutrino fluxes in those bands, it's hard to be precise. However, given that the Be-7 flux is much larger than CNO fluxes, and the CNO contribution in band 1 is a fraction of their total flux, the ratio is likely small but non-zero. If forced to approximate, maybe the answer is around 0.1 or 0.03. But I need to recall the approximate neutrino fluxes. Let me check:

Standard solar model neutrino fluxes (from memory, in cm^-2 s^-1):

- pp: ~6×10^10

- pep: ~1.4×10^8

- Be-7: ~4.8×10^9

- B-8: ~5×10^6

- N-13: ~3×10^8

- O-15: ~2×10^8

- F-17: ~6×10^6

So, CNO total is ~5.06×10^8. Be-7 is 4.8×10^9. So CNO is about 10% of Be-7. Now, the 13N spectrum peaks around 0.7 MeV, so in band 1 (700-800 keV), a significant portion of 13N neutrinos would be there. Let's say half of the 13N flux is in band 1: 1.5×10^8. Then, band 1 flux is 1.5×10^8, band 2 is Be-7 (4.8×10^9) plus the remaining 13N in band 2. If 13N's spectrum up to 1.2 MeV, then from 800-900 keV, it's 0.8-0.9 MeV. The fraction of 13N neutrinos in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be the integral from 0.8 to 0.9 of the spectrum. The 13N spectrum is a beta decay spectrum with endpoint 1.2 MeV. The number of neutrinos in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be less than the number below 0.8 MeV. Let's approximate that 30% of 13N neutrinos are in 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, 0.3×3×10^8 = 9×10^7. Then, band 2 flux is Be-7 (4.8×10^9) + 9×10^7 ≈ 4.89×10^9. Band 1 flux is 1.5×10^8. The ratio is 1.5×10^8 / 4.89×10^9 ≈ 0.03. So approximately 3%. Therefore, the ratio is about 0.03, which is 3/100 or 1/33. But the problem asks for the approximate ratio. If the options are order-of-magnitude, 0.03 is ~0.03, which could be approximated as 0.03 or 1/30. However, the problem might expect the answer to be zero, assuming that CNO is negligible. But given the problem's phrasing that all other reactions remain, including CNO, the answer should consider CNO. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 0.03. But since the problem is hypothetical and possibly simplified, the intended answer might be zero. However, given the data, I think the correct approximate ratio is about 0.03, so the answer is approximately 0.03, which is 3/100. But the problem might expect a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the B-8 neutrinos contribute to both bands. If pp-III is stopped, those contributions disappear. Let's calculate the ratio before and after. Before stopping pp-III, the flux in band 1 and 2 would have contributions from B-8 and Be-7. After stopping, only Be-7 remains in band 2 and CNO in band 1. But the question is about the ratio after the stop. If before the stop, the flux in band 1 would be B-8 and CNO, and band 2 would be B-8 and Be-7. But the problem is about the ratio after the stop. So, post-stop, band 1: CNO (mostly 13N), band 2: Be-7. The ratio is CNO_band1 / Be7_band2. Given that CNO_band1 is ~1.5×10^8 and Be7_band2 is ~4.8×10^9, the ratio is ~0.03. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.03, which is roughly 1/30. But the problem might want the answer as "approximately 0.03" or "about 0.03". However, since the user hasn't provided options, but asks to write the ratio, I should state it as approximately 0.03. But maybe the answer is zero. Given the ambiguity, but based on calculations considering CNO, the ratio is approximately 0.03. However, another angle: the time factor. The pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The Sun is 8.3 light-minutes away. So, neutrinos take about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. If the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the last neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch would have had 8.5 - 8.3 = 0.2 minutes to escape the Sun. But the Sun's core is dense, and neutrinos escape immediately. However, the B-8 production involves a timescale. The B-8 is produced via Be-7 + p → B-8 + gamma. The B-8 then decays with a half-life of ~0.77 seconds. So, if the pp-III branch stops (i.e., no more B-8 production), the existing B-8 would decay within seconds. Therefore, after 8.5 minutes, all B-8 would have decayed, and no B-8 neutrinos would be arriving. Therefore, the current flux has no B-8 contribution. Thus, the flux in band 1 and 2 is from other sources. As before, band 2 has Be-7, band 1 has CNO. The ratio is ~0.03. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.03, which is 3/100. But the problem might expect this as 0.03 or 1/30. However, in terms of order of magnitude, it's about 0.03. So, the flux ratio is approximately 0.03. But since the question says "approximate", maybe round to 0.03 or 0.1. But given the calculation, 0.03 is more accurate. However, in some contexts, people approximate CNO as ~10% of Be-7, so if band 1 has half of CNO, that's 5%, so 0.05. But my earlier estimate was 0.03. Given the uncertainty, the safest approximate answer is that the ratio is approximately 0.03, so the answer is \boxed{0.03}.

So, band 2 would have the Be-7 neutrinos, and band 1 would have none. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be approximately zero. But wait, the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So, pp-III is stopped, but pp-II and pp-I continue. The Be-7 neutrinos are part of pp-II, so they should still be present. The B-8 neutrinos (from pp-III) are gone. The B-8 neutrinos have a higher energy spectrum, but the question is about 700-900 keV. The Be-7 line is at 861 keV, so in band 2. The B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum, but their flux in the 700-900 keV range might be non-zero. Wait, but B-8 decay produces neutrinos up to ~15 MeV, but the spectrum peaks at higher energies. The flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range from B-8 might be low. However, if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 production stops. Since B-8 has a half-life of about 0.8 seconds, the neutrinos from B-8 would stop almost immediately (within seconds) after the reaction stops. Since the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is 510 seconds, much longer than the half-life, so B-8 neutrinos would have decayed away. Therefore, the only neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be the Be-7 line at 861 keV. So, band 2 (800-900 keV) includes the Be-7 line, while band 1 (700-800 keV) does not. Therefore, the flux in band 1 would be zero (or negligible from other sources), and band 2 would have the Be-7 flux. Hence, the ratio would be approximately zero. But the problem states "very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos...)", but if the pp-III is stopped, the B-8 neutrinos are gone, but the Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) are still present. So, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be the Be-7 neutrinos, and band 1 (700-800 keV) would have no neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio would be Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ 0. However, the problem might be considering that the pp-III branch is responsible for some neutrinos in these bands. Wait, but the Be-7 neutrinos are part of pp-II, not pp-III. So, if pp-III is stopped, but pp-II continues, then Be-7 neutrinos are still there. So, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is from Be-7, and band 1 (700-800 keV) has no neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio is zero. But maybe there are other sources. Let me check. The pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) produces a neutrino line at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than the bands considered. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos up to about 1.2 MeV (for N-13 and O-15 decays), but their flux is much lower than the pp chain. So, in the absence of B-8 neutrinos, the only significant flux in 800-900 keV is Be-7. Therefore, the ratio would be approximately zero. But the answer might not be zero. Let me check the exact energy of Be-7 neutrinos. The electron capture of Be-7 produces a neutrino at 0.861 MeV (861 keV), which is within band 2 (800-900 keV). Therefore, band 2 has the full flux from Be-7, and band 1 has no flux. So, the ratio is Flux1/Flux2 = 0. But the problem says "approximate ratio". If there\'s any other contribution, maybe from CNO in band 1? For example, N-13 decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV, but the flux is about 100 times less than Be-7. So, even if there\'s a small contribution, the ratio would be very small. But the question says "all other reactions remained as they were". So, if CNO is still active, but the flux from CNO in 700-800 keV is negligible compared to Be-7. Therefore, the ratio is approximately zero. But the answer options might expect a ratio of 0. So, the answer is approximately zero. But maybe the question is a trick. If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the pp-II and pp-I continue. The pp-III is responsible for B-8 neutrinos. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum that extends down to lower energies. Let me check the B-8 neutrino spectrum. The B-8 decay produces a continuous spectrum with maximum energy around 15 MeV, but the flux decreases with lower energy. The differential flux at 0.7-0.9 MeV might be non-zero. However, compared to the Be-7 line, which is a single energy, the B-8 contribution in that range might be lower. But if the pp-III is stopped, then B-8 production stops. Since B-8 has a half-life of ~0.8 seconds, after 8.5 minutes, all B-8 would have decayed. Therefore, the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be present. Therefore, the only neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range are from Be-7. The 0.7-0.8 MeV range would have no significant flux. Therefore, the ratio is zero. But maybe the question is expecting the ratio of the remaining fluxes. If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the pp-II continues, so Be-7 neutrinos are still there. So, band 2 has Be-7 neutrinos, band 1 has nothing, so the ratio is zero. Therefore, the answer is approximately zero. But in reality, the Be-7 neutrino line is at 861 keV, which is in band 2. So, band 2 has that line, and band 1 has nothing. Therefore, the ratio is zero. But maybe the problem is considering that the pp-III branch produces some neutrinos in those bands. Wait, pp-III is the branch that produces B-8, which then decays into two He-4 and emits a high-energy neutrino. The B-8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV, but their flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is non-zero. However, if the pp-III branch is stopped, then B-8 is no longer produced, so those neutrinos disappear. The Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) are still present. So, in band 2 (800-900 keV), you have the Be-7 line. In band 1 (700-800 keV), you have nothing. Therefore, the ratio is zero. But maybe there\'s a mistake here. Let me check the energy of the Be-7 neutrino again. Yes, it\'s 861 keV, which is in band 2. So, band 2 has flux, band 1 doesn\'t. Therefore, the ratio is zero. But the problem says "approximate ratio". If the answer is zero, but maybe the options are given as numbers. However, since the user hasn\'t provided options, I need to state the ratio. So, the answer is approximately zero. But maybe the question is expecting a ratio of 1, but that would be if both bands had the same flux. Alternatively, if the pp-III branch contributes to both bands, but stopping it removes that contribution. Wait, but the pp-III branch\'s neutrinos (B-8) have a spectrum that includes the 700-900 keV range. If the pp-III is stopped, then the B-8 neutrinos in those bands would disappear. However, the Be-7 neutrinos (from pp-II) are still present in band 2. So, prior to stopping pp-III, the flux in band 1 would have some B-8 neutrinos, and band 2 would have B-8 and Be-7. After stopping pp-III, band 2 has only Be-7, and band 1 has nothing. Therefore, the ratio would be Flux1/Flux2 = 0 / (Be-7 flux). But the question is about the ratio after stopping pp-III, so the answer is zero. However, maybe the Be-7 flux is present only in band 2, and band 1 has no flux. Therefore, the ratio is zero. So, the answer is approximately zero. But in the context of an exam question, maybe the answer is 0. However, the problem states "approximate ratio". If there\'s any other source, like pep neutrinos, but they are at 1.44 MeV. CNO neutrinos (N-13, O-15) have endpoints at ~1.2 MeV, but their flux is much lower. So, even if there\'s a small contribution in band 1 from CNO, the ratio would be very small. But the problem says "approximate", so the answer is approximately zero. Therefore, the ratio is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745448034, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2390, prompt_tokens=930, total_tokens=3320, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves determining the ratio of neutrino fluxes between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. Here's the key reasoning:

1. **Understanding the pp-III Branch**: The pp-III branch produces boron-8 (B-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. However, the B-8 neutrinos would no longer be produced if the pp-III branch stops. Given B-8's short half-life (~0.8 seconds), these neutrinos would decay away within seconds after the reaction stops.

2. **Other Neutrino Sources**: 
   - The pp-II branch produces beryllium-7 (Be-7) neutrinos, which are monoenergetic at 861 keV. This energy falls within the 800-900 keV band (band 2).
   - The pp-I branch and CNO cycle neutrinos do not contribute significantly to the 700-900 keV range. The pp-I neutrinos have lower energies (up to ~0.42 MeV), and CNO neutrinos, while present, have much lower flux compared to the pp chain.

3. **Flux Analysis**:
   - After stopping the pp-III branch, the B-8 neutrinos (which could contribute to both bands) are absent.
   - The Be-7 neutrinos (861 keV) from the pp-II branch are still present and fall within band 2 (800-900 keV).
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) does not receive significant contributions from any remaining neutrino sources (pp-I, CNO, or pp-II).

Thus, the flux in band 1 is negligible compared to band 2, leading to a ratio of approximately zero.

\boxed{0}
