# Original Question

You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to the **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** flanking the receptor-eGFP fusion. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand is fused to mCherry via a **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette, while the receptor is fused to eGFP via a **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette.
   - **Cre recombinase** (from SOX10-Cre mice) specifically recognizes **loxP** sites, not the mutant **lox2272** sites. 

2. **Mechanism**:
   - In SOX10-Cre-expressing cells, Cre excises the **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette, allowing ligand-mCherry fusion expression (red signal).
   - The **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette remains intact because Cre cannot act on lox2272. This prevents receptor-eGFP fusion expression, resulting in no green signal.

3. **Validation**:
   - In vitro Western blotting detected ligand and receptor proteins (without fluorescent tags) because the stop cassettes block fusion protein translation. Actin-normalized signals confirmed proper expression.
   - In vivo, the lack of eGFP is not due to expression failure of the receptor itself but the unexcised stop cassette blocking eGFP translation.

**Conclusion**: The receptor's lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is incompatible with Cre recombinase, leaving the eGFP silenced. This explains the absence of green fluorescence despite successful ligand-mCherry expression.

Okay, let's try to figure out why there's no green fluorescence in the mice. So, the setup is a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step. 

First, the construct they made is a bicistronic vector, which means it has two genes (ligand and receptor) under the same promoter but with some regulatory elements. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP. The promoter for the ligand is CBA, and the receptor is under an IRES. IRES usually allows for cap-independent translation, so the receptor should be expressed after the ligand, but maybe at a lower level? 

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These stop cassettes are probably there to prevent the fluorescent proteins from being expressed unless Cre recombinase is present, which would excise the stop codon. 

They transfected the plasmid into astrocytes and did a Western blot. The total proteins show signal proportional to actin, which is a loading control. But when they bred the mice homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show green fluorescence. 

Wait, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, right? So the Cre should be active in cells where SOX10 is expressed, which would be the neural crest derivatives. The idea is that Cre would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But they don't see green. 

Possible reasons: 

1. Maybe the Cre isn't active in the right cells. But SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest cells. If the construct is in the same cells, Cre should excise the stops. 

2. The IRES might not be working properly. If the receptor is after the IRES, maybe the IRES isn't functional in the mice, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in the plasmid transfection into astrocytes, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the Western blot showed the proteins, then the IRES must be working in vitro. But in vivo, maybe the IRES is not active in the neural crest cells? That's possible. IRES elements can be cell-type specific. 

3. The stop cassettes: The ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. But lox2272 is a mutant variant with different specificity. Wait, Cre only acts on loxP, not lox2272. So if the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, then Cre from SOX10-Cre wouldn't excise that stop cassette. Therefore, the eGFP (receptor fusion) would remain suppressed, while the ligand's mCherry would be expressed if the loxP-stop is removed. 

Wait, but the question says they don't observe green signal. If the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, and the Cre is from SOX10-Cre, which uses regular Cre, then the lox2272 sites wouldn't be recognized. Therefore, the stop cassette remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. But the ligand's stop cassette is loxP, so Cre would remove that, allowing mCherry to be expressed. So maybe the red signal is present, but green isn't. 

But the question states that in the Western blot after plasmid transfection, they used antibodies and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, but the plasmid in vitro would have the stop cassettes unless they used Cre in the transfection. Wait, no—if they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes without Cre, then the stop cassettes would still be there. Unless the plasmid was designed such that the stop cassettes are only in the transgenic mice. Wait, no—the construct as described has the stop cassettes in the vector. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, unless they co-transfected Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. But they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Wait, the ligand and receptor ORFs are before the stop cassettes. So the ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter, followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is after the ligand ORF), and the mCherry is not. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, so after the ligand, but the receptor ORF is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272 and then eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor would be expressed (since the stop is after the receptor ORF), and eGFP is not. 

Wait, no. Let me clarify the construct structure. The ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP. 

So, in the absence of Cre, the stop codon is present between the ligand and mCherry, so the ligand is expressed (because the stop is after the ligand ORF), and mCherry is not. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop before eGFP, so the receptor is expressed (without eGFP). 

But when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they would detect the ligand and receptor proteins (without the fluorescent tags) because the stops prevent the fusion proteins from being made. But in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So maybe they saw the ligand and receptor proteins at levels proportional to actin, indicating proper expression. 

In the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the loxP sites in the ligand-mCherry cassette, allowing mCherry to be fused to the ligand. Similarly, if the receptor's cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre (since Cre only acts on loxP), then the eGFP would remain unexpressed. 

Therefore, the green fluorescence (eGFP) isn't observed because the lox2272 sites aren't recombined by Cre, so the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. The mCherry would be expressed if the loxP sites are recombined. But the question says there's no green signal. So the answer is that the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre, so the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is not functional in the mice, but in the plasmid transfection, the IRES worked. But the Western blot in astrocytes would have shown the receptor expression (since the stop is after the receptor ORF, so the receptor is expressed without eGFP). So the problem in the mice is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 isn't recombined. 

Another possibility: The Cre is expressed, but the lox2272 sites require a different recombinase, like Dre, but the question says they used Cre. So the answer is that the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is not recognized by Cre, so the eGFP remains silenced.

Let's examine why there's no green fluorescence in the mice by analyzing the experimental setup methodically.

The researchers created a bicistronic vector containing two genes (ligand and receptor) controlled by a single promoter with specific regulatory elements. The ligand is positioned at the 5' end and fused to mCherry, while the receptor is at the 3' end connected to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is regulated by an IRES element, which typically enables cap-independent translation. This suggests the receptor should be expressed after the ligand, possibly at reduced levels.

A loxP-stop-loxP cassette is inserted between the ligand ORF and mCherry. Similarly, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette exists between the receptor and eGFP. These stop cassettes presumably prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre recombinase is present to excise the stop codons.

The researchers transfected the plasmid into astrocytes and performed a Western blot analysis. The total protein signals were proportional to actin, which served as a loading control. However, when they bred mice homozygous for the construct and crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice, the resulting offspring didn't exhibit green fluorescence.

It's worth noting that SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre recombinase should be active in neural crest derivatives. Theoretically, Cre should remove the stop cassettes, enabling expression of both mCherry and eGFP. Yet, green fluorescence is absent.

Some potential explanations include:

1. The Cre recombinase might not be active in the appropriate cells, although SOX10-Cre should be functioning in neural crest cells. If the construct is present in these same cells, Cre should be able to excise the

# OpenAI completion

Let's attempt to determine why the mice aren't exhibiting green fluorescence. The setup is somewhat intricate, so let's simplify it step by step.

Firstly, the construct they designed is a bicistronic vector, meaning it includes two genes (a ligand and a receptor) under the same promoter with some regulatory components. The ligand is located at the 5' end and is fused to mCherry, while the receptor is positioned at the 3' end with eGFP. The ligand is regulated by the CBA promoter, whereas the receptor is controlled by an IRES, which generally permits cap-independent translation. Therefore, the receptor is expected to be expressed subsequent to the ligand, but possibly at a reduced level.

Inserted between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These stop cassettes are likely intended to block the expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre recombinase is present to excise the stop codons.

The researchers transfected the plasmid into astrocytes and performed a Western blot. The total proteins exhibit a signal proportional to actin, serving as a loading control. However, when they bred mice homozygous for the construct and crossed them with SOX10-Cre, the offspring did not display green fluorescence.

Hold on, SOX10 is known to be expressed in neural crest cells, correct? Thus, Cre should be active in cells where SOX10 is expressed, namely the derivatives of neural crest cells. The expectation was that Cre would remove the stop cassettes, enabling the expression of mCherry and eGFP, yet no green fluorescence is observed.

Possible explanations:

1. Perhaps Cre isn't functioning in the appropriate cells. However, SOX10-Cre is intended to be active in neural crest cells. If the construct is also present in these cells, Cre should be removing the blockade.

2. **Cre Activity**:
   - SOX10-Cre excises **only the loxP cassette** upstream of mCherry, allowing ligand-mCherry expression in SOX10+ cells.
   - The **lox2272 cassette** upstream of eGFP remains unexcised because SOX10-Cre cannot act on lox2272. This leaves the stop codon in place, preventing receptor-eGFP translation.

3. **Outcome**:
   - Red fluorescence (mCherry) would be observed in SOX10+ cells due to successful loxP excision.
   - Green fluorescence (eGFP) is absent because the lox2272-stop cassette blocks receptor-eGFP expression.

**Conclusion**: The mismatch between the Cre recombinase (specific to loxP) and the lox2272 cassette prevents removal of the stop codon upstream of eGFP, resulting in no green signal.

The reason is that the Cre used (SOX10-Cre) doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites, so the stop cassette before eGFP isn't removed, preventing eGFP expression. 

Therefore, the most likely reason is that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by the Cre recombinase expressed under the SOX10 promoter, so the receptor-eGFP fusion is not produced.

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to **the Cre recombinase failing to excise the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** in the receptor-eGFP construct. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Construct Design**:  
   - The ligand-mCherry fusion is controlled by a **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette, while the receptor-eGFP fusion uses a **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette.  
   - **Cre recombinase** (from SOX10-Cre mice) specifically recognizes **loxP** sites but **cannot act on lox2272**, a mutant variant with a different sequence.  

2. **In Vivo Outcome**:  
   - In neural crest-derived cells (where SOX10-Cre is active), Cre excises the **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette, enabling ligand-mCherry expression (red fluorescence).  
   - The **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette remains intact because Cre does not recognize lox2272. This prevents receptor-eGFP expression, resulting in no green signal.  

3. **Western Blot Discrepancy**:  
   - In vitro transfection (astrocytes) likely bypassed the stop cassettes (e.g., via transient Cre expression or constitutive promoters), allowing receptor-eGFP detection. In vivo, the dependency on Cre-mediated excision highlights the incompatibility between lox2272 and standard Cre.  

**Conclusion**: The receptor-eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 cassette is not recognized by Cre recombinase, leaving its stop codon intact. This explains the absence of green fluorescence despite proper ligand-mCherry expression.

stops. However, if there's a temporal or spatial mismatch between SOX10 expression and the construct's activation, this could be an issue.

2. The IRES element might not be functioning correctly. IRES elements can sometimes be inefficient, leading to lower expression of the downstream gene (the receptor in this case). However, the Western blot in transfected astrocytes showed proper expression, suggesting the IRES works in vitro. But in vivo, there might be differences in IRES efficiency or other regulatory factors.

3. The lox2272 cassette might not be recognized by Cre. However, lox2272 is a mutant variant of loxP that is compatible with Cre, but it's possible that the specific Cre used (SOX10-Cre) doesn't target lox2272. Wait, no—Cre recombinase acts on loxP sites, but lox2272 is a different variant. If the construct uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop cassette, then Cre (which targets loxP) would not excise it.
