To find the relative speed and the total energy of the system of two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively in the same direction, we proceed as follows:

### Relative Speed Calculation:
The relative speed between two objects moving at velocities \(u\) and \(v\) in the same direction in the context of special relativity is given by the formula:
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):
\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

### Total Energy Calculation:
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

Summing the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}\).

Okay, so I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system with two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. Hmm, let's start with the relative speed first. 

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't just the difference in speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Because when things are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them. There's a formula for adding velocities. But wait, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, maybe the relative speed is the difference? But no, that's not how it works. Let me recall the velocity addition formula. 

The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So if one is moving at u = 0.6c and the other at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed from the perspective of the slower astronaut (0.5c) would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.143c. Is that right? Let me check the formula again. Yes, the relative velocity formula is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²) if they are moving in opposite directions, but here they are moving in the same direction, so it's (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So yes, that calculation seems correct. So the relative speed is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.143c. 

But wait, the problem says "relative speed". So maybe they just want the magnitude, so 0.143c. Let me note that. 

Now, the total energy of the system. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, their energies would be the sum of their relativistic energies. The total energy is the sum of each astronaut's rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma*mc² for each object. So for each astronaut, calculate gamma and multiply by their rest mass and c², then add them together. 

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Therefore, energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5mc². 

For the second astronaut, mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma here is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc². 

Therefore, total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc². Rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, since the velocities are given to two significant figures, maybe we should present it as approximately 5.96mc² or 5.96mc². But let me check the exact values. 

Wait, 1/sqrt(0.75) is exactly 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 3m * c² * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.4641mc². So exact form would be 2.5mc² + 2sqrt(3)mc². But maybe they want it in terms of exact fractions or decimals. The problem says "total energy of the system", so probably as a numerical coefficient times mc². So 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641, so approximately 5.96 mc². 

But let me check if there's another way. Wait, in some cases, when you have a system of particles, the total energy isn't just the sum of their individual energies because of potential energy, but in special relativity, if they are non-interacting and far apart, then the total energy is just the sum. Since the problem doesn't mention any interaction between them, we can assume that the total energy is additive. So yes, adding their relativistic energies is correct. 

So, to recap: relative speed is approximately 0.143c, and total energy is approximately 5.96mc². Let me check the exact value for the relative speed. The calculation was (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/10)c / (7/10) = 1/7 c ≈ 0.142857c, which is exactly 1/7 c. So maybe we can write it as (1/7)c or approximately 0.143c. 

So the exact relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.142857c. So that's exactly c/7. So maybe better to write it as c/7. But the problem says "relative speed", so perhaps they want the answer in terms of c. So c/7 is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.143c. 

But let me check the velocity addition formula again. Suppose we are in the rest frame of the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c). Then the velocity of the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c) in this frame is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6)(0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. So yes, exactly c/7. So the relative speed is c/7. So that's exact. So maybe the answer should be c/7. 

But sometimes, in some contexts, relative speed is considered as the speed of one in the rest frame of the other, which is what we calculated. So that's correct. 

So the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is 2.5mc² + (2sqrt(3))mc². Let's compute 2.5 + 2sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2*1.732 ≈ 3.464. So 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964. So approximately 5.964mc². 

But maybe we can write it in exact terms. 2.5 is 5/2, and 2sqrt(3) is 2sqrt(3). So total energy is (5/2 + 2sqrt(3))mc². If we want to combine them, it's (5 + 4sqrt(3))/2 mc². But that might not be necessary. The problem might accept the decimal approximation. 

Alternatively, since 1/sqrt(0.75) is 2/sqrt(3), so 3m * c² * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3) m c². So E2 is 2sqrt(3) m c². And E1 is 2.5 m c². So total energy is (2.5 + 2sqrt(3)) m c². 

But maybe the problem expects the numerical value. Let me compute 2.5 + 2*1.732 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964. So approximately 5.96 mc². 

So summarizing: 

Relative speed: c/7 ≈ 0.143c 

Total energy: approximately 5.96 mc² 

But let me check if the problem wants the exact expressions or decimal approximations. The problem states "two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c". Since the velocities are given as decimals, maybe the answer should also be in decimals. But for the relative speed, c/7 is exact, but 0.6c and 0.5c are exact in the problem statement. Wait, 0.6 and 0.5 are exact decimals. So c/7 is exact, but 0.142857c is approximate. Hmm. Maybe they want the exact value. Let me see. 

If the problem is from a textbook or an exam, sometimes they prefer exact fractions. Since c/7 is exact, maybe that's the answer. Similarly, for the total energy, 2.5 is 5/2, and 2sqrt(3) is exact. So total energy is (5/2 + 2sqrt(3)) mc². But maybe they want a numerical coefficient. Let me check. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the total energy to be calculated using gamma for each and then added. Let me recheck the gamma calculations. 

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc². Correct. 

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 3m * (2 / sqrt(3)) c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.464 mc². 

So total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². If we factor out mc², it's (2.5 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². 

But 2.5 is 5/2, so 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3) = (5 + 4 sqrt(3))/2. So exact form is (5 + 4 sqrt(3))/2 mc². But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, leave it as 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964. 

Given that the problem gives velocities to two significant figures (0.6 and 0.5), maybe the answers should be to two significant figures as well. But 0.6 and 0.5 are one decimal place with one significant figure? Wait, 0.6 is one significant figure, 0.5 is also one. So maybe the answers should be to one significant figure. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, since 0.6 and 0.5 have two decimal places but one significant figure. Hmm, actually, leading zeros don't count, so 0.6 and 0.5 have one significant figure each. Therefore, the relative speed would be 0.1c (one significant figure), but we calculated c/7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c (two significant figures). Hmm, this is a conflict. 

Wait, maybe the problem expects two significant figures because 0.6 and 0.5 are given to one decimal place, which can be considered as two significant figures if the trailing zero is counted, but actually, 0.6 is 6 x 10^-1, one significant figure. Similarly, 0.5 is one significant figure. So perhaps the answers should be to one significant figure. But 0.1c is 0.1 times c, but our calculation is approximately 0.14c, which is two significant figures. Maybe the problem expects two significant figures. Alternatively, the exact value c/7 is better. 

In any case, since the problem is about relativistic speeds, and the velocities are given as 0.6c and 0.5c, which are exact values (presumably exact in the problem's context), then the relative speed is exactly c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². But maybe the problem expects decimal answers. 

Alternatively, check if the total energy can be written as a single fraction. Let's compute 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3). 5/2 is 2.5, 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 3.464. So total is approximately 5.964, which is roughly 6.0 mc² if we round to two significant figures. But 5.964 is three significant figures. Since the given masses are 2m and 3m, which are exact, and velocities 0.6c and 0.5c, which are one decimal place, maybe the answer should be given to two decimal places. 

But I think in physics problems, unless specified, it's common to give answers to the same number of significant figures as the given data. Here, the velocities are given to one significant figure (0.6 and 0.5), masses are given as 2m and 3m, which are exact. So maybe the relative speed should be given to one significant figure: 0.1c. But our exact calculation is c/7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c (two significant figures). Hmm. 

Alternatively, since the masses are exact (2m and 3m), but velocities are given to one significant figure, the answers should be to one significant figure. So relative speed is 0.1c, total energy is 6mc². But that seems too approximate. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects more precise answers. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the relative speed is c/7 and the total energy is (5/2 + 2sqrt(3)) mc², and expects those exact forms. Let me see. 

If I write the relative speed as c/7, that's exact. For the total energy, 5/2 + 2sqrt(3) is also exact. Alternatively, combining them over a common denominator: (5 + 4sqrt(3))/2. But that might not be necessary. 

Alternatively, the problem might accept decimal answers. So relative speed: approximately 0.143c, total energy approximately 5.96mc². 

But let me check with exact values. 

Relative speed: c/7. 

Total energy: 2.5 mc² + 2sqrt(3) mc². 

So if the question expects symbolic answers, maybe they want c/7 and (5/2 + 2sqrt(3))mc². But if they want decimal numbers, then 0.143c and 5.96mc². 

Given that the problem mentions "relativistic speeds" and asks for "relative speed and the total energy", it's likely expecting the exact relativistic addition for velocity and the sum of the relativistic energies. 

Therefore, the answers are: 

Relative speed: c/7 

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)mc² 

But let me verify once more. 

For the relative speed: using the velocity addition formula. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame, then the speed of A as seen from B's frame is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. So that's exact. 

For the total energy: each astronaut's energy is gamma*mc². For the first astronaut, gamma is 1.25, so 2m * 1.25 = 2.5mc². For the second astronaut, gamma is 2/sqrt(3), so 3m * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3)m c². Therefore, total energy is 2.5mc² + 2sqrt(3)mc². 

Yes, that's correct. So unless they want a decimal approximation, the exact forms are c/7 and (2.5 + 2√3)mc². 

But maybe the problem expects the numerical values. Let's compute 2.5 + 2*1.732 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964. So approximately 5.96 mc². 

So final answers: 

Relative speed: c/7 or approximately 0.143c 

Total energy: approximately 5.96 mc² 

But since the problem might want exact terms, I should present both answers in exact form unless specified otherwise. 

Alternatively, check if the problem is from a textbook or standard question. For example, sometimes total energy is asked in terms of mc², so writing coefficients accordingly. 

In summary, after careful calculation: 

- The relative speed between the two astronauts is c/7. 

- The total energy of the system is (5/2 + 2√3) mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². 

Therefore, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3) mc². But since the problem may prefer decimal approximations, 0.143c and 5.96mc². 

But to be precise, since c/7 is exact and preferable in exact terms, and the energy can be left in terms of sqrt(3) unless a decimal is required. 

I think the problem expects the exact forms. So I'll go with c/7 and (5/2 + 2√3) mc². 

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

Okay, so I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system with two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. Hmm, let's start with the relative speed first.

So approximately 0.143c. Is that right? Let me check the formula again. Yes, the relative velocity formula is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²) if they are moving in opposite directions, but here they are moving in the same direction, so it's (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So yes, that calculation seems correct. So the relative speed is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.143c.

For the second astronaut, mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma here is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc². 

Therefore, total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc². Rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, since the velocities are given to two significant figures, maybe we should present it as approximately 5.96mc² or 5.96mc². But let me check the exact values. 

Wait, 1/sqrt(0.75) is exactly 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 3m * c² * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.4641mc². So exact form would be 2.5mc² + 2sqrt(3)mc².

I need to determine the relative speed and total energy of a system with two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction.

For the relative speed, I should remember that in special relativity, we can't simply subtract velocities. I need to use the velocity addition formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²).

With u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c, the relative speed from the perspective of the slower astronaut would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c or approximately 0.143c.

For the total energy, I need to calculate each astronaut's relativistic energy and sum them. The relativistic energy formula is E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c:
γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25
E₁ = 1.25 × 2m × c² = 2.5mc²

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c:
γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 1/√0.75 ≈ 1.1547
E₂ = 1.1547 × 3m × c² ≈ 3.4641mc²

The exact value for γ in the second calculation is 2/√3, making E₂ = 2√3mc².

Therefore, the total energy of the system is E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc², or approximately 5.96mc².

Alright, I need to determine the relative speed and total energy of a system involving two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they move in the same direction at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. Let's begin with the relative speed.

In special relativity, relative speed isn't simply the difference in speeds as it is in classical mechanics. We can't just subtract the velocities because they're relativistic. There's a formula for adding velocities. But since both are moving in the same direction, it might seem like we could subtract them, but that's incorrect. I need to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula to find the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So, if one is moving at u = 0.6c and the other at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed from the slower astronaut's perspective (0.5c) would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, or approximately 0.143c. Does that seem correct? Let me verify the formula again. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) when both move in the same direction, so the calculation looks accurate, with the relative speed being about 0.1428c, roughly 0.143c.

However, since the problem requests "relative speed," they might mean the magnitude, so 0.143c should be noted. 

Next, consider the total energy of the system. Given that they are moving at relativistic speeds, their energies will be the sum of their relativistic energies. The total energy is the sum of each astronaut's rest mass energy and kinetic energy, where in relativity, total energy equals gamma*mc² for each. So, calculate gamma for each astronaut and multiply it by their rest mass and c², then add the outcomes.

For the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c, Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v = 0.6c, v²/c² = 0.36, and thus 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. The energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5mc².

For the second astronaut, with mass 3m and speed 0.5c, Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Therefore, E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641mc².

The total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² ≈ 5.9641mc². Given that the velocities have two significant figures, we should approximate this to about 5.96mc². Let me verify the exact figures.

Now, 1/sqrt(0.75) is exactly 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So, E2 = 3m * c² * 2/sqrt(3) = 6m c² / sqrt(3) = 2sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.4641mc². Thus, the exact total would be 2.5mc² + 2sqrt(3)mc². But if expressed numerically as a coefficient times mc², it would be approximately 5.96 mc².

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts, we proceed as follows:

**Relative Speed Calculation:**
The astronauts are moving in the same direction with velocities \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula for relative speed:
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]

**Total Energy Calculation:**
The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 = \frac{5}{4}
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

Summing the energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

**Final Answer:**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

However, if we use exact expressions, it's (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

But since the problem might prefer exact terms, I should present the total energy as (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Let me check the exact calculation again.

Wait, for the second astronaut, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(3/4) = 2/√3. So E₂ = 3m * (2/√3)c² = (6/√3)m c² = 2√3 m c². Similarly, E₁ is 2m * (5/4)c²? Wait, no. Wait, 0.6c gives γ = 1.25, so 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c². So total energy is 2.5 m c² + 2√3 m c². Since 2.5 is 5/2, so 5/2 + 2√3. That's the exact expression. So the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Numerically, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

But the problem says "total energy of the system". Since they are moving in the same direction, but their energies are calculated in the same frame (assuming we are calculating in the lab frame where their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c). So yes, the total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies in that frame.

So the answers are relative speed ≈ 0.143c and total energy ≈ 5.96mc², or exact expressions as (0.1c)/(0.7) and (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

Wait, but the relative speed formula: when both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is calculated using the velocity addition formula. Let me confirm that. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B at 0.5c, then in astronaut B's frame, the speed of astronaut A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if we were to compute the speed of B in A's frame, it would be negative, but the magnitude would be the same. So the relative speed is approximately 0.143c.

So the final answers are relative speed: (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c, and total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Let me compute 5/2 + 2√3. 5/2 is 2.5, 2√3 is approximately 3.464. So total is approximately 5.964, which rounds to 5.96mc². But exact form is better. So the exact relative speed is c/7 ≈ 0.1429c, and total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

Wait, 0.1/0.7 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857... So the relative speed is exactly (1/7)c. So that's a better way to present it. So relative speed is c/7, and total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc².

Yes, that's correct. So the answer for relative speed is c/7, and total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². Let me check the arithmetic again.

Yes, 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6)(0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. So that's exact. So relative speed is c/7. For the energy, first astronaut: γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 5/4. So E₁ = 2m * (5/4)c² = (5/2)mc². Second astronaut: γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1/sqrt(3/4) = 2/sqrt(3) = 2√3/3. Wait, 2/sqrt(3) is equal to 2√3/3. So E₂ = 3m * (2√3/3)c² = 2√3 mc². So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². That's exact. So that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

E2 = 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) * c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.464 mc². So, the total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². If we want to combine these terms, we can factor out mc²: (2.5 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if we rationalize, 2.5 is 5/2, so 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3).

It says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So, perhaps both answers need to be in boxed format. The relative speed is approximately 0.143c, but exact value is (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.142857c. So, exact value is (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c. So, maybe write it as (1/7)c or 0.143c. For the energy, if exact, (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if decimal, approximately 5.96 mc². Let me check if the problem expects symbolic or numerical. The problem says "two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m" so m is a variable. So, the answer should be in terms of m and c. So, exact expressions. Therefore, relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. So, exact relative speed is c/7. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7. So, 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7. Therefore, the relative speed is c/7. That\'s exact. So, that\'s better. So, the relative speed is c/7. Then, the total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, combining terms, (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, factor out mc². So, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Let me confirm the velocity addition again. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then the velocity of A relative to B is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. Yes, that\'s correct. So, the relative speed is c/7. For the total energy, since each astronaut\'s energy is gamma*m*c². For the first astronaut, gamma is 1.25, so 2m*1.25*c² = 2.5 mc². For the second astronaut, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 2/sqrt(3). So, 3m*(2/sqrt(3))c² = (6/sqrt(3))mc² = 2*sqrt(3) mc². Therefore, total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, combining these terms, we can write it as (2.5 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3) all multiplied by mc². So, that\'s the exact answer. If we want to write it as a single fraction, 5/2 is 2.5, and 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 3.464, but since the problem doesn\'t specify, we can leave it in exact form. Therefore, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Let me check once more. Velocity addition: yes, same direction, so (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So, (0.6 - 0.5)c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. Correct. For the energies: first astronaut, gamma = 1.25, mass 2m, so 2.5 mc². Second astronaut, gamma = 2/sqrt(3), mass 3m, so 3m * 2/sqrt(3) c² = 6/sqrt(3) mc² = 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². Correct. So, the exact answer is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if we rationalize, 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, so approximately 5.96 mc². But since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures, maybe we should present the answer as 5.96 mc². However, the problem states masses as 2m and 3m, which are exact, and velocities as 0.6c and 0.5c, which are exact. So, perhaps the answer should be left in exact terms. Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, combining the terms over a common denominator, but that might complicate. Alternatively, factor out mc². So, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations, then 0.1428c and 5.96 mc². But given that the problem is about relativity, and exact expressions are preferred, I think the answer should be in exact terms.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system involving two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively, we proceed as follows:

**Relative Speed Calculation:**
Using the relativistic velocity addition formula for objects moving in the same direction:
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
where \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]

**Total Energy Calculation:**
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

Summing the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

However, perhaps the problem expects an exact expression. Let me check.

The problem says "the total energy of the system." Since the problem uses exact fractions (0.6c and 0.5c), maybe we can present the answer in exact terms.

E2 = 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) * c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c² ≈ 3.464 mc². So, the total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc².

Since the velocities are given as 0.6c and 0.5c, which are exact fractions, but the masses are 2m and 3m, which are exact. So, perhaps the answer should be given in exact terms. So, 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². Alternatively, combining terms, (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². But maybe the problem expects a numerical value. Let me check the problem again. It says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So, perhaps both answers need to be in boxed format. The relative speed is approximately 0.143c, but exact value is (0.1c)/0.7 = c/7 ≈ 0.142857c. So, exact value is (1/7)c ≈ 0.1429c. So, maybe write it as (1/7)c or 0.143c. For the energy, if exact, (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if decimal, approximately 5.96 mc². Let me check if the problem expects symbolic or numerical. The problem says "two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m" so m is a variable. So, the answer should be in terms of m and c. So, exact expressions. Therefore, relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. So, exact relative speed is c/7. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7. So, 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7. Therefore, the relative speed is c/7. That's exact. So, that's better. So, the relative speed is c/7. Then, the total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, combining terms, (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, factor out mc². So, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Let me confirm the velocity addition again. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then the velocity of A relative to B is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. Yes, that's correct. So, the relative speed is c/7. For the total energy, since each astronaut's energy is gamma*m*c². For the first astronaut, gamma is 1.25, so 2m*1.25*c² = 2.5 mc². For the second astronaut, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 2/sqrt(3). So, 3m*(2/sqrt(3))c² = (6/sqrt(3))mc² = 2*sqrt(3) mc². Therefore, total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, combining these terms, we can write it as (2.5 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3) all multiplied by mc². So, that's the exact answer. If we want to write it as a single fraction, 5/2 is 2.5, and 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 3.464, but since the problem doesn't specify, we can leave it in exact form. Therefore, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Let me check once more. Velocity addition: yes, same direction, so (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So, (0.6 - 0.5)c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = c/7. Correct. For the energies: first astronaut, gamma = 1.25, mass 2m, so 2.5 mc². Second astronaut, gamma = 2/sqrt(3), mass 3m, so 3m * 2/sqrt(3) c² = 6/sqrt(3) mc² = 2 sqrt(3) mc². So, total energy is 2.5 mc² + 2 sqrt(3) mc². Correct. So, the exact answer is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if we rationalize, 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, so approximately 5.96 mc². But since the problem gives velocities to two significant figures, maybe we should present the answer as 5.96 mc². However, the problem states masses as 2m and 3m, which are exact, and velocities as 0.6c and 0.5c, which are exact. So, perhaps the answer should be left in exact terms. Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, combining the terms over a common denominator, but that might complicate. Alternatively, factor out mc². So, the answers are c/7 and (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) mc². Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations, then 0.1428c and 5.96 mc². But given that the problem is about relativity, and exact expressions are preferred, I think the answer should be in exact terms. Therefore, the relative speed is c/7, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)mc². So, boxed answers would be:

Relative speed: \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}

Total energy: \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}

Alternatively, if the problem expects decimal approximations for the energy, but given that 5/2 is 2.5 and 2√3 is about 3.464, so 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which is approximately 5.96. But since the problem gives velocities as 0.6c and 0.5c, which are exact, but the masses as 2m and 3m, which are exact, perhaps the answer should be exact. So, I think the exact form is better here. Therefore, the final answers are as above.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.
