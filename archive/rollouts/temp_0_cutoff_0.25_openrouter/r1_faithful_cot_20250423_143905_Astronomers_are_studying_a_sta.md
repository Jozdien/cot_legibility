# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}\right)
\]

where \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The energy difference is calculated using the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\):

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Substituting the values of \(h\), \(c\), and \(\lambda\):

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting this energy to electron volts:

\[
E_2 - E_1 \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}
\]

The ratio of the number of atoms at temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots) is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right)
\]

Calculating the exponent:

\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99550 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = -\frac{500}{33000000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

\[
\text{Exponent} = 99550 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.508
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\exp(-1.508) \approx 0.221
\]

However, since the problem states the ratio decreases when the star has spots, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is the inverse:

\[
\frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.52
\]

Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. The star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K when 40% of its surface is covered by spots. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). 

First, let me recall some basic concepts. In LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2, is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio n1/n2 (since the problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when there are spots) would be:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So we need to compare the ratio at 6000 K and at 5500 K.

But first, let's compute the energy difference between the two levels. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. The energy difference can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me compute that. Let's convert 1448 Å to meters: 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m. 

So E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1448 x 10^-10 m)

Calculating that:

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Convert that to electron volts since sometimes energy levels are in eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. That seems quite high for thermal populations, but maybe it's okay. Let's check.

At 6000 K, the thermal energy k*T is about (1.38e-23 J/K)(6000 K) ≈ 8.28e-20 J, which is about 0.517 eV. So the energy difference between the two levels is much larger than the thermal energy. That would mean that the higher energy level is not populated much compared to the lower one. So the ratio n1/n2 would be large, but when temperature decreases, the ratio would decrease? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). If ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more positive, so the ratio increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's clarify. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)). If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so when T decreases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) becomes larger, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1 instead. Let me check.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So if we take the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the energy difference is negative, i.e., E2 < E1. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength, which would be emission or absorption depending on the direction. But energy levels are such that E2 > E1 for a transition from level 1 to 2 (absorption) or vice versa (emission). But the problem just mentions the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, so the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E2 > E1. Therefore, the energy difference is positive. 

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases. However, the problem states that when the temperature is lower (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Maybe I need to check my reasoning again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of level 1 to level 2, and when the temperature decreases, this ratio decreases. But according to the formula, if ΔE is positive, then lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 larger. So unless ΔE is negative, which would mean E2 < E1. But the transition wavelength is given, which is 1448 Å. Let's confirm the energy difference again.

Wait, energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, E2 = E1 + hc/λ. So E2 > E1. Therefore, ΔE is positive. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is a problem. 

Wait, maybe the ratio they are referring to is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The wording is ambiguous. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots (lower T), that would make sense. But the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then as T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering ionization instead of excitation, but the question specifically mentions two energy levels of neutral atoms. So it's about excitation, not ionization. 

Wait, maybe the energy difference is such that level 1 is higher than level 2. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E1 > E2, so the photon emitted would have energy E1 - E2 = hc/λ. But usually, transitions are from higher to lower energy, emitting a photon. So if the transition is 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, if the transition is emission from level 1 to level 2, then E1 > E2. Therefore, ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, in that case, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). 

But in this case, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps the transition is absorption from level 2 to level 1, requiring that E1 > E2. Wait, but absorption would be from lower to higher energy. So if the transition is absorption at 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, E1 = E2 + hc/λ. Therefore, E1 > E2. Then the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k T)) = (g2/g1) exp(-hc/(λ k T)). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the ratio being measured is n2/n1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. But the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). So as T decreases, this ratio increases. But the problem states that when T is lower (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting.

This suggests that either there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is smaller than when there are no spots (T=6000 K). But according to the Boltzmann equation, if E1 > E2, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. Therefore, the ratio should increase when the star has spots, but the problem says it decreases. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, if E2 > E1, then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If E2 > E1, then the Boltzmann factor is exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)). If E2 > E1, then as T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, this is still a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the energy difference is such that E2 - E1 is negative, i.e., E2 < E1. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(-|ΔE|/(k T)). Then, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. That would align with the problem statement. But how can that be? If the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E = hc/λ. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E1 - E2 = hc/λ, so E1 = E2 + hc/λ. Therefore, E1 > E2. Therefore, ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the energy difference is positive. Therefore, this scenario is not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of level 2 to level 1, but the wording says level 1 to level 2. Alternatively, maybe the statistical weights are different. But unless the statistical weights change with temperature, which they don't, the ratio change would still be dominated by the exponential term. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the Boltzmann factor but about the Saha equation? But the problem specifies neutral atoms, so ionization is not involved. It's about two energy levels within the same ion (neutral Ti). Therefore, the Saha equation isn't needed here, just the Boltzmann equation. 

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is not the same as the local temperature in the photosphere. Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But in reality, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. However, the effective temperature is a global parameter, which is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total radiation. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots at a lower temperature, and 60% at the original temperature (6000 K), then the effective temperature is some average. But the problem states that the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. However, when calculating the observed ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, we have to consider that in the spotted regions, the temperature is lower, and in the unspotted regions, it's higher. But the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". Wait, but LTE is assumed, so the temperature in the photosphere is uniform? Or is it that the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K, but the effective temperature as observed is an average. However, the ratio of the number of atoms in energy levels would depend on the local temperature where the spectral lines are formed. If the spots cover 40% of the surface, and the rest is at 6000 K, then the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, maybe they are approximating that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But in reality, starspots are localized cooler regions. However, the problem might be simplifying it to a uniform lower temperature. The problem says "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". So perhaps they are treating the entire photosphere as having a lower temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. That might be a simplification. So we can proceed under that assumption, that when spots are present, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, and when not, it's at 6000 K. 

If that's the case, then the ratio n1/n2 at 6000 K and 5500 K can be directly compared using the Boltzmann factor. 

Given that, let's proceed. 

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)). Wait, but earlier we determined that E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Wait, no. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, E2 = E1 + hc/λ. Therefore, the energy difference is positive. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)) = (g1/g2) * exp(-hc/(λ k T)). 

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE = E2 - E1. Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)). 

But if ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). 

But the problem states that when T decreases (spots), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. However, according to this formula, if T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. Therefore, this contradicts the problem statement. 

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Let's check the energy difference again. 

If the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, then the energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ. If the transition is from a lower energy level to a higher one (absorption), then E2 - E1 = E_photon. If it's from a higher to a lower (emission), then E1 - E2 = E_photon. 

In stellar photospheres, absorption lines are formed when atoms absorb photons from the continuous spectrum, so transitions are from lower to higher energy levels. Therefore, E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, E2 > E1. 

Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T))^{-1}? Wait, no. Let's re-derive:

The Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T))

Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T))

Wait, no. Let's do it carefully.

Let me denote the ratio as R = n1/n2.

From Boltzmann:

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T))

Therefore, R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T))

But since E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is positive. Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so R increases. Therefore, when the star has spots (lower T), R increases. But the problem says R decreases. Contradiction.

Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let's check again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. If the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, that's n1/n2. If the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, but according to the formula, it increases, then there's a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference is negative. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of energy E_photon = E2 - E1. Then, E2 > E1. Therefore, same as before. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of ions to neutrals, but no, it's specified as neutral atoms. 

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the opposite: the ratio n2/n1 decreases when spots are present. If the problem statement has a typo, but assuming it's correct as stated, we have to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is not the temperature relevant for the Boltzmann factor. In stars, the effective temperature is the temperature of the outer layer that emits the light, but in spots, the temperature is lower. However, if the star's overall effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but the actual temperature in the photosphere (outside spots) is still 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. Then, the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions. 

But the problem states "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". The term "photospheric effective temperature" might be confusing. Normally, effective temperature is a global parameter. If spots are present, the observed effective temperature is lower because the star emits less light. However, the local temperature in the photosphere outside spots remains the same, and the spots are cooler. 

But the problem says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE". If the photosphere is in LTE, but parts of it are at different temperatures, then the observed line ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions. 

However, the problem might be simplifying this by saying that when spots cover 40% of the surface, the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. That is, treating it as a uniform temperature. This is probably an approximation to make the problem solvable. 

Assuming that, then we can proceed by calculating the ratio R = n1/n2 at 6000 K and 5500 K, then find the factor by which it changes. 

But according to the Boltzmann equation, as T decreases, R increases if E2 > E1. But the problem says R decreases. Therefore, unless the energy difference is negative, which contradicts the given wavelength. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of level 2 to level 1, which would decrease with lower T. Let's check:

If R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). If E2 > E1, then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so R decreases. Therefore, if the ratio being referred to is n2/n1, then when T decreases, R decreases. But the problem states "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases. So if level 1 is first and level 2 is second, the ratio is n1/n2. Therefore, the problem says n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. But according to the Boltzmann factor, n1/n2 increases. Therefore, contradiction. 

This suggests that either the problem has an error, or there's a different approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization state changes with temperature, but the problem specifies neutral atoms, so ionization is not the cause. 

Wait, another thought: the Boltzmann factor depends on the temperature, but the derivation assumes that the system is in LTE, which it is. However, the star's effective temperature changing might affect the ionization state, but again, the problem states we're considering neutral atoms. 

Alternatively, maybe the spots are hotter? But no, starspots are cooler. The problem says when spots are present, the effective temperature decreases, so spots are cooler. 

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the ratio observed is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. If 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (spots) and 60% is at 6000 K, then the total number of atoms in each level would be the sum of the contributions from both regions. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But in reality, the effective temperature is determined by the total flux, which is a Stefan-Boltzmann law integration over the surface. However, the line ratios would depend on the local temperature where the spectral lines are formed. 

But the problem says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE", which might imply that the entire photosphere is at a uniform temperature, either 6000 K or 5500 K depending on spots. But that's not realistic, but perhaps it's a simplified model. 

Assuming that when spots are present, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, and when not, at 6000 K. Then, the ratio R = n1/n2 is given by:

R(T) = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T))

But since E2 - E1 = hc/λ, we can write:

R(T) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T))

Therefore, the factor by which R changes is R(6000)/R(5500) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

Since the problem asks for the factor when the star does not have spots (6000 K) compared to when it has spots (5500 K), which is R(6000)/R(5500). 

But according to the problem statement, R decreases when the star has spots, meaning R(5500) < R(6000), so the factor would be greater than 1. However, according to the formula, since 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative, the exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(negative) which is less than 1. Therefore, this contradicts the problem statement. 

This suggests that either the energy difference is negative, or the ratio is inverted. 

Alternatively, if the ratio is n2/n1, then:

R(T) = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-hc/(λ k T))

Then, the factor R(6000)/R(5500) = exp[ -hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

Which would be exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Since 1/5500 - 1/6000 is positive, this factor is greater than 1. Therefore, if the ratio is n2/n1, then it decreases when spots are present, and the factor R(6000)/R(5500) is greater than 1. But the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, which would be n1/n2. Therefore, unless the problem has a typo, this is confusing. 

Given the problem statement, I think the intended answer is to compute the factor using the Boltzmann equation, assuming that the ratio decreases when T decreases, which would require that the exponent is negative when T decreases. But according to our earlier calculation, this is not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the contradiction and proceed with the calculation. Let's try that. 

Compute the factor R(6000)/R(5500) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

First, compute hc/(λ k):

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So hc/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.998e-30 J m/K

Therefore, hc/(λ k) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 ≈ 9.955e4 K

So hc/(λ k) ≈ 99550 K

Now compute the exponent:

(1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ≈ -1.515e-5 1/K

Therefore, exponent = 99550 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ≈ -1.508

Therefore, the factor R(6000)/R(5500) = exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221

So the ratio at 6000 K is approximately 0.221 times the ratio at 5500 K. But since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning R(5500) < R(6000), but according to this calculation, R(6000) is 0.221 times R(5500), which would mean R decreases by a factor of ~4.52 (1/0.221). But this contradicts the problem statement. 

Wait, no. Wait, if the factor is R(6000)/R(5500) = 0.221, that means R(6000) = 0.221 * R(5500), so when the star doesn't have spots (6000 K), the ratio is 0.221 times when it does have spots (5500 K). Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of ~4.52 when spots are present. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is R(5500) = R(6000)/0.221 ≈ 4.52 * R(6000). Wait, no:

Wait, R(6000)/R(5500) = 0.221 → R(5500) = R(6000)/0.221 ≈ 4.52 R(6000). Therefore, when the star has spots, the ratio is 4.52 times higher than when it doesn't. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Therefore, this is the opposite of what's observed. 

This suggests that either the calculation is incorrect, or the problem statement has an error. However, given the numbers, this is the result. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If we compute R(5500)/R(6000) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ exp(99550 * (1.515e-5)) ≈ exp(1.508) ≈ 4.52. Therefore, R(5500) = 4.52 R(6000). So the ratio increases by a factor of 4.52 when spots are present, which contradicts the problem statement. 

But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. 

Given that, perhaps the energy difference was supposed to be negative, i.e., E1 - E2 = hc/λ. If that's the case, then ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Then, the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). Then, as T decreases, the exponent decreases, so R decreases. Therefore, when spots are present (lower T), R decreases, which matches the problem statement. 

But this would mean that the transition is from level 2 to level 1, with E1 > E2, and the photon emitted has energy E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/λ. 

If we proceed with this assumption, then the factor R(6000)/R(5500) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] 

Wait, no. If ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ, then:

R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T))

Therefore, the factor is R(6000)/R(5500) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

But as before, this gives a factor of exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221, meaning R(6000) = 0.221 R(5500). Therefore, when there are no spots (6000 K), the ratio is 0.221 times when there are spots (5500 K). Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of 4.52 when the star has spots. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R(5500) < R(6000). But according to this, R(5500) = R(6000)/0.221 ≈ 4.52 R(6000), which is an increase. 

This is very confusing. It seems like no matter how I set it up, the result contradicts the problem statement unless the energy difference is negative, which contradicts the transition wavelength given. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and I'm missing something. Let's think differently. 

The problem says that when spots are present, the effective temperature decreases. Spots are cooler, so the regions with spots have lower temperature, but the rest of the photosphere remains at 6000 K. Therefore, the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions. 

Assuming that 40% of the surface is at T_spot and 60% at T_no_spot = 6000 K. The effective temperature is given as 5500 K, but that's the effective temperature due to the lower flux from the spots. However, the line ratio depends on the local temperature in the regions where the spectral lines are formed. If the lines are formed in both spotted and unspotted regions, then the total ratio would be a weighted average. 

Assuming that the line ratio is proportional to the sum over the surface of n1/n2 in each region, weighted by their area. 

But n1/n2 depends exponentially on 1/T. So:

R_total = (A1 * R(T1) + A2 * R(T2)) / (A1 + A2)

Where A1 is the area of spots (40%) at T1=5500 K, and A2 is the area without spots (60%) at T2=6000 K. 

But wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. The effective temperature is calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

sigma_Teff^4 = (A1 sigma_T1^4 + A2 sigma_T2^4) / (A1 + A2)

Given that, we can solve for T1 (spot temperature):

Teff^4 = 0.4*T1^4 + 0.6*T2^4

Given Teff = 5500 K, T2 = 6000 K:

5500^4 = 0.4*T1^4 + 0.6*6000^4

Calculate 5500^4:

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15

So:

9.150625e14 = 0.4*T1^4 + 0.6*1.296e15

Calculate 0.6*1.296e15 = 7.776e14

So:

9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 0.4*T1^4

1.374625e14 = 0.4*T1^4

T1^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14

T1 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4)

Calculate this:

First, take log10: log10(3.4365625e14) = log10(3.4365625) + 14 ≈ 0.536 + 14 = 14.536

Divide by 4: 14.536 /4 ≈ 3.634

So T1 ≈ 10^3.634 ≈ 4300 K

Therefore, the spots have a temperature of approximately 4300 K. 

Therefore, when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is at 4300 K and 60% at 6000 K. The effective temperature is 5500 K. 

Now, to compute the ratio of n1/n2, we need to consider the contribution from both regions. However, the observed ratio in the spectrum would depend on the flux coming from each region. Since the flux is proportional to the area times the blackbody radiation at the wavelength of the transition. 

But the problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels decreases when spots are present. The number ratio in LTE is determined by the local temperature. However, the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions weighted by their contribution to the flux at the specific wavelength. 

This complicates things because the flux from each region depends on the blackbody radiation at the transition wavelength. The line strength depends on the number of atoms in the lower level (for absorption lines), and the continuum flux. 

But the problem might be simplifying this by considering that the ratio is an average over the surface, either by area or by flux. 

Assuming that the ratio is averaged by area, then:

R_total = 0.4 * R(4300) + 0.6 * R(6000)

Where R(T) = n1/n2 at temperature T. 

But if the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K (which is not the case), then R_total = R(5500). But the correct approach is to consider the two regions. 

However, this requires knowing the temperature of the spots, which we calculated as 4300 K. 

Now, let's compute R(6000)/R(4300) and R(6000)/R_total. 

But the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So factor = R_no_spots / R_spots

Where R_no_spots = R(6000)

R_spots = 0.4*R(4300) + 0.6*R(6000)

But this requires calculating R(4300) and R(6000). 

But we need to express this factor in terms of the Boltzmann factors. 

First, compute R(T) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)) (assuming E1 > E2, which contradicts the problem statement, but let's proceed). 

Assuming that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which would happen if R_spots < R_no_spots. But according to this, R_spots is a weighted average of R(4300) and R(6000). Since R(T) increases as T decreases (because exp(hc/(λ k T)) increases as T decreases), R(4300) > R(6000). Therefore, R_spots = 0.4*R(4300) + 0.6*R(6000) > R(6000). Therefore, the ratio increases when spots are present, contradicting the problem statement. 

This is very confusing. It seems that no matter how we approach it, the ratio should increase when spots are present if E1 > E2, but the problem says it decreases. 

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the initial approach, assuming uniform temperature, and see what answer comes out, even if it contradicts the problem statement. 

Given that, the factor is exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221, so the ratio changes by a factor of approximately 0.22, meaning the ratio without spots is 0.22 times the ratio with spots. But since the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, this would imply the factor is 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. 

But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So if without spots it's R1 and with spots R2, the factor is R1/R2. 

If R1 = 0.221 R2, then R1/R2 = 0.221. 

But the problem states that R decreases when spots are present, so R2 < R1, which would mean R1/R2 > 1. But according to the calculation, R1/R2 = 0.221 < 1. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup or my understanding. 

Given the time constraints, I think the intended answer is to compute the factor using the Boltzmann equation with the given temperatures, leading to a factor of exp(hc/(λ k) (1/6000 - 1/5500)) which is exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221, and since the problem says the ratio decreases, the inverse is 4.52. But since the question asks for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, it's R(6000)/R(5500) = 0.221, but the problem might expect the inverse. 

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference is taken as E1 - E2, leading to a positive exponent when T decreases. 

Given the confusion, I think the answer is approximately 4.5, but I need to check the calculation again. 

Let me recompute the exponent:

hc/(λ k) = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Denominator: 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = 1.998e-30

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 ≈ 99550 K

Then, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ≈ -1.515e-5 1/K

Exponent = 99550 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.508

exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221

Therefore, the factor is 0.221. But since the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, the factor should be 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. 

However, the question asks: "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots". So R_no_spots / R_spots = 0.221. 

But according to the problem statement, the ratio decreases when spots are present, so R_spots < R_no_spots, meaning the factor R_no_spots / R_spots > 1. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 4.5, and the confusion arises from the energy level ordering. Therefore, despite the contradiction in the problem statement, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

But to be precise, the calculation gives approximately 4.52. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. 

But let's check with E1 - E2 = -hc/λ, which would make ΔE negative. Then, the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(-hc/(λ k T)). Then, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so R decreases. Therefore, R_spots < R_no_spots, and the factor R_no_spots/R_spots = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ exp(1.508) ≈ 4.52. 

Therefore, if the energy difference is negative (E1 < E2), which contradicts the transition wavelength, the factor is 4.52. 

Given that the problem states the ratio decreases when spots are present, this must be the intended answer, despite the confusion. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

But to be precise, let's compute exp(1.508):

exp(1.508) ≈ e^1.508 ≈ 4.52 (since e^1.6 ≈ 4.953, e^1.5 ≈ 4.481, so 1.508 is ~4.52)

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

Since the problem might expect an exact answer, let's compute it more precisely. 

Calculate 1.508:

We have hc/(λ k) = 99550 K

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K

Wait, earlier we had:

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K

But the exponent is hc/(λ k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99550 K * 1.515e-5 1/K = 99550 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.508

Therefore, exp(1.508) = e^1.508

Using calculator:

ln(4) = 1.386, ln(4.5) = 1.504, ln(4.55) = 1.515

Since ln(4.5) = 1.504, and 1.508 - 1.504 = 0.004, so e^0.004 ≈ 1.004. Therefore, e^1.508 ≈ 4.5 * 1.004 ≈ 4.518. 

Therefore, approximately 4.52. 

Given that, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

But the problem might expect the answer as a whole number, but given the calculation, it's about 4.5. However, let's check with more precise calculation:

Compute 1.508:

We can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5:

e^1.5 = 4.4816890703

e^1.508 = e^(1.5 + 0.008) = e^1.5 * e^0.008 ≈ 4.481689 * 1.008032 ≈ 4.481689 * 1.008 ≈ 4.481689 + 4.481689*0.008 ≈ 4.481689 + 0.0358535 ≈ 4.5175

Therefore, approximately 4.5175, which rounds to 4.52. 

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

Given that, and considering that the problem might expect an answer of approximately 4.5 or 5, but given the precise calculation, 4.5. 

However, the question might want the exact exponential expression evaluated, which is approximately 4.5. 

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 4.5, so the factor is 4.5. 

But to write it boxed:

\boxed{4.5}

Or more precisely, \boxed{4.52}

But given the options, probably 4.5 is acceptable.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. The star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K when 40% of its surface is covered by spots. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). 

First, let me recall some basic concepts. In LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2, is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio n1/n2 (since the problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when there are spots) would be:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So we need to compare the ratio at 6000 K and at 5500 K.

But first, let's compute the energy difference between the two levels. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. The energy difference can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me compute that. Let's convert 1448 Å to meters: 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m. 

So E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1448 x 10^-10 m)

Calculating that:

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Convert that to electron volts since sometimes energy levels are in eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. That seems quite high for thermal populations, but maybe it's okay. Let's check.

At 6000 K, the thermal energy k*T is about (1.38e-23 J/K)(6000 K) ≈ 8.28e-20 J, which is about 0.517 eV. So the energy difference between the two levels is much larger than the thermal energy. That would mean that the higher energy level is not populated much compared to the lower one. So the ratio n1/n2 would be large, but when temperature decreases, the ratio would decrease? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). If ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more positive, so the ratio increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's clarify. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)). If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so when T decreases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) becomes larger, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1 instead. Let me check.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So if we take the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the energy difference is negative, i.e., E2 < E1. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength, which would be emission or absorption depending on the direction. But energy levels are such that E2 > E1 for a transition from level 1 to 2 (absorption) or vice versa (emission). But the problem just mentions the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, so the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E2 > E1. Therefore, the energy difference is positive. 

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases. However, the problem states that when the temperature is lower (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Maybe I need to check my reasoning again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of level 1 to level 2, and when the temperature decreases, this ratio decreases. But according to the formula, if ΔE is positive, then lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 larger. So unless ΔE is negative, which would mean E2 < E1. But the transition wavelength is given, which is 1448 Å. Let's confirm the energy difference again.

Wait, energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, E2 = E1 + hc/λ. So E2 > E1. Therefore, ΔE is positive. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is a problem. 

Wait, maybe the ratio they are referring to is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The wording is ambiguous. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots (lower T), that would make sense. But the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then as T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering ionization instead of excitation, but the question specifically mentions two energy levels of neutral atoms. So it's about excitation, not ionization. 

Wait, maybe the energy difference is such that level 1 is higher than level 2. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E1 > E2, so the photon emitted would have energy E1 - E2 = hc/λ. But usually, transitions are from higher to lower energy, emitting a photon. So if the transition is 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, if the transition is emission from level 1 to level 2, then E1 > E2. Therefore, ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, in that case, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k T)) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). 

But in this case, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps the transition is absorption from level 2 to level 1, requiring that E1 > E2. Wait, but absorption would be from lower to higher energy. So if the transition is absorption at 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, E1 = E2 + hc/λ. Therefore, E1 > E2. Then the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k T)) = (g2/g1) exp(-hc/(λ k T)). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the ratio being measured is n2/n1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. But the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp(hc/(λ k T)). So as T decreases, this ratio increases. But the problem states that when T is lower (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting.

This suggests that either there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is smaller than when there are no spots (T=6000 K). But according to the Boltzmann equation, if E1 > E2, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. Therefore, the ratio should increase when the star has spots, but the problem says it decreases. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, if E2 > E1, then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If E2 > E1, then the Boltzmann factor is exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E2 - E1)/(k T)). I

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when a star develops spots. When spots cover 40% of the star's surface, the effective temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. The transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, and we can assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

In LTE, the Boltzmann equation governs how atoms populate different energy levels. The ratio of atoms in two energy levels is expressed as:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Where g1 and g2 are statistical weights, E2 - E1 represents the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 would be:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp((E2 - E1)/(k*T))

The problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots appear. With spots, the temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Let me calculate the energy difference between the levels. The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which equals 1448 × 10^-10 meters. The energy difference is:

E = hc/λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s) × (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (1448 × 10^-10 m)

Calculating:
Numerator: 6.626 × 10^-34 × 3 × 10^8 = 1.9878 × 10^-25 J·m
Denominator: 1448 × 10^-10 m = 1.448 × 10^-7 m

Therefore, E ≈ 1.372 × 10^-18 J, which converts to approximately 8.57 eV (using 1 eV = a.602 × 10^-19 J).

At 6000 K, the thermal energy k*T is about (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)(6000 K) ≈ 8.28 × 10^-20 J or 0.517 eV. The energy difference between levels significantly exceeds the thermal energy.

According to the Boltzmann equation, if E2 > E1, then as temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should increase, not decrease as stated in the problem. This creates a contradiction.

I've checked several possibilities: the ratio might be n2/n1 instead of n1/n2, or perhaps the energy levels are arranged differently (E1 > E2). However, given a transition wavelength of 1448 Å, the energy difference between levels should be positive.

If E2 > E1, when temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should increase, but the problem says it decreases. Alternatively, if E2 < E1, then when temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should still increase.

Alright, I need to determine how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when a star has spots compared to when it doesn't. The star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K when spots cover 40% of its surface. The transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is assumed.

First, let’s recall some basic principles. Under LTE, the population of atomic energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation, which is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases with spots. With the presence of spots, the temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. We need to compare the ratio at both temperatures.

First, let's calculate the energy difference between the two levels. The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, in the ultraviolet range. The energy difference can be calculated using E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Converting 1448 Å to meters gives: 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m.

Calculate E: E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1448 x 10^-10 m)

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Converting to eV (1 eV = 1.602e-19 J), E ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Now, at 6000 K, the thermal energy k*T is approximately (1.38e-23 J/K)(6000 K) ≈ 8.28e-20 J, about 0.517 eV. Thus, the energy difference is much greater than the thermal energy, meaning the upper level (higher energy) is less populated, which makes n1/n2 large. If T decreases, the exponent in n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)) becomes larger, increasing the ratio. However, the problem states the ratio decreases when the star has spots (lower T), suggesting a contradiction.

Perhaps reconsidering the ratio as n2/n1 would solve this: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). As T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. This matches the statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Therefore, the problem likely refers to the ratio n2/n1 descending as the temperature drops with the presence of spots, giving a plausible resolution to the contradiction.

Let me write the Boltzmann equation properly.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations between two energy levels is:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nTherefore, if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative, so n2/n1 decreases exponentially as the energy difference increases. If E2 < E1, then the exponent becomes positive, which would mean n2/n1 increases, but that would be unphysical because higher energy levels should be less populated. Wait, no. If E2 < E1, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes positive, so n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So if E2 < E1, then n2/n1 is greater than (g2/g1) by a factor of exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But that would mean a higher energy level (E1) has a lower population than E2, which is lower. Wait, no. If E2 is lower than E1, then n2 (population of lower level) should be higher than n1 (population of higher level). So if E2 < E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, that would mean that n2/n1 is larger when (E1 - E2) is positive, which is correct because the lower level has a higher population. \n\nBut in our case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is a photon emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one. So if the transition is 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E_upper - E_lower = hc/λ. Therefore, E_upper = E_lower + hc/λ. Therefore, if level 1 and level 2 are the two levels involved, depending on which is upper and lower. \n\nSuppose level 2 is the upper level and level 1 is the lower level. Then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( - hc/(λ k T) )\n\nTherefore, the ratio n2/n1 decreases as temperature decreases because the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a smaller value. Therefore, if the ratio being measured is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. However, the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 = 1 / (n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent hc/(λ k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, meaning level 1 is the upper level and level 2 is the lower level. Then E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases. That would align with the problem statement: when T decreases (spots), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, this must be the case. \n\nTherefore, the key here is to determine which level is the upper and which is the lower. If the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, then the upper level (level 1) has higher energy than the lower level (level 2). Therefore, E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-hc/(λ k T)) decreases, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, this matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does have spots (T=5500 K) is higher. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of the two ratios: [n1/n2(6000 K)] / [n1/n2(5500 K)] = [exp(-hc/(λ k *6000)) / exp(-hc/(λ k *5500))] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nSince the statistical weights g1 and g2 would cancel out in the ratio of ratios, assuming they don't change with temperature (which they don't; they're properties of the atomic levels). Therefore, the factor is exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nNow, let's compute this factor. First, compute hc/(λ k):\n\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s\n\nc = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nλ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m\n\nk = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K\n\nTherefore, hc/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23)\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m\n\nDenominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448*1.38e-30 J m/K ≈ 2.00e-30 J m/K\n\nTherefore, hc/(λ k) ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 2.00e-30 ≈ 9.939e4 K\n\nSo hc/(λ k) ≈ 99390 K\n\nNow compute the exponent: hc/(λ k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)\n\nFirst, compute 1/5500 - 1/6000:\n\n1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667\n\nDifference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1\n\nMultiply by hc/(λ k) ≈ 99390 K:\n\n0.000015151 K^-1 * 99390 K ≈ 0.000015151 * 99390 ≈ 1.506\n\nTherefore, the exponent is approximately 1.506\n\nTherefore, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.51\n\nTherefore, the ratio n1/n2 at 6000 K is about 4.51 times higher than at 5500 K. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.51. \n\nBut let me check the calculations again to be precise.\n\nFirst, compute hc/(λ k):\n\nNumerator: hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m\n\nDenominator: λk = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448*1.38e-30 J·m/K ≈ 2.00064e-30 J·m/K\n\nTherefore, hc/(λk) = 1.9878e-25 / 2.00064e-30 ≈ 99370 K (more precisely, 1.9878 / 2.00064 = 0.9937, so 0.9937e5 = 99370 K)\n\nThen, compute the difference in 1/T:\n\n1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 0.0000151515 K^-1\n\nMultiply by hc/(λk):\n\n99370 K * 0.0000151515 K^-1 ≈ 99370 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506\n\nSo exponent is 1.506, so e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. \n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.51. \n\nBut let me check with more precise numbers. Let's compute hc/(λk):\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value as per definition)\n\nc = 299792458 m/s (exact)\n\nλ = 1448e-10 m\n\nk = 1.380649e-23 J/K (exact)\n\nSo hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m\n\nλk = 1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 ≈ 1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 = 1448 * 1.380649e-33 ≈ 1998.38e-33 ≈ 1.99838e-30 J·m/K\n\nTherefore, hc/(λk) = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.99838e-30 ≈ (1.98644586 / 1.99838) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 99400 K\n\nThen, 1/5500 - 1/6000:\n\nCompute 1/5500 = 0.00018181818...\n\n1/6000 = 0.00016666666...\n\nDifference: 0.0000151515...\n\nMultiply by 99400:\n\n0.0000151515 * 99400 ≈ 1.506\n\nSo exponent is 1.506, e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. \n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. Depending on rounding, maybe 4.5 or 4.51. \n\nBut let's compute e^1.506 more accurately. \n\nWe know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, and e^0.006 ≈ 1.00602. So e^1.506 = e^1.5 * e^0.006 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00602 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.00602 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.027 ≈ 4.5087. So approximately 4.51. \n\nTherefore, the ratio changes by a factor of approximately 4.51. \n\nBut the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation, but given the numbers, 4.5 is a reasonable approximation. However, let's see if there's a way to present it more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm values. But I think 4.5 is acceptable. However, let's check with the exact exponent:\n\nCompute 1.506 in e^x:\n\nUsing calculator: e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. Yes. \n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the reciprocal? Wait, the ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio at 6000 K divided by the ratio at 5500 K. Since the ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present, the factor is [n1/n2(6000)] / [n1/n2(5500)] = exp( hc/(λk) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ≈ 4.51. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. \n\nBut to be precise, let's use more accurate constants. \n\nCompute hc/k:\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J·s\n\nc = 299792458 m/s\n\nk = 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\nhc/k = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (6.62607015 * 299792458 / 1.380649) * 1e(-34 +8 +23) = (6.62607015 * 299792458 / 1.380649) * 1e-3\n\nCompute numerator: 6.62607015 * 299792458 ≈ 6.62607015 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e9 (exact: 6.62607015 * 299792458 = 1.98644586e-25 / 1e-23 to get hc/k? Wait, maybe better to compute step by step.\n\nWait, hc/k = (6.62607015e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s) / 1.380649e-23 J/K = (1.98644586e-25 J·m) / 1.380649e-23 J/K = (1.98644586 / 1.380649) * 1e-2 m·K ≈ 1.439e-2 m·K\n\nWait, 1.98644586 / 1.380649 ≈ 1.439. So hc/k ≈ 1.439e-2 m·K\n\nTherefore, hc/(λk) = hc/k / λ = 1.439e-2 m·K / (1448e-10 m) = 1.439e-2 / 1448e-10 K = 1.439e-2 / 1.448e-7 K ≈ (1.439 / 1.448) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.9938 * 1e5 K ≈ 99380 K\n\nSo hc/(λk) ≈ 99380 K\n\nThen, the exponent is 99380 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1\n\nCompute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply by 99380 K:\n\n99380 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 99380 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506\n\nSo exponent is 1.506, e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. \n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.51. \n\nGiven that, the answer should be approximately 4.5. However, in some cases, the natural logarithm of the ratio might be required, but the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is e^1.506 ≈ 4.5. \n\nAlternatively, if the question expects a more precise answer, maybe they used slightly different constants. For example, using hc = 12398.4 eV·Å (a common approximation), then E = 12398.4 Å·eV / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. Then, ΔE = 8.56 eV. Then, kT at 6000 K is 0.517 eV (since k = 8.617e-5 eV/K, so 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV). Then, ΔE/(kT) at 6000 K is 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.56. Similarly, at 5500 K, kT = 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.474 eV, ΔE/(kT) ≈ 8.56 / 0.474 ≈ 18.07. \n\nThen, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). Assuming g1/g2 = 1 for simplicity (since the problem doesn't specify), then the ratio is exp(ΔE/(kT)). \n\nWait, but earlier we had n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)) where ΔE = E1 - E2. But if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E1 > E2, so ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( hc/(λ k T) ). \n\nBut in the previous calculation, we considered the ratio n1/n2 decreasing when T decreases, which required that the exponent is negative. Wait, no. If E1 > E2, then hc/(λ k T) is positive, so exp( hc/(λ k T) ) increases as T decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 increases as T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation. \n\nWait, no. Wait, if the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( hc/(λ k T) ), then as T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem states that when T decreases (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, going back, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio n2/n1 = exp( - hc/(λ k T) ), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. But the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, which is n1/n2. Therefore, this is still conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the original assumption about which level is upper or lower is incorrect. Let's clarify. \n\nIf the transition is at 1448 Å, then the energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ ≈ 8.56 eV. If this corresponds to a transition from level 2 to level 1, then E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV. Therefore, E2 = E1 + 8.56 eV. Therefore, level 2 is higher than level 1. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( -8.56 eV / (k T) ). \n\nIf we are looking at the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) exp( 8.56 eV / (k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV, so E1 = E2 + 8.56 eV. Therefore, level 1 is higher than level 2. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -8.56 eV / (k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases. This matches the problem statement. \n\nAh! Here's the key. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2 (emission), then E1 > E2, and the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. Therefore, this aligns with the problem statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to recognize that the transition from level 1 to level 2 corresponds to E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. \n\nTherefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is [n1/n2(6000 K)] / [n1/n2(5500 K)] = [exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) ) / exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) ) ] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ratio at 6000 K is exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) )\n\nThe ratio at 5500 K is exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) )\n\nTherefore, the factor is [exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) ) ] / [exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) ) ] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nWhich is the same as before. Therefore, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. \n\nBut wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion where we thought the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. But according to this, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2 (E1 > E2), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-hc/(λ k T)) decreases, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, the ratio at 6000 K is larger than at 5500 K. Therefore, the factor is [n1/n2(6000)] / [n1/n2(5500)] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ 4.51. \n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. \n\nBut to confirm, let's plug in the numbers again with the correct understanding. \n\nGiven:\n\nAt T1 = 6000 K, ratio1 = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T1) )\n\nAt T2 = 5500 K, ratio2 = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T2) )\n\nFactor = ratio1 / ratio2 = exp( - hc/(λ k T1) + hc/(λ k T2) ) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]\n\nWhich is the same as exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51. \n\nYes. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the statistical weights, we assume they cancel out. Therefore, the answer is e^(1.506) ≈ 4.5. \n\nTherefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots. But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So when there are no spots (6000 K), the ratio is higher by a factor of 4.5 compared to when there are spots (5500 K). \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is \\boxed{4.5}\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444857, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5936, prompt_tokens=2692, total_tokens=8628, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Energy Difference Calculation**:
   - The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, corresponding to an energy difference \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \).
   - Using constants \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     \Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.0 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}
     \]

2. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   - The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:
     \[
     \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
     \]
   - Here, \( \Delta E = E_1 - E_2 \), and the ratio decreases when the temperature decreases.

3. **Temperature Effect**:
   - When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K.
   - The factor by which the ratio changes is calculated by comparing the ratios at 6000 K and 5500 K:
     \[
     \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000 \, \text{K}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500 \, \text{K}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right)
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \):
     \[
     \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \approx \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99390 \, \text{K}
     \]
   - Compute the exponent:
     \[
     99390 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx 99390 \times 0.0000151515 \approx 1.506
     \]
   - The factor is:
     \[
     \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51
     \]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately \(\boxed{4.5}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

think I might have mixed up the order here. Let me write the Boltzmann equation properly.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations between two energy levels is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Therefore, if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative, so n2/n1 decreases exponentially as the energy difference increases. If E2 < E1, then the exponent becomes positive, which would mean n2/n1 increases, but that would be unphysical because higher energy levels should be less populated. Wait, no. If E2 < E1, then E2 - E1 is negative, so -(E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes positive, so n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So if E2 < E1, then n2/n1 is greater than (g2/g1) by a factor of exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But that would mean a higher energy level (E1) has a lower population than E2, which is lower. Wait, no. If E2 is lower than E1, then n2 (population of lower level) should be higher than n1 (population of higher level). So if E2 < E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, that would mean that n2/n1 is larger when (E1 - E2) is positive, which is correct because the lower level has a higher population. 

But in our case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is a photon emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one. So if the transition is 1448 Å, then the energy difference is E_upper - E_lower = hc/λ. Therefore, E_upper = E_lower + hc/λ. Therefore, if level 1 and level 2 are the two levels involved, depending on which is upper and lower. 

Suppose level 2 is the upper level and level 1 is the lower level. Then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( - hc/(λ k T) )

Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 decreases as temperature decreases because the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a smaller value. Therefore, if the ratio being measured is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. However, the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 = 1 / (n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent hc/(λ k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, meaning level 1 is the upper level and level 2 is the lower level. Then E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases. That would align with the problem statement: when T decreases (spots), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, this must be the case. 

Therefore, the key here is to determine which level is the upper and which is the lower. If the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, then the upper level (level 1) has higher energy than the lower level (level 2). Therefore, E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-hc/(λ k T)) decreases, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, this matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Therefore, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does have spots (T=5500 K) is higher. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of the two ratios: [n1/n2(6000 K)] / [n1/n2(5500 K)] = [exp(-hc/(λ k *6000)) / exp(-hc/(λ k *5500))] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Since the statistical weights g1 and g2 would cancel out in the ratio of ratios, assuming they don't change with temperature (which they don't; they're properties of the atomic levels). Therefore, the factor is exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Now, let's compute this factor. First, compute hc/(λ k):

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s

c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m

k = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K

Therefore, hc/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448*1.38e-30 J m/K ≈ 2.00e-30 J m/K

Therefore, hc/(λ k) ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 2.00e-30 ≈ 9.939e4 K

So hc/(λ k) ≈ 99390 K

Now compute the exponent: hc/(λ k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)

First, compute 1/5500 - 1/6000:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1

Multiply by hc/(λ k) ≈ 99390 K:

0.000015151 K^-1 * 99390 K ≈ 0.000015151 * 99390 ≈ 1.506

Therefore, the exponent is approximately 1.506

Therefore, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.51

Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 at 6000 K is about 4.51 times higher than at 5500 K. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.51. 

But let me check the calculations again to be precise.

First, compute hc/(λ k):

Numerator: hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: λk = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448*1.38e-30 J·m/K ≈ 2.00064e-30 J·m/K

Therefore, hc/(λk) = 1.9878e-25 / 2.00064e-30 ≈ 99370 K (more precisely, 1.9878 / 2.00064 = 0.9937, so 0.9937e5 = 99370 K)

Then, compute the difference in 1/T:

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 0.0000151515 K^-1

Multiply by hc/(λk):

99370 K * 0.0000151515 K^-1 ≈ 99370 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506

So exponent is 1.506, so e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. 

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.51. 

But let me check with more precise numbers. Let's compute hc/(λk):

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value as per definition)

c = 299792458 m/s (exact)

λ = 1448e-10 m

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K (exact)

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m

λk = 1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 ≈ 1448e-10 * 1.380649e-23 = 1448 * 1.380649e-33 ≈ 1998.38e-33 ≈ 1.99838e-30 J·m/K

Therefore, hc/(λk) = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.99838e-30 ≈ (1.98644586 / 1.99838) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 99400 K

Then, 1/5500 - 1/6000:

Compute 1/5500 = 0.00018181818...

1/6000 = 0.00016666666...

Difference: 0.0000151515...

Multiply by 99400:

0.0000151515 * 99400 ≈ 1.506

So exponent is 1.506, e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. 

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. Depending on rounding, maybe 4.5 or 4.51. 

But let's compute e^1.506 more accurately. 

We know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, and e^0.006 ≈ 1.00602. So e^1.506 = e^1.5 * e^0.006 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00602 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.00602 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.027 ≈ 4.5087. So approximately 4.51. 

Therefore, the ratio changes by a factor of approximately 4.51. 

But the problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise calculation, but given the numbers, 4.5 is a reasonable approximation. However, let's see if there's a way to present it more accurately. 

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm values. But I think 4.5 is acceptable. However, let's check with the exact exponent:

Compute 1.506 in e^x:

Using calculator: e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. Yes. 

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

But let me check once more. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the reciprocal? Wait, the ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio at 6000 K divided by the ratio at 5500 K. Since the ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present, the factor is [n1/n2(6000)] / [n1/n2(5500)] = exp( hc/(λk) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ≈ 4.51. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. 

But to be precise, let's use more accurate constants. 

Compute hc/k:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299792458 m/s

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

hc/k = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (6.62607015 * 299792458 / 1.380649) * 1e(-34 +8 +23) = (6.62607015 * 299792458 / 1.380649) * 1e-3

Compute numerator: 6.62607015 * 299792458 ≈ 6.62607015 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e9 (exact: 6.62607015 * 299792458 = 1.98644586e-25 / 1e-23 to get hc/k? Wait, maybe better to compute step by step.

Wait, hc/k = (6.62607015e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s) / 1.380649e-23 J/K = (1.98644586e-25 J·m) / 1.380649e-23 J/K = (1.98644586 / 1.380649) * 1e-2 m·K ≈ 1.439e-2 m·K

Wait, 1.98644586 / 1.380649 ≈ 1.439. So hc/k ≈ 1.439e-2 m·K

Therefore, hc/(λk) = hc/k / λ = 1.439e-2 m·K / (1448e-10 m) = 1.439e-2 / 1448e-10 K = 1.439e-2 / 1.448e-7 K ≈ (1.439 / 1.448) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.9938 * 1e5 K ≈ 99380 K

So hc/(λk) ≈ 99380 K

Then, the exponent is 99380 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1

Multiply by 99380 K:

99380 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 99380 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506

So exponent is 1.506, e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. 

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.51. 

Given that, the answer should be approximately 4.5. However, in some cases, the natural logarithm of the ratio might be required, but the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is e^1.506 ≈ 4.5. 

Alternatively, if the question expects a more precise answer, maybe they used slightly different constants. For example, using hc = 12398.4 eV·Å (a common approximation), then E = 12398.4 Å·eV / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. Then, ΔE = 8.56 eV. Then, kT at 6000 K is 0.517 eV (since k = 8.617e-5 eV/K, so 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV). Then, ΔE/(kT) at 6000 K is 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.56. Similarly, at 5500 K, kT = 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.474 eV, ΔE/(kT) ≈ 8.56 / 0.474 ≈ 18.07. 

Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). Assuming g1/g2 = 1 for simplicity (since the problem doesn't specify), then the ratio is exp(ΔE/(kT)). 

Wait, but earlier we had n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)) where ΔE = E1 - E2. But if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E1 > E2, so ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( hc/(λ k T) ). 

But in the previous calculation, we considered the ratio n1/n2 decreasing when T decreases, which required that the exponent is negative. Wait, no. If E1 > E2, then hc/(λ k T) is positive, so exp( hc/(λ k T) ) increases as T decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 increases as T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation. 

Wait, no. Wait, if the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( hc/(λ k T) ), then as T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem states that when T decreases (spots), the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. 

Wait, going back, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio n2/n1 = exp( - hc/(λ k T) ), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. But the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, which is n1/n2. Therefore, this is still conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps the original assumption about which level is upper or lower is incorrect. Let's clarify. 

If the transition is at 1448 Å, then the energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ ≈ 8.56 eV. If this corresponds to a transition from level 2 to level 1, then E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV. Therefore, E2 = E1 + 8.56 eV. Therefore, level 2 is higher than level 1. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( -8.56 eV / (k T) ). 

If we are looking at the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) exp( 8.56 eV / (k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV, so E1 = E2 + 8.56 eV. Therefore, level 1 is higher than level 2. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -8.56 eV / (k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases. This matches the problem statement. 

Ah! Here's the key. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2 (emission), then E1 > E2, and the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. Therefore, this aligns with the problem statement. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to recognize that the transition from level 1 to level 2 corresponds to E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. 

Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is [n1/n2(6000 K)] / [n1/n2(5500 K)] = [exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) ) / exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) ) ] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio at 6000 K is exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) )

The ratio at 5500 K is exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) )

Therefore, the factor is [exp( - hc/(λ k *6000) ) ] / [exp( - hc/(λ k *5500) ) ] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. 

But wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion where we thought the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. But according to this, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2 (E1 > E2), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T) ). Therefore, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-hc/(λ k T)) decreases, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Therefore, the ratio at 6000 K is larger than at 5500 K. Therefore, the factor is [n1/n2(6000)] / [n1/n2(5500)] = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ 4.51. 

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. 

But to confirm, let's plug in the numbers again with the correct understanding. 

Given:

At T1 = 6000 K, ratio1 = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T1) )

At T2 = 5500 K, ratio2 = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - hc/(λ k T2) )

Factor = ratio1 / ratio2 = exp( - hc/(λ k T1) + hc/(λ k T2) ) = exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Which is the same as exp[ hc/(λ k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] ≈ exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51. 

Yes. Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. 

Since the problem doesn't specify the statistical weights, we assume they cancel out. Therefore, the answer is e^(1.506) ≈ 4.5. 

Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots. But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So when there are no spots (6000 K), the ratio is higher by a factor of 4.5 compared to when there are spots (5500 K). 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. 

Given that, I think the answer is \boxed{4.5}

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is $\\boxed{1.7}$.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let\'s clarify. Let me denote E2 as the higher energy level. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So, if the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases when T decreases. But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots (lower T). This is contradictory unless the statistical weights change, but the problem doesn\'t mention that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). But according to the Boltzmann equation, if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). So if T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this suggests that either ΔE is negative (E1 > E2) or there\'s another effect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the effective temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler, so the overall photospheric temperature is a combination of spotted and unspotted regions. Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But how does this affect the observed line ratios? If the star\'s photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions, then the observed spectrum would be a combination of the two. However, the problem states that the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spotted. Wait, but effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, so perhaps the spots are cooler than the rest of the photosphere, leading to a lower overall Teff. However, when considering line ratios, which depend on the local temperature where the lines are formed. If the spots are cooler regions, then the line ratios in those spots would be different from the unspotted regions. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. However, LTE is assumed, so perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Wait, but that might not be accurate. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots with lower temperature and 60% remains at 6000 K, then the effective temperature would be a combination. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is modeled as a single temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. But that might be an oversimplification. Alternatively, the presence of spots causes the star to emit as a blackbody with lower Teff. However, line ratios depend on the temperature of the gas where the lines are formed. If the spots are cooler regions, then the lines formed in those regions would have different excitation states. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so maybe we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 would be determined by the Boltzmann equation at 5500 K compared to 6000 K. But according to the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let\'s compute the ratio at both temperatures and see.\n\nLet me compute the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). The factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_spots = [exp(ΔE/(k*6000))] / [exp(ΔE/(k*5500))] = exp[ΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)].\n\nBut first, compute ΔE. The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet. Let\'s compute ΔE = hc/(λ). h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, c = 3 × 10^8 m/s, λ = 1448 × 10^-10 m.\n\nΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J. Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.\n\nSo ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV. Now, compute the exponent term:\n\nΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)\n\nFirst, compute 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nThen, 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99450 K\n\nMultiply by -1.515e-5 K^-1: 99450 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.507\n\nSo the factor is exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221\n\nBut wait, the factor R_no_spots / R_spots = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221, which would mean that R_no_spots is 0.221 times R_spots, meaning that R decreases when spots are present. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, but according to this calculation, when the star has spots (lower T), R = n1/n2 would be higher (since R_no_spots / R_spots = 0.221, so R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This contradicts the calculation. Therefore, there must be an error in the reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Let me check again. The problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots (T=6000 K). But according to the calculation, R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. Wait, that would mean R_spots is higher, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, the energy difference: 1448 Å corresponds to 8.57 eV. Then, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is ΔE/(k*T). For T=6000 K, ΔE/(k*T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.57 / (0.517) ≈ 16.57. Similarly, for T=5500 K, ΔE/(k*T) ≈ 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) ≈ 8.57 / 0.473 ≈ 18.11.\n\nThe ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)). Assuming g1/g2 is constant, the ratio R changes by exp(ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k*T2)) = exp[ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2)].\n\nWait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so T1=6000 K (no spots), T2=5500 K (spots). Then, the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/6000 - 1/5500)].\n\nBut as calculated earlier, this exponent is negative: 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1. So the exponent is ΔE/k * (-1.515e-5). But ΔE/k is (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 99450 K. Multiply by -1.515e-5 K^-1 gives -1.507. So exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221. Therefore, R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 0.221, which implies that R_spots ≈ R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. Therefore, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 increases by a factor of ~4.5, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases. This suggests a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. If the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So, for lower T, the exponential term decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present, that would correspond to n1/n2 decreasing, which would mean that n2/n1 increases. But according to the calculation, n2/n1 would decrease when T decreases. Therefore, this is still contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy levels are inverted. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But if the observed transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2, then the energy difference is E2 - E1. However, the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. If the ratio n1/n2 decreases, that would mean either n1 decreases or n2 increases. If the temperature is lower, for a high-energy transition (ΔE positive), the population of the higher level (n2) would decrease more than n1, leading to an increase in n1/n2. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which is the opposite. Therefore, there must be a different explanation.\n\nWait, maybe the presence of spots introduces a different excitation mechanism. But the problem states LTE, so thermal excitation is the only factor. Alternatively, the effective temperature is a combination of different regions. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots at a lower temperature and 60% at 6000 K, then the observed line ratio would be a weighted average. Let\'s consider that. Suppose the spotted regions have temperature T_spot and unspotted T_unspot = 6000 K. The overall effective temperature is given as 5500 K, but line ratios might be determined by the individual temperatures in each region. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which might imply that the entire photosphere is at a uniform temperature. But that contradicts the presence of spots. Alternatively, the effective temperature is a flux-weighted average, but the line formation depth might have a different temperature. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the star\'s photosphere when spotted has a lower temperature overall, so the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Then, the ratio n1/n2 is determined by T=5500 K. The problem says that this ratio decreases compared to when T=6000 K. But according to the Boltzmann equation, with ΔE positive, the ratio n1/n2 should increase when T decreases. Therefore, the problem\'s statement that the ratio decreases contradicts this. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation or understanding.\n\nWait, let me check the energy difference again. If the transition is 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet, corresponding to a high-energy transition. Let me verify the calculation of ΔE:\n\nλ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10^-10 m\n\nE = hc/λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s)(3 × 10^8 m/s) / (1448 × 10^-10 m) = (1.9878 × 10^-25 J·m) / (1.448 × 10^-7 m) ≈ 1.372 × 10^-18 J\n\nConvert to eV: 1.372 × 10^-18 J / 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. That\'s correct.\n\nNow, Boltzmann factor at T=6000 K:\n\nΔE/(k*T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.57\n\nAt T=5500 K:\n\nΔE/(k*T) ≈ 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) ≈ 8.57 / 0.473 ≈ 18.11\n\nThe ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T))\n\nAssuming g1/g2 is 1 for simplicity (since the problem doesn\'t provide statistical weights), then:\n\nR_no_spots = exp(16.57) ≈ 1.58 × 10^7\n\nR_spots = exp(18.11) ≈ 7.25 × 10^7\n\nWait, but this would mean that R_spots is higher than R_no_spots, so the ratio increases when spots are present, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the problem says the ratio decreases, but according to this, it increases. Therefore, there\'s a contradiction unless the energy difference is negative, which would imply E1 > E2. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But if the energy levels are labeled such that E1 > E2, then ΔE would be negative. Let\'s check that.\n\nIf E1 > E2, then ΔE = E2 - E1 = negative. Let\'s say ΔE = -8.57 eV. Then, the exponent becomes negative:\n\nAt T=6000 K: ΔE/(k*T) = (-8.57 eV)/(0.517 eV) ≈ -16.57\n\nAt T=5500 K: ΔE/(k*T) ≈ (-8.57)/(0.473) ≈ -18.11\n\nThen, R = n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k*T)) = exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33 × 10^-8 (no spots)\n\nR_spots = exp(-18.11) ≈ 1.38 × 10^-8\n\nSo R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 6.33e-8 / 1.38e-8 ≈ 4.59\n\nIn this case, when spots are present (lower T), R = n1/n2 decreases, which matches the problem\'s statement. Therefore, the energy difference must be negative, implying that E1 > E2. This would mean that the transition from level 2 to level 1 (emitting a photon with energy 8.57 eV), so level 2 is higher than level 1. Wait, but if E1 > E2, then a transition from level 1 to level 2 would require absorption of energy, but the problem mentions the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is likely an emission or absorption line. However, in stellar photospheres, we usually see absorption lines. So if the transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2 (which requires E2 > E1), then my initial calculation holds, leading to a contradiction. But the problem states the ratio decreases, which only makes sense if E1 > E2. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the ratio of ions in different ionization states, but the question specifies neutral atoms in two energy levels. Therefore, ionization is not the factor here.\n\nAnother possibility is that the effective temperature decrease leads to a lower ionization state, but the problem states neutral titanium atoms, so ionization is not the issue.\n\nWait, maybe the Saha equation is involved, but the problem specifies the ratio of two energy levels of neutral atoms, so the Boltzmann equation should suffice.\n\nGiven the problem\'s statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present (lower T), and my calculation shows that this requires E1 > E2 (ΔE negative), which would mean the transition is from a lower to a higher energy level (absorption), but the energy of the photon would then be E2 - E1 = positive 8.57 eV. Wait, no. If E1 > E2, then a transition from E1 to E2 would emit a photon with energy E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV. But the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which corresponds to 8.57 eV. Therefore, if the transition is emission from E1 to E2, then E1 > E2, and the energy difference is positive. However, in that case, the ratio n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)) (if E1 > E2). Wait, let\'s clarify:\n\nIf the energy levels are E1 and E2 with E1 > E2, then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). If the temperature decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is still contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, if the transition is absorption from E2 to E1 (E1 > E2), requiring a photon of energy E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)). So, if T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, meaning n1/n2 increases. Again, this contradicts the problem\'s statement.\n\nI\'m stuck. The problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. According to the Boltzmann equation, this would require that the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k*T) decreases when T decreases. For that to happen, (E2 - E1) must be negative, i.e., E1 > E2. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). When T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, there\'s a contradiction. Unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)) = exp((E2 - E1)/(k*T)). If E1 > E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so the exponent is negative. When T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, that would align. But the problem states "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases. If level 1 is higher energy, then n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases. Wait, no. Let\'s clarify:\n\nIf E1 > E2, then n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 increases when T decreases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio is n2/n1, then it would decrease when T decreases (since n2/n1 = exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE = E1 - E2 > 0). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, that would make sense. But the problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, which is n1/n2. Therefore, there\'s a contradiction unless the problem has a typo or I\'m missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the continuum flux, altering the excitation temperature. But in LTE, the excitation temperature is equal to the local thermal temperature. If the star\'s effective temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler regions, the observed spectrum would be a mix. However, the problem states the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spotted, implying that the entire photosphere is treated as having that temperature. Therefore, the line ratio should follow the Boltzmann distribution at 5500 K compared to 6000 K. But according to the calculation, this leads to an increase in n1/n2 when T decreases, contradicting the problem\'s statement.\n\nGiven that the problem is from an astronomy context, perhaps the effective temperature is not the same as the excitation temperature. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the excitation temperature should equal the local thermal temperature. If the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, the observed spectrum would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. Therefore, the line ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions. Let\'s explore this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Fraction of surface with spots: f = 0.4 (T_spot)\n- Fraction without spots: 1 - f = 0.6 (T_unspot = 6000 K)\n\nThe effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spotted, but to compute the line ratio, we need to consider the contribution from both regions. However, line formation depends on the conditions in the regions where the lines are formed. If the lines are formed in both spotted and unspotted regions, the total line strength would be a combination. However, the ratio of populations in energy levels would depend on the temperature of each region.\n\nAssuming that the line is optically thin, the total number of atoms in each level would be the sum from both regions. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. Let\'s model this.\n\nLet’s assume that in spotted regions, the temperature is T_spot, and in unspotted regions, T_unspot = 6000 K. The effective temperature of 5500 K is a flux-weighted average, but the population ratio is an average over the surface. However, the population ratio depends on the local temperature. Therefore, the average ratio would be:\n\nR_total = [f * n1_spot + (1 - f) * n1_unspot] / [f * n2_spot + (1 - f) * n2_unspot]\n\nWhere n1_spot = (g1/g2) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) * n2_spot\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, if we assume that the emergent line is a sum of the contributions from each region, and the ratio is measured from the equivalent widths, which depend on the populations. However, this requires knowing the specific intensities and filling factors. This might be too complex without more information.\n\nAlternatively, if the spots are at a lower temperature T_spot, and the unspotted regions remain at T_unspot = 6000 K, then the average ratio R_total would be a weighted average of the ratios in each region. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Maybe we need to find T_spot such that the average flux corresponds to Teff = 5500 K. The flux is proportional to T^4, so:\n\n(1 - f) * T_unspot^4 + f * T_spot^4 = Teff^4\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4\n\nCalculate 6000^4 = 1.296e+18, 5500^4 ≈ 9.15e+17\n\nSo:\n\n0.6*1.296e18 = 7.776e17\n\n0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.15e17 - 7.776e17 = 1.374e17\n\nT_spot^4 = 1.374e17 / 0.4 = 3.435e17\n\nT_spot = (3.435e17)^(1/4) ≈ (3.435e17)^0.25 ≈ 4300 K (since 1000^4=1e12, 10000^4=1e16, so 4300^4 ≈ 3.4e17)\n\nTherefore, the spots have a temperature of approximately 4300 K.\n\nNow, the ratio R_total would be a weighted average of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the ratio of number densities depends on the temperature. Assuming that the filling factor is by area, and that the number densities are proportional to the Boltzmann factors in each region.\n\nBut the total number of atoms in each level would be the sum over both regions. Assuming that the column density is the same in both regions (same pressure, etc.), but this is uncertain. Alternatively, if the spots are cooler, the gas in the spots may have higher density, but without information, we can assume that the surface area is the main factor.\n\nAssuming that the number of atoms in each level is proportional to the area, then:\n\nn1_total = f * n1_spot + (1 - f) * n1_unspot\n\nn2_total = f * n2_spot + (1 - f) * n2_unspot\n\nThe ratio R_total = n1_total / n2_total\n\nEach n1 and n2 in the regions are given by the Boltzmann factors:\n\nn1_spot / n2_spot = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot))\n\nSimilarly for unspotted.\n\nAssuming g1/g2 is the same, let\'s denote S = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). Then:\n\nn1_spot = S_spot * n2_spot\n\nn1_unspot = S_unspot * n2_unspot\n\nAssuming that the total number of atoms in each region is the same (since the problem doesn\'t specify otherwise), then n2_spot = n2_unspot = n2 (constant). This is a simplification, but without more information, we proceed.\n\nThen:\n\nn1_total = f * S_spot * n2 + (1 - f) * S_unspot * n2\n\nn2_total = f * n2 + (1 - f) * n2 = n2\n\nTherefore, R_total = [f * S_spot + (1 - f) * S_unspot] * n2 / n2 = f * S_spot + (1 - f) * S_unspot\n\nThus, the ratio R_total = f * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) + (1 - f) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))\n\nBut we need to compare this to the ratio when there are no spots, which is R_no_spots = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_total = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot)) / [f * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) + (1 - f) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))]\n\nThis is complicated, but let\'s plug in the numbers. First, we need to determine E1 - E2. Earlier, we found that the transition wavelength corresponds to 8.57 eV. If the transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2, then E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV, so E1 - E2 = -8.57 eV. Therefore, the exponent (E1 - E2)/(k*T) = -8.57 eV / (k*T)\n\nGiven that, let\'s compute S_spot and S_unspot:\n\nS_spot = exp(-8.57 eV / (k*T_spot))\n\nSimilarly, S_unspot = exp(-8.57 eV / (k*T_unspot))\n\nWe have T_spot ≈ 4300 K, T_unspot = 6000 K\n\nCompute for T_spot = 4300 K:\n\nk*T_spot = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 4300 K ≈ 0.3705 eV\n\nΔE/(k*T_spot) = -8.57 / 0.3705 ≈ -23.13\n\nS_spot = exp(-23.13) ≈ 9.1 × 10^-11\n\nFor T_unspot = 6000 K:\n\nk*T_unspot ≈ 0.517 eV\n\nΔE/(k*T_unspot) = -8.57 / 0.517 ≈ -16.57\n\nS_unspot = exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33 × 10^-8\n\nNow, R_total = 0.4 * 9.1e-11 + 0.6 * 6.33e-8 ≈ 3.64e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8\n\nR_no_spots = 6.33e-8\n\nTherefore, the factor R_no_spots / R_total ≈ 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666\n\nSo the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately 1.67 when spots are present. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the factor by which it changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately 1.67, which is about 5/3. But this is a rough estimate.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the number of atoms in level 2 is the same in both spotted and unspotted regions, which may not be accurate. Additionally, the actual calculation of the effective temperature leading to T_spot = 4300 K is approximate. Let\'s verify that calculation again.\n\nGiven:\n\n(1 - f) * T_unspot^4 + f * T_spot^4 = Teff^4\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4\n\nCalculate 6000^4 = 1296e+16 = 1.296e+18\n\n5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14 (Wait, no, 5500^4 = (5.5*10^3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 10^12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14). Wait, but 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e+16 * 1e4 = 1.296e+18? No, wait:\n\n(6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e+15. Similarly, (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n0.6*1.296e15 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14\n\n0.6*1.296e15 = 7.776e14\n\nSo 7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14\n\n0.4*T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14\n\nT_spot^4 = 3.43656e14\n\nT_spot = (3.43656e14)^(1/4) = (3.43656)^(1/4) * 1e14^(1/4) ≈ 1.36 * 1e3.5 ≈ 1.36 * 3.16e3 ≈ 4300 K (as before)\n\nSo T_spot ≈ 4300 K is correct.\n\nNow, redoing the calculation with accurate exponents:\n\nS_spot = exp(-8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 4300)) = exp(-8.57 / 0.3705) = exp(-23.13) ≈ 9.1e-11\n\nS_unspot = exp(-8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000)) = exp(-8.57 / 0.517) ≈ exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33e-8\n\nR_total = 0.4*9.1e-11 + 0.6*6.33e-8 ≈ 3.64e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8\n\nR_no_spots = 6.33e-8\n\nFactor = 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666, so approximately 1.67 times.\n\nTherefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of ~1.67 when spots are present. The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, which is R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 1.67. So the answer is approximately 1.7, or if precise, 1.67. However, given the approximations in T_spot and the exponential terms, rounding to two significant figures, the factor is approximately 1.7.\n\nBut let\'s check if using the exact T_spot changes much. Let\'s compute T_spot more accurately:\n\nT_spot^4 = 3.43656e14\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\nln(T_spot^4) = ln(3.43656e14) => 4 ln(T_spot) = ln(3.43656) + ln(1e14)\n\nln(3.43656) ≈ 1.234, ln(1e14) = 32.236\n\nSo 4 ln(T_spot) ≈ 1.234 + 32.236 = 33.47\n\nln(T_spot) ≈ 8.3675\n\nT_spot ≈ e^8.3675 ≈ 4280 K\n\nSo T_spot ≈ 4280 K. Recalculating S_spot:\n\nk*T_spot = 8.617e-5 * 4280 ≈ 0.368 eV\n\nΔE/(k*T_spot) = -8.57 / 0.368 ≈ -23.29\n\nS_spot = exp(-23.29) ≈ 7.25e-11\n\nR_total = 0.4*7.25e-11 + 0.6*6.33e-8 ≈ 2.9e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8\n\nFactor remains approximately 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666, so 1.67.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 1.67, which can be expressed as 5/3 (≈1.666...). However, the problem might expect an exact answer using the given temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) without considering the spot temperature. But according to the problem statement, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the spotted and unspotted regions as contributing to the line ratio, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67.\n\nHowever, the initial approach where the entire photosphere is at 5500 K gives a contradictory result, but considering the two-component model, the factor is about 1.67. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.7, but to be precise, it\'s 1.67, which is 5/3. However, given that the problem might expect using the Teff values directly (6000 K vs. 5500 K) without considering the spot temperature, let\'s check that scenario.\n\nIf we incorrectly assume the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted, then:\n\nR_no_spots / R_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/6000 - 1/5500)] with ΔE = 8.57 eV\n\nAs calculated earlier, this gives exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221, implying R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots, which contradicts the problem\'s statement. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the two-component model, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67. However, the problem might expect using the given Teff values (6000 K and 5500 K) and the energy difference corresponding to 1448 Å. Let\'s try that again, assuming the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted.\n\nIf we proceed with T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K, and ΔE=8.57 eV:\n\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]\n\nΔE/k = 8.57 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99450 K\n\n(1/6000 - 1/5500) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nFactor = exp(99450 * -1.515e-5) = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221\n\nThis implies R_no_spots / R_spots = 0.221, so R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. But the problem states that the ratio decreases, which would mean R_spots < R_no_spots, but this calculation shows R_spots > R_no_spots. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must consider the two-component model, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67. However, since the problem mentions the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, and LTE is assumed, it\'s ambiguous whether the entire photosphere is at 5500 K or it\'s a combination. Given the problem\'s context, the intended answer might be using the Saha-Boltzmann equations with the given Teff values, but that leads to a contradiction. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the energy levels are such that E2 - E1 is negative.\n\nIf we assume that the energy difference is negative (E1 > E2), then ΔE = -8.57 eV. Then, the factor would be:\n\nexp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] = exp[ (-8.57e /k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\n\nBut ΔE/k = -8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ -99450 K\n\n(1/6000 - 1/5500) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nFactor = exp( (-99450) * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(1.507) ≈ 4.51\n\nTherefore, R_no_spots / R_spots = 4.51, meaning the ratio decreases by a factor of ~4.5 when spots are present. But this requires that the energy difference is negative, which contradicts the transition wavelength given. However, if the problem intended the energy levels to be such that E1 > E2, then this would be the answer. But given the transition wavelength corresponds to 8.57 eV, which should be E2 - E1, this is conflicting.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is approximately 4.5, derived from the initial incorrect approach where the entire photosphere is at 5500 K and the energy levels are such that E1 > E2. However, this contradicts the transition energy. Alternatively, the correct answer considering the two-component model is approximately 1.67. Given that the problem states the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, and astronomers often use effective temperature as an average, the intended answer might be the two-component model\'s result of ~1.67. However, without more information, it\'s challenging to determine the exact expectation.\n\nGiven the problem\'s context and typical astronomy problems, the expected answer is likely derived from the Boltzmann factor using the given Teff values, assuming the entire photosphere\'s temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K, leading to a factor of exp(1.507) ≈ 4.5, but since this contradicts the problem\'s statement, perhaps the correct factor is the inverse, 0.221, but that also contradicts. Therefore, there\'s a fundamental issue with the problem\'s setup. However, considering the two-component model gives a factor of ~1.67, which aligns with the problem\'s statement if the ratio decreases by that factor. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.7, but the precise calculation gives 1.67, which is 5/3.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445124, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=9452, prompt_tokens=805, total_tokens=10257, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **1.7**. This is determined by considering the weighted average of the Boltzmann factors in the spotted and unspotted regions of the star's photosphere, taking into account the effective temperature decrease due to the spots.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Energy Difference Calculation:**
   - Transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.
   - Energy difference ΔE = hc/λ ≈ 8.57 eV.

2. **Effective Temperatures:**
   - No spots: T₁ = 6000 K.
   - With spots: Overall T_eff = 5500 K, implying a mix of 60% unspotted (6000 K) and 40% spotted regions (calculated to be ~4300 K using Stefan-Boltzmann law).

3. **Boltzmann Factor in Each Region:**
   - For T_spot ≈ 4300 K: exp(-ΔE/(k*T_spot)) ≈ 7.25 × 10⁻¹¹.
   - For T_unspot = 6000 K: exp(-ΔE/(k*T_unspot)) ≈ 6.33 × 10⁻⁸.

4. **Weighted Average Ratio:**
   - R_total = 0.4 * 7.25e-11 + 0.6 * 6.33e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8.
   - R_no_spots = 6.33e-8.

5. **Factor Calculation:**
   - Factor = R_no_spots / R_total ≈ 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.67.

**Answer:** The ratio decreases by a factor of approximately **1.7** when the star has spots. Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is $\boxed{1.7}$.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's clarify. Let me denote E2 as the higher energy level. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So, if the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases when T decreases. But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots (lower T). This is contradictory unless the statistical weights change, but the problem doesn't mention that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). But according to the Boltzmann equation, if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). So if T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this suggests that either ΔE is negative (E1 > E2) or there's another effect.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler, so the overall photospheric temperature is a combination of spotted and unspotted regions. Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But how does this affect the observed line ratios? If the star's photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions, then the observed spectrum would be a combination of the two. However, the problem states that the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spotted. Wait, but effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, so perhaps the spots are cooler than the rest of the photosphere, leading to a lower overall Teff. However, when considering line ratios, which depend on the local temperature where the lines are formed. If the spots are cooler regions, then the line ratios in those spots would be different from the unspotted regions. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. However, LTE is assumed, so perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Wait, but that might not be accurate. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots with lower temperature and 60% remains at 6000 K, then the effective temperature would be a combination. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is modeled as a single temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. But that might be an oversimplification. Alternatively, the presence of spots causes the star to emit as a blackbody with lower Teff. However, line ratios depend on the temperature of the gas where the lines are formed. If the spots are cooler regions, then the lines formed in those regions would have different excitation states. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so maybe we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 would be determined by the Boltzmann equation at 5500 K compared to 6000 K. But according to the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's compute the ratio at both temperatures and see.

Let me compute the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). The factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_spots = [exp(ΔE/(k*6000))] / [exp(ΔE/(k*5500))] = exp[ΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)].

But first, compute ΔE. The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet. Let's compute ΔE = hc/(λ). h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, c = 3 × 10^8 m/s, λ = 1448 × 10^-10 m.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J. Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV. Now, compute the exponent term:

ΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)

First, compute 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1

Then, 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99450 K

Multiply by -1.515e-5 K^-1: 99450 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.507

So the factor is exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221

But wait, the factor R_no_spots / R_spots = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221, which would mean that R_no_spots is 0.221 times R_spots, meaning that R decreases when spots are present. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, but according to this calculation, when the star has spots (lower T), R = n1/n2 would be higher (since R_no_spots / R_spots = 0.221, so R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This contradicts the calculation. Therefore, there must be an error in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Let me check again. The problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots (T=6000 K). But according to the calculation, R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. Wait, that would mean R_spots is higher, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. Let me check the steps again.

First, the energy difference: 1448 Å corresponds to 8.57 eV. Then, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is ΔE/(k*T). For T=6000 K, ΔE/(k*T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.57 / (0.517) ≈ 16.57. Similarly, for T=5500 K, ΔE/(k*T) ≈ 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) ≈ 8.57 / 0.473 ≈ 18.11.

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)). Assuming g1/g2 is constant, the ratio R changes by exp(ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k*T2)) = exp[ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2)].

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so T1=6000 K (no spots), T2=5500 K (spots). Then, the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/6000 - 1/5500)].

But as calculated earlier, this exponent is negative: 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1. So the exponent is ΔE/k * (-1.515e-5). But ΔE/k is (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 99450 K. Multiply by -1.515e-5 K^-1 gives -1.507. So exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221. Therefore, R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 0.221, which implies that R_spots ≈ R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. Therefore, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 increases by a factor of ~4.5, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases. This suggests a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. If the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So, for lower T, the exponential term decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present, that would correspond to n1/n2 decreasing, which would mean that n2/n1 increases. But according to the calculation, n2/n1 would decrease when T decreases. Therefore, this is still contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are inverted. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But if the observed transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2, then the energy difference is E2 - E1. However, the problem states that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. If the ratio n1/n2 decreases, that would mean either n1 decreases or n2 increases. If the temperature is lower, for a high-energy transition (ΔE positive), the population of the higher level (n2) would decrease more than n1, leading to an increase in n1/n2. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which is the opposite. Therefore, there must be a different explanation.

Wait, maybe the presence of spots introduces a different excitation mechanism. But the problem states LTE, so thermal excitation is the only factor. Alternatively, the effective temperature is a combination of different regions. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots at a lower temperature and 60% at 6000 K, then the observed line ratio would be a weighted average. Let's consider that. Suppose the spotted regions have temperature T_spot and unspotted T_unspot = 6000 K. The overall effective temperature is given as 5500 K, but line ratios might be determined by the individual temperatures in each region. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which might imply that the entire photosphere is at a uniform temperature. But that contradicts the presence of spots. Alternatively, the effective temperature is a flux-weighted average, but the line formation depth might have a different temperature. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's photosphere when spotted has a lower temperature overall, so the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Then, the ratio n1/n2 is determined by T=5500 K. The problem says that this ratio decreases compared to when T=6000 K. But according to the Boltzmann equation, with ΔE positive, the ratio n1/n2 should increase when T decreases. Therefore, the problem's statement that the ratio decreases contradicts this. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation or understanding.

Wait, let me check the energy difference again. If the transition is 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet, corresponding to a high-energy transition. Let me verify the calculation of ΔE:

λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10^-10 m

E = hc/λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s)(3 × 10^8 m/s) / (1448 × 10^-10 m) = (1.9878 × 10^-25 J·m) / (1.448 × 10^-7 m) ≈ 1.372 × 10^-18 J

Convert to eV: 1.372 × 10^-18 J / 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. That's correct.

Now, Boltzmann factor at T=6000 K:

ΔE/(k*T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.57

At T=5500 K:

ΔE/(k*T) ≈ 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) ≈ 8.57 / 0.473 ≈ 18.11

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T))

Assuming g1/g2 is 1 for simplicity (since the problem doesn't provide statistical weights), then:

R_no_spots = exp(16.57) ≈ 1.58 × 10^7

R_spots = exp(18.11) ≈ 7.25 × 10^7

Wait, but this would mean that R_spots is higher than R_no_spots, so the ratio increases when spots are present, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the problem says the ratio decreases, but according to this, it increases. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless the energy difference is negative, which would imply E1 > E2. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But if the energy levels are labeled such that E1 > E2, then ΔE would be negative. Let's check that.

If E1 > E2, then ΔE = E2 - E1 = negative. Let's say ΔE = -8.57 eV. Then, the exponent becomes negative:

At T=6000 K: ΔE/(k*T) = (-8.57 eV)/(0.517 eV) ≈ -16.57

At T=5500 K: ΔE/(k*T) ≈ (-8.57)/(0.473) ≈ -18.11

Then, R = n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k*T)) = exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33 × 10^-8 (no spots)

R_spots = exp(-18.11) ≈ 1.38 × 10^-8

So R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 6.33e-8 / 1.38e-8 ≈ 4.59

In this case, when spots are present (lower T), R = n1/n2 decreases, which matches the problem's statement. Therefore, the energy difference must be negative, implying that E1 > E2. This would mean that the transition from level 2 to level 1 (emitting a photon with energy 8.57 eV), so level 2 is higher than level 1. Wait, but if E1 > E2, then a transition from level 1 to level 2 would require absorption of energy, but the problem mentions the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is likely an emission or absorption line. However, in stellar photospheres, we usually see absorption lines. So if the transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2 (which requires E2 > E1), then my initial calculation holds, leading to a contradiction. But the problem states the ratio decreases, which only makes sense if E1 > E2. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the ratio of ions in different ionization states, but the question specifies neutral atoms in two energy levels. Therefore, ionization is not the factor here.

Another possibility is that the effective temperature decrease leads to a lower ionization state, but the problem states neutral titanium atoms, so ionization is not the issue.

Wait, maybe the Saha equation is involved, but the problem specifies the ratio of two energy levels of neutral atoms, so the Boltzmann equation should suffice.

Given the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present (lower T), and my calculation shows that this requires E1 > E2 (ΔE negative), which would mean the transition is from a lower to a higher energy level (absorption), but the energy of the photon would then be E2 - E1 = positive 8.57 eV. Wait, no. If E1 > E2, then a transition from E1 to E2 would emit a photon with energy E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV. But the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which corresponds to 8.57 eV. Therefore, if the transition is emission from E1 to E2, then E1 > E2, and the energy difference is positive. However, in that case, the ratio n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)) (if E1 > E2). Wait, let's clarify:

If the energy levels are E1 and E2 with E1 > E2, then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). If the temperature decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Therefore, this is still contradictory.

Alternatively, if the transition is absorption from E2 to E1 (E1 > E2), requiring a photon of energy E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)). So, if T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, meaning n1/n2 increases. Again, this contradicts the problem's statement.

I'm stuck. The problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. According to the Boltzmann equation, this would require that the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k*T) decreases when T decreases. For that to happen, (E2 - E1) must be negative, i.e., E1 > E2. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). When T decreases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio observed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)) = exp((E2 - E1)/(k*T)). If E1 > E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so the exponent is negative. When T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, that would align. But the problem states "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases. If level 1 is higher energy, then n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If E1 > E2, then n1/n2 = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). As T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 increases when T decreases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio is n2/n1, then it would decrease when T decreases (since n2/n1 = exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE = E1 - E2 > 0). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, if the problem is referring to n2/n1 decreasing, that would make sense. But the problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases, which is n1/n2. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless the problem has a typo or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the continuum flux, altering the excitation temperature. But in LTE, the excitation temperature is equal to the local thermal temperature. If the star's effective temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler regions, the observed spectrum would be a mix. However, the problem states the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spotted, implying that the entire photosphere is treated as having that temperature. Therefore, the line ratio should follow the Boltzmann distribution at 5500 K compared to 6000 K. But according to the calculation, this leads to an increase in n1/n2 when T decreases, contradicting the problem's statement.

Given that the problem is from an astronomy context, perhaps the effective temperature is not the same as the excitation temperature. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the excitation temperature should equal the local thermal temperature. If the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, the observed spectrum would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. Therefore, the line ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions. Let's explore this.

Let’s denote:

- Fraction of surface with spots: f = 0.4 (T_spot)
- Fraction without spots: 1 - f = 0.6 (T_unspot = 6000 K)

The effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spotted, but to compute the line ratio, we need to consider the contribution from both regions. However, line formation depends on the conditions in the regions where the lines are formed. If the lines are formed in both spotted and unspotted regions, the total line strength would be a combination. However, the ratio of populations in energy levels would depend on the temperature of each region.

Assuming that the line is optically thin, the total number of atoms in each level would be the sum from both regions. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. Let's model this.

Let’s assume that in spotted regions, the temperature is T_spot, and in unspotted regions, T_unspot = 6000 K. The effective temperature of 5500 K is a flux-weighted average, but the population ratio is an average over the surface. However, the population ratio depends on the local temperature. Therefore, the average ratio would be:

R_total = [f * n1_spot + (1 - f) * n1_unspot] / [f * n2_spot + (1 - f) * n2_unspot]

Where n1_spot = (g1/g2) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) * n2_spot

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, if we assume that the emergent line is a sum of the contributions from each region, and the ratio is measured from the equivalent widths, which depend on the populations. However, this requires knowing the specific intensities and filling factors. This might be too complex without more information.

Alternatively, if the spots are at a lower temperature T_spot, and the unspotted regions remain at T_unspot = 6000 K, then the average ratio R_total would be a weighted average of the ratios in each region. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Maybe we need to find T_spot such that the average flux corresponds to Teff = 5500 K. The flux is proportional to T^4, so:

(1 - f) * T_unspot^4 + f * T_spot^4 = Teff^4

Plugging in the values:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4

Calculate 6000^4 = 1.296e+18, 5500^4 ≈ 9.15e+17

So:

0.6*1.296e18 = 7.776e17

0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.15e17 - 7.776e17 = 1.374e17

T_spot^4 = 1.374e17 / 0.4 = 3.435e17

T_spot = (3.435e17)^(1/4) ≈ (3.435e17)^0.25 ≈ 4300 K (since 1000^4=1e12, 10000^4=1e16, so 4300^4 ≈ 3.4e17)

Therefore, the spots have a temperature of approximately 4300 K.

Now, the ratio R_total would be a weighted average of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. However, the ratio of number densities depends on the temperature. Assuming that the filling factor is by area, and that the number densities are proportional to the Boltzmann factors in each region.

But the total number of atoms in each level would be the sum over both regions. Assuming that the column density is the same in both regions (same pressure, etc.), but this is uncertain. Alternatively, if the spots are cooler, the gas in the spots may have higher density, but without information, we can assume that the surface area is the main factor.

Assuming that the number of atoms in each level is proportional to the area, then:

n1_total = f * n1_spot + (1 - f) * n1_unspot

n2_total = f * n2_spot + (1 - f) * n2_unspot

The ratio R_total = n1_total / n2_total

Each n1 and n2 in the regions are given by the Boltzmann factors:

n1_spot / n2_spot = (g1/g2) exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot))

Similarly for unspotted.

Assuming g1/g2 is the same, let's denote S = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T)). Then:

n1_spot = S_spot * n2_spot

n1_unspot = S_unspot * n2_unspot

Assuming that the total number of atoms in each region is the same (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise), then n2_spot = n2_unspot = n2 (constant). This is a simplification, but without more information, we proceed.

Then:

n1_total = f * S_spot * n2 + (1 - f) * S_unspot * n2

n2_total = f * n2 + (1 - f) * n2 = n2

Therefore, R_total = [f * S_spot + (1 - f) * S_unspot] * n2 / n2 = f * S_spot + (1 - f) * S_unspot

Thus, the ratio R_total = f * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) + (1 - f) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))

But we need to compare this to the ratio when there are no spots, which is R_no_spots = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))

The factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_total = exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot)) / [f * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_spot)) + (1 - f) * exp((E1 - E2)/(k*T_unspot))]

This is complicated, but let's plug in the numbers. First, we need to determine E1 - E2. Earlier, we found that the transition wavelength corresponds to 8.57 eV. If the transition is absorption from level 1 to level 2, then E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV, so E1 - E2 = -8.57 eV. Therefore, the exponent (E1 - E2)/(k*T) = -8.57 eV / (k*T)

Given that, let's compute S_spot and S_unspot:

S_spot = exp(-8.57 eV / (k*T_spot))

Similarly, S_unspot = exp(-8.57 eV / (k*T_unspot))

We have T_spot ≈ 4300 K, T_unspot = 6000 K

Compute for T_spot = 4300 K:

k*T_spot = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 4300 K ≈ 0.3705 eV

ΔE/(k*T_spot) = -8.57 / 0.3705 ≈ -23.13

S_spot = exp(-23.13) ≈ 9.1 × 10^-11

For T_unspot = 6000 K:

k*T_unspot ≈ 0.517 eV

ΔE/(k*T_unspot) = -8.57 / 0.517 ≈ -16.57

S_unspot = exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33 × 10^-8

Now, R_total = 0.4 * 9.1e-11 + 0.6 * 6.33e-8 ≈ 3.64e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8

R_no_spots = 6.33e-8

Therefore, the factor R_no_spots / R_total ≈ 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666

So the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately 1.67 when spots are present. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the factor by which it changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately 1.67, which is about 5/3. But this is a rough estimate.

However, this calculation assumes that the number of atoms in level 2 is the same in both spotted and unspotted regions, which may not be accurate. Additionally, the actual calculation of the effective temperature leading to T_spot = 4300 K is approximate. Let's verify that calculation again.

Given:

(1 - f) * T_unspot^4 + f * T_spot^4 = Teff^4

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4

Calculate 6000^4 = 1296e+16 = 1.296e+18

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14 (Wait, no, 5500^4 = (5.5*10^3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 10^12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14). Wait, but 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e+16 * 1e4 = 1.296e+18? No, wait:

(6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e+15. Similarly, (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e+14.

Therefore, the equation is:

0.6*1.296e15 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14

0.6*1.296e15 = 7.776e14

So 7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14

0.4*T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14

T_spot^4 = 3.43656e14

T_spot = (3.43656e14)^(1/4) = (3.43656)^(1/4) * 1e14^(1/4) ≈ 1.36 * 1e3.5 ≈ 1.36 * 3.16e3 ≈ 4300 K (as before)

So T_spot ≈ 4300 K is correct.

Now, redoing the calculation with accurate exponents:

S_spot = exp(-8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 4300)) = exp(-8.57 / 0.3705) = exp(-23.13) ≈ 9.1e-11

S_unspot = exp(-8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000)) = exp(-8.57 / 0.517) ≈ exp(-16.57) ≈ 6.33e-8

R_total = 0.4*9.1e-11 + 0.6*6.33e-8 ≈ 3.64e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8

R_no_spots = 6.33e-8

Factor = 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666, so approximately 1.67 times.

Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of ~1.67 when spots are present. The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, which is R_no_spots / R_spots ≈ 1.67. So the answer is approximately 1.7, or if precise, 1.67. However, given the approximations in T_spot and the exponential terms, rounding to two significant figures, the factor is approximately 1.7.

But let's check if using the exact T_spot changes much. Let's compute T_spot more accurately:

T_spot^4 = 3.43656e14

Take natural logarithm:

ln(T_spot^4) = ln(3.43656e14) => 4 ln(T_spot) = ln(3.43656) + ln(1e14)

ln(3.43656) ≈ 1.234, ln(1e14) = 32.236

So 4 ln(T_spot) ≈ 1.234 + 32.236 = 33.47

ln(T_spot) ≈ 8.3675

T_spot ≈ e^8.3675 ≈ 4280 K

So T_spot ≈ 4280 K. Recalculating S_spot:

k*T_spot = 8.617e-5 * 4280 ≈ 0.368 eV

ΔE/(k*T_spot) = -8.57 / 0.368 ≈ -23.29

S_spot = exp(-23.29) ≈ 7.25e-11

R_total = 0.4*7.25e-11 + 0.6*6.33e-8 ≈ 2.9e-11 + 3.8e-8 ≈ 3.8e-8

Factor remains approximately 6.33e-8 / 3.8e-8 ≈ 1.666, so 1.67.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 1.67, which can be expressed as 5/3 (≈1.666...). However, the problem might expect an exact answer using the given temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) without considering the spot temperature. But according to the problem statement, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the spotted and unspotted regions as contributing to the line ratio, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67.

However, the initial approach where the entire photosphere is at 5500 K gives a contradictory result, but considering the two-component model, the factor is about 1.67. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.7, but to be precise, it's 1.67, which is 5/3. However, given that the problem might expect using the Teff values directly (6000 K vs. 5500 K) without considering the spot temperature, let's check that scenario.

If we incorrectly assume the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted, then:

R_no_spots / R_spots = exp[ΔE/k (1/6000 - 1/5500)] with ΔE = 8.57 eV

As calculated earlier, this gives exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221, implying R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots, which contradicts the problem's statement. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the correct approach is the two-component model, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67. However, the problem might expect using the given Teff values (6000 K and 5500 K) and the energy difference corresponding to 1448 Å. Let's try that again, assuming the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted.

If we proceed with T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K, and ΔE=8.57 eV:

Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

ΔE/k = 8.57 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99450 K

(1/6000 - 1/5500) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1

Factor = exp(99450 * -1.515e-5) = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221

This implies R_no_spots / R_spots = 0.221, so R_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots. But the problem states that the ratio decreases, which would mean R_spots < R_no_spots, but this calculation shows R_spots > R_no_spots. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the correct answer must consider the two-component model, leading to a factor of approximately 1.67. However, since the problem mentions the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, and LTE is assumed, it's ambiguous whether the entire photosphere is at 5500 K or it's a combination. Given the problem's context, the intended answer might be using the Saha-Boltzmann equations with the given Teff values, but that leads to a contradiction. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the energy levels are such that E2 - E1 is negative.

If we assume that the energy difference is negative (E1 > E2), then ΔE = -8.57 eV. Then, the factor would be:

exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] = exp[ (-8.57e /k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

But ΔE/k = -8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ -99450 K

(1/6000 - 1/5500) ≈ -1.515e-5 K^-1

Factor = exp( (-99450) * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(1.507) ≈ 4.51

Therefore, R_no_spots / R_spots = 4.51, meaning the ratio decreases by a factor of ~4.5 when spots are present. But this requires that the energy difference is negative, which contradicts the transition wavelength given. However, if the problem intended the energy levels to be such that E1 > E2, then this would be the answer. But given the transition wavelength corresponds to 8.57 eV, which should be E2 - E1, this is conflicting.

Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is approximately 4.5, derived from the initial incorrect approach where the entire photosphere is at 5500 K and the energy levels are such that E1 > E2. However, this contradicts the transition energy. Alternatively, the correct answer considering the two-component model is approximately 1.67. Given that the problem states the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, and astronomers often use effective temperature as an average, the intended answer might be the two-component model's result of ~1.67. However, without more information, it's challenging to determine the exact expectation.

Given the problem's context and typical astronomy problems, the expected answer is likely derived from the Boltzmann factor using the given Teff values, assuming the entire photosphere's temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K, leading to a factor of exp(1.507) ≈ 4.5, but since this contradicts the problem's statement, perhaps the correct factor is the inverse, 0.221, but that also contradicts. Therefore, there's a fundamental issue with the problem's setup. However, considering the two-component model gives a factor of ~1.67, which aligns with the problem's statement if the ratio decreases by that factor. Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.7, but the precise calculation gives 1.67, which is 5/3.

So, if the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present, that would mean n1/n2 (spots) < n1/n2 (no spots). But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*T)). So, if T decreases, ΔE/(k*T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k*T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases. Therefore, there\'s a contradiction unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the ratio in question must be n2/n1. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) as before. Which we calculated as approximately 4.5.\n\nBut let\'s check the calculation again.\n\nΔE = 1.372e-18 J\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nT1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K\n\nCompute ΔE/(k*T1) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6e3) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.57\n\nΔE/(k*T2) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5.5e3) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08\n\nSo, the exponent difference is 18.08 - 16.57 = 1.51\n\nThus, exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51 ≈ 4.52\n\nTherefore, the ratio n2/n1 is higher by a factor of ~4.5 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when there are spots, this factor of ~4.5 is the factor by which the ratio changes (i.e., the ratio without spots is 4.5 times higher than with spots). Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5.\n\nBut let me check the energy calculation again. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 m. So, λ = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s)/(1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m)/(1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J. That\'s correct.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. Correct.\n\nk*T at 6000 K: 1.38e-23 * 6e3 = 8.28e-20 J. 8.28e-20 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.517 eV. So, ΔE is 8.57 eV, which is much larger than k*T (0.517 eV). So, the exponent is large and negative, making n2/n1 very small. But when T decreases, the exponent becomes even more negative, so n2/n1 becomes even smaller. Wait, but according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So, if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So, the ratio without spots (higher T) is higher than with spots (lower T). Therefore, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = exp(1.51) ≈ 4.5. So, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let\'s compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.51:\n\ne^1.51 = e^1.5 * e^0.01 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.01005 ≈ 4.526. So, approximately 4.53.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\ne^1.51 ≈ 4.53.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. But let\'s check if the energy calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star\'s photosphere\'s temperature in spotted regions vs. unspotted regions. Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But in reality, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. However, the effective temperature is a global parameter. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots with lower temperature, and 60% is at the original temperature, the effective temperature is a weighted average. But the problem states that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, perhaps the question is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But in reality, the effective temperature is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. However, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", so we can take it as the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots, and 6000 K when there are no spots. Therefore, when calculating the Boltzmann factor, we should use the effective temperature of the photosphere. So, even though in reality, the spots are cooler and the rest is hotter (maybe), but the problem simplifies it to a uniform Teff of 5500 K when spots are present. Therefore, the calculation as done before is correct.\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. But let\'s check the exact calculation again.\n\nCompute ΔE/(k*T1) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6000) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.57\n\nΔE/(k*T2) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5500) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08\n\nDifference in exponents: 18.08 - 16.57 = 1.51\n\nexp(1.51) ≈ 4.53\n\nSo, the ratio changes by a factor of approximately 4.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But to be precise, let\'s compute 1.51 more accurately.\n\n1.51 in exponent:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5:\n\ne^1.51 = e^1.5 * e^0.01\n\nWe know e^1.5 ≈ 4.4816890703\n\ne^0.01 ≈ 1.010050167\n\nThus, e^1.51 ≈ 4.4816890703 * 1.010050167 ≈ 4.4816890703 * 1.01 ≈ 4.5265\n\nSo, approximately 4.53. Rounding to two significant figures, 4.5. But maybe the problem expects more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, use a calculator:\n\n1.51\n\ne^1.51 ≈ 4.53\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.5. However, let\'s check if the energy calculation is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting wavelength to energy. Let me recheck.\n\nλ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m\n\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s\n\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25)/(1.448e-7) = 1.372e-18 J. Correct.\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So, the energy difference is 1.372e-18 J. Then, converting to eV:\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. Correct.\n\nSo, the energy levels are separated by 8.57 eV, which is a large energy difference compared to thermal energies (k*T ~0.5 eV). Therefore, the exponent is large, and the ratio n2/n1 is very small, but the change in temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K leads to a factor of ~4.5 difference in the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let\'s see if there\'s another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the Boltzmann factor ratio:\n\nRatio_no_spots / Ratio_spots = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)]\n\nCompute ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 9.94e4 K\n\nSo, ΔE/k ≈ 9.94e4 K\n\nThen, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply ΔE/k by (1/T2 - 1/T1):\n\n9.94e4 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 ≈ 1.506\n\nThus, exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51\n\nSo, approximately 4.5. Therefore, the factor is about 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the inverse ratio (n2/n1) increases when there are spots. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. According to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). If T decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases, so exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, this suggests that the ratio being referred to is n2/n1. If the ratio n2/n1 decreases when spots are present (lower T), then that\'s consistent with the Boltzmann factor. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). As T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) ≈ 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. Since the problem might expect an exact exponential expression evaluation, but given the approximated calculation, 4.5 is reasonable. However, let\'s check with more precise constants.\n\nLet me use more precise values:\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact)\n\nc = 299792458 m/s (exact)\n\nλ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\n\nE = hc/λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7\n\nCalculate numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J m\n\nDivide by λ: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J (same as before)\n\nk = 1.380649e-23 J/K (exact)\n\nΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ 9.94e4 K (same as before)\n\n1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) ≈ 0.0000151515\n\nΔE/k*(1/T2 -1/T1) = 9.94e4 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506\n\nexp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.51\n\nSo, approximately 4.51. Rounding to two significant figures, 4.5. If three significant figures, 4.51. But the problem doesn\'t specify, but since the temperatures are given as 6000 and 5500 (two significant figures?), but 40% is two as well. The answer is likely expected to be approximately 4.5. However, let me check if the question is asking for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio when no spots divided by ratio when spots. Since the ratio n2/n1 decreases when spots are present, the factor is 4.5. So, the answer is 4.5.\n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose the ratio is n1/n2. Then, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the ratio must be n2/n1. Therefore, the factor is 4.5.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we use the Boltzmann equation under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Energy Difference Calculation**:
   - The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which converts to \(1.448 \times 10^{-7}\) m.
   - Using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is calculated as:
     \[
     E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J}
     \]
   - Converting to electron volts (eV):
     \[
     E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \text{ eV}
     \]

2. **Boltzmann Factor Calculation**:
   - For temperatures \(T_1 = 6000\) K (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500\) K (with spots):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 6000} \approx 16.57
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 5500} \approx 18.08
     \]
   - The ratio of the Boltzmann factors is:
     \[
     \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) / \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
     \]
   - Calculating the exponent difference:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 1.51
     \]
   - Therefore, the factor is:
     \[
     \exp(1.51) \approx 4.5
     \]

The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is \(\boxed{4.5}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it doesn't (T=6000 K). The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes, i.e., (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Since the statistical weights g1 and g2 are constants, they will cancel out when taking the ratio of the two ratios. Therefore, the factor is:

exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)) = exp[ ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

But let's compute this step by step.

First, compute ΔE/(k*T) for both temperatures.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J (from earlier)

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K

Compute ΔE/(k*T1) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6000) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.57

Similarly, ΔE/(k*T2) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5500) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08

So, the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(-16.57) / exp(-18.08) = exp(18.08 - 16.57) = exp(1.51) ≈ 4.52

Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots. But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, let's clarify.

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So, if the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present, that would mean n1/n2 (spots) < n1/n2 (no spots). But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*T)). So, if T decreases, ΔE/(k*T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k*T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless the ratio is n2/n1. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the ratio in question must be n2/n1. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) as before. Which we calculated as approximately 4.5.

But let's check the calculation again.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K

Compute ΔE/(k*T1) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6e3) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.57

ΔE/(k*T2) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5.5e3) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08

So, the exponent difference is 18.08 - 16.57 = 1.51

Thus, exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51 ≈ 4.52

Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 is higher by a factor of ~4.5 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when there are spots, this factor of ~4.5 is the factor by which the ratio changes (i.e., the ratio without spots is 4.5 times higher than with spots). Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5.

But let me check the energy calculation again. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 m. So, λ = 1.448e-7 m.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s)/(1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m)/(1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J. That's correct.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. Correct.

k*T at 6000 K: 1.38e-23 * 6e3 = 8.28e-20 J. 8.28e-20 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.517 eV. So, ΔE is 8.57 eV, which is much larger than k*T (0.517 eV). So, the exponent is large and negative, making n2/n1 very small. But when T decreases, the exponent becomes even more negative, so n2/n1 becomes even smaller. Wait, but according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So, if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So, the ratio without spots (higher T) is higher than with spots (lower T). Therefore, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)) = exp(1.51) ≈ 4.5. So, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.51:

e^1.51 = e^1.5 * e^0.01 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.01005 ≈ 4.526. So, approximately 4.53.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

e^1.51 ≈ 4.53.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. But let's check if the energy calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's photosphere's temperature in spotted regions vs. unspotted regions. Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But in reality, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. However, the effective temperature is a global parameter. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots with lower temperature, and 60% is at the original temperature, the effective temperature is a weighted average. But the problem states that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, perhaps the question is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But in reality, the effective temperature is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. However, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", so we can take it as the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots, and 6000 K when there are no spots. Therefore, when calculating the Boltzmann factor, we should use the effective temperature of the photosphere. So, even though in reality, the spots are cooler and the rest is hotter (maybe), but the problem simplifies it to a uniform Teff of 5500 K when spots are present. Therefore, the calculation as done before is correct.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. But let's check the exact calculation again.

Compute ΔE/(k*T1) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6000) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.57

ΔE/(k*T2) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5500) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08

Difference in exponents: 18.08 - 16.57 = 1.51

exp(1.51) ≈ 4.53

So, the ratio changes by a factor of approximately 4.5. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But to be precise, let's compute 1.51 more accurately.

1.51 in exponent:

We can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5:

e^1.51 = e^1.5 * e^0.01

We know e^1.5 ≈ 4.4816890703

e^0.01 ≈ 1.010050167

Thus, e^1.51 ≈ 4.4816890703 * 1.010050167 ≈ 4.4816890703 * 1.01 ≈ 4.5265

So, approximately 4.53. Rounding to two significant figures, 4.5. But maybe the problem expects more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator:

1.51

e^1.51 ≈ 4.53

So, the factor is approximately 4.5. However, let's check if the energy calculation is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting wavelength to energy. Let me recheck.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s

c = 3 x 10^8 m/s

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25)/(1.448e-7) = 1.372e-18 J. Correct.

Yes, that's correct. So, the energy difference is 1.372e-18 J. Then, converting to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. Correct.

So, the energy levels are separated by 8.57 eV, which is a large energy difference compared to thermal energies (k*T ~0.5 eV). Therefore, the exponent is large, and the ratio n2/n1 is very small, but the change in temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K leads to a factor of ~4.5 difference in the ratio.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. But let's see if there's another approach.

Alternatively, using the Boltzmann factor ratio:

Ratio_no_spots / Ratio_spots = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Compute ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 9.94e4 K

So, ΔE/k ≈ 9.94e4 K

Then, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1

Multiply ΔE/k by (1/T2 - 1/T1):

9.94e4 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 ≈ 1.506

Thus, exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51

So, approximately 4.5. Therefore, the factor is about 4.5.

Therefore, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the inverse ratio (n2/n1) increases when there are spots. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, then n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. According to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). If T decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases, so exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. Therefore, this suggests that the ratio being referred to is n2/n1. If the ratio n2/n1 decreases when spots are present (lower T), then that's consistent with the Boltzmann factor. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). As T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) ≈ 4.5.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5. Since the problem might expect an exact exponential expression evaluation, but given the approximated calculation, 4.5 is reasonable. However, let's check with more precise constants.

Let me use more precise values:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact)

c = 299792458 m/s (exact)

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

E = hc/λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7

Calculate numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J m

Divide by λ: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J (same as before)

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K (exact)

ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ 9.94e4 K (same as before)

1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) ≈ 0.0000151515

ΔE/k*(1/T2 -1/T1) = 9.94e4 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.506

exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.51

So, approximately 4.51. Rounding to two significant figures, 4.5. If three significant figures, 4.51. But the problem doesn't specify, but since the temperatures are given as 6000 and 5500 (two significant figures?), but 40% is two as well. The answer is likely expected to be approximately 4.5. However, let me check if the question is asking for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio when no spots divided by ratio when spots. Since the ratio n2/n1 decreases when spots are present, the factor is 4.5. So, the answer is 4.5.

But let me check once more. Suppose the ratio is n1/n2. Then, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the ratio must be n2/n1. Therefore, the factor is 4.5. So, the answer is \boxed{4.5}

**Final Answer**
The factor by which the ratio changes is \boxed{4.5}.
