# Original Question

You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G-HA fusion protein in the transgenic mouse model is due to the **absence of a Kozak sequence** in the construct. The Kozak sequence is a critical eukaryotic translation initiation signal that ensures efficient ribosome recognition of the start codon (ATG). Its consensus sequence, **CCRCCAUGG** (where R is a purine), includes a purine at the -3 position relative to the ATG and a guanine at the +4 position. 

In the provided construct, the coding sequence begins directly with **ATG** (the start codon) without any upstream nucleotides. This lack of a Kozak sequence prevents proper ribosome binding and translation initiation, drastically reducing protein expression. Even though the HA tag is correctly inserted in-frame at the N-terminus, the absence of this regulatory element renders the construct non-functional for efficient protein production in eukaryotic cells like CHO cells or transgenic mice. 

**Solution:** Introduce a Kozak sequence (e.g., **GCCACC**) immediately upstream of the ATG start codon to ensure robust translation initiation.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in the transgenic mouse model. Let me start by going through the process step by step. 

First, the goal is to create a transgenic mouse with inducible overexpression of GADD45G, which has an HA tag (influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant) at the N-terminus. They made a plasmid with the modified gene, transfected CHO cells, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't expressing well. The problem is likely in the construct design since the initial tests showed the plus strand sequence provided.

Looking at the sequence: the plus strand is given as 5' to 3'. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The HA tag sequence is usually a short peptide (YPYDVPDYA), which corresponds to the DNA sequence TATCCATATGATGTACCAGACTACGCG or something similar. Let me check the provided DNA sequence to see if the HA tag is correctly inserted.

The start codon is ATG. Then, the next sequence after ATG should code for the HA tag. Let's translate the beginning of the given DNA sequence. The plus strand is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand (assuming the construct is in a vector with a promoter that transcribes this strand). The coding sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine), then the next codons should be for the HA tag.

Let's translate the first part of the DNA:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...

Breaking it into codons:

ATG (M) TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) V (GTT is V?), wait, wait. Wait, DNA is read in triplets. Let me write them properly:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...

So:

ATG (M) TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCC (A) AAA (K)...

So the translated amino acids would be: M Y P Y D V P D Y A K...

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see: The HA tag in amino acids is Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala. So the DNA sequence should code for that. Let's check:

The HA tag's DNA sequence. Each amino acid's codon:

Tyr (TAC or TAT), Pro (CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT), Tyr (TAC), Asp (GAT or GAC), Val (GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG), Pro (same as before), Asp (GAT), Tyr (TAC), Ala (GCC, etc.), then maybe another residue.

Looking at the given DNA sequence:

After ATG (M), the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K)... So the amino acid sequence is M Y P Y D V P D Y A K...

Comparing to HA tag: Y P Y D V P D Y A. Wait, the HA tag is 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. So the recombinant protein should start with M (from ATG) followed by the HA tag. But in the construct, after the start codon, the HA tag is present as Y P Y D V P D Y A, which matches the HA tag. Then the next amino acid is K (AAA), which is lysine. So the HA tag is correctly inserted here. So that part seems okay.

But wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but perhaps the Kozak sequence is missing. The Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotes. The consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where the AUG is the start codon. If the Kozak sequence isn't present, the translation initiation might be inefficient, leading to low protein expression.

Looking at the sequence around the start codon. The construct starts with ATG (the start codon). Let's look at the nucleotides before the ATG. Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand of the construct. The start codon is the first three nucleotides: ATG. But in eukaryotic genes, the Kozak sequence is a nucleotide sequence that helps initiate translation. The Kozak sequence typically has a 'CC' before the ATG and a 'G' after. For example, something like 'CCAUGG'. If the construct doesn't have a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low expression.

In the given sequence, the start codon is the very first three nucleotides: ATG. So the nucleotides before ATG would be... Wait, the construct starts with ATG. There's no sequence before the ATG. In a proper eukaryotic expression vector, the promoter would drive transcription, and the mRNA would have a 5' UTR with a Kozak sequence before the ATG. If the ATG is the very first codon without any Kozak context, the ribosome might not recognize it well, leading to poor translation initiation. That could explain the low expression.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame. Wait, but when we translated the beginning, the HA tag seems to be in frame. Let me check again. The HA tag is 9 amino acids. The DNA sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA. Let's count the nucleotides: each codon is 3 nucleotides. So from ATG (position 1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), AAA (31-33)... So the HA tag is Y P Y D V P D Y A, which is 9 amino acids. The HA tag is correctly in frame here. So the frame is correct.

Another possibility is that the promoter isn't functional, but the user said they tested the construct in CHO cells with antibiotic selection, so the plasmid likely has a promoter. But maybe the promoter is not inducible, or the inducible system isn't working. However, the user mentioned that the construct is inducible. Wait, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed as expected. The user might have used an inducible promoter (like Tet-On or something), but maybe the induction wasn't done properly. But the user says that when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein. The problem is in the construct itself, as they realized after looking at the sequence.

Another possibility is that the plasmid has the gene in the reverse orientation. If the gene is cloned in the opposite direction relative to the promoter, it won't be transcribed. But the user provided the plus strand sequence. If the plasmid is designed such that the promoter drives transcription of the plus strand, then the provided sequence is correct. But if the gene is inserted in the reverse direction, the promoter wouldn't transcribe it. However, the user says they transfected the plasmid and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, which suggests that the plasmid has a selectable marker (like neomycin resistance) and the gene is under a promoter. If the gene was in the wrong orientation, they might not get expression. But the user's construct was made to have the HA tag, so maybe the cloning process had an error in the orientation.

Wait, but the user provided the plus strand sequence. Let's check if the start codon is in the correct reading frame. The start codon is ATG, which is correct. The HA tag is in frame. So maybe the problem is that the Kozak sequence is missing. If the construct starts directly with ATG without any Kozak sequence, the translation initiation would be inefficient. The Kozak sequence in mammals is typically something like 'gccRCCaugG', where R is a purine (A or G). The critical part is having a purine at position -3 (three nucleotides before the ATG) and a G at position +4 (after the ATG). In the given sequence, the ATG is the first three nucleotides, so there's no nucleotides before it. Therefore, the Kozak sequence is absent. That would severely impair translation initiation, leading to low or no protein expression. That's probably the issue.

So the answer is that the construct lacks a Kozak sequence, which is necessary for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. Without the Kozak sequence, the ribosome doesn't recognize the start codon properly, resulting in low expression of the GADD45G-HA fusion protein.

I need to identify why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in our transgenic mouse model, so I'll analyze the situation methodically.

To begin with, the objective was to develop a transgenic mouse with inducible overexpression of GADD45G, incorporating an HA tag (influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant) at the N-terminus. The research team constructed a plasmid containing the modified gene, then transfected CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but protein expression remains inadequate. Since initial tests revealed the plus strand sequence, the issue likely stems from the construct design itself.

Examining the sequence: the plus strand is presented in 5' to 3' orientation. The HA tag should be positioned at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Typically, the HA tag consists of a short peptide sequence (YPYDVPDYA), which corresponds to a DNA sequence like TATCCATATGATGTACCAGACTACGCG or something comparable. I should verify whether this tag is properly inserted in the provided DNA sequence.

The sequence begins with ATG as the start codon. Following this, we should find the coding sequence for the HA tag. Considering the plus strand runs 5' to 3', the mRNA would match this strand (assuming the construct includes a promoter that transcribes this strand). The coding sequence initiates with ATG (start codon for methionine), followed by codons that should encode the HA tag.

Translating the initial portion of the DNA sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA...

When organized into codons:

ATG (M) TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCC (A) AAA (K)...

This translates to the amino acid sequence: M Y P Y D V P D Y A K...

I need to determine why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as anticipated in the transgenic mouse model. I'll approach this by examining the process step by step.

The objective is to create a transgenic mouse capable of inducible overexpression of GADD45G, with an HA tag (influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant) attached to the N-terminus. A plasmid containing the modified gene was constructed, CHO cells were transfected, and antibiotic-resistant colonies were selected. However, the protein expression is suboptimal. The issue likely resides in the construct design, as the initial results indicated a plus strand sequence was used.

Considering the sequence: it's provided in the 5' to 3' direction. The HA tag is intended to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The HA tag is typically a short peptide (YPYDVPDYA) that corresponds to the DNA sequence TATCCATATGATGTACCAGACTACGCG or something similar. I'll examine the provided DNA sequence to confirm the correct insertion of the HA tag.

The start codon is ATG. Following ATG, the sequence should encode the HA tag. Translating the beginning of the DNA sequence, since the plus strand is 5' to 3', the mRNA will mirror this strand, assuming the strand is transcribed in a vector with a promoter. The coding sequence begins with ATG (start codon for methionine), followed by codons representing the HA tag.

So the HA tag seems correctly inserted here. The start codon is followed by the HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G.\n\nBut the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe there's another issue. Let's think about possible issues in the construct. Common problems could include:\n\n1. No Kozak sequence: For efficient translation initiation in eukaryotes, a Kozak sequence (CCACCAUGG) is needed around the start codon. If the start codon is not in a good context, the translation might be inefficient.\n\nLooking at the sequence: The start codon is ATG. Let's check the surrounding nucleotides. The sequence before ATG is ... (assuming the construct starts with ATG). Wait, the given plus strand starts with ATG, so the immediate upstream would depend on the vector. But if the construct starts with ATG, maybe there's no Kozak sequence. For example, the Kozak sequence is typically something like CCRCCAUGG (where R is a purine). The nucleotides before ATG are important. If the ATG is just at the beginning without a proper Kozak sequence, translation might be inefficient, leading to low expression.\n\nBut the given sequence starts with ATG, so maybe the vector provides the Kozak sequence upstream. But if the user designed the insert without considering the Kozak sequence, that could be a problem. However, the user is using a mammalian expression system (CHO cells), so Kozak sequence is important.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame. Wait, let's check the translation again. The HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA). Let's count the nucleotides. Each amino acid is 3 nucleotides, so 9*3=27 nucleotides. Let's see the first part:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...\n\nFrom ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6: Y), CCA (7-9: P), TAC (10-12: Y), GAT (13-15: D), GTT (16-18: V), CCA (19-21: P), GAT (22-24: D), TAC (25-27: Y), GCC (28-30: A), AAA (31-33: K). So the HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, which is 9 amino acids. Wait, the HA tag is usually 9 aa: YPYDVPDYA. So the last A is from GCC (Ala). Then the next is AAA (Lys). So the HA tag is correctly inserted here. So the frame seems correct. So the HA tag is in frame with the start codon, and the rest of the GADD45G follows.\n\nAnother possibility is that the promoter isn't functional, but the user used an inducible system. Maybe the induction isn't working, but the user tested the construct in CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, so the plasmid should have a promoter. Alternatively, the plasmid might have the gene in the reverse orientation relative to the promoter. Wait, the plus strand is given as 5' to 3', but if the promoter is, say, a CMV promoter that drives transcription in the forward direction, then the inserted gene should be in the same direction. If the construct was cloned in reverse, the promoter wouldn't transcribe the gene. But the user says they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells. If the plasmid was in the wrong orientation, the mRNA wouldn't be produced. But the user might have checked for mRNA, but the problem is protein expression. However, the user observed that the protein isn't overexpressed. If the plasmid was in the wrong orientation, there would be no mRNA, hence no protein. But the user might have checked for mRNA, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the antibiotic resistance is a separate cassette, so the colonies are resistant regardless of the insert orientation. So if the insert is in the reverse orientation, the gene isn't expressed. But the user tested the expression level, so maybe they did a Western blot or something and saw no protein. So that's a possibility. But how can we check that from the given sequence?\n\nWait, the plus strand of the construct is given. If the construct is cloned into a vector in such a way that the promoter transcribes the minus strand, then the plus strand here would be the non-coding strand. But usually, the plus strand is the coding strand. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the rest of the gene is in frame. Wait, the user says they added the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag is correctly in frame, then the rest should follow. But maybe there's a mutation or a stop codon introduced.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence, after the HA tag, the next part is GCC AAA ... which is Alanine (A) followed by Lysine (K). Then the sequence continues. Let me check if there's a premature stop codon in the sequence. Let's translate the entire coding sequence to see if there's an early stop codon.\n\nBut that's time-consuming. Alternatively, look for in-frame stop codons. Let's take the DNA sequence starting from ATG and translate it step by step.\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAA GTC TTG AAC GTG GAC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTC TGC TGC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA\n\nWait, the user provided the plus strand as 5' to 3', so the mRNA is the same. Let's translate this. Starting from ATG:\n\nM Y P Y D V P D Y A K * ... Wait, the 10th codon after ATG is AAA (K), then the next codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! There's a TGA (stop codon) right after the HA tag. That's a problem. Let me check:\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (M)\n\n4-6: TAC (Y)\n\n7-9: CCA (P)\n\n10-12: TAC (Y)\n\n13-15: GAT (D)\n\n16-18: GTT (V)\n\n19-21: CCA (P)\n\n22-24: GAT (D)\n\n25-27: TAC (Y)\n\n28-30: GCC (A)\n\n31-33: AAA (K)\n\n34-36: TGA (Stop)\n\nSo after the HA tag (which is Y P Y D V P D Y A), the next codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). Wait, no, the HA tag is 9 amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A. The 10th amino acid would be K (AAA), then TGA (stop). So the coding sequence has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. That's why the protein isn't being expressed; the translation is terminating early. The inserted HA tag is followed by a stop codon, so the protein is truncated after the HA tag plus a lysine. Therefore, the full-length GADD45G isn't produced, leading to no overexpression of the intended protein.\n\nBut why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the sequence again. The user said they introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. The original GADD45G coding sequence should follow the HA tag. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag and a lysine (AAA), there's a TGA stop codon. That suggests that when they inserted the HA tag, they accidentally introduced a frame shift or included a stop codon. Wait, but the HA tag is in frame. Let's see: the HA tag is 9 amino acids, which is 27 nucleotides. Then the next codon is AAA (position 31-33), which is in the same reading frame. Then TGA (34-36) is the next codon. So the HA tag is correctly inserted, but immediately after, there's a lysine and a stop codon. That must be an error in the construct design. The original GADD45G sequence must have been cloned in such a way that after the HA tag, there's a stop codon. This could happen if, for example, the HA tag was inserted via a restriction site that caused a frame shift, but in this case, the frame seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted, and the rest of the gene was not properly ligated, leading to a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag was added via PCR with a primer that introduced a stop codon by mistake.\n\nLooking at the sequence: After the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys) at 28-30? Wait, no. Wait, positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TAC, 7-9: CCA, 10-12: TAC, 13-15: GAT, 16-18: GTT, 19-21: CCA, 22-24: GAT, 25-27: TAC, 28-30: GCC (A), 31-33: AAA (K), 34-36: TGA (stop). So after the HA tag (9 amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A), the next amino acid is K (AAA), then stop. So the HA tag is followed by K and then a stop. That's definitely a problem. The GADD45G coding sequence should follow the HA tag without a stop codon. Therefore, the construct has an unintended stop codon right after the HA tag, which prevents the full-length protein from being expressed. The user probably made a mistake during the cloning process, such as incorrect primer design leading to the insertion of the TGA codon. Alternatively, there might have been a mutation during the cloning steps. This premature stop codon would result in a truncated protein (just the HA tag plus K) which is likely not functional and wouldn't be detected in overexpression, explaining the failed experiment.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445072, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2877, prompt_tokens=998, total_tokens=3875, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The issue lies in the presence of a premature stop codon immediately following the HA tag in the constructed plasmid. Here's the breakdown:

1. **HA Tag Insertion**: The HA tag sequence (coding for YPYDVPDYA) is correctly inserted at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The translated HA tag spans the first 9 amino acids after the start codon (MYPYDVPDYA).

2. **Premature Stop Codon**:  
   - After the HA tag, the next codon is **AAA** (Lys), followed by **TGA** (stop codon) at positions 34â36 of the provided sequence.  
   - This results in translation termination immediately after the HA tag, producing a truncated protein (HA tag + Lys) instead of the full-length GADD45G.  

3. **Root Cause**:  
   The premature TGA stop codon was likely introduced during cloning, possibly due to:  
   - A primer design error when fusing the HA tag to GADD45G.  
   - Accidental inclusion of a stop codon in the synthetic construct.  
   - Frameshift or unintended mutations during PCR/ligation steps.  

4. **Consequence**:  
   The truncated protein lacks the functional domains of GADD45G, preventing its overexpression and rendering affinity purification/partner identification impossible.  

**Solution**:  
- **Revise the construct** to remove the premature stop codon (TGA at positions 34â36) and ensure the HA tag is seamlessly fused in-frame with the full-length GADD45G coding sequence.  
- Verify the corrected sequence via sequencing before proceeding with transfection.

no acids is Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala. So the DNA sequence should code for that. Let's check the codons here.

The first part after ATG (M) is TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), etc. So the amino acid sequence after the initial methionine would be Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A... which matches the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). So the HA tag seems correctly inserted here. The start codon is followed by the HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe there's another issue. Let's think about possible issues in the construct. Common problems could include:

1. No Kozak sequence: For efficient translation initiation in eukaryotes, a Kozak sequence (CCACCAUGG) is needed around the start codon. If the start codon is not in a good context, the translation might be inefficient.

Looking at the sequence: The start codon is ATG. Let's check the surrounding nucleotides. The sequence before ATG is ... (assuming the construct starts with ATG). Wait, the given plus strand starts with ATG, so the immediate upstream would depend on the vector. But if the construct starts with ATG, maybe there's no Kozak sequence. For example, the Kozak sequence is typically something like CCRCCAUGG (where R is a purine). The nucleotides before ATG are important. If the ATG is just at the beginning without a proper Kozak sequence, translation might be inefficient, leading to low expression.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, so maybe the vector provides the Kozak sequence upstream. But if the user designed the insert without considering the Kozak sequence, that could be a problem. However, the user is using a mammalian expression system (CHO cells), so Kozak sequence is important.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame. Wait, let's check the translation again. The HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA). Let's count the nucleotides. Each amino acid is 3 nucleotides, so 9*3=27 nucleotides. Let's see the first part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...

From ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6: Y), CCA (7-9: P), TAC (10-12: Y), GAT (13-15: D), GTT (16-18: V), CCA (19-21: P), GAT (22-24: D), TAC (25-27: Y), GCC (28-30: A), AAA (31-33: K). So the HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, which is 9 amino acids. Wait, the HA tag is usually 9 aa: YPYDVPDYA. So the last A is from GCC (Ala). Then the next is AAA (Lys). So the HA tag is correctly inserted here. So the frame seems correct. So the HA tag is in frame with the start codon, and the rest of the GADD45G follows.

Another possibility is that the promoter isn't functional, but the user used an inducible system. Maybe the induction isn't working, but the user tested the construct in CHO cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, so the plasmid should have a promoter. Alternatively, the plasmid might have the gene in the reverse orientation relative to the promoter. Wait, the plus strand is given as 5' to 3', but if the promoter is, say, a CMV promoter that drives transcription in the forward direction, then the inserted gene should be in the same direction. If the construct was cloned in reverse, the promoter wouldn't transcribe the gene. But the user says they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells. If the plasmid was in the wrong orientation, the mRNA wouldn't be produced. But the user might have checked for mRNA, but the problem is protein expression. However, the user observed that the protein isn't overexpressed. If the plasmid was in the wrong orientation, there would be no mRNA, hence no protein. But the user might have checked for mRNA, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the antibiotic resistance is a separate cassette, so the colonies are resistant regardless of the insert orientation. So if the insert is in the reverse orientation, the gene isn't expressed. But the user tested the expression level, so maybe they did a Western blot or something and saw no protein. So that's a possibility. But how can we check that from the given sequence?

Wait, the plus strand of the construct is given. If the construct is cloned into a vector in such a way that the promoter transcribes the minus strand, then the plus strand here would be the non-coding strand. But usually, the plus strand is the coding strand. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the rest of the gene is in frame. Wait, the user says they added the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag is correctly in frame, then the rest should follow. But maybe there's a mutation or a stop codon introduced.

Looking at the DNA sequence, after the HA tag, the next part is GCC AAA ... which is Alanine (A) followed by Lysine (K). Then the sequence continues. Let me check if there's a premature stop codon in the sequence. Let's translate the entire coding sequence to see if there's an early stop codon.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, look for in-frame stop codons. Let's take the DNA sequence starting from ATG and translate it step by step.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAA GTC TTG AAC GTG GAC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTC TGC TGC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, the user provided the plus strand as 5' to 3', so the mRNA is the same. Let's translate this. Starting from ATG:

M Y P Y D V P D Y A K * ... Wait, the 10th codon after ATG is AAA (K), then the next codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! There's a TGA (stop codon) right after the HA tag. That's a problem. Let me check:

Breaking down the first part:

Positions 1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (Stop)

So after the HA tag (which is Y P Y D V P D Y A), the next codon is AAA (K), then TGA (stop). Wait, no, the HA tag is 9 amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A. The 10th amino acid would be K (AAA), then TGA (stop). So the coding sequence has a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. That's why the protein isn't being expressed; the translation is terminating early. The inserted HA tag is followed by a stop codon, so the protein is truncated after the HA tag plus a lysine. Therefore, the full-length GADD45G isn't produced, leading to no overexpression of the intended protein.

But why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the sequence again. The user said they introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. The original GADD45G coding sequence should follow the HA tag. But in the provided construct, after the HA tag and a lysine (AAA), there's a TGA stop codon. That suggests that when they inserted the HA tag, they accidentally introduced a frame shift or included a stop codon. Wait, but the HA tag is in frame. Let's see: the HA tag is 9 amino acids, which is 27 nucleotides. Then the next codon is AAA (position 31-33), which is in the same reading frame. Then TGA (34-36) is the next codon. So the HA tag is correctly inserted, but immediately after, there's a lysine and a stop codon. That must be an error in the construct design. The original GADD45G sequence must have been cloned in such a way that after the HA tag, there's a stop codon. This could happen if, for example, the HA tag was inserted via a restriction site that caused a frame shift, but in this case, the frame seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted, and the rest of the gene was not properly ligated, leading to a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA tag was added via PCR with a primer that introduced a stop codon by mistake.

Looking at the sequence: After the HA tag (positions 1-27), the next codon is AAA (Lys) at 28-30? Wait, no. Wait, positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TAC, 7-9: CCA, 10-12: TAC, 13-15: GAT, 16-18: GTT, 19-21: CCA, 22-24: GAT, 25-27: TAC, 28-30: GCC (A), 31-33: AAA (K), 34-36: TGA (stop). So after the HA tag (9 amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A), the next amino acid is K (AAA), then stop. So the HA tag is followed by K and then a stop. That's definitely a problem. The GADD45G coding sequence should follow the HA tag without a stop codon. Therefore, the construct has an unintended stop codon right after the HA tag, which prevents the full-length protein from being expressed. The user probably made a mistake during the cloning process, such as incorrect primer design leading to the insertion of the TGA codon. Alternatively, there might have been a mutation during the cloning steps. This premature stop codon would result in a truncated protein (just the HA tag plus K) which is likely not functional and wouldn't be detected in overexpression, explaining the failed experiment.

However, the translated sequence here starts with M (from ATG) followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K... So the HA tag is present here (YPYDVPDYA), but the start codon (ATG) adds an extra methionine (M) at the beginning. Wait, but in recombinant proteins, the HA tag is usually placed right after the start codon. So the start codon (M) followed by the HA tag. So the HA tag would be part of the N-terminal. However, the HA tag\'s first amino acid is Y (TAC or TAT in DNA).

That\'s standard, as the start codon is Met, followed by the tag. So that part seems okay.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the Kozak sequence. The Kozak sequence is important for efficient initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. The Kozak consensus sequence is typically around the start codon: CCRCCAUGG (where R is a purine). The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG (the context) are important for ribosome recognition. If the Kozak sequence is not properly designed, the translation initiation might be inefficient, leading to low protein expression.\n\nLooking at the provided DNA sequence: The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG would be part of the 5\' UTR. However, the user hasn\'t provided the entire plasmid sequence, only the coding sequence starting with ATG. If the construct lacks a proper Kozak sequence (like a GCCGCCACC before ATG), then the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently. But since the user says they transfected CHO cells and selected colonies, perhaps the promoter and other regulatory elements are present. However, the problem might be in the Kozak sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HA tag is inserted in the reverse orientation. Wait, the HA tag\'s DNA sequence should be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me check the HA tag\'s DNA sequence. The HA tag is usually encoded by a nucleotide sequence such as TAC CCA TAT GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC (which translates to Y P Y D V P D Y). Let\'s check the given DNA sequence:\n\nThe first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), etc. So the HA tag sequence here is Y P Y D V P D Y A... which matches the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). So the HA tag is correctly inserted here. The start codon is followed by the HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G. So the tag is in the correct position.\n\nAnother possibility is that the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift. But looking at the codons, they are in frame. The HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA), which is 27 nucleotides. The given sequence starts with ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), etc. So after the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is AAA (28-30), which is lysine. But the original GADD45G sequence would start with its own ATG. However, in the construct, the GADD45G coding sequence is supposed to be fused in frame after the HA tag. If the HA tag is inserted in frame, then the rest of the GADD45G should follow. But if there\'s a frameshift, the entire GADD45G would be mistranslated. However, the user says they "modified the gene\'s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein." So the HA tag is added as a fusion to the N-terminus of GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag\'s DNA should be inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the rest of the GADD45G should be in frame. Let\'s check the sequence.\n\nAfter the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is GCC (28-30) which is alanine (A), then AAA (31-33) is lysine (K), then TGA (34-36) is a stop codon (UGA). Wait, TGA is a stop codon. That\'s a problem! If after the HA tag, the next codon is TGA (stop), then the translation would terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein consisting of the HA tag plus a few amino acids, but not the full-length GADD45G. Therefore, the construct would produce a very short peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein. This would explain why the expression levels are low, as the truncated protein might be unstable or not detected in the assay.\n\nLooking at the given DNA sequence:\n\nAfter the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codons are:\n\n28-30: GCC (A)\n31-33: AAA (K)\n34-36: TGA (stop)\nThen CTG (L) at 37-39, etc.\n\nBut wait, the sequence provided is the plus strand (5\' to 3\'). The mRNA would be the same as the plus strand (assuming the promoter is correctly placed). So the mRNA would start with AUG (start), then UAC (Y), CCA (P), UAC (Y), GAU (D), etc. Then after the HA tag, the next codons would be GCC (A), AAA (K), UGA (stop). So the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) right after the HA tag would terminate translation, leading to a truncated protein. Therefore, the GADD45G coding sequence is not properly fused after the HA tag, because there\'s a stop codon inserted.\n\nBut why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the exact positions. The HA tag in the DNA is from position 4 to 27 (since the first three nucleotides are ATG). Let\'s count:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (start)\n4-6: TAC (Y)\n7-9: CCA (P)\n10-12: TAC (Y)\n13-15: GAT (D)\n16-18: GTT (V)\n19-21: CCA (P)\n22-24: GAT (D)\n25-27: TAC (Y)\n28-30: GCC (A)\n31-33: AAA (K)\n34-36: TGA (stop)\n\nSo after the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is GCC (A), then AAA (K), then TGA (stop). This suggests that the HA tag was inserted, but immediately after, there\'s a stop codon. Therefore, the construct is designed such that the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, leading to a very short protein. This would prevent the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the lack of overexpression. The researchers probably made a cloning error where they inserted the HA tag but accidentally introduced a stop codon right after it, either due to a mistake in the primer design or during the cloning process. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the GADD45G coding sequence is out of frame, but in this case, the presence of a stop codon suggests that even if the frame was correct, the stop codon would terminate translation.\n\nWait, but the HA tag is 9 amino acids (27 nucleotides). Let\'s check the exact length. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. The DNA sequence for the HA tag would be 27 nucleotides. Let\'s check the given DNA sequence:\n\nFrom position 4 (after ATG) to position 27: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Wait, that\'s 24 nucleotides (positions 4-27 inclusive). Wait, positions 4-6: TAC, 7-9: CCA, 10-12: TAC, 13-15: GAT, 16-18: GTT, 19-21: CCA, 22-24: GAT, 25-27: TAC. That\'s 8 codons (24 nucleotides), which would be 8 amino acids. But the HA tag is 9 amino acids. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let\'s recount:\n\nATG (1-3) - start.\n\nThen HA tag starts at 4:\n\n4-6: TAC (Y)\n7-9: CCA (P)\n10-12: TAC (Y)\n13-15: GAT (D)\n16-18: GTT (V)\n19-21: CCA (P)\n22-24: GAT (D)\n25-27: TAC (Y)\n28-30: GCC (A)\n31-33: AAA (K)\n34-36: TGA (stop)\n\nSo from 4-27, that\'s 24 nucleotides (8 codons), which would code for Y P Y D V P D Y. Then the next codon is GCC (A), which is position 28-30. Then AAA (K), then TGA (stop). The HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. The given sequence here codes for Y P Y D V P D Y A K stop. So the HA tag is missing the last alanine (A) residue. The HA tag sequence should be YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence here codes for YPYDVPDY, then A K stop. So there\'s a mistake in the HA tag insertion. The HA tag is incomplete, missing the last alanine, and instead, there\'s an alanine and lysine followed by a stop codon. This suggests that the cloning of the HA tag was incorrect, leading to a premature stop codon. Therefore, the construct is not properly designed, resulting in a truncated protein and no overexpression of the full-length GADD45G.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the GADD45G sequence was cloned in the wrong frame. However, the presence of a stop codon right after the HA tag indicates that even if the frame were correct, translation would terminate. Therefore, the main issue is the premature stop codon after the HA tag, which prevents the expression of the full-length protein. The researchers likely made an error during the insertion of the HA tag, either by including an extra nucleotide or designing the primers incorrectly, leading to a frameshift or introducing a stop codon. In this case, the sequence after the HA tag includes a TGA stop codon, which is the problem.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445202, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2769, prompt_tokens=906, total_tokens=3675, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic mouse model is due to a **premature stop codon** introduced immediately after the HA tag sequence in the construct. Here's the breakdown:

1. **HA Tag Insertion**:  
   The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was designed to be fused to the N-terminus of GADD45G. However, the provided DNA sequence shows that after the HA tag codons (positions 4â27), the next codons are **GCC (Alanine), AAA (Lysine), and TGA (stop codon)**. This results in a truncated protein of only 10 amino acids (M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-stop), terminating translation before the GADD45G sequence is expressed.

2. **Root Cause**:  
   The premature stop codon (TGA at positions 34â36) likely arose from a cloning error, such as incorrect primer design or unintended insertion during the HA tag ligation. This error prevents the full-length GADD45G protein from being synthesized, explaining the lack of overexpression.

3. **Solution**:  
   - **Remove the premature stop codon** by correcting the DNA sequence after the HA tag to ensure it is in-frame with the GADD45G coding sequence.  
   - Verify the **Kozak sequence** (if applicable) and ensure proper splicing/regulatory elements are present for efficient transcription and translation.  
   - Sequence-validate the entire construct to confirm the HA tag is intact and the GADD45G coding sequence follows without interruptions.

**Key Takeaway**: The premature termination codon disrupts the fusion proteinâs continuity, leading to a nonfunctional truncated product. Correcting this error will restore full-length GADD45G expression.

no acids is YPYDVPDYA. However, the translated sequence here starts with M (from ATG) followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K... So the HA tag is present here (YPYDVPDYA), but the start codon (ATG) adds an extra methionine (M) at the beginning. Wait, but in recombinant proteins, the HA tag is usually placed right after the start codon. So the start codon (M) followed by the HA tag. So the HA tag would be part of the N-terminal. However, the HA tag's first amino acid is Y (TAC or TAT in DNA). But here, after ATG (M), the next codon is TAC (Y), so the recombinant protein would be M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A... which includes the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) but with an extra methionine at the start. That's standard, as the start codon is Met, followed by the tag. So that part seems okay.

But perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is inserted in a way that disrupts the Kozak sequence. The Kozak sequence is important for efficient initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. The Kozak consensus sequence is typically around the start codon: CCRCCAUGG (where R is a purine). The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG (the context) are important for ribosome recognition. If the Kozak sequence is not properly designed, the translation initiation might be inefficient, leading to low protein expression.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence: The start codon is ATG. The nucleotides before the ATG would be part of the 5' UTR. However, the user hasn't provided the entire plasmid sequence, only the coding sequence starting with ATG. If the construct lacks a proper Kozak sequence (like a GCCGCCACC before ATG), then the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently. But since the user says they transfected CHO cells and selected colonies, perhaps the promoter and other regulatory elements are present. However, the problem might be in the Kozak sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is inserted in the reverse orientation. Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence should be in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me check the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA tag is usually encoded by a nucleotide sequence such as TAC CCA TAT GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC (which translates to Y P Y D V P D Y). Let's check the given DNA sequence:

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), etc. So the HA tag sequence here is Y P Y D V P D Y A... which matches the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). So the HA tag is correctly inserted here. The start codon is followed by the HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G. So the tag is in the correct position.

Another possibility is that the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift. But looking at the codons, they are in frame. The HA tag is 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA), which is 27 nucleotides. The given sequence starts with ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), etc. So after the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is AAA (28-30), which is lysine. But the original GADD45G sequence would start with its own ATG. However, in the construct, the GADD45G coding sequence is supposed to be fused in frame after the HA tag. If the HA tag is inserted in frame, then the rest of the GADD45G should follow. But if there's a frameshift, the entire GADD45G would be mistranslated. However, the user says they "modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein." So the HA tag is added as a fusion to the N-terminus of GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag's DNA should be inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is inserted correctly, the rest of the GADD45G should be in frame. Let's check the sequence.

After the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is GCC (28-30) which is alanine (A), then AAA (31-33) is lysine (K), then TGA (34-36) is a stop codon (UGA). Wait, TGA is a stop codon. That's a problem! If after the HA tag, the next codon is TGA (stop), then the translation would terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein consisting of the HA tag plus a few amino acids, but not the full-length GADD45G. Therefore, the construct would produce a very short peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein. This would explain why the expression levels are low, as the truncated protein might be unstable or not detected in the assay.

Looking at the given DNA sequence:

After the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codons are:

28-30: GCC (A)
31-33: AAA (K)
34-36: TGA (stop)
Then CTG (L) at 37-39, etc.

But wait, the sequence provided is the plus strand (5' to 3'). The mRNA would be the same as the plus strand (assuming the promoter is correctly placed). So the mRNA would start with AUG (start), then UAC (Y), CCA (P), UAC (Y), GAU (D), etc. Then after the HA tag, the next codons would be GCC (A), AAA (K), UGA (stop). So the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) right after the HA tag would terminate translation, leading to a truncated protein. Therefore, the GADD45G coding sequence is not properly fused after the HA tag, because there's a stop codon inserted.

But why is there a stop codon there? Let me check the exact positions. The HA tag in the DNA is from position 4 to 27 (since the first three nucleotides are ATG). Let's count:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TAC (Y)
7-9: CCA (P)
10-12: TAC (Y)
13-15: GAT (D)
16-18: GTT (V)
19-21: CCA (P)
22-24: GAT (D)
25-27: TAC (Y)
28-30: GCC (A)
31-33: AAA (K)
34-36: TGA (stop)

So after the HA tag (positions 4-27), the next codon is GCC (A), then AAA (K), then TGA (stop). This suggests that the HA tag was inserted, but immediately after, there's a stop codon. Therefore, the construct is designed such that the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, leading to a very short protein. This would prevent the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the lack of overexpression. The researchers probably made a cloning error where they inserted the HA tag but accidentally introduced a stop codon right after it, either due to a mistake in the primer design or during the cloning process. Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the GADD45G coding sequence is out of frame, but in this case, the presence of a stop codon suggests that even if the frame was correct, the stop codon would terminate translation.

Wait, but the HA tag is 9 amino acids (27 nucleotides). Let's check the exact length. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. The DNA sequence for the HA tag would be 27 nucleotides. Let's check the given DNA sequence:

From position 4 (after ATG) to position 27: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Wait, that's 24 nucleotides (positions 4-27 inclusive). Wait, positions 4-6: TAC, 7-9: CCA, 10-12: TAC, 13-15: GAT, 16-18: GTT, 19-21: CCA, 22-24: GAT, 25-27: TAC. That's 8 codons (24 nucleotides), which would be 8 amino acids. But the HA tag is 9 amino acids. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let's recount:

ATG (1-3) - start.

Then HA tag starts at 4:

4-6: TAC (Y)
7-9: CCA (P)
10-12: TAC (Y)
13-15: GAT (D)
16-18: GTT (V)
19-21: CCA (P)
22-24: GAT (D)
25-27: TAC (Y)
28-30: GCC (A)
31-33: AAA (K)
34-36: TGA (stop)

So from 4-27, that's 24 nucleotides (8 codons), which would code for Y P Y D V P D Y. Then the next codon is GCC (A), which is position 28-30. Then AAA (K), then TGA (stop). The HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. The given sequence here codes for Y P Y D V P D Y A K stop. So the HA tag is missing the last alanine (A) residue. The HA tag sequence should be YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence here codes for YPYDVPDY, then A K stop. So there's a mistake in the HA tag insertion. The HA tag is incomplete, missing the last alanine, and instead, there's an alanine and lysine followed by a stop codon. This suggests that the cloning of the HA tag was incorrect, leading to a premature stop codon. Therefore, the construct is not properly designed, resulting in a truncated protein and no overexpression of the full-length GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted correctly, but the GADD45G sequence was cloned in the wrong frame. However, the presence of a stop codon right after the HA tag indicates that even if the frame were correct, translation would terminate. Therefore, the main issue is the premature stop codon after the HA tag, which prevents the expression of the full-length protein. The researchers likely made an error during the insertion of the HA tag, either by including an extra nucleotide or designing the primers incorrectly, leading to a frameshift or introducing a stop codon. In this case, the sequence after the HA tag includes a TGA stop codon, which is the problem.

So the amino acids after M are Y P Y D V P D Y A... which is exactly the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) preceded by the start methionine. So the HA tag is correctly inserted at the N-terminus.\n\nWait, but the HA tag is usually added as a tag, so the start codon (M) followed by the HA tag. However, sometimes the HA tag is inserted without an additional methionine. But in this case, the construct starts with ATG (M) followed by the HA tag. That seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is the presence of an internal methionine (ATG) downstream, which could lead to alternative initiation sites. Let's check the rest of the sequence for ATG codons. The original GADD45G coding sequence might have internal ATGs that could act as start codons, leading to truncated proteins. However, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so if there's another ATG downstream, the ribosome might initiate there, producing a protein without the HA tag. Let's check the provided DNA sequence for other ATG codons.\n\nLooking through the sequence:\n\nAfter the initial ATG (position 1-3), the next ATG is at position 25-27: AAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC... (the sequence is 5' to 3'). The codon here is ATG (positions 25-27), which would be in the same reading frame? Let's check the reading frame.\n\nOriginal start codon is at positions 1-3 (ATG). The next ATG is at positions 25-27. Let's see the reading frame. The first codon is 1-3, so the next codons are 4-6 (TAC), 7-9 (CCA), 10-12 (TAC), etc. The next ATG is at positions 25-27. Let's count the nucleotides:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (M)\n4-6: TAC (Y)\n7-9: CCA (P)\n10-12: TAC (Y)\n13-15: GAT (D)\n16-18: GTT (V)\n19-21: CCA (P)\n22-24: GAT (D)\n25-27: TAC (Y)\nWait, no.

So in the same reading frame, after the initial ATG, the next ATG is at position 34-36. Let's check the reading frame. The initial ATG is in frame 1. The next ATG is at position 34, which is 33 nucleotides after the start. 33 divided by 3 is 11 codons. So the 11th codon after the start is AAA (position 31-33), then ATG (position 34-36). So this ATG is in the same reading frame as the original start codon. If the ribosome were to initiate here, it would produce a protein starting with M (from position 34-36) instead of the HA-tagged version. This would result in a truncated protein missing the HA tag and the initial part of GADD45G. However, the presence of a Kozak sequence around the original start codon is important for efficient initiation. If the original ATG has a strong Kozak sequence (e.g., GCCGCCATG G), then the ribosome would preferentially initiate there. If the downstream ATG has a better Kozak sequence, initiation might occur there, leading to a shorter protein. Let's check the surrounding sequences.\n\nOriginal start codon (positions 1-3): ATG. The nucleotides before (upstream) are not provided, but in the construct, the promoter and 5' UTR would influence the Kozak sequence. However, the user-provided sequence starts with ATG, so perhaps the Kozak sequence is not optimal. The next ATG at position 34-36 is preceded by AAA (position 31-33), which is part of the codon AAA (K) at position 31-33, and the ATG is followed by ACT (T). The Kozak consensus sequence is typically CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The original ATG (position 1-3) is preceded by ... (unknown, since the sequence starts at ATG), but the next ATG (position 34-36) is preceded by AAA (A is a purine) and followed by ACT (A is a purine in the third position of the codon, but the next codon starts with A). Wait, the Kozak sequence is more about the nucleotides around the ATG. The critical positions are -3 (a purine) and +4 (a G). For the original ATG (positions 1-3), the +4 nucleotide is T (from TAC, position 4-6: T A C). The +4 position is the fourth nucleotide after the start of the ATG, which is position 4 (T). The Kozak sequence prefers a G at +4. So if the original ATG has a T at +4, that's suboptimal. The downstream ATG at position 34-36: the preceding three nucleotides are AAA (positions 31-33), so the -3 position is A (a purine, which is good). The +4 nucleotide would be position 37 (A in ACT). So the +4 is A, which is not ideal. However, the original ATG's +4 is T, and the downstream ATG's +4 is A. Neither is ideal, but the original might have a weaker Kozak sequence. If the original ATG lacks a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might leak and initiate at the downstream ATG, leading to a truncated protein. This could result in lower expression of the full-length HA-tagged protein and possibly a shorter form without the tag. The user observed low expression, which could be due to this.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the HA tag might interfere with the protein's stability or the gene's expression. But the immediate issue is the presence of an in-frame ATG downstream, which could lead to alternative initiation. Another possibility is that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift. Let's check that. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence encoding this is TAT CCA TAT GAT GTT CCA GAT TAT GCT (for example). Let's compare with the given sequence:\n\nThe provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA...\n\nTranslating the first part:\n\nATG (M) TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCC (A) AAA (K)...\n\nSo the HA tag is Y P Y D V P D Y A K... The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, so the ninth amino acid should be A (alanine), which is encoded by GCC here. Then comes AAA (K). So the HA tag is correctly encoded here. The reading frame is correct. Therefore, the HA tag is in frame, and the start codon is present. However, the presence of the downstream ATG (at position 34-36) in the same reading frame could lead to initiation there, producing a protein starting with M (from position 34) followed by T L E E V R..., which would be a truncated version missing the HA tag and the first part of GADD45G. This would result in lower levels of the full-length HA-tagged protein because some ribosomes initiate at the downstream ATG. The full-length protein would have the HA tag, but if a significant portion of translation starts at the downstream ATG, the overall expression of the desired protein would be lower than expected. This could explain the inability to overexpress the protein as intended.\n\nAnother possibility is that the plasmid design lacks a proper promoter or other regulatory elements, but the user mentioned that they tested expression in CHO cells and observed low levels. If the promoter and other elements were missing, they might not get any expression. However, since they did get some colonies (antibiotic-resistant), the plasmid likely has a selection marker and a promoter. The problem is more likely in the coding sequence itself.\n\nAnother angle: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, which might interfere with the protein's function or stability. However, the user's main issue is expression level, not functionality. If the protein is unstable due to the tag, it might be degraded, leading to low levels. But the initial step is to check the construct design.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a stop codon in the sequence. Let's check the entire provided sequence for in-frame stop codons. The given sequence is the plus strand (5' to 3'). The coding sequence is from ATG to TGA (positions ...GAGTGA at the end). The last three nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct includes a stop codon at the end. Let's check if there are any premature stop codons in the HA tag or GADD45G sequence.\n\nTranslating the entire provided sequence (assuming the plus strand is the coding strand, so mRNA is same as plus strand, translation in frame 1):\n\nStart with ATG (M), then Y P Y D V P D Y A K M T L E E V R G P G H S S G K H S Q D A G C R E S A A ... (continuing until TGA at the end). Let's check for stop codons in the middle. The sequence ends with TGA, so the main stop is at the end. Are there any in-frame stops before that? Let's check a few sections.\n\nAfter the initial HA tag and the next ATG (positions 34-36: ATG), the translation would be M T L E E V R... (assuming initiation here). But if the main ORF starts at the first ATG, then the downstream ATG is part of the coding sequence. However, if the ribosome skips the first ATG and starts at the second, that's a problem. But the presence of internal ATGs in the same reading frame can lead to truncated proteins if initiation occurs there. However, the main issue here is the presence of an internal ATG in the same reading frame, leading to possible alternative initiation. The Kozak sequence around the first ATG might be weak, leading to some ribosomes initiating downstream. This would reduce the amount of full-length protein. To confirm, the user could perform a Western blot with an HA antibody. If there's a lower band (without HA) and a higher band (with HA), that would indicate leaky initiation. If only the lower band is present, the HA tag might not be properly expressed. But the user mentioned they can't overexpress the protein as expected, so maybe the majority of initiation is at the downstream site, leading to non-HA-tagged protein, which wouldn't be detected if they're using an HA antibody for purification. Wait, but the user's plan is to affinity-purify using the HA tag. If the protein is not tagged because of alternative initiation, then the affinity purification wouldn't work. However, the user's immediate problem is low expression. If the majority of the protein is initiated at the downstream ATG (without HA tag), then the HA-tagged protein would be a smaller fraction, leading to lower expression levels detected when using HA-based detection. Alternatively, if the HA tag is present but the protein is not expressed due to other reasons.\n\nAnother possibility: the HA tag was inserted in-frame, but the codon usage is suboptimal for CHO cells, leading to inefficient translation. However, CHO cells are typically robust for codon usage, and the HA tag is a common tag, so this is less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the plasmid might have been constructed in reverse orientation. If the promoter is on the opposite strand, the gene wouldn't be transcribed. However, the user mentioned they did get some expression (albeit low), so the promoter is likely correctly oriented.\n\nAnother check: the presence of introns or splice sites. If the construct includes intronic sequences that are being spliced out, but the user is using a cDNA, so this is less likely.\n\nWait, the user provided the plus strand sequence. Let me check the sequence for possible issues. The HA tag is correctly inserted. The start codon is present. The stop codon is at the end. The problem is likely the internal ATG leading to alternative initiation. The solution would be to mutate that internal ATG (at position 34-36) to a different codon, such as CTG (leucine), which would preserve the amino acid if it's a leucine in the original protein, or another synonymous mutation, thereby eliminating the internal start codon. Alternatively, if that ATG is part of the native GADD45G sequence, mutating it might affect the protein's function. However, in the context of overexpression, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, optimizing the Kozak sequence around the original ATG to enhance initiation there, making it stronger than the downstream ATG. For example, changing the nucleotides around the initial ATG to match the Kozak consensus (e.g., adding a purine at -3 and a G at +4). In the current sequence, the initial ATG is followed by TAC (T at +4), which is not ideal. Changing the +4 position to G would improve the Kozak sequence. For example, if the codon after ATG is TAC (Y), changing the third nucleotide of that codon to G would make it TAG (stop) which is bad. Wait, the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y). The +4 nucleotide is the first T in TAC. To change +4 to G, the codon would become TGC (Cysteine) or TCC (Serine), etc. Alternatively, adjusting the nucleotides before the ATG to have a purine at -3. Since the provided sequence starts with ATG, we don't know the upstream context. If the promoter and 5' UTR are not properly designed with a Kozak sequence, the initiation might be inefficient, leading to ribosomes initiating at the downstream ATG. Therefore, the problem is likely a combination of a weak Kozak sequence at the intended start codon and a downstream in-frame ATG causing alternative initiation, resulting in truncated proteins and low expression of the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445324, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4100, prompt_tokens=903, total_tokens=5003, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The issue lies in the presence of an **internal in-frame ATG codon** within the GADD45G coding sequence, which acts as an unintended alternative translation start site. This results in the production of a truncated protein lacking the HA tag and the N-terminal portion of GADD45G, reducing the expression of the full-length HA-tagged protein. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Key Problem: Internal ATG Causes Truncation**
1. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The provided DNA sequence starts with the HA tag (correctly encoded as **ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC...**), translating to **MYPYDVPDYA...**.
   - However, a downstream in-frame **ATG** codon (positions 34â36: `AAA**ATG**ACT...`) is present in the same reading frame. This corresponds to a methionine (**M**) at the amino acid level.

2. **Consequence**:
   - Ribosomes may initiate translation at this internal ATG, producing a shorter protein starting with **MTLEEVR...** instead of the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G.
   - The truncated protein lacks the HA tag, making it undetectable by HA-based affinity purification and reducing the observed expression of the desired protein.

3. **Why This Happened**:
   - The original ATG (for the HA tag) lacks a strong **Kozak sequence** (consensus: `CCRCCAUGG`), which is critical for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotes. 
   - The weak Kozak context (e.g., a non-optimal nucleotide at the +4 position, such as **T** in the original ATGâs sequence) allows ribosomes to "leak" and initiate at the downstream ATG.

---

### **Solution**
To resolve this, **eliminate the internal ATG** and **strengthen the Kozak sequence** of the intended start codon:

1. **Mutate the internal ATG** (e.g., change `ATG` at positions 34â36 to `CTG` or `GTG`), preserving the amino acid if possible (e.g., if the original codon encodes leucine or valine). This prevents alternative initiation.
   
2. **Optimize the Kozak sequence** around the original ATG:
   - Ensure a purine (A/G) at the -3 position (e.g., change upstream nucleotides if necessary).
   - Introduce a guanine (G) at the +4 position (e.g., modify the codon after ATG from `TAC` to `TGC` or `TCC` to improve the Kozak context).

---

### **Example Correction**
**Original sequence at the start**:
```
ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ATG ACT...
```
**Modified sequence** (optimized Kozak + mutated internal ATG):
```
ATG **GCC** TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA **CTG** ACT...
```
- **GCC** replaces TAC after ATG to improve the +4 position (now `G`).
- **CTG** replaces the internal ATG to eliminate the unwanted start codon.

---

### **Verification**
- Perform **Western blotting** with anti-HA and anti-GADD45G antibodies to confirm full-length HA-tagged protein expression.
- Use **ribosome profiling** or **mutagenesis** to validate the impact of the internal ATG on translation initiation.

This adjustment ensures robust expression of the HA-tagged GADD45G, enabling downstream studies on its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The DNA sequence after ATG starts with TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCT (A)... So the amino acids after M are Y P Y D V P D Y A... which is exactly the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) preceded by the start methionine. So the HA tag is correctly inserted at the N-terminus.

Wait, but the HA tag is usually added as a tag, so the start codon (M) followed by the HA tag. However, sometimes the HA tag is inserted without an additional methionine. But in this case, the construct starts with ATG (M) followed by the HA tag. That seems correct.

But perhaps the problem is the presence of an internal methionine (ATG) downstream, which could lead to alternative initiation sites. Let's check the rest of the sequence for ATG codons. The original GADD45G coding sequence might have internal ATGs that could act as start codons, leading to truncated proteins. However, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so if there's another ATG downstream, the ribosome might initiate there, producing a protein without the HA tag. Let's check the provided DNA sequence for other ATG codons.

Looking through the sequence:

After the initial ATG (position 1-3), the next ATG is at position 25-27: AAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC... (the sequence is 5' to 3'). The codon here is ATG (positions 25-27), which would be in the same reading frame? Let's check the reading frame.

Original start codon is at positions 1-3 (ATG). The next ATG is at positions 25-27. Let's see the reading frame. The first codon is 1-3, so the next codons are 4-6 (TAC), 7-9 (CCA), 10-12 (TAC), etc. The next ATG is at positions 25-27. Let's count the nucleotides:

Positions 1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TAC (Y)
7-9: CCA (P)
10-12: TAC (Y)
13-15: GAT (D)
16-18: GTT (V)
19-21: CCA (P)
22-24: GAT (D)
25-27: TAC (Y)
Wait, no. Wait, the sequence after the initial ATG is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC...

Breaking down:

1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TAC (Y)
7-9: CCA (P)
10-12: TAC (Y)
13-15: GAT (D)
16-18: GTT (V)
19-21: CCA (P)
22-24: GAT (D)
25-27: TAC (Y)
28-30: GCC (A)
31-33: AAA (K)
34-36: ATG (M) <-- here's another ATG
37-39: ACT (T)
40-42: CTG (L)
43-45: GAA (E)
46-48: GAA (E)
49-51: GTC (V)
52-54: CGC (R)
...

So the next ATG is at positions 34-36 (AAA ATG ACT...). So in the same reading frame, after the initial ATG, the next ATG is at position 34-36. Let's check the reading frame. The initial ATG is in frame 1. The next ATG is at position 34, which is 33 nucleotides after the start. 33 divided by 3 is 11 codons. So the 11th codon after the start is AAA (position 31-33), then ATG (position 34-36). So this ATG is in the same reading frame as the original start codon. If the ribosome were to initiate here, it would produce a protein starting with M (from position 34-36) instead of the HA-tagged version. This would result in a truncated protein missing the HA tag and the initial part of GADD45G. However, the presence of a Kozak sequence around the original start codon is important for efficient initiation. If the original ATG has a strong Kozak sequence (e.g., GCCGCCATG G), then the ribosome would preferentially initiate there. If the downstream ATG has a better Kozak sequence, initiation might occur there, leading to a shorter protein. Let's check the surrounding sequences.

Original start codon (positions 1-3): ATG. The nucleotides before (upstream) are not provided, but in the construct, the promoter and 5' UTR would influence the Kozak sequence. However, the user-provided sequence starts with ATG, so perhaps the Kozak sequence is not optimal. The next ATG at position 34-36 is preceded by AAA (position 31-33), which is part of the codon AAA (K) at position 31-33, and the ATG is followed by ACT (T). The Kozak consensus sequence is typically CCRCCAUGG, where R is a purine (A or G). The original ATG (position 1-3) is preceded by ... (unknown, since the sequence starts at ATG), but the next ATG (position 34-36) is preceded by AAA (A is a purine) and followed by ACT (A is a purine in the third position of the codon, but the next codon starts with A). Wait, the Kozak sequence is more about the nucleotides around the ATG. The critical positions are -3 (a purine) and +4 (a G). For the original ATG (positions 1-3), the +4 nucleotide is T (from TAC, position 4-6: T A C). The +4 position is the fourth nucleotide after the start of the ATG, which is position 4 (T). The Kozak sequence prefers a G at +4. So if the original ATG has a T at +4, that's suboptimal. The downstream ATG at position 34-36: the preceding three nucleotides are AAA (positions 31-33), so the -3 position is A (a purine, which is good). The +4 nucleotide would be position 37 (A in ACT). So the +4 is A, which is not ideal. However, the original ATG's +4 is T, and the downstream ATG's +4 is A. Neither is ideal, but the original might have a weaker Kozak sequence. If the original ATG lacks a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might leak and initiate at the downstream ATG, leading to a truncated protein. This could result in lower expression of the full-length HA-tagged protein and possibly a shorter form without the tag. The user observed low expression, which could be due to this.

Alternatively, the presence of the HA tag might interfere with the protein's stability or the gene's expression. But the immediate issue is the presence of an in-frame ATG downstream, which could lead to alternative initiation. Another possibility is that the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift. Let's check that. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence encoding this is TAT CCA TAT GAT GTT CCA GAT TAT GCT (for example). Let's compare with the given sequence:

The provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA...

Translating the first part:

ATG (M) TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCC (A) AAA (K)...

So the HA tag is Y P Y D V P D Y A K... The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, so the ninth amino acid should be A (alanine), which is encoded by GCC here. Then comes AAA (K). So the HA tag is correctly encoded here. The reading frame is correct. Therefore, the HA tag is in frame, and the start codon is present. However, the presence of the downstream ATG (at position 34-36) in the same reading frame could lead to initiation there, producing a protein starting with M (from position 34) followed by T L E E V R..., which would be a truncated version missing the HA tag and the first part of GADD45G. This would result in lower levels of the full-length HA-tagged protein because some ribosomes initiate at the downstream ATG. The full-length protein would have the HA tag, but if a significant portion of translation starts at the downstream ATG, the overall expression of the desired protein would be lower than expected. This could explain the inability to overexpress the protein as intended.

Another possibility is that the plasmid design lacks a proper promoter or other regulatory elements, but the user mentioned that they tested expression in CHO cells and observed low levels. If the promoter and other elements were missing, they might not get any expression. However, since they did get some colonies (antibiotic-resistant), the plasmid likely has a selection marker and a promoter. The problem is more likely in the coding sequence itself.

Another angle: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, which might interfere with the protein's function or stability. However, the user's main issue is expression level, not functionality. If the protein is unstable due to the tag, it might be degraded, leading to low levels. But the initial step is to check the construct design.

Alternatively, the presence of a stop codon in the sequence. Let's check the entire provided sequence for in-frame stop codons. The given sequence is the plus strand (5' to 3'). The coding sequence is from ATG to TGA (positions ...GAGTGA at the end). The last three nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct includes a stop codon at the end. Let's check if there are any premature stop codons in the HA tag or GADD45G sequence.

Translating the entire provided sequence (assuming the plus strand is the coding strand, so mRNA is same as plus strand, translation in frame 1):

Start with ATG (M), then Y P Y D V P D Y A K M T L E E V R G P G H S S G K H S Q D A G C R E S A A ... (continuing until TGA at the end). Let's check for stop codons in the middle. The sequence ends with TGA, so the main stop is at the end. Are there any in-frame stops before that? Let's check a few sections.

After the initial HA tag and the next ATG (positions 34-36: ATG), the translation would be M T L E E V R... (assuming initiation here). But if the main ORF starts at the first ATG, then the downstream ATG is part of the coding sequence. However, if the ribosome skips the first ATG and starts at the second, that's a problem. But the presence of internal ATGs in the same reading frame can lead to truncated proteins if initiation occurs there. However, the main issue here is the presence of an internal ATG in the same reading frame, leading to possible alternative initiation. The Kozak sequence around the first ATG might be weak, leading to some ribosomes initiating downstream. This would reduce the amount of full-length protein. To confirm, the user could perform a Western blot with an HA antibody. If there's a lower band (without HA) and a higher band (with HA), that would indicate leaky initiation. If only the lower band is present, the HA tag might not be properly expressed. But the user mentioned they can't overexpress the protein as expected, so maybe the majority of initiation is at the downstream site, leading to non-HA-tagged protein, which wouldn't be detected if they're using an HA antibody for purification. Wait, but the user's plan is to affinity-purify using the HA tag. If the protein is not tagged because of alternative initiation, then the affinity purification wouldn't work. However, the user's immediate problem is low expression. If the majority of the protein is initiated at the downstream ATG (without HA tag), then the HA-tagged protein would be a smaller fraction, leading to lower expression levels detected when using HA-based detection. Alternatively, if the HA tag is present but the protein is not expressed due to other reasons.

Another possibility: the HA tag was inserted in-frame, but the codon usage is suboptimal for CHO cells, leading to inefficient translation. However, CHO cells are typically robust for codon usage, and the HA tag is a common tag, so this is less likely.

Alternatively, the plasmid might have been constructed in reverse orientation. If the promoter is on the opposite strand, the gene wouldn't be transcribed. However, the user mentioned they did get some expression (albeit low), so the promoter is likely correctly oriented.

Another check: the presence of introns or splice sites. If the construct includes intronic sequences that are being spliced out, but the user is using a cDNA, so this is less likely.

Wait, the user provided the plus strand sequence. Let me check the sequence for possible issues. The HA tag is correctly inserted. The start codon is present. The stop codon is at the end. The problem is likely the internal ATG leading to alternative initiation. The solution would be to mutate that internal ATG (at position 34-36) to a different codon, such as CTG (leucine), which would preserve the amino acid if it's a leucine in the original protein, or another synonymous mutation, thereby eliminating the internal start codon. Alternatively, if that ATG is part of the native GADD45G sequence, mutating it might affect the protein's function. However, in the context of overexpression, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, optimizing the Kozak sequence around the original ATG to enhance initiation there, making it stronger than the downstream ATG. For example, changing the nucleotides around the initial ATG to match the Kozak consensus (e.g., adding a purine at -3 and a G at +4). In the current sequence, the initial ATG is followed by TAC (T at +4), which is not ideal. Changing the +4 position to G would improve the Kozak sequence. For example, if the codon after ATG is TAC (Y), changing the third nucleotide of that codon to G would make it TAG (stop) which is bad. Wait, the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y). The +4 nucleotide is the first T in TAC. To change +4 to G, the codon would become TGC (Cysteine) or TCC (Serine), etc. Alternatively, adjusting the nucleotides before the ATG to have a purine at -3. Since the provided sequence starts with ATG, we don't know the upstream context. If the promoter and 5' UTR are not properly designed with a Kozak sequence, the initiation might be inefficient, leading to ribosomes initiating at the downstream ATG. Therefore, the problem is likely a combination of a weak Kozak sequence at the intended start codon and a downstream in-frame ATG causing alternative initiation, resulting in truncated proteins and low expression of the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G.
