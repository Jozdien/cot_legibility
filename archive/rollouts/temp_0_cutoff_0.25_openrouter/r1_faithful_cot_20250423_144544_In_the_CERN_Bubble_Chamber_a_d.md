To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we start by considering the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Determine the velocity (\(v\))**:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.917^2}} \approx 0.992c
   \]

3. **Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame (\(\tau\))**:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.333 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Compute the average decay length (\(L_{\text{avg}}\))**:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = v \gamma \tau_0 = 0.992c \times 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}
   \]
   Converting to meters:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.8856 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 1.8856 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

5. **Determine the resolution (\(\Delta L\)) needed to observe 30% of the decays**:
   The fraction of decays observable is given by \( e^{-\Delta L / L_{\text{avg}}} \geq 0.3 \). Solving for \(\Delta L\):
   \[
   \Delta L = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3) \approx 1.8856 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^0 in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The problem gives me the proper lifetime of X^0 as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds, the energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 as 3.41 GeV. The decay is X^0 → Y⁺ Z⁻. 

First, I remember that the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame. But in the lab frame, due to relativistic effects, the lifetime will be longer because of time dilation. The lab frame here would be the Bubble Chamber's frame, where the particle is moving at a high energy. So, the actual lifetime observed in the lab frame is γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

To find γ, I need to relate the energy of the particle to its mass. The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where m is the rest mass. Here, the energy is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. Since we're dealing with units where c=1 (common in particle physics), the equation simplifies to E = γm. Therefore, γ = E/m. 

Calculating γ: γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. So, the Lorentz factor is approximately 7.917. 

Then, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.333×10^-15 seconds. 

But wait, the problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. Resolution here probably refers to the spatial resolution, meaning the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. The distance the particle travels before decaying is related to its speed and lifetime. 

The distance L is given by L = vγτ₀, where v is the velocity of the particle. But to find v, we can use the relation between γ and velocity. Since γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²), and again in natural units where c=1, v = √(1 - 1/γ²). 

Calculating v: v = √(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) ≈ √(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ √(1 - 0.01595) ≈ √(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c. So, the velocity is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. 

Therefore, the average distance traveled by the particle before decaying is L = vγτ₀. Plugging in the numbers: L ≈ 0.992c × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s. 

But c is approximately 3×10^8 m/s. So, L ≈ 0.992 × 3×10^8 m/s × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s. 

Calculating step by step: 

First, 0.992 × 3×10^8 ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s.

Then, 2.976×10^8 m/s × 7.917 ≈ 2.976×10^8 × 7.917 ≈ let's compute 2.976×7.917 ≈ 23.57, so 23.57×10^8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 8×10^-16 s: 23.57×10^8 m/s × 8×10^-16 s = 23.57 × 8 × 10^(8-16) m = 188.56 × 10^-8 m = 1.8856×10^-6 meters. 

So, the average decay length is approximately 1.8856 micrometers. 

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So, resolution here refers to the ability to measure the decay length. If the resolution is too poor, you might not see the decay because the displacement is too small compared to the resolution. 

But how does the resolution relate to the percentage of decays observed? I think it's about the probability that the decay occurs at a distance that can be resolved. The decay length follows an exponential distribution, right? The probability that the particle decays before a certain time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). But in terms of distance, since L = vt, then t = L/v, so the probability that the decay occurs within a length L is P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(vγτ₀)). 

But wait, the mean decay length is L_avg = vγτ₀. So, the probability that the decay length is less than some distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L_avg). 

But the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, does that mean that the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least a certain value where 30% of the decays have a longer path? Or is it the other way around? 

Wait, if the detector has a spatial resolution ΔL, then it can only detect decay lengths longer than ΔL. Because if the particle decays within a distance shorter than ΔL, the detector can't resolve the separation between the production vertex and the decay vertex. Therefore, the fraction of decays that are observable would be the fraction of decays where the decay length L > ΔL. 

So, the fraction f of observable decays is f = e^(-ΔL / L_avg). We need f ≥ 0.3, so e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -ΔL / L_avg ≥ ln(0.3). Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3). 

Calculating ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397. So, ΔL ≤ L_avg × 1.20397. 

Wait, but that would mean ΔL is less than or equal to 1.2 times the average decay length? That seems counterintuitive. If the resolution is worse (larger ΔL), then fewer decays would be observed. Wait, maybe I got the inequality reversed. 

Wait, the fraction of decays that are longer than ΔL is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). So, to have at least 30% of the decays observable, we need e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Therefore, solving for ΔL: 

-ΔL / L_avg ≥ ln(0.3)  
ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3)  
ΔL ≤ L_avg × 1.20397  

So, the maximum allowed ΔL (i.e., the minimum resolution) is L_avg × 1.20397. Wait, but resolution is the minimum distance that can be measured. If ΔL is the resolution, then to observe a decay, the decay length must be greater than ΔL. So, the fraction observable is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). So, to have this fraction ≥ 0.3, we set e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3, solve for ΔL. 

So, ΔL = -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ L_avg × 1.20397. 

But this would mean that the resolution must be better (smaller) than this ΔL. Because if the resolution is ΔL, then any decay with length longer than ΔL can be observed. So, the number of such decays is the integral from ΔL to infinity of the exponential distribution, which is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). 

Therefore, to have e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3, we need ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3). 

But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. So, the resolution must be such that ΔL is small enough to capture 30% of the decays. So, the minimum resolution required is the ΔL where e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Therefore, solving for ΔL gives the maximum allowed resolution (i.e., the coarsest resolution) that still allows 30% of the decays to be observed. 

Therefore, ΔL = -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m × 1.20397 ≈ 2.27×10^-6 meters, which is 2.27 micrometers. 

But wait, the average decay length is 1.8856 micrometers, and the required resolution is about 2.27 micrometers? That seems larger than the average decay length. But if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers, then the fraction of decays that occur beyond 2.27 micrometers is e^(-2.27 / 1.8856) ≈ e^(-1.203) ≈ 0.3, which matches. 

But if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers, then decays that happen within 2.27 micrometers can't be resolved. So, the fraction of decays that happen beyond 2.27 micrometers is 30%, which is what we need. Therefore, the resolution needs to be at least 2.27 micrometers to observe 30% of the decays. Wait, but resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers, then any decay that produces a track longer than 2.27 micrometers can be observed. The fraction of such decays is 30%. Therefore, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution must be 2.27 micrometers or better (i.e., smaller). 

But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. "Minimum resolution" might be a bit ambiguous. In experimental terms, the resolution is the smallest distance that can be distinguished. So, if you have a better resolution (smaller ΔL), you can see more decays. Therefore, to see at least 30%, you need the resolution to be at least good enough such that ΔL is such that 30% of decays are beyond ΔL. Therefore, the required resolution is ΔL = 2.27 micrometers. So, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But let me check the calculation again. 

First, compute γ: E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So, γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. 

Then, velocity v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c. 

Then, L_avg = vγτ₀c. Wait, hold on. Wait, τ₀ is given in seconds. So, when we compute L_avg, it's v multiplied by γτ₀. But τ₀ is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is γτ₀. Then, the average distance is v * γτ₀ * c? Wait, no. Wait, in natural units where c=1, L_avg = v * γτ₀. But in SI units, since τ₀ is in seconds, and v is in terms of c, we need to multiply by c to get the distance. 

Wait, maybe I confused units earlier. Let's clarify. 

In particle physics, often we use natural units where c=1, so distance is in units of time multiplied by c. But here, we have τ₀ in seconds, and we need to compute the distance in meters. 

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ₀. The distance traveled is velocity multiplied by time. Velocity v is in m/s, time is γτ₀ in seconds. So, L_avg = v * γτ₀. 

But v is 0.992c, so 0.992 * 3e8 m/s. 

Therefore, L_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. 

Compute this: 

First, 0.992 * 3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

Then, 2.976e8 m/s * 7.917 ≈ 2.976e8 * 7.917 ≈ 2.976 * 7.917 = approx 23.57, so 23.57e8 m/s.

Then, 23.57e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 23.57 * 8 * 1e-8 m = 188.56e-8 m = 1.8856e-6 meters, which is 1.8856 micrometers. So that's correct. 

Then, the fraction of decays observable is e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. 

So, solving for ΔL: ΔL = -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.8856e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers. 

Therefore, the spatial resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers to observe 30% of the decays. 

But wait, the problem says "minimum resolution". In experimental terms, a better resolution is a smaller number. So, if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers, you can see decays that are longer than 2.27 micrometers. If your resolution is worse (larger), say 3 micrometers, you can only see decays longer than 3 micrometers, which would be a smaller fraction. Therefore, to have at least 30% of the decays observable, you need the resolution to be 2.27 micrometers or better (i.e., smaller). Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. 

But the question is phrased as "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" So, the answer is 2.27 micrometers. But let me check if there's a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe they consider the full width at some confidence level, but I think the exponential distribution reasoning is correct. The number of particles remaining after time t is N(t) = N0 e^(-t/τ). The number decayed is N0 (1 - e^(-t/τ)). But in terms of distance, L = vt, so t = L/v. Therefore, the number decayed within distance L is 1 - e^(-L/(vτ)). But the lab frame lifetime is τ = γτ₀, so L/(vτ) = L/(vγτ₀). But the average decay length L_avg = vγτ₀. Therefore, the number decayed within distance L is 1 - e^(-L / L_avg). 

But the fraction of decays that occur beyond distance ΔL is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). Therefore, to have 30% of the decays observable (i.e., occurring beyond ΔL), we set e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3, leading to ΔL = -L_avg ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 L_avg. 

So, ΔL ≈ 1.2 * 1.8856 ≈ 2.26 micrometers. 

Therefore, the required resolution is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But let me check the calculation once more for errors. 

First, gamma: 27 / 3.41. Let's compute that more accurately. 

3.41 * 7 = 23.87  
3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41*7 + 3.41*0.9 = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939  
So, 3.41 * 7.9 ≈ 26.939, which is close to 27. So, 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Correct. 

Then, velocity: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). gamma is 7.917, so gamma² ≈ 62.68. 1/gamma² ≈ 0.01595. 1 - 0.01595 ≈ 0.98405. sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. Correct. 

Then, L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0 * c. Wait, hold on. Wait, in natural units, c=1, so L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0. But in SI units, since tau_0 is in seconds, and v is in m/s, then L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0. 

But v is 0.992c, so 0.992 * 3e8 m/s. 

gamma is 7.917. 

tau_0 is 8e-16 s. 

Therefore, L_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 * 7.917 * 8e-16. 

Compute step by step: 

0.992 * 3 = 2.976  
2.976e8 m/s * 7.917 ≈ 2.976 * 7.917 ≈ 23.57, so 23.57e8 m/s  
23.57e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 23.57 * 8 * 1e-8 m = 188.56e-8 m = 1.8856e-6 m. Correct. 

Then, ΔL = -ln(0.3) * L_avg ≈ 1.20397 * 1.8856e-6 m ≈ 2.27e-6 m. 

Yes, that's 2.27 micrometers. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But let me check if the units all make sense. 

Tau_0 is in seconds, velocity is in m/s, so multiplying them gives meters. Correct. 

Yes, so the calculation is consistent. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.3 micrometers. But to be precise, 2.27 micrometers. Depending on significant figures. The given values are: tau_0 = 8×10^-16 s (one significant figure), energy 27 GeV (two significant figures), mass 3.41 GeV (three significant figures). So, the least precise value is tau_0 with one significant figure. But in the calculation of gamma, we used 27 / 3.41, which is about 7.917 (so three significant figures). Then, the velocity calculation is based on gamma, so maybe three significant figures. Then, L_avg is 1.8856e-6 m, which is about 1.9e-6 m with two significant figures. Then, multiplying by 1.20397 gives 2.27e-6, which would be two significant figures, 2.3e-6 m, or 2.3 micrometers. 

But the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". So, perhaps the answer is expected in micrometers, and with two significant figures. 

Alternatively, maybe the exact calculation is needed. Let's do it more precisely. 

First, gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let's compute this more accurately. 

27 divided by 3.41: 

3.41 * 7 = 23.87  
27 - 23.87 = 3.13  
3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917  
So, gamma ≈ 7.917. 

But let's do it with more decimal places. 

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 * 7 + 3.41 * 0.9 = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939  
27 - 26.939 = 0.061  
0.061 / 3.41 ≈ 0.01788  
So, gamma ≈ 7.9 + 0.01788 ≈ 7.91788. 

So, gamma ≈ 7.9179. 

Then, v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). 

gamma^2 = (7.9179)^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*0.9179 + (0.9179)^2 ≈ 49 + 12.8506 + 0.8425 ≈ 62.6931. 

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈ 1 / 62.6931 ≈ 0.01595. 

Then, 1 - 0.01595 ≈ 0.98405. 

sqrt(0.98405). Let's compute sqrt(0.98405). 

We know that sqrt(0.98) ≈ 0.98995, sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.99196. 

Compute 0.98405: 

Let me use linear approximation. Let f(x) = sqrt(x). At x = 0.98, f(x) = 0.98995. The derivative f’(x) = 1/(2sqrt(x)). 

At x=0.98, f’(x) = 1/(2*0.98995) ≈ 0.5051. 

We need to find sqrt(0.98405). The difference from x=0.98 is 0.98405 - 0.98 = 0.00405. 

Approximate f(x + Δx) ≈ f(x) + f’(x) * Δx. 

So, sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.98995 + 0.5051 * 0.00405 ≈ 0.98995 + 0.002045 ≈ 0.9920. 

So, v ≈ 0.9920c. 

Then, L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0 * c. Wait, no. Wait, in SI units: 

L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0 * c. Wait, no. Wait, tau_0 is in seconds, gamma is unitless, v is in terms of c. 

Wait, let's clarify units again. 

The proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. 

In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau_0. 

The velocity is v = 0.992c. 

Therefore, the average distance traveled is L_avg = v * gamma * tau_0. 

But v is 0.992c, so substituting:

L_avg = 0.992c * gamma * tau_0. 

But c is 3e8 m/s. 

Therefore, L_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.9179 * 8e-16 s. 

Calculating step by step: 

0.992 * 3 = 2.976  
2.976e8 m/s * 7.9179 ≈ 2.976 * 7.9179 ≈ let's compute 2 * 7.9179 = 15.8358, 0.976*7.9179 ≈ 7.73. So total ≈ 15.8358 + 7.73 ≈ 23.5658. So, 23.5658e8 m/s. 

Then, multiply by 8e-16 s: 23.5658e8 * 8e-16 = 23.5658 * 8 * 1e-8 = 188.5264e-8 m = 1.885264e-6 m ≈ 1.8853 micrometers. 

Then, ΔL = -ln(0.3) * L_avg. 

ln(0.3) ≈ -1.203972804. 

So, ΔL ≈ 1.203972804 * 1.8853e-6 m ≈ 2.2705e-6 m ≈ 2.2705 micrometers. 

So, approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

Given the inputs, the most precise answer would be 2.27 micrometers. However, considering significant figures, since the lifetime is given as 8e-16 s (1 significant figure), but the energy is 27 GeV (2 significant figures) and mass is 3.41 GeV (3 significant figures). The lifetime is the least precise, but in the calculation of gamma, we used energy and mass, which have 2 and 3 sig figs. The result for gamma is 7.92 (3 sig figs). Then, velocity is 0.992 (3 sig figs). Then, L_avg is 1.89e-6 m (3 sig figs). Then, multiplying by 1.204 gives 2.27e-6 m (3 sig figs). 

But the problem says "minimum resolution", and in experimental physics, resolutions are often quoted with one or two significant figures. But given that the inputs have up to three, maybe we can keep two decimal places. 

Alternatively, the answer might expect the result in meters, but micrometers is more appropriate. 

So, converting 2.27e-6 meters is 2.27 micrometers. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.3 micrometers. 

But to check, maybe the approach is different. For example, using the relativistic momentum or something else. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe they want the length contraction formula? Wait, no. Length contraction is in the direction of motion, but here we are dealing with the decay length, which is related to the lifetime dilation. 

Alternatively, maybe using the formula L = βγcτ₀. 

Yes, that's another way to write it. Since L = v * γτ₀, and β = v/c, so L = βγcτ₀. 

Given that, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ 0.992, as before. 

So, L = βγcτ₀. 

Calculating that: 0.992 * 7.917 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s. 

Which is the same as before. 

So, same result. 

Therefore, the conclusion remains the same. 

Another check: the energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV, so gamma is E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 2.3 micrometers. 

But let me see if the problem mentions anything about the velocity or if there's a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe they want the answer in terms of the particle's momentum? But since we already calculated gamma using E = γm, and E is given, which is the total energy. 

Alternatively, if the energy given is the kinetic energy, but the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV", which is likely the total energy, as in particle physics, when they say energy, they usually mean total energy. 

Therefore, I think the calculation is correct. 

So, the minimum resolution needed is approximately 2.3 micrometers. 

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^0 in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The problem gives me the proper lifetime of X^0 as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds, the energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 as 3.41 GeV. The decay is X^0 → Y⁺ Z⁻. 

First, I remember that the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame. But in the lab frame, due to relativistic effects, the lifetime will be longer because of time dilation. The lab frame here would be the Bubble Chamber's frame, where the particle is moving at a high energy. So, the actual lifetime observed in the lab frame is γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

To find γ, I need to relate the energy of the particle to its mass. The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where m is the rest mass. Here, the energy is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. Since we're dealing with units where c=1 (common in particle physics), the equation simplifies to E = γm. Therefore, γ = E/m. 

Calculating γ: γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. So, the Lorentz factor is approximately 7.917. 

Then, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.333×10^-15 seconds. 

But wait, the problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. Resolution here probably refers to the spatial resolution, meaning the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. The distance the particle travels before decaying is related to its speed and lifetime. 

The distance L is given by L = vγτ₀, where v is the velocity of the particle. But to find v, we can use the relation between γ and velocity. Since γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²), and again in natural units where c=1, v = √(1 - 1/γ²). 

Calculating v: v = √(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) ≈ √(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ √(1 - 0.01595) ≈ √(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c. So, the velocity is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. 

Therefore, the average distance traveled by the particle before decaying is L = vγτ₀. Plugging in the numbers: L ≈ 0.992c × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s. 

But c is approximately 3×10^8 m/s. So, L ≈ 0.992 × 3×10^8 m/s × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s. 

Calculating step by step: 

First, 0.992 × 3×10^8 ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s.

Then, 2.976×10^8 m/s × 7.917 ≈ 2.976×10^8 × 7.917 ≈ let's compute 2.976×7.917 ≈ 23.57, so 23.57×10^8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 8×10^-16 s: 23.57×10^8 m/s × 8×10^-16 s = 23.57 × 8 × 10^(8-16) m = 188.56 × 10^-8 m = 1.8856×10^-6 meters. 

So, the average decay length is approximately 1.8856 micrometers. 

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So, resolution here refers to the ability to measure the decay length. If the resolution is too poor, you might not see the decay because the displacement is too small compared to the resolution. 

But how does the resolution relate to the percentage of decays observed? I think it's about the probability that the decay occurs at a distance that can be resolved. The decay length follows an exponential distribution, right? The probability that the particle decays before a certain time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). But in terms of distance, since L = vt, then t = L/v, so the probability that the decay occurs within a length L is P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(vγτ₀)). 

But wait, the mean decay length is L_avg = vγτ₀. So, the probability that the decay length is less than some distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L_avg). 

But the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, does that mean that the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least a certain value where 30% of the decays have a longer path? Or is it the other way around? 

Wait, if the detector has a spatial resolution ΔL, then it can only detect decay lengths longer than ΔL. Because if the particle decays within a distance shorter than ΔL, the detector can't resolve the separation between the production vertex and the decay vertex. Therefore, the fraction of decays that are observable would be the fraction of decays where the decay length L > ΔL. 

So, the fraction f of observable decays is f = e^(-ΔL / L_avg). We need f ≥ 0.3, so e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -ΔL / L_avg ≥ ln(0.3). Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3). 

Calculating ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397. So, ΔL ≤ L_avg × 1.20397. 

Wait, but that would mean ΔL is less than or equal to 1.2 times the average decay length? That seems counterintuitive. I

I need to determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle X^0 in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Given information includes the proper lifetime of X^0 as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds, the energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 as 3.41 GeV. The decay reaction is X^0 → Y⁺ Z⁻.

The proper lifetime τ₀ represents the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. However, in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber), the lifetime will be extended due to relativistic time dilation. The observed lifetime in the lab frame is γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

To calculate γ, I'll use the relationship between energy and mass. For a relativistic particle, E = γmc². Since we're using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to E = γm. Therefore, γ = E/m.

Computing γ: γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917

Thus, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.333×10^-15 seconds.

Regarding the minimum resolution, I believe this refers to spatial resolution - the ability to distinguish between the decay vertex and production vertex. The particle's travel distance before decay depends on its velocity and lifetime.

The distance L is given by L = vγτ₀, where v is the particle's velocity. To find v, I can use the relation between γ and velocity: γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). In natural units (c=1), v = √(1 - 1/γ²).

Calculating v: v = √(1 - 1/(7.917)²) ≈ √(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ √(1 - 0.01595) ≈ √(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c

Therefore, the average distance traveled before decay is L = vγτ₀.
L ≈ 0.992c × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s

With c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s, I calculate:
0.992 × 3×10^8 ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s
2.976×10^8 m/s × 7.917 ≈ 23.57×10^8 m/s
23.57×10^8 m/s × 8×10^-16 s = 1.8856×10^-6 meters

So the average decay length is approximately 1.8856 micrometers.

For the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of decays, I need to consider that if the detector has a spatial resolution ΔL, it can only detect decay lengths greater than ΔL. The fraction of observable decays would be f = e^(-ΔL/L_avg).

We need f ≥ 0.3, so e^(-ΔL/L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -ΔL/L_avg ≥ ln(0.3). Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3).

Calculating ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397, so ΔL ≤ L_avg × 1.20397.

I need to determine the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle X^0 in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The information provided includes the proper lifetime of X^0 as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds, energy in the chamber as 27 GeV, and mass of X^0 as 3.41 GeV. The decay process is X^0 → Y⁺ Z⁻.

The proper lifetime τ₀ represents the particle's lifetime in its rest frame, but in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame), the lifetime is longer due to time dilation, expressed as γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

To find γ, I use the relationship between the energy and mass of the particle. For a relativistic particle, energy E is given by E = γmc². Here, E = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, simplifying to E = γm in natural units where c=1. Therefore, γ = E/m.

Calculating γ gives γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. This makes the Lorentz factor approximately 7.917.

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is then τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.333×10^-15 seconds.

Next, I consider the minimum resolution needed for observing at least 30% of the decays, which likely refers to spatial resolution—the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. The distance the particle travels before decaying depends on its velocity and lifetime.

The distance L is expressed as L = vγτ₀, where v is the particle's velocity. Using the relation γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) and working in natural units (c=1), v = √(1 - 1/γ²).

Calculating v gives v = √(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ √0.98405 ≈ 0.992c. Thus, the velocity is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light.

Therefore, the average distance L = vγτ₀. Substituting values: L ≈ 0.992c × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s.

In standard units, with c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s: L ≈ 0.992 × 3×10^8 m/s × 7.917 × 8×10^-16 s.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. 0.992 × 3×10^8 m/s ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s.
2. 2.976×10^8 m/s × 7.917 ≈ 23.57×10^8 m/s.
3. 23.57×10^8 m/s × 8×10^-16 s = 188.56×10^-8 m = 1.8856×10^-6 meters.

Thus, the average decay length is approximately 1.8856 micrometers.

To ensure we observe at least 30% of decays, the spatial resolution must be such that decay lengths greater than the resolution are detectable. The decay length distribution is exponential, so the probability of decaying within a distance L is P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(vγτ₀)).

For the resolution ΔL, we set f = e^(-ΔL / L_avg) and require f ≥ 0.3, hence e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Taking natural logs yields -ΔL / L_avg ≥ ln(0.3). Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3).

Calculating ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397, so ΔL ≤ L_avg × 1.20397.

Maybe I got the fraction backwards. \n\nWait, if the detector can\'t resolve distances smaller than ΔL, then any decay that occurs at a distance less than ΔL would appear as if it didn\'t decay, right? So the number of observed decays would be the total decays minus those that decayed within ΔL. So the fraction observed is 1 - P(ΔL) = e^(-ΔL / L_avg). Therefore, to have e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3, then ΔL ≤ -L_avg ln(0.3). \n\nSo, solving for ΔL: ΔL ≤ -L_avg ln(0.3). \n\nBut since we need the minimum resolution, which would correspond to the maximum allowable ΔL such that at least 30% are observed. So, the minimum resolution required is the maximum ΔL where e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Therefore, ΔL = -L_avg ln(0.3). \n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: ΔL = - (1.8856×10^-6 m) × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m × 1.20397 ≈ 2.27×10^-6 meters, which is 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is worse (i.e., larger ΔL), then fewer decays would be observed. So, to observe at least 30%, the resolution must be better (smaller ΔL) than this value. Wait, but according to the formula, if ΔL is smaller, then e^(-ΔL / L_avg) is closer to 1, so the fraction observed is higher. Therefore, to have at least 30% observed, the resolution must be such that ΔL ≤ 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. But since resolution is usually the smallest detectable distance, meaning the precision, so the answer would be approximately 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut let me check the steps again. \n\n1. Calculate gamma: E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV, so gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Correct. \n\n2. Calculate velocity: v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c. Correct. \n\n3. Calculate lab frame lifetime: tau = gamma * tau0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.333e-15 s. Correct. \n\n4. Calculate average decay length: L_avg = v * gamma * tau0 = 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. \n\nWait, but actually, L_avg = v * tau (since tau is already gamma*tau0). So, L_avg = v * gamma * tau0. Which is the same as v * tau. So, yes, same result. \n\nCalculating L_avg: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.333e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3 * 6.333e-7 m ≈ 0.992 * 19.0e-7 m ≈ 18.84e-7 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers. Correct. \n\nThen, the fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL: ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m ≈ 2.27 micrometers. \n\nTherefore, the spatial resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers to observe 30% of the decays. But wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%". If the resolution is coarser (larger ΔL), then the observed fraction is less. So, to ensure that at least 30% are observed, the resolution must be finer (smaller ΔL) than 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut in experimental terms, the resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, if your resolution is 2.27 micrometers, you can\'t see anything smaller than that. Therefore, decays that occur within 2.27 micrometers would not be observed, and those beyond would be observed. The fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = e^(-2.27 / 1.884) ≈ e^(-1.204) ≈ 0.3, which is 30%. So, exactly 30% would be observed if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, to observe at least 30%, the resolution must be better than or equal to 2.27 micrometers. Hence, the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut let me check the calculation once more. \n\nGiven L_avg ≈ 1.884e-6 m. \n\nΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.203972 ≈ 1.884 * 1.203972 ≈ 2.268e-6 m. \n\nYes, that\'s correct. \n\nSo, converting to meters, it\'s 2.268e-6 meters, which is 2.268 micrometers. \n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in some other unit? Let\'s see. 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So, 2.27 micrometers is 2.27×10^-6 meters. Alternatively, in centimeters, it\'s 2.27×10^-4 cm. But micrometers is a standard unit for such resolutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in millimeters? 2.27 micrometers is 0.00227 mm. But micrometers is more precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the proper significant figures. The given values are τ₀ = 8×10^-16 s (one significant figure), energy 27 GeV (two significant figures), mass 3.41 GeV (three significant figures). So, the answer should probably be given to two significant figures, since the energy is given as 27 GeV (two sig figs). But gamma was calculated as 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917, which is about three sig figs. Then, the velocity is 0.992c (three sig figs). Then, L_avg is 1.88e-6 m (three sig figs). Then, ΔL is 2.27e-6 m (three sig figs). But since the lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 (one sig fig), that might limit the precision. Hmm. \n\nBut in experimental physics, often the precision is determined by the least precise measurement. However, here τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16, which is one significant figure, but the mass is 3.41 (three sig figs), energy 27 (two sig figs). So, maybe the answer should have two significant figures. So, 2.3 micrometers. \n\nBut the question says "minimum resolution needed", so perhaps we need to round up to ensure that at least 30% are observed. If we say 2.3 micrometers, but the exact calculation is 2.27, which is 2.3 when rounded to two significant figures. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is expected in meters with scientific notation. Let\'s see. 2.27e-6 meters is 2.27 micrometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in centimeters? 2.27e-6 m is 2.27e-4 cm, which is 0.000227 cm. But that\'s less intuitive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the proper unit prefixes. 2.27 micrometers is 2270 nanometers. But micrometers is standard for bubble chamber resolution. \n\nI think 2.3 micrometers is a reasonable answer with appropriate significant figures. But let me check once more. \n\nWait, the energy is 27 GeV (two sig figs), mass is 3.41 GeV (three sig figs), tau is 8e-16 (one sig fig). The lifetime is the one with the least precision. So, the lifetime is 8e-16 s, which is one sig fig. So, when we compute gamma = 27 / 3.41, which is approximately 7.917, but since 27 has two sig figs and 3.41 has three, the result should have two sig figs, so gamma ≈ 7.9. Then, velocity v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.41) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992, but with gamma as 7.9, 1/gamma² is 1/62.41 ≈ 0.016, so 1 - 0.016 = 0.984, sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992. So, velocity is 0.992c. \n\nThen, L_avg = v * gamma * tau0 * c. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, but when converting to actual units, we need to multiply by c. Wait, let\'s redo the calculation with units. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units earlier. Let me check. \n\nThe proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. \n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. \n\nThe velocity v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ c * 0.992. \n\nThe mean lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma * tau₀ ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.333e-15 s. \n\nThe mean decay length L_avg = v * tau ≈ 0.992c * 6.333e-15 s. \n\nBut c is 3e8 m/s, so:\n\nL_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.333e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3 * 6.333e-7 m ≈ 0.992 * 1.8999e-6 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m ≈ 1.884 micrometers. \n\nSo, that\'s correct. Then, the resolution needed is ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m ≈ 2.268 micrometers. \n\nGiven that τ₀ is 8e-16 s (1 sig fig), but the other quantities have more sig figs. However, since τ₀ is given with 1 sig fig, the final answer should probably be given with 1 sig fig, which would be 2e-6 meters or 2 micrometers. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, since the energy is 27 GeV (2 sig figs), mass is 3.41 (3 sig figs), so maybe 2.3 micrometers (2 sig figs). \n\nBut the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If we use 2.27 micrometers, which is approximately 2.3 micrometers, and if the actual calculation gives exactly 30% at 2.27, then the resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers. But since in practice, you can\'t have a resolution better than a certain value, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. However, the problem might expect the answer in meters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 30% refers to the proper length, but no, the decay probability is based on the exponential distribution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the time resolution instead of spatial resolution? But the question mentions "resolution" in the context of observing the decay, which in a bubble chamber is typically about spatial resolution to see the vertex separation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider the length contraction, but no, the decay length is already accounting for the Lorentz contraction. \n\nWait, no. The decay length in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper length would be in the rest frame, but the particle is moving, so the decay length is longer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation is incorrect. Let me check. \n\nE = gamma * m * c^2. But in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m. So, gamma = E / m. \n\nBut if the energy given is the total energy, which it is, then yes, gamma = E / m. So, 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. Correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the energy given is kinetic energy, then gamma would be (K + m)/m. But the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV", which is typically the total energy. So, I think the initial approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 2.3 micrometers. \n\nBut let me check if the calculation of the exponential is correct. \n\nThe probability to decay after a length L is P(L) = e^(-L / L_avg). So, to have 30% observed, we set e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL gives ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3). \n\nYes, that\'s correct. \n\nSo, ΔL = 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m. \n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. \n\nBut since the problem might expect the answer in meters, 2.3e-6 meters, or 2.3 micrometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer in centimeters? 2.3e-6 meters is 2.3e-4 cm. But micrometers is more standard for such small distances. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in millimeters: 0.0023 mm. \n\nBut I think micrometers is the appropriate unit here. \n\nSo, final answer: approximately 2.3 micrometers. \n\nBut let me check with exact values. \n\nGiven:\n\ntau0 = 8e-16 s\n\nE = 27 GeV\n\nm = 3.41 GeV\n\nCalculate gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9155\n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.9155)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/62.655) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.9920\n\nL_avg = v * gamma * tau0 * c\n\nCompute gamma * tau0 = 7.9155 * 8e-16 = 6.3324e-15 s\n\nMultiply by v * c: 0.9920 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3324e-15 s = 0.9920 * 3 * 6.3324e-7 m = 0.9920 * 1.8997e-6 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m\n\nThen, ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m\n\nSo, 2.268 micrometers. \n\nGiven that, and considering significant figures, since the energy is 27 GeV (2 sig figs), mass is 3.41 GeV (3 sig figs), tau0 is 8e-16 (1 sig fig). The lifetime is the least precise, but in the calculation of gamma, we have 27 / 3.41, which is 7.9155, but 27 has two sig figs, so gamma is 7.9 (two sig figs). Then, v is sqrt(1 - 1/(7.9)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.41) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992 (three sig figs). Then, L_avg = 0.992 * 7.9 * 8e-16 * 3e8.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we start by calculating the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) using the given energy and mass:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the particle using the Lorentz factor:

\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.917^2}} \approx 0.992c
\]

The mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is then:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.333 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

The average decay length \( L_{\text{avg}} \) is calculated using the velocity and the lab frame lifetime:

\[
L_{\text{avg}} = v \gamma \tau_0 = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 6.333 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

To find the minimum resolution \(\Delta L\) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we use the exponential decay probability:

\[
e^{-\Delta L / L_{\text{avg}}} \geq 0.3
\]

Solving for \(\Delta L\):

\[
\Delta L \leq -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3) \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.268 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the minimum resolution required is:

\[
\boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

thought the resolution needs to be smaller than the decay length. Maybe I got the fraction backwards. 

Wait, if the detector can't resolve distances smaller than ΔL, then any decay that occurs at a distance less than ΔL would appear as if it didn't decay, right? So the number of observed decays would be the total decays minus those that decayed within ΔL. So the fraction observed is 1 - P(ΔL) = e^(-ΔL / L_avg). Therefore, to have e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3, then ΔL ≤ -L_avg ln(0.3). 

So, solving for ΔL: ΔL ≤ -L_avg ln(0.3). 

But since we need the minimum resolution, which would correspond to the maximum allowable ΔL such that at least 30% are observed. So, the minimum resolution required is the maximum ΔL where e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Therefore, ΔL = -L_avg ln(0.3). 

So, plugging in the numbers: ΔL = - (1.8856×10^-6 m) × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m × 1.20397 ≈ 2.27×10^-6 meters, which is 2.27 micrometers. 

But wait, the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is worse (i.e., larger ΔL), then fewer decays would be observed. So, to observe at least 30%, the resolution must be better (smaller ΔL) than this value. Wait, but according to the formula, if ΔL is smaller, then e^(-ΔL / L_avg) is closer to 1, so the fraction observed is higher. Therefore, to have at least 30% observed, the resolution must be such that ΔL ≤ 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. But since resolution is usually the smallest detectable distance, meaning the precision, so the answer would be approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But let me check the steps again. 

1. Calculate gamma: E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV, so gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Correct. 

2. Calculate velocity: v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c. Correct. 

3. Calculate lab frame lifetime: tau = gamma * tau0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.333e-15 s. Correct. 

4. Calculate average decay length: L_avg = v * gamma * tau0 = 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. 

Wait, but actually, L_avg = v * tau (since tau is already gamma*tau0). So, L_avg = v * gamma * tau0. Which is the same as v * tau. So, yes, same result. 

Calculating L_avg: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.333e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3 * 6.333e-7 m ≈ 0.992 * 19.0e-7 m ≈ 18.84e-7 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers. Correct. 

Then, the fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL: ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m ≈ 2.27 micrometers. 

Therefore, the spatial resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers to observe 30% of the decays. But wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%". If the resolution is coarser (larger ΔL), then the observed fraction is less. So, to ensure that at least 30% are observed, the resolution must be finer (smaller ΔL) than 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. 

But in experimental terms, the resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, if your resolution is 2.27 micrometers, you can't see anything smaller than that. Therefore, decays that occur within 2.27 micrometers would not be observed, and those beyond would be observed. The fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = e^(-2.27 / 1.884) ≈ e^(-1.204) ≈ 0.3, which is 30%. So, exactly 30% would be observed if the resolution is 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, to observe at least 30%, the resolution must be better than or equal to 2.27 micrometers. Hence, the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. 

But let me check the calculation once more. 

Given L_avg ≈ 1.884e-6 m. 

ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.203972 ≈ 1.884 * 1.203972 ≈ 2.268e-6 m. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, converting to meters, it's 2.268e-6 meters, which is 2.268 micrometers. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But maybe the problem expects the answer in some other unit? Let's see. 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So, 2.27 micrometers is 2.27×10^-6 meters. Alternatively, in centimeters, it's 2.27×10^-4 cm. But micrometers is a standard unit for such resolutions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in millimeters? 2.27 micrometers is 0.00227 mm. But micrometers is more precise. 

Alternatively, maybe using the proper significant figures. The given values are τ₀ = 8×10^-16 s (one significant figure), energy 27 GeV (two significant figures), mass 3.41 GeV (three significant figures). So, the answer should probably be given to two significant figures, since the energy is given as 27 GeV (two sig figs). But gamma was calculated as 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917, which is about three sig figs. Then, the velocity is 0.992c (three sig figs). Then, L_avg is 1.88e-6 m (three sig figs). Then, ΔL is 2.27e-6 m (three sig figs). But since the lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 (one sig fig), that might limit the precision. Hmm. 

But in experimental physics, often the precision is determined by the least precise measurement. However, here τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16, which is one significant figure, but the mass is 3.41 (three sig figs), energy 27 (two sig figs). So, maybe the answer should have two significant figures. So, 2.3 micrometers. 

But the question says "minimum resolution needed", so perhaps we need to round up to ensure that at least 30% are observed. If we say 2.3 micrometers, but the exact calculation is 2.27, which is 2.3 when rounded to two significant figures. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected in meters with scientific notation. Let's see. 2.27e-6 meters is 2.27 micrometers. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in centimeters? 2.27e-6 m is 2.27e-4 cm, which is 0.000227 cm. But that's less intuitive. 

Alternatively, maybe using the proper unit prefixes. 2.27 micrometers is 2270 nanometers. But micrometers is standard for bubble chamber resolution. 

I think 2.3 micrometers is a reasonable answer with appropriate significant figures. But let me check once more. 

Wait, the energy is 27 GeV (two sig figs), mass is 3.41 GeV (three sig figs), tau is 8e-16 (one sig fig). The lifetime is the one with the least precision. So, the lifetime is 8e-16 s, which is one sig fig. So, when we compute gamma = 27 / 3.41, which is approximately 7.917, but since 27 has two sig figs and 3.41 has three, the result should have two sig figs, so gamma ≈ 7.9. Then, velocity v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.41) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992, but with gamma as 7.9, 1/gamma² is 1/62.41 ≈ 0.016, so 1 - 0.016 = 0.984, sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992. So, velocity is 0.992c. 

Then, L_avg = v * gamma * tau0 * c. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, but when converting to actual units, we need to multiply by c. Wait, let's redo the calculation with units. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the units earlier. Let me check. 

The proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. 

The Lorentz factor gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. 

The velocity v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ≈ c * 0.992. 

The mean lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma * tau₀ ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.333e-15 s. 

The mean decay length L_avg = v * tau ≈ 0.992c * 6.333e-15 s. 

But c is 3e8 m/s, so:

L_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.333e-15 s ≈ 0.992 * 3 * 6.333e-7 m ≈ 0.992 * 1.8999e-6 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m ≈ 1.884 micrometers. 

So, that's correct. Then, the resolution needed is ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m ≈ 2.268 micrometers. 

Given that τ₀ is 8e-16 s (1 sig fig), but the other quantities have more sig figs. However, since τ₀ is given with 1 sig fig, the final answer should probably be given with 1 sig fig, which would be 2e-6 meters or 2 micrometers. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, since the energy is 27 GeV (2 sig figs), mass is 3.41 (3 sig figs), so maybe 2.3 micrometers (2 sig figs). 

But the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If we use 2.27 micrometers, which is approximately 2.3 micrometers, and if the actual calculation gives exactly 30% at 2.27, then the resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers. But since in practice, you can't have a resolution better than a certain value, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. However, the problem might expect the answer in meters. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 30% refers to the proper length, but no, the decay probability is based on the exponential distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the time resolution instead of spatial resolution? But the question mentions "resolution" in the context of observing the decay, which in a bubble chamber is typically about spatial resolution to see the vertex separation. 

Alternatively, maybe they consider the length contraction, but no, the decay length is already accounting for the Lorentz contraction. 

Wait, no. The decay length in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper length would be in the rest frame, but the particle is moving, so the decay length is longer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation is incorrect. Let me check. 

E = gamma * m * c^2. But in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m. So, gamma = E / m. 

But if the energy given is the total energy, which it is, then yes, gamma = E / m. So, 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917. Correct. 

Alternatively, if the energy given is kinetic energy, then gamma would be (K + m)/m. But the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV", which is typically the total energy. So, I think the initial approach is correct. 

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 2.3 micrometers. 

But let me check if the calculation of the exponential is correct. 

The probability to decay after a length L is P(L) = e^(-L / L_avg). So, to have 30% observed, we set e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL gives ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3). 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, ΔL = 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m. 

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. 

But since the problem might expect the answer in meters, 2.3e-6 meters, or 2.3 micrometers. 

Alternatively, maybe they want the answer in centimeters? 2.3e-6 meters is 2.3e-4 cm. But micrometers is more standard for such small distances. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in millimeters: 0.0023 mm. 

But I think micrometers is the appropriate unit here. 

So, final answer: approximately 2.3 micrometers. 

But let me check with exact values. 

Given:

tau0 = 8e-16 s

E = 27 GeV

m = 3.41 GeV

Calculate gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9155

v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.9155)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/62.655) ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.9920

L_avg = v * gamma * tau0 * c

Compute gamma * tau0 = 7.9155 * 8e-16 = 6.3324e-15 s

Multiply by v * c: 0.9920 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3324e-15 s = 0.9920 * 3 * 6.3324e-7 m = 0.9920 * 1.8997e-6 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m

Then, ΔL = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.268e-6 m

So, 2.268 micrometers. 

Given that, and considering significant figures, since the energy is 27 GeV (2 sig figs), mass is 3.41 GeV (3 sig figs), tau0 is 8e-16 (1 sig fig). The lifetime is the least precise, but in the calculation of gamma, we have 27 / 3.41, which is 7.9155, but 27 has two sig figs, so gamma is 7.9 (two sig figs). Then, v is sqrt(1 - 1/(7.9)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.41) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992 (three sig figs). Then, L_avg = 0.992 * 7.9 * 8e-16 * 3e8. Let's compute with two sig figs for gamma:

gamma ≈ 7.9 (two sig figs)

v ≈ 0.99 (two sig figs)

L_avg ≈ 0.99 * 7.9 * 8e-16 * 3e8 = 0.99 * 7.9 * 24e-8 ≈ 0.99 * 7.9 * 2.4e-7 ≈ 0.99 * 1.896e-6 ≈ 1.877e-6 m ≈ 1.9e-6 m (two sig figs)

Then, ΔL = -1.9e-6 * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.9e-6 * 1.2 ≈ 2.3e-6 m (two sig figs). 

Therefore, with two significant figures, the answer is 2.3 micrometers. 

Hence, the minimum resolution needed is 2.3 micrometers. 

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}.

If the resolution is ΔL, then the probability that the decay length is greater than ΔL is e^(-ΔL/(L_avg)). So to have at least 30% of decays observed, we need e^(-ΔL/L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Therefore, solving for ΔL: ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 × L_avg.\n\nBut this would mean that the resolution needs to be better (smaller) than 1.2 times the average decay length? That doesn\'t make sense. Wait, perhaps I have the inequality reversed. If the detector can\'t resolve distances smaller than ΔL, then decays that occur within ΔL of the production point would not be observed. Therefore, the number of decays observed would be the fraction of particles that decay after traveling a distance greater than ΔL. The probability for a particle to decay after a distance L is e^(-L/(vγτ₀)). Therefore, the fraction observed is f = e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)). Wait, no, the decay probability as a function of time is (1/τ) e^(-t/τ) dt. The distance is L = vt, so t = L/v. Therefore, the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than ΔL is the integral from t = ΔL/v to infinity of (1/τ) e^(-t/τ) dt = e^(-ΔL/(vτ)).\n\nBut τ in the lab frame is γτ₀, so the fraction is e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)).\n\nWe need this fraction to be at least 0.3, so:\n\ne^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)) ≥ 0.3\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\n-ΔL/(vγτ₀) ≥ ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):\n\nΔL/(vγτ₀) ≤ 1.20397\n\nTherefore, ΔL ≤ 1.20397 × vγτ₀\n\nBut vγτ₀ is the average decay length L_avg = vγτ₀ ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m. Therefore, ΔL ≤ 1.20397 × 1.8856×10^-6 m ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m, or 2.27 micrometers.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the resolution needs to be better than 2.27 micrometers to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is ΔL, then you can only see decay lengths longer than ΔL. So to observe 30% of the decays, the required resolution is such that ΔL is less than or equal to the distance where the cumulative probability is 70% (since 30% decay after that distance). Wait, perhaps I need to use the exponential decay formula correctly.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays after a time t is P(t) = e^(-t/τ). The time corresponds to a distance L = vt. So the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than L is e^(-L/(vτ)). Therefore, to have 30% of the decays observed (i.e., decay lengths longer than ΔL), we set e^(-ΔL/(vτ)) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL:\n\nΔL = -vτ ln(0.3) = -v γ τ₀ ln(0.3)\n\nBut vτ = v γ τ₀, so ΔL = -v γ τ₀ ln(0.3)\n\nBut since v ≈ 0.992c, and γ τ₀ ≈ 6.333×10^-15 s, then:\n\nΔL = 0.992c * 6.333×10^-15 s * 1.20397\n\nCalculating:\n\n0.992 * 3×10^8 m/s ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s\n\n2.976×10^8 m/s * 6.333×10^-15 s ≈ 1.885×10^-6 m\n\nMultiply by 1.20397: 1.885×10^-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.\n\nTherefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. However, the problem states "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If the resolution is worse (larger) than this, then the fraction observed would be less than 30%. Therefore, the resolution must be at least as good as (i.e., less than or equal to) 2.27 micrometers. So the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me re-express:\n\nThe number of decays observed is the number of particles that decay after traveling a distance greater than the resolution ΔL. The probability for this is e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)). We need this probability to be at least 0.3. Therefore:\n\ne^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)) ≥ 0.3\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\n-ΔL/(vγτ₀) ≥ ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397\n\nMultiply both sides by -vγτ₀ (inequality reverses):\n\nΔL ≤ vγτ₀ * 1.20397\n\nSo ΔL ≤ 1.20397 * L_avg\n\nSince L_avg = vγτ₀ ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m, then:\n\nΔL ≤ 1.20397 * 1.8856×10^-6 m ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m\n\nTherefore, the resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers or better (smaller) to observe at least 30% of the decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is larger than this, the observed fraction would be less than 30%. Therefore, the resolution must be ≤ 2.27 micrometers. So the answer is approximately 2.3 micrometers. However, let me check the calculation again for accuracy.\n\nCalculating L_avg:\n\nv = 0.992c ≈ 0.992 * 3×10^8 m/s = 2.976×10^8 m/s\n\nγτ₀ = 7.917 * 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.3336×10^-15 s\n\nL_avg = v * γτ₀ = 2.976×10^8 m/s * 6.3336×10^-15 s ≈ (2.976 * 6.3336) × 10^-7 m ≈ 18.85 × 10^-7 m ≈ 1.885×10^-6 m = 1.885 micrometers\n\nThen ΔL ≤ -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.885 µm * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27 µm\n\nSo the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. Rounding to two significant figures, since τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16 (one significant figure?), but the energy and mass are given with three significant figures (27 GeV and 3.41 GeV). Hmm, 27 has two, 3.41 has three. The answer would then be 2.3 micrometers with two decimal places, but perhaps the answer is expected in meters with scientific notation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check if I used the correct formula for decay length.\n\nThe mean path length (average decay length) is indeed cτ (in lab frame), but since the particle is moving at velocity v, the average decay length is vγτ₀. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use L = βγcτ₀, where β = v/c. Since βγ = vγ/c. But since we have v ≈ 0.992c, β ≈ 0.992, so βγ ≈ 0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.85. Then L = βγcτ₀ = 7.85 * 3×10^8 m/s * 8×10^-16 s ≈ 7.85 * 2.4×10^-8 m ≈ 1.88×10^-7 m? Wait, that can\'t be. Wait, no:\n\nWait, βγcτ₀ = (v/c) * γ * c * τ₀ = v * γ * τ₀, which is the same as before. So L = v * γ * τ₀. So 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let\'s compute that again:\n\n0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s\n\n7.917 * 8e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s\n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s = (2.976 * 6.3336) * 10^-7 m ≈ 18.85 * 10^-7 m = 1.885e-6 m = 1.885 micrometers. So that\'s correct.\n\nThen, the required resolution is ΔL such that the fraction of decays with L > ΔL is 0.3. As per the exponential distribution, the cumulative distribution function for decay length L is P(L > x) = e^(-x/(vγτ₀)). So setting this equal to 0.3:\n\ne^(-x/(vγτ₀)) = 0.3 → x = -vγτ₀ * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.885e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.\n\nTherefore, the spatial resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers to resolve 30% of the decays. But wait, the term "resolution" here refers to the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. If the decay length is shorter than the resolution, you can\'t see it. Therefore, to observe a decay, the decay length must be longer than the resolution. The fraction of decays with L > ΔL is 0.3, so ΔL must be such that 30% of decays have L > ΔL. Therefore, solving for ΔL gives the required resolution. Hence, the resolution must be better (smaller) than 2.27 micrometers to observe at least 30% of the decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. Converting to meters, that\'s 2.27×10^-6 meters, or 2.27 µm.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a different approach. For example, using the proper lifetime and considering time dilation, then calculating the distance. But I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting an answer in terms of time resolution, but the question mentions "resolution" without specifying. However, in particle physics experiments, the spatial resolution of the detector (how well it can measure the position of the decay vertex) is crucial for observing decay lengths. So spatial resolution makes sense here.\n\nTherefore, the minimum spatial resolution required is approximately 2.3 micrometers. However, considering significant figures, the given data: τ₀ is 8×10^-16 s (1 significant figure), energy 27 GeV (2 significant figures), mass 3.41 GeV (3 significant figures). The answer should probably be given to two significant figures, so 2.3 micrometers. But maybe the expected answer is 2.3×10^-6 meters or 2.3 µm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in centimeters or another unit, but micrometers is reasonable for particle physics detectors. Bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers, so 2.3 micrometers seems very high resolution.

But bubble chambers typically have resolution around 100 micrometers or so. This suggests that maybe there\'s an error in the calculation. Let me check the gamma factor again.\n\nGiven E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. Then γ = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. That\'s correct.\n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.016) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992c. Correct.\n\nL_avg = v * γ * τ₀ = 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Calculating:\n\n0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.85\n\n7.85 * 8e-16 = 6.28e-15 s\n\nMultiply by c (3e8 m/s):\n\n6.28e-15 s * 3e8 m/s = 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers.

But no, because the proper lifetime is given, and we need to calculate the lab frame distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy given is the kinetic energy? Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". Usually, in high-energy physics, when they say "energy" of a particle, they mean total energy, not kinetic.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \), we consider relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is dilated in the lab frame. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated using the total energy \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
   \]  
   The lab-frame lifetime is:  
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Velocity of \( X^0 \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), the velocity \( v \) is:  
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx 0.992c.
   \]

3. **Average Decay Length**:  
   The average distance \( L_{\text{avg}} \) traveled before decay is:  
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = v \gamma \tau_0 = 0.992c \times 6.33 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 1.885 \, \mu\text{m}.
   \]

4. **Resolution for 30% Detection**:  
   The fraction of decays observed depends on the exponential survival probability:  
   \[
   P(L > \Delta L) = e^{-\Delta L / L_{\text{avg}}}.
   \]  
   Setting \( P(L > \Delta L) = 0.3 \):  
   \[
   \Delta L = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3) \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \times 1.204 \approx 2.27 \, \mu\text{m}.
   \]

**Conclusion**:  
The minimum spatial resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays is **2.3 micrometers** (or \( 2.3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)).  

\boxed{2.3 \, \mu\text{m}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, but this seems contradictory. If the resolution is ΔL, then the probability that the decay length is greater than ΔL is e^(-ΔL/(L_avg)). So to have at least 30% of decays observed, we need e^(-ΔL/L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Therefore, solving for ΔL: ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 × L_avg.

But this would mean that the resolution needs to be better (smaller) than 1.2 times the average decay length? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I have the inequality reversed. If the detector can't resolve distances smaller than ΔL, then decays that occur within ΔL of the production point would not be observed. Therefore, the number of decays observed would be the fraction of particles that decay after traveling a distance greater than ΔL. The probability for a particle to decay after a distance L is e^(-L/(vγτ₀)). Therefore, the fraction observed is f = e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)). Wait, no, the decay probability as a function of time is (1/τ) e^(-t/τ) dt. The distance is L = vt, so t = L/v. Therefore, the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than ΔL is the integral from t = ΔL/v to infinity of (1/τ) e^(-t/τ) dt = e^(-ΔL/(vτ)).

But τ in the lab frame is γτ₀, so the fraction is e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)).

We need this fraction to be at least 0.3, so:

e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)) ≥ 0.3

Take natural logarithm:

-ΔL/(vγτ₀) ≥ ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):

ΔL/(vγτ₀) ≤ 1.20397

Therefore, ΔL ≤ 1.20397 × vγτ₀

But vγτ₀ is the average decay length L_avg = vγτ₀ ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m. Therefore, ΔL ≤ 1.20397 × 1.8856×10^-6 m ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m, or 2.27 micrometers.

But this seems to suggest that the resolution needs to be better than 2.27 micrometers to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is ΔL, then you can only see decay lengths longer than ΔL. So to observe 30% of the decays, the required resolution is such that ΔL is less than or equal to the distance where the cumulative probability is 70% (since 30% decay after that distance). Wait, perhaps I need to use the exponential decay formula correctly.

The probability that a particle decays after a time t is P(t) = e^(-t/τ). The time corresponds to a distance L = vt. So the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than L is e^(-L/(vτ)). Therefore, to have 30% of the decays observed (i.e., decay lengths longer than ΔL), we set e^(-ΔL/(vτ)) = 0.3. Solving for ΔL:

ΔL = -vτ ln(0.3) = -v γ τ₀ ln(0.3)

But vτ = v γ τ₀, so ΔL = -v γ τ₀ ln(0.3)

But since v ≈ 0.992c, and γ τ₀ ≈ 6.333×10^-15 s, then:

ΔL = 0.992c * 6.333×10^-15 s * 1.20397

Calculating:

0.992 * 3×10^8 m/s ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s

2.976×10^8 m/s * 6.333×10^-15 s ≈ 1.885×10^-6 m

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.885×10^-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. However, the problem states "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If the resolution is worse (larger) than this, then the fraction observed would be less than 30%. Therefore, the resolution must be at least as good as (i.e., less than or equal to) 2.27 micrometers. So the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me re-express:

The number of decays observed is the number of particles that decay after traveling a distance greater than the resolution ΔL. The probability for this is e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)). We need this probability to be at least 0.3. Therefore:

e^(-ΔL/(vγτ₀)) ≥ 0.3

Take natural logarithm:

-ΔL/(vγτ₀) ≥ ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397

Multiply both sides by -vγτ₀ (inequality reverses):

ΔL ≤ vγτ₀ * 1.20397

So ΔL ≤ 1.20397 * L_avg

Since L_avg = vγτ₀ ≈ 1.8856×10^-6 m, then:

ΔL ≤ 1.20397 * 1.8856×10^-6 m ≈ 2.27×10^-6 m

Therefore, the resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers or better (smaller) to observe at least 30% of the decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed. If the resolution is larger than this, the observed fraction would be less than 30%. Therefore, the resolution must be ≤ 2.27 micrometers. So the answer is approximately 2.3 micrometers. However, let me check the calculation again for accuracy.

Calculating L_avg:

v = 0.992c ≈ 0.992 * 3×10^8 m/s = 2.976×10^8 m/s

γτ₀ = 7.917 * 8×10^-16 s ≈ 6.3336×10^-15 s

L_avg = v * γτ₀ = 2.976×10^8 m/s * 6.3336×10^-15 s ≈ (2.976 * 6.3336) × 10^-7 m ≈ 18.85 × 10^-7 m ≈ 1.885×10^-6 m = 1.885 micrometers

Then ΔL ≤ -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.885 µm * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27 µm

So the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. Rounding to two significant figures, since τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16 (one significant figure?), but the energy and mass are given with three significant figures (27 GeV and 3.41 GeV). Hmm, 27 has two, 3.41 has three. The answer would then be 2.3 micrometers with two decimal places, but perhaps the answer is expected in meters with scientific notation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check if I used the correct formula for decay length.

The mean path length (average decay length) is indeed cτ (in lab frame), but since the particle is moving at velocity v, the average decay length is vγτ₀. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people use L = βγcτ₀, where β = v/c. Since βγ = vγ/c. But since we have v ≈ 0.992c, β ≈ 0.992, so βγ ≈ 0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.85. Then L = βγcτ₀ = 7.85 * 3×10^8 m/s * 8×10^-16 s ≈ 7.85 * 2.4×10^-8 m ≈ 1.88×10^-7 m? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no:

Wait, βγcτ₀ = (v/c) * γ * c * τ₀ = v * γ * τ₀, which is the same as before. So L = v * γ * τ₀. So 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that again:

0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s

7.917 * 8e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s

Multiply them: 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s = (2.976 * 6.3336) * 10^-7 m ≈ 18.85 * 10^-7 m = 1.885e-6 m = 1.885 micrometers. So that's correct.

Then, the required resolution is ΔL such that the fraction of decays with L > ΔL is 0.3. As per the exponential distribution, the cumulative distribution function for decay length L is P(L > x) = e^(-x/(vγτ₀)). So setting this equal to 0.3:

e^(-x/(vγτ₀)) = 0.3 → x = -vγτ₀ * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.885e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

Therefore, the spatial resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers to resolve 30% of the decays. But wait, the term "resolution" here refers to the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. If the decay length is shorter than the resolution, you can't see it. Therefore, to observe a decay, the decay length must be longer than the resolution. The fraction of decays with L > ΔL is 0.3, so ΔL must be such that 30% of decays have L > ΔL. Therefore, solving for ΔL gives the required resolution. Hence, the resolution must be better (smaller) than 2.27 micrometers to observe at least 30% of the decays. Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is 2.27 micrometers. Converting to meters, that's 2.27×10^-6 meters, or 2.27 µm.

But let me check if there's a different approach. For example, using the proper lifetime and considering time dilation, then calculating the distance. But I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting an answer in terms of time resolution, but the question mentions "resolution" without specifying. However, in particle physics experiments, the spatial resolution of the detector (how well it can measure the position of the decay vertex) is crucial for observing decay lengths. So spatial resolution makes sense here.

Therefore, the minimum spatial resolution required is approximately 2.3 micrometers. However, considering significant figures, the given data: τ₀ is 8×10^-16 s (1 significant figure), energy 27 GeV (2 significant figures), mass 3.41 GeV (3 significant figures). The answer should probably be given to two significant figures, so 2.3 micrometers. But maybe the expected answer is 2.3×10^-6 meters or 2.3 µm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in centimeters or another unit, but micrometers is reasonable for particle physics detectors. Bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers, so 2.3 micrometers seems very high resolution. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1.885 micrometers is the average decay length. To observe 30% of the decays, the required resolution is about 2.27 micrometers. But bubble chambers typically have resolution around 100 micrometers or so. This suggests that maybe there's an error in the calculation. Let me check the gamma factor again.

Given E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. Then γ = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. That's correct.

v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.016) ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992c. Correct.

L_avg = v * γ * τ₀ = 0.992c * 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Calculating:

0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.85

7.85 * 8e-16 = 6.28e-15 s

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

6.28e-15 s * 3e8 m/s = 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers. Correct.

Then, for 30% survival:

ΔL = -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.884e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m. So 2.27 micrometers.

But bubble chambers have a spatial resolution typically on the order of 0.1 mm (100 micrometers), which is much larger. This suggests that either the problem is hypothetical, or there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the proper decay length without considering relativity? But no, because the proper lifetime is given, and we need to calculate the lab frame distance.

Alternatively, maybe the energy given is the kinetic energy? Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". Usually, in high-energy physics, when they say "energy" of a particle, they mean total energy, not kinetic. So E = γmc², so γ = E/(mc²). Since we're using natural units where c=1, E = γm, so γ = E/m. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the decay time is being confused with the lab frame lifetime. But no, the proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lab frame lifetime is γτ₀.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the uncertainty in the position measurement needed to observe the decay, which would relate to the decay length. But the calculation seems correct.

Given that, perhaps the answer is indeed approximately 2.3 micrometers. Even though bubble chambers might not achieve such resolution, the problem is theoretical. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is about 2.3 micrometers.

Therefore, the number of observed decays would be the fraction of decays that occur beyond ΔL, which is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To have at least 30% observed, e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.2 × L_avg. But this would mean that the resolution must be less than or equal to 1.2 × L_avg. However, since L_avg is about 1.88 micrometers, 1.2 × L_avg ≈ 2.26 micrometers. But if the resolution is 2.26 micrometers, then decays occurring beyond 2.26 micrometers can be resolved. The fraction of decays beyond 2.26 micrometers is e^(-2.26 / 1.88) ≈ e^(-1.2) ≈ 0.3, which matches. Therefore, the resolution must be at least 2.26 micrometers to observe 30% of the decays. Wait, but the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. If the resolution is ΔL, then decays longer than ΔL can be observed. So, the fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To have this fraction ≥ 0.3, we need e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3 → ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.2 × L_avg. Therefore, the resolution must be ≤ 1.2 × L_avg. But resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, to observe decays, the resolution must be smaller than the decay length. Wait, perhaps the confusion is in terminology. If the spatial resolution is ΔL, then two points closer than ΔL cannot be distinguished. Therefore, the decay vertex must be separated from the production vertex by at least ΔL to be observed. Therefore, the number of observable decays is the fraction of decays with decay length ≥ ΔL, which is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To have at least 30% observable, e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3 → ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.2 × L_avg. Therefore, the maximum allowed ΔL (resolution) is 1.2 × L_avg ≈ 2.26 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.26 micrometers. But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, if the resolution is 2.26 micrometers, then decays longer than that can be observed, which is 30% of the total. Therefore, the resolution must be at least 2.26 micrometers. However, resolution is usually the ability to distinguish, so a smaller resolution (better precision) allows observing more decays. Therefore, to observe at least 30%, the resolution must be better (smaller) than 2.26 micrometers. Wait, let\'s clarify:\n\nIf the spatial resolution is ΔL, then any decay occurring within ΔL of the production point cannot be resolved, so the observed decays are those that occur at a distance greater than ΔL. The fraction observed is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To have this fraction ≥ 0.3, we set e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3 → ΔL ≤ -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 * L_avg. Therefore, ΔL must be ≤ 1.20397 * L_avg. Since L_avg ≈ 1.8856 micrometers, then ΔL ≤ 1.20397 * 1.8856 ≈ 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the resolution must be at least 2.27 micrometers or better (smaller) to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, but if the resolution is smaller (better), then ΔL is smaller, so the fraction e^(-ΔL / L_avg) is larger. Therefore, to achieve at least 30%, the resolution must be such that ΔL ≤ 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the minimum resolution required is 2.27 micrometers. However, the term "minimum resolution" here might be confusing. In experimental terms, a better resolution (smaller ΔL) allows you to see more decay vertices. But the question is phrased as "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If "minimum resolution" refers to the coarsest resolution (largest ΔL) that still allows 30% to be observed, then the answer is 2.27 micrometers. Because if your resolution is worse (larger) than that, the fraction observed would be less than 30%. Therefore, the minimum resolution (i.e., the maximum allowable ΔL) is approximately 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the answer should be around 2.3 micrometers.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \), we calculate the average decay length of \( X^0 \) in the lab frame and use the exponential decay probability.

1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27\ \text{GeV}}{3.41\ \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Lab Frame Lifetime (\( \tau \)):**
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{s} \approx 6.333 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{s}
   \]

3. **Velocity (\( v \)):**
   \[
   v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx 0.992c
   \]

4. **Average Decay Length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)):**
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = v \gamma \tau_0 c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s} \times 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}\ \text{s} \approx 1.884\ \mu\text{m}
   \]

5. **Resolution for 30% Detection (\( \Delta L \)):**
   The fraction of decays observed is \( e^{-\Delta L / L_{\text{avg}}} \geq 0.3 \). Solving for \( \Delta L \):
   \[
   \Delta L \leq -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3) \approx 1.884\ \mu\text{m} \times 1.204 \approx 2.27\ \mu\text{m}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The minimum resolution required is \(\boxed{2.3\ \mu\text{m}}\).

However, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the approach is different. If the resolution is ΔL, then the probability that the decay length is greater than ΔL is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To observe at least 30% of decays, we need this probability to be ≥ 0.3. Therefore, e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Solving for ΔL: ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 × L_avg.

But this would mean the resolution needs to be better than 1.2 times the average decay length, which is counterintuitive. Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the probability of decay occurring beyond a certain length. If the detector can resolve decay lengths down to ΔL, then the fraction of decays that occur at lengths greater than ΔL is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need e^(-ΔL / L_avg) ≥ 0.3. Therefore, ΔL ≤ -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 × L_avg. But this would mean that the required resolution is ΔL ≤ 1.2 × L_avg. However, resolution is the minimum distance that can be measured. If the decay length is longer than the resolution, you can detect it. So, to capture 30% of the decays, which occur at lengths greater than some value, the resolution must be better (smaller) than that value. Let me re-express:

The fraction of decays that occur at a distance greater than ΔL is e^(-ΔL / L_avg). To observe 30% of the decays, we need e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3. Therefore, ΔL = -L_avg × ln(0.3) ≈ 1.20397 × L_avg.

Therefore, the minimum resolution (i.e., the maximum allowable ΔL) is approximately 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, the answer should be around 2.3 micrometers. Let me check the calculations again.

First, compute γ = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917.

Then, τ = γτ₀ = 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.333e-15 s.

Velocity v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992c.

Then, L_avg = v * γ * τ₀ * c. Wait, in natural units, c=1, but when converting to meters, we need to multiply by c. So, L_avg = v * γ * τ₀ * c.

Wait, actually, in natural units, L_avg = v * γ * τ₀. But τ₀ is in seconds, and to convert to meters, we need to multiply by c. So, L_avg = v * γ * τ₀ * c.

But let's compute it step by step:

In the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = γτ₀. The distance traveled is L = v * τ = v * γ * τ₀. But v is in terms of c, so L = v * γ * τ₀ * c.

Wait, perhaps better to compute:

v = 0.992c, so in m/s, v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Lifetime in lab frame τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.333e-15 s.

Therefore, L = v * τ ≈ 2.976e8 m/s * 6.333e-15 s ≈ 1.884e-6 meters ≈ 1.884 micrometers.

So, average decay length L_avg ≈ 1.884 micrometers.

Then, to find the resolution ΔL such that the fraction of decays with L > ΔL is 30%:

Fraction = e^(-ΔL / L_avg) = 0.3.

Solving for ΔL: ΔL = -L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ -1.884e-6 m * (-1.20397) ≈ 2.267e-6 m ≈ 2.267 micrometers.

Therefore, the required spatial resolution is approximately 2.27 micrometers. So, the minimum resolution needed is about 2.3 micrometers. Converting to meters, it's 2.27×10^-6 meters, but typically expressed in micrometers.

But let me check if the calculation of L_avg is correct. Another approach: L_avg = γ v τ₀ c. Wait, in natural units, c=1, so L_avg = γ v τ₀. But τ₀ is in seconds, so to convert to meters, multiply by c. So, L_avg = γ v τ₀ c.

But γ = 7.917, v ≈ 0.992, τ₀ = 8e-16 s, c = 3e8 m/s.

So, L_avg = 7.917 * 0.992 * 8e-16 s * 3e8 m/s.

Calculating:

7.917 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85.

8e-16 s * 3e8 m/s = 8e-16 * 3e8 = 24e-8 m = 2.4e-7 m.

Then, 7.85 * 2.4e-7 m ≈ 1.884e-6 m, which matches the previous result. So, L_avg ≈ 1.884 micrometers.

Therefore, ΔL ≈ 2.27 micrometers. So, the minimum resolution required is approximately 2.27 micrometers. Rounding to two significant figures, since τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16 (one significant figure?), but the energy and mass are given with three significant figures (27 GeV and 3.41 GeV). The answer should probably be given to two significant figures, so 2.3 micrometers.

But let me check the exact calculation:

ΔL = -L_avg * ln(0.3) = 1.884 µm * 1.203972 ≈ 1.884 * 1.203972 ≈ 2.267 µm ≈ 2.27 µm.

Yes, so 2.27 micrometers. Depending on the question's requirement for significant figures, since the given τ₀ is 8e-16 (one sig fig), but the energy and mass are 27 (two sig figs) and 3.41 (three sig figs).
