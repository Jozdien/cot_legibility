# Original Question

You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The least observed proteins in the active chromatin of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* during shmoo formation would likely belong to the **Sir (Silent Information Regulator) complex**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Shmoo Formation Context**: Shmooing occurs in response to mating pheromones, triggering G1 arrest and activation of mating-specific genes. Active chromatin in this context is enriched for transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and histone acetyltransferases (e.g., Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA).

2. **Sir Complex Role**: The Sir complex (Sir2/3/4) is responsible for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing at regions like telomeres, rDNA, and silent mating loci. During shmoo formation, mating genes are actively transcribed, and their chromatin is in an open, acetylated state. The Sir complex, which represses these regions in non-mating conditions, would not associate with active chromatin.

3. **Exclusion from Active Chromatin**: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targeting active regions would exclude repressive complexes like Sir. In contrast, complexes involved in transcriptional activation (e.g., Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA) would be enriched.

**Answer**: The Sir complex proteins would be least observed in the active chromatin proteome during shmoo formation.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out which protein complex is least likely to be found in the active chromatin of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when they form shmoos after being treated with a quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus. The question is asking which complex's proteins will be the least observed in the chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The options aren't listed here, but I need to think about the possible complexes involved in active chromatin and which ones are not present or less likely.

First, I should recall what shmoo formation means. Shmooing in yeast is a response to mating pheromones. When yeast cells detect mating pheromones (like alpha factor), they undergo morphological changes to form a shmoo, which is a projection towards the source of the pheromone. This process involves cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, polarization of the cytoskeleton, and changes in gene expression to prepare for mating.

Active chromatin regions are areas of the genome that are transcriptionally active. These regions are typically associated with certain histone modifications (like H3K4 methylation, acetylation) and specific protein complexes that modify chromatin structure to allow transcription. So, the proteome of active chromatin would include transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases (HATs), components of the mediator complex, and other transcriptional coactivators.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry would pull down proteins that are associated with the DNA in these active regions. So, the question is which complex is not involved in active transcription and thus would not be present.

Possible complexes involved in active chromatin:
1. **Mediator complex** - mediates interaction between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Definitely present.
2. **SWI/SNF complex** - chromatin remodeling, uses ATP to reposition nucleosomes, facilitating transcription. Present in active chromatin.
3. **SAGA complex** - a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in chromatin modification for transcription. Present.
4. **RNA polymerase II** - actively transcribing genes, so would be associated.
5. **Histone deacetylases (HDACs)** - these remove acetyl groups, leading to condensed chromatin. Usually associated with repression. So maybe not in active chromatin. But some HDACs might have specific roles. Wait, but HDACs are part of co-repressor complexes. If the chromatin is active, HDACs might be less present. However, some HDACs are involved in specific gene regulation, not just repression. Hmm.
6. **Polycomb repressive complex (PRC)** - involved in maintaining repressed chromatin states, like H3K27me3. In yeast, the Polycomb system isn't present. Wait, Polycomb is more prominent in higher eukaryotes. Yeast might not have Polycomb complexes. So maybe that's a candidate. But the question is about complexes that are present in yeast. If the complex isn't present in yeast at all, then its proteins wouldn't be there. But the question says "the least of proteins from which complex below will you observe". So the options might include complexes that are present in yeast but not active in this context.

Wait, the possible answer options aren't given here, but the user is expecting me to figure out which complex is least likely. Let me think again.

In the mating response, yeast cells activate specific genes. The pheromone response pathway involves Ste12 transcription factor, which activates genes required for mating. Active chromatin here would have Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, etc. The complexes that are involved in repression would not be there. Alternatively, maybe the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication might be less active because the cells are arrested in G1. But ORC is part of the pre-replicative complex. However, during G1, ORC is bound to origins of replication. But if the chromatin is active in transcription, maybe replication proteins are not in the same regions. But the question is about active chromatin, so maybe replication proteins are not part of that.

Alternatively, the Cohesin complex, which holds sister chromatids together, but that's more during S phase and mitosis. If cells are in G1, maybe cohesin isn't as prevalent. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: heterochromatin vs euchromatin. Active chromatin is euchromatin. Heterochromatin proteins like Sir proteins in yeast (Silent Information Regulators) are involved in silencing, like at telomeres, mating loci when not active. If the chromatin is active, Sir proteins would not be there. But Sir proteins form complexes. If one of the options is the Sir complex, then that would be the least observed.

Alternatively, the Rpd3 complex is an HDAC in yeast. Rpd3 is part of both large and small complexes; the large complex is involved in subtelomeric regions, and the small complex targets specific promoters. If active chromatin is acetylated, maybe Rpd3 is not present there. But some HDACs might still be involved in dynamic regulation.

Alternatively, the NuA4 HAT complex would be present because it acetylates histones, promoting active transcription. So their presence is expected.

If the question is about which complex is not involved in active chromatin, maybe the answer is the Rpd3 complex (HDAC) or the Sir complex. But since the yeast is forming shmoos, which is a mating response, the active chromatin would be at the genes induced by the pheromone. The Sir complex is involved in silencing, so they wouldn't be there. If the options include the Sir complex, that's the answer. Alternatively, the Polycomb complex, but yeast doesn't have Polycomb. So if the options include Polycomb, that's not present. But if the options are Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Cohesin, then Cohesin might be the least. But I need to think.

Wait, the question says "the least of proteins from which complex". So the complex whose proteins are least likely to be found. If the complex is involved in active chromatin, they would be present. The one that's involved in repression or in other processes not related to active transcription would be least observed.

In yeast, the Tup1-Cyc8 complex is a general transcriptional repressor. If the chromatin is active, Tup1 would not be there. So if the options include Tup1-Cyc8, that's a candidate. Alternatively, the Sir2/3/4 complex involved in silencing.

Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is part of DNA replication. Since the cells are in G1 phase (due to shmoo formation and mating arrest), ORC is bound to origins, but active transcription regions might not overlap with replication origins. However, origins are scattered throughout the genome, so maybe some are in active regions. Not sure.

Alternatively, the RNA polymerase I is in the nucleolus, transcribing rRNA, but the question is about active chromatin, which is likely RNA pol II. So RNA pol I complex would not be there. But the question is about the least observed. If the options include RNA pol I, that's possible. But the question is about the proteome of active chromatin, which is RNA pol II regions.

Alternatively, the Condensin complex, involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. But if cells are in G1, condensin might not be active. But again, not directly related to active transcription.

Another thought: the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome. Sometimes parts of the proteasome are involved in transcription elongation, but that's more of a stretch. Probably not.

Wait, the Mediator complex is definitely involved. SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeler. SAGA is a HAT. All these are part of active chromatin. The least likely would be a repressive complex. So if the options are Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and the RSC complex (which is another chromatin remodeler in yeast, similar to SWI/SNF), then maybe not. Wait, RSC is also involved in chromatin remodeling. Alternatively, the ISW2 complex, which is involved in positioning nucleosomes in a repressive way. If ISW2 is part of the options, that's a candidate.

But since the user hasn't given the options, I need to think of the most probable answer based on standard complexes. Since the question is from a test, the likely answer is the Sir complex (Sir2/3/4) which is involved in heterochromatin and gene silencing. Since the chromatin is active, Sir proteins would not be there. Alternatively, the Tup1-Cyc8 repressor complex. Another possibility is the Rpd3 HDAC complex, but Rpd3 might be involved in both repression and activation depending on context.

Alternatively, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication initiation. Since the cells are arrested in G1 (due to shmoo formation), replication isn't happening, but ORC is still bound to origins. However, active transcription regions might not overlap with replication origins. But I'm not sure if ORC would be considered part of active chromatin. Probably not, so ORC proteins would be least observed.

But I need to recall: in the mating response, yeast arrest in G1, so DNA replication isn't occurring. The active chromatin would be at genes induced by the pheromone response. The ORC is bound to replication origins throughout the cell cycle, but in G1, they are present but not active in replication. However, ORC might not be part of the active chromatin regions (transcriptionally active), so their proteins would not be enriched in the ChIP for active chromatin. So if ORC is an option, that's a candidate.

Alternatively, the answer could be the Cohesin complex, which is involved in sister chromatid cohesion. But again, in G1 phase, cohesion is established during S phase, so maybe not present. But I think Cohesin is loaded during S phase. So in G1, maybe less Cohesin.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The key is that the complex is part of active chromatin. Which of the standard complexes are not involved in active chromatin?

The Mediator complex is there. SWI/SNF is there. SAGA is there. RNA pol II is there. Histone acetyltransferases. The ones not there would be the ones involved in repression. So Sir complex (heterochromatin), Tup1-Cyc8 (repression), Rpd3 (HDAC), or maybe the Elongator complex (but Elongator is involved in transcription elongation, so might be present).

Alternatively, the NuRD complex, but I think that's more in metazoans. Yeast might have different complexes.

Wait, in yeast, the Rpd3 complex is the HDAC. The Rpd3 complex can be involved in both repression and activation, depending on the context. For example, the Rpd3 complex is recruited to some active promoters to fine-tune acetylation levels. So maybe Rpd3 is present even in active chromatin. The same with other HDACs. So perhaps the Sir complex is a better candidate because Sir proteins are specifically involved in silent regions like telomeres, rDNA, and the silent mating loci. When the yeast is forming shmoos, the mating loci are active, so the Sir proteins would not be there. Therefore, the Sir complex proteins would be the least observed.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the Cohesin complex. But I think the Sir complex is more likely. Since the formation of shmoo involves activation of mating genes, which are usually silenced in non-mating conditions by the Sir complex. So when they are active, Sir proteins are not present there. Therefore, in the active chromatin, Sir proteins would not be found. So if the options include the Sir complex, that's the answer.

But since the user hasn't provided the options, but the original question (from an exam or similar) likely had options like Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Sir complex. So the answer is Sir complex.

I need to determine which protein complex is least likely to be found in active chromatin of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast when they form shmoos after exposure to Lactobacillus acidophilus quorum-sensing peptide. The question asks which complex's proteins would be least detected in chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, though specific options aren't provided.

I should consider what shmoo formation entails. Shmooing is a yeast response to mating pheromones.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry would extract proteins associated with DNA in these active regions. The question essentially asks which complex isn't involved in active transcription and would therefore be absent.

I need to determine which protein complex is least likely to be found in the active chromatin of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when they form shmoos after exposure to a quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus. The task is to identify which complex's proteins will be minimally represented in chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Even without the list of options, I need to consider the possible complexes present in active chromatin and discern which are absent or less likely to be involved.

Firstly, understanding shmoo formation is useful. In yeast, shmooing is a response to mating pheromones. When yeast cells detect such pheromones (like the alpha factor), they morphologically change to form a shmoo, projecting towards the pheromone source. This involves cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, cytoskeletal polarization, and alterations in gene expression in preparation for mating.

Active chromatin regions are those parts of the genome undergoing transcriptional activity. Such regions are generally associated with specific histone modifications (e.g., H3K4 methylation, acetylation) and specific protein complexes that modify chromatin structure to enable transcription. Therefore, the proteome of active chromatin typically includes transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases (HATs), components of the mediator complex, and other transcriptional coactivators.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry identifies proteins associated with DNA in these active regions. Thus, the task is to determine which complex is not involved in active transcription and, consequently, would not appear.

Possible complexes involved in active chromatin include:
1. **Mediator complex** - facilitates interactions between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. It is definitely present.
2. **SWI/SNF complex** - a chromatin remodeling complex that uses ATP to reposition nucleosomes, facilitating transcription, therefore present in active chromatin.
3. **SAGA complex** - a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in chromatin modification supporting transcription, so it is present.
4. **RNA polymerase II** - involved in actively transcribing genes, so it would be associated.
5. **Histone deacetylases (HDACs)** - these remove acetyl groups, leading to condensed chromatin. They are usually associated with repression, suggesting they might not be present in active chromatin. However, some HDACs have specific roles beyond repression. Although they are part of co-repressor complexes, if the chromatin is active, HDACs might be less prevalent, but their involvement might be specific to certain genes.
6. **Polycomb repressive complex (PRC)** - involved in maintaining repressed chromatin states, like H3K27me3. Yeast lacks the Polycomb system, which is more prevalent in higher eukaryotes, making it a possible candidate. However, the question pertains to complexes not involved in transcription...

The active chromatin would be around those genes. The transcription factors for mating, like Ste12, would be active. The complexes involved in repressing other genes (like those involved in cell cycle progression) might be less present. But the question is about the active chromatin proteome.

If the chromatin is active, Sir proteins would not be there. But the question is which complex is least observed. If the active chromatin is at the mating genes, which are being expressed, then Sir proteins would not be there.

But the options aren\'t given here.\n\nWait, the user hasn\'t provided the options, but the original question (from the user\'s perspective) must have had options. Since the user is pasting a question, maybe the options are part of the original question but not included here. Wait, looking back, the user says "the least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?" but the options aren\'t here. Hmm. Maybe the user is expecting me to know standard complexes and which are not in active chromatin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is the condensin complex. But I need to think again.\n\nIn the process of shmoo formation, the cells are in G1 phase, so DNA replication hasn\'t occurred. The active chromatin would be regions where genes involved in mating are being transcribed. The mediator complex, SWI/SNF, SAGA, etc., would be present. Repressive complexes like Rpd3 or Sir would not be. But if the options include the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is involved in initiating DNA replication, then ORC proteins would be present at origins, but maybe not in the active chromatin regions. However, origins of replication are in open chromatin regions. But during G1, ORC is bound to origins. But if the ChIP is for active transcription regions, maybe ORC isn\'t there. Alternatively, the replication proteins are not part of the active transcription chromatin.\n\nAlternatively, the cohesin complex. Cohesin is loaded during S phase, but in G1, maybe not present. But cohesin can have roles in gene regulation as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the Lsm complex, which is involved in mRNA degradation, but that\'s cytoplasmic.\n\nWait, the question is about the proteome of the active chromatin. So proteins that are part of the chromatin structure in active regions. The least likely would be a complex involved in heterochromatin formation. In yeast, the Sir (Silent Information Regulator) proteins are responsible for silencing regions like the telomeres, HM loci. If the active chromatin is at the mating loci (which are usually silenced in haploid cells by Sir proteins), but when they are active, Sir proteins are not present. So if the ChIP is pulling down active chromatin, Sir proteins would not be there. So if one of the options is the Sir complex, that\'s the answer. But since the user hasn\'t provided options, but the original question (from an exam or something) must have had options. Since the user is asking here, maybe the answer is the Sir complex.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be the RSC complex, but RSC is a chromatin remodeler involved in creating open chromatin. So it should be present.\n\nAlternatively, the NuA4 HAT complex, which acetylates histones, so present in active chromatin.\n\nWait, the question is which complex is least likely. So the correct answer is likely a repressive complex. Since the chromatin is active, repressive complexes would not be there. In yeast, the main repressive complexes are the Rpd3 complex (HDAC), the Sir complex, and the Tup1-Cyc8 complex. So if the options include any of these, they would be the least observed. But without the options, I have to think of the most probable answer.\n\nAlternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication initiation. If the cells are in G1, ORC is bound to origins, but active chromatin regions (transcription) might not overlap with origins. However, origins are typically in open chromatin. But replication isn\'t occurring in G1, so ORC might be present but not active. But I\'m not sure if ORC would be pulled down in a ChIP for active chromatin.\n\nAlternatively, the kinetochore complex, which is involved in chromosome segregation. Since the cells are in G1, kinetochores are not assembled yet. Kinetochore formation occurs during S phase and mitosis. So kinetochore proteins would not be present in active chromatin in G1-arrested cells.\n\nBut again, without the options, it\'s challenging. However, considering standard exam questions, a common trick is to include a complex involved in repression. Since the question is about active chromatin, the least observed would be a repressive complex. In yeast, the Sir complex is a key player in silencing. Therefore, the answer is likely the Sir complex. But if the options given were, say, Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Sir, then Sir is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is the RNA polymerase II is present, but maybe RNA polymerase III? But active chromatin for mRNA is RNA pol II. RNA pol I is in the nucleolus. RNA pol III is for tRNA, etc. But the question is about active chromatin, which would include RNA pol II.\n\nAlternatively, the proteasome? No, that\'s not a chromatin complex.\n\nWait, the user mentioned "chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry." So they are looking for proteins associated with the chromatin. The least likely would be a complex that is not involved in active transcription. The Sir complex is involved in silencing, so it\'s not in active regions. Therefore, the answer is the Sir complex. But since the user hasn\'t provided options, but the original question must have had specific complexes. However, given the context, the most probable answer is the Sir complex. Alternatively, the condensin complex.\n\nBut I need to think again. The formation of shmoo is due to activation of the mating pathway. The genes induced include FUS1, FUS3, etc. The transcription factors like Ste12 would be active. The chromatin at these genes would be open, with H3K4me3, acetylation. The complexes present would be Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, RNA pol II, etc. The complexes absent would be those involved in repression. In yeast, the Tup1-Cyc8 complex is a general repressor. If the cells are activating genes, Tup1 would not be at those loci. Similarly, the Rpd3 HDAC complex. But which of these is a complex that would be least observed.\n\nAlternatively, the question might refer to the cohesin complex. Cohesin is involved in sister chromatid cohesion but also in chromatin looping for gene regulation. However, in G1 phase, cohesin is not loaded yet; loading occurs during S phase. So cohesin might not be present. But some studies suggest cohesin can be present in G1. Alternatively, the answer is condensin, which is involved in mitotic condensation, not active in G1.\n\nBut I think the more likely answer is the Sir complex, as it\'s directly involved in silencing, and active chromatin would exclude Sir proteins. Since the user\'s experiment is in yeast, and Sir is a yeast-specific silencing complex, that\'s a probable answer.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the least observed complex in active chromatin during shmoo formation would be the Sir complex.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446888, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2547, prompt_tokens=705, total_tokens=3252, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The least observed protein complex in the active chromatin of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* during shmoo formation would likely be the **Sir (Silent Information Regulator) complex**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Shmoo Formation Context**: Shmooing occurs in response to mating pheromones, leading to G1 arrest and activation of mating-specific genes. Active chromatin at these loci is marked by histone acetylation, H3K4 methylation, and transcriptionally active complexes like Mediator, SWI/SNF, and SAGA.

2. **Sir Complex Role**: The Sir complex is responsible for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing at regions like telomeres and the silent mating loci (HML/HMR). In active chromatin, these repressive complexes are excluded to allow transcription.

3. **ChIP-MS Analysis**: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targeting active chromatin would enrich for transcriptional activators (e.g., Mediator, RNA polymerase II) and exclude repressive complexes. Since the Sir complex is not involved in active transcription and instead maintains silenced regions, it would be absent or minimally detected.

**Answer**: The Sir complex proteins would be the least observed in the active chromatin proteome during shmoo formation.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

hat are present but least likely.
7. **Cohesin complex** - involved in sister chromatid cohesion, but also in chromatin looping and gene regulation. Might be present in some active regions.
8. **Condensin complex** - involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. If the cells are in G1 (shmoo formation is G1 arrest), condensin might not be active. But I'm not sure.
9. **RSC complex** - another chromatin remodeler in yeast, similar to SWI/SNF. Active in chromatin remodeling for transcription.
10. **FACT complex** - facilitates transcription through nucleosomes. Present during active transcription.

The question is which complex is least likely. If Polycomb isn't present in yeast, then that complex wouldn't be there. But the options might include something else. Alternatively, maybe the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which binds H3K9me3, but again, in yeast, the silencing is done via Sir proteins. So HP1 is more in other organisms.

Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication. If the cells are arrested in G1, replication isn't happening, so ORC might not be active. But ORC is present at origins even in G1. However, active chromatin regions might not overlap with replication origins necessarily.

Another angle: during shmoo formation, the cells are preparing to mate, so they might be upregulating mating-specific genes. The active chromatin would be around those genes. The transcription factors for mating, like Ste12, would be active. The complexes involved in repressing other genes (like those involved in cell cycle progression) might be less present. But the question is about the active chromatin proteome. So the least likely complex would be one involved in repression.

If the options include the Rpd3 complex (a yeast HDAC), which is part of the Sin3-Rpd3 complex involved in deacetylation and repression. If the chromatin is active, Rpd3 might not be there. Alternatively, the Tup1-Cyc8 complex, which is a repressor complex. If the chromatin is active, these repressors would not be present.

Alternatively, the NuRD complex (another HDAC-containing complex), but I think NuRD is more in metazoans. Yeast might have different complexes.

Wait, the question is about the least observed. So which of the typical active chromatin complexes is not present. Wait, maybe the answer is the condensin complex, because condensin is involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis, and the cells are arrested in G1, so condensin might not be active. But condensin might still have roles outside of mitosis. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) as I thought before.

Alternatively, the kinetochore complex, which is involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis. If the cells are in G1, kinetochore proteins might not be associated with chromatin. But kinetochores are assembled during S phase. So maybe not present in G1 arrested cells.

But the question is about active chromatin. So the proteins that are part of the active transcription machinery. The least likely would be a complex involved in repression or in processes not active during G1.

Alternatively, the telomerase complex, but yeast have telomerase, but it's active during S phase. If cells are in G1, maybe not. But telomeres are repetitive regions, which are heterochromatic. So maybe not part of active chromatin.

Alternatively, the Sir complex, which is involved in silent chromatin in yeast (like at telomeres and mating loci when silenced). If the chromatin is active, Sir proteins would not be there. But the question is which complex is least observed. If the active chromatin is at the mating genes, which are being expressed, then Sir proteins would not be there. But Sir proteins are involved in silencing, so their absence would mean they are not in active chromatin. So if the options include Sir complex, that would be the answer. But the options aren't given here.

Wait, the user hasn't provided the options, but the original question (from the user's perspective) must have had options. Since the user is pasting a question, maybe the options are part of the original question but not included here. Wait, looking back, the user says "the least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?" but the options aren't here. Hmm. Maybe the user is expecting me to know standard complexes and which are not in active chromatin.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the condensin complex. But I need to think again.

In the process of shmoo formation, the cells are in G1 phase, so DNA replication hasn't occurred. The active chromatin would be regions where genes involved in mating are being transcribed. The mediator complex, SWI/SNF, SAGA, etc., would be present. Repressive complexes like Rpd3 or Sir would not be. But if the options include the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is involved in initiating DNA replication, then ORC proteins would be present at origins, but maybe not in the active chromatin regions. However, origins of replication are in open chromatin regions. But during G1, ORC is bound to origins. But if the ChIP is for active transcription regions, maybe ORC isn't there. Alternatively, the replication proteins are not part of the active transcription chromatin.

Alternatively, the cohesin complex. Cohesin is loaded during S phase, but in G1, maybe not present. But cohesin can have roles in gene regulation as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Lsm complex, which is involved in mRNA degradation, but that's cytoplasmic.

Wait, the question is about the proteome of the active chromatin. So proteins that are part of the chromatin structure in active regions. The least likely would be a complex involved in heterochromatin formation. In yeast, the Sir (Silent Information Regulator) proteins are responsible for silencing regions like the telomeres, HM loci. If the active chromatin is at the mating loci (which are usually silenced in haploid cells by Sir proteins), but when they are active, Sir proteins are not present. So if the ChIP is pulling down active chromatin, Sir proteins would not be there. So if one of the options is the Sir complex, that's the answer. But since the user hasn't provided options, but the original question (from an exam or something) must have had options. Since the user is asking here, maybe the answer is the Sir complex.

Alternatively, the answer could be the RSC complex, but RSC is a chromatin remodeler involved in creating open chromatin. So it should be present.

Alternatively, the NuA4 HAT complex, which acetylates histones, so present in active chromatin.

Wait, the question is which complex is least likely. So the correct answer is likely a repressive complex. Since the chromatin is active, repressive complexes would not be there. In yeast, the main repressive complexes are the Rpd3 complex (HDAC), the Sir complex, and the Tup1-Cyc8 complex. So if the options include any of these, they would be the least observed. But without the options, I have to think of the most probable answer.

Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication initiation. If the cells are in G1, ORC is bound to origins, but active chromatin regions (transcription) might not overlap with origins. However, origins are typically in open chromatin. But replication isn't occurring in G1, so ORC might be present but not active. But I'm not sure if ORC would be pulled down in a ChIP for active chromatin.

Alternatively, the kinetochore complex, which is involved in chromosome segregation. Since the cells are in G1, kinetochores are not assembled yet. Kinetochore formation occurs during S phase and mitosis. So kinetochore proteins would not be present in active chromatin in G1-arrested cells.

But again, without the options, it's challenging. However, considering standard exam questions, a common trick is to include a complex involved in repression. Since the question is about active chromatin, the least observed would be a repressive complex. In yeast, the Sir complex is a key player in silencing. Therefore, the answer is likely the Sir complex. But if the options given were, say, Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Sir, then Sir is the answer.

Alternatively, another possibility is the RNA polymerase II is present, but maybe RNA polymerase III? But active chromatin for mRNA is RNA pol II. RNA pol I is in the nucleolus. RNA pol III is for tRNA, etc. But the question is about active chromatin, which would include RNA pol II.

Alternatively, the proteasome? No, that's not a chromatin complex.

Wait, the user mentioned "chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry." So they are looking for proteins associated with the chromatin. The least likely would be a complex that is not involved in active transcription. The Sir complex is involved in silencing, so it's not in active regions. Therefore, the answer is the Sir complex. But since the user hasn't provided options, but the original question must have had specific complexes. However, given the context, the most probable answer is the Sir complex. Alternatively, the condensin complex.

But I need to think again. The formation of shmoo is due to activation of the mating pathway. The genes induced include FUS1, FUS3, etc. The transcription factors like Ste12 would be active. The chromatin at these genes would be open, with H3K4me3, acetylation. The complexes present would be Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, RNA pol II, etc. The complexes absent would be those involved in repression. In yeast, the Tup1-Cyc8 complex is a general repressor. If the cells are activating genes, Tup1 would not be at those loci. Similarly, the Rpd3 HDAC complex. But which of these is a complex that would be least observed.

Alternatively, the question might refer to the cohesin complex. Cohesin is involved in sister chromatid cohesion but also in chromatin looping for gene regulation. However, in G1 phase, cohesin is not loaded yet; loading occurs during S phase. So cohesin might not be present. But some studies suggest cohesin can be present in G1. Alternatively, the answer is condensin, which is involved in mitotic condensation, not active in G1.

But I think the more likely answer is the Sir complex, as it's directly involved in silencing, and active chromatin would exclude Sir proteins. Since the user's experiment is in yeast, and Sir is a yeast-specific silencing complex, that's a probable answer.

So, putting it all together, the least observed complex in active chromatin during shmoo formation would be the Sir complex.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The least likely protein complex to be observed in the active chromatin of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* during shmoo formation is the **Polycomb repressive complex (PRC)**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Shmoo Formation Context**: Shmooing involves transcriptional activation of mating-related genes, which are associated with active chromatin marked by histone acetylation, chromatin remodeling, and transcription factor recruitment (e.g., Ste12, Mediator complex, SWI/SNF, SAGA).

2. **Active Chromatin Proteome**: Proteins expected in active chromatin include:
   - **Mediator complex** (facilitates transcription initiation).
   - **SWI/SNF** and **SAGA** (chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation).
   - **RNA polymerase II** (transcription machinery).
   - **Cohesin** (chromatin looping for transcriptional regulation).

3. **Repressive Complexes in Yeast**: 
   - Yeast lacks **Polycomb complexes** (PRC1/PRC2), which are critical for gene silencing via H3K27me3 in higher eukaryotes. 
   - Instead, yeast uses **Sir (Silent Information Regulator) complexes** for heterochromatin formation (e.g., at telomeres and mating loci). However, Sir proteins are absent in transcriptionally active regions.

4. **Why Polycomb is the Answer**: 
   - Polycomb complexes are evolutionarily absent in *S. cerevisiae*. Thus, they would not be detected in any chromatin state, including active regions. 
   - Other repressive complexes (e.g., Sir proteins) are yeast-specific but localize to silent chromatin, not active regions.

**Conclusion**: The **Polycomb repressive complex** is the least likely to be observed, as it is not present in yeast. If the question assumes standard eukaryotic complexes, Polycomb is the correct answer. If yeast-specific options were provided, the Sir complex might be considered, but Polycomb’s absence in yeast makes it the definitive choice.

Alternatively, the CoREST complex, but that\'s also not in yeast. Alternatively, the Lsm complex, but that\'s RNA processing. Alternatively, the RNA polymerase I or III, but the question is about active chromatin, which is transcribed by RNA pol II. So RNA pol I (rRNA) might be in nucleolus, which is a different region. But the question is about the proteome of active chromatin (presumably RNA pol II regions). So RNA pol I complex would be less present. But again, without options, it\'s hard. However, given the context, the most probable answer is the Polycomb repressive complex, as it\'s not present in yeast, so the least observed. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex. But I need to think again. The user\'s original question (even though the options aren\'t here) is likely structured with standard complexes. Since the formation of shmoo involves activation of mating genes, which are regulated by Ste proteins, transcription factors, etc. The active chromatin would have Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, etc. The least likely would be a complex involved in repression. Since yeast uses the Sir complex for silencing, and if the chromatin is active, Sir proteins would not be there. So the answer is the Sir complex. Alternatively, the Rpd3 complex. But Rpd3 has two complexes: Rpd3L (large) involved in repression of specific genes, and Rpd3S (small) involved in deacetylation in transcribed regions. So Rpd3S might be present in active genes. Therefore, Sir complex is more associated with heterochromatin. Therefore, the least observed would be Sir complex. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) which is involved in DNA replication, not transcription. But ORC is present in G1 phase. However, ORC is bound to origins of replication, which may not be in active transcription regions. But origins can be in euchromatic regions. Alternatively, the condensin complex. But again, without the options, it\'s challenging. However, given that the question is from a biology exam, the likely answer is the Polycomb repressive complex (PRC), as it\'s not present in yeast. Therefore, if the options include PRC, that\'s the answer. Since the user hasn\'t provided the options, but in the original context, the answer is likely the Polycomb repressive complex. But since yeast doesn\'t have Polycomb, the proteins from that complex won\'t be present. Alternatively, if the options include condensin or ORC, but those are present. So the answer is Polycomb.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447104, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1605, prompt_tokens=686, total_tokens=2291, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The least observed proteins in the active chromatin of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* during shmoo formation would likely belong to the **Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Shmoo Formation Context**: Shmooing in yeast is driven by mating pheromone signaling, leading to transcriptional activation of mating-related genes. Active chromatin in this process is enriched with transcription factors, chromatin remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF), histone acetyltransferases (e.g., SAGA), and the Mediator complex.

2. **Polycomb Complex Absence in Yeast**: The Polycomb system (PRC1/PRC2), which represses genes via H3K27me3 in higher eukaryotes, is absent in *S. cerevisiae*. Yeast relies on other silencing mechanisms (e.g., Sir proteins for heterochromatin), but these are not part of the Polycomb family.

3. **Repressive Complexes in Yeast**: While yeast has repressive complexes like Sir (heterochromatin) and Rpd3 (HDACs), these are distinct from Polycomb. The question asks for the **least observed** complex, and since Polycomb does not exist in yeast, its proteins would not be detected at all in the assay.

**Answer**: Proteins from the **Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)** will not be observed, as this complex is absent in *S. cerevisiae*.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Wait, but yeast doesn't have Polycomb complexes. So if the options include Polycomb, that would be the answer. Alternatively, other repressive complexes in yeast, like the Rpd3 or Sir complexes (which are HDACs involved in silencing), might be less present in active chromatin.
7. **Cohesin complex** - involved in sister chromatid cohesion, but also in chromatin looping and gene regulation. It can be present in active regions depending on context.
8. **Condensin complex** - involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. If the cells are in G1 phase (shmoo formation involves G1 arrest), condensin might be less active here. But condensin is more about chromosome structure during mitosis, so perhaps not in active transcription regions.
9. **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)** - involved in DNA replication initiation. If the cells are in G1, replication hasn't started yet, but ORC might still be present at origins. However, ORC is not directly part of active transcription.
10. **TOR complexes** - involved in signaling, perhaps not directly associated with chromatin.

But since the question is about the least likely complex, and given that yeast doesn't have Polycomb, if the options include Polycomb, that's the answer. Alternatively, if the options include a complex involved in heterochromatin (like Sir proteins), which are not active in transcriptionally active regions, that would be the case. For example, the Sir (Silent Information Regulator) complex in yeast is involved in silencing regions like telomeres, mating loci, and rDNA. Active chromatin would not have Sir proteins. Alternatively, the Rpd3 complex (HDAC) might be part of both repression and activation depending on context, but in active regions, HDACs may not be prominent.

Alternatively, the NuA4 HAT complex would be present in active chromatin. The 19S proteasome regulatory particle might be involved in transcription by aiding in the removal of transcription factors, but that's a stretch.

Wait, the question says "the least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?" So the answer is the complex whose proteins are least present. If the options include a repressive complex (like Sir complex, Rpd3, or Polycomb), but since yeast doesn't have Polycomb, perhaps the answer is the Polycomb repressive complex. Alternatively, if the options include condensin or ORC, which are not involved in active transcription. But without the options, it's challenging. However, given that the user hasn't provided the options, but the original question (from the user's perspective) must have had specific options. Since this is a practice question, perhaps the answer is the Polycomb repressive complex, as it's not present in yeast. Alternatively, the condensin complex, which is involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis, not in active chromatin during G1. But yeast cells in shmoo are in G1, so condensin might not be active. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC) is present in G1 but not directly part of active transcription. However, ORC proteins might be at origins, which are not necessarily active chromatin regions. Alternatively, the heterochromatin protein Sir complex. Since active chromatin is euchromatic, Sir proteins (involved in heterochromatin) would be absent. So the least observed would be Sir complex proteins. Alternatively, the answer could be the condensin complex. But given that the question is about active chromatin, the least likely would be a repressive complex. Since yeast doesn't have Polycomb, the answer is likely Polycomb repressive complex. But if the options don't include that, perhaps another. Alternatively, the CoREST complex, but that's also not in yeast. Alternatively, the Lsm complex, but that's RNA processing. Alternatively, the RNA polymerase I or III, but the question is about active chromatin, which is transcribed by RNA pol II. So RNA pol I (rRNA) might be in nucleolus, which is a different region. But the question is about the proteome of active chromatin (presumably RNA pol II regions). So RNA pol I complex would be less present. But again, without options, it's hard. However, given the context, the most probable answer is the Polycomb repressive complex, as it's not present in yeast, so the least observed. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex. But I need to think again. The user's original question (even though the options aren't here) is likely structured with standard complexes. Since the formation of shmoo involves activation of mating genes, which are regulated by Ste proteins, transcription factors, etc. The active chromatin would have Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, etc. The least likely would be a complex involved in repression.

But since yeast doesn't have Polycomb, the proteins from that complex won't be present. Alternatively, if the options include condensin or ORC, but those are present. So the answer is Polycomb.
