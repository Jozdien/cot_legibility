# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting their orbital periods. The given orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Thus, Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has a period \( P_4 = 3.5 \).

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( a^{-1/2} \). Substituting the relation for \( a \), we find \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

The temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is therefore:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting the periods \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:
\[
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 in this system. The planets have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They mentioned that they're in orbital resonance, which probably means their orbital periods are in some integer ratios, but here the given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Hmm, maybe those are simplified or maybe the resonances are more complex. But maybe that's not directly important for the equilibrium temperature. 

The key thing here is equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance from the star, right? Since they have circular orbits, the distance is related to the orbital period through Kepler's third law. But the problem states that the planets were discovered through the TTV method, which is the transit timing variation method. But I don't think that affects the equilibrium temperature calculation. 

Equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L is the luminosity of the star, and a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbits is just the radius). But since we don't know the luminosity of the star, maybe we can express the ratio in terms of the orbital periods. 

But how do we relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis? Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3). 

So if the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, then the semi-major axes are proportional to (1)^(2/3), (2)^(2/3), (2.5)^(2/3), (3.5)^(2/3), (5)^(2/3). 

Then, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be (T4 / T2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) (since T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4), and if L is constant, then T ∝ a^(-1/2)). 

Wait, let me check that again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L * (1 - albedo) ) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ]^(1/4). Since they have the same albedo, and assuming the same luminosity, then T is proportional to a^(-1/2). So yes, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). 

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then substituting that in, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3)) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3). 

Wait, let me verify that step. If a ∝ P^(2/3), then 1/sqrt(a) ∝ 1/sqrt(P^(2/3)) = P^(-1/3). So yes, T ∝ P^(-1/3). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). 

But let's check the given period ratios. The planets are designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5 with periods 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has period 2, Planet_4 has period 3.5. Therefore, the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. Then, T4/T2 = (1.75)^(-1/3). 

But the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

Wait, 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3). But maybe we can write that as a more simplified ratio. Let's compute the cube of 4/7. But perhaps they want it expressed as a ratio of integers under a cube root? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we can rationalize it. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me go through the steps again. 

Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3). 

Equilibrium temperature: T ∝ a^(-1/2). 

Therefore, substituting a: T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). 

Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

So the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. But 4 and 7 are both integers, so the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3), which can be written as ∛(4/7). 

But maybe they want it expressed as ∛4 : ∛7, but since it's a ratio, we can write it as ∛4 / ∛7, which is the same as ∛(4/7). 

Alternatively, if we rationalize the cube roots, but I don't think that's necessary. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check if the formula is correct. 

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the radius of the star, and T_eff is the effective temperature of the star. But if we don't know R or T_eff, but since we are taking a ratio between two planets around the same star, R and T_eff would cancel out. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, let's check. 

Wait, the equilibrium temperature can be given by:

T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since albedo is the same and L and σ are constants for the same star, T ∝ a^(-1/2). So T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). Wait, no, T is proportional to a^(-1/2), so T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). 

But earlier, I thought that T ∝ P^(-1/3), which would be equivalent because a ∝ P^(2/3), so substituting, T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). So T1/T2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

But if we use the other expression, T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3). Therefore, (a2/a1)^(1/2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So both methods agree. 

Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

Given that P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5, which is 7/2. So P2/P4 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7. Therefore, T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). 

So the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. 

But maybe they want it expressed as a numerical ratio? Let's compute the numerical value. 

Cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, cube root of 7 is approximately 1.913. So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83. So approximately 0.83:1, but the question says to provide the ratio, so likely in terms of cube roots. 

Alternatively, maybe they want it written as 4^{1/3} : 7^{1/3}, which is the same as ∛4 : ∛7. 

But the problem states "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2". So T4 : T2 = ∛(4/7) or ∛4 : ∛7. 

But in terms of exact ratios, since 4 and 7 are both integers, the ratio is ∛4 / ∛7, which can be left as is. 

Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator: ∛4 / ∛7 = ∛(4/7). 

So the answer is the cube root of (4/7), which can be written as \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

But let me check again if I messed up Planet numbers. The periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. So Planet_2 is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5. So yes, P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 7/4? Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4. Wait, no. Wait, 3.5 is 7/2. So P4 is 7/2, P2 is 2. So P4/P2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4. Therefore, T4/T2 = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other factor. Since all planets have the same albedo, and assuming they're orbiting the same star, so luminosity is the same. Also, the formula assumes that the planets are black bodies, and there's no greenhouse effect, etc., but the problem states equilibrium temperature, so that's the standard formula. 

Therefore, the answer should be the cube root of 4/7.

I need to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 in this system. The planets have orbital periods with the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. While they're described as being in orbital resonance, suggesting integer ratios, the given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, which might be simplified or involve more complex resonances. However, this may not directly impact the equilibrium temperature calculation.

Equilibrium temperature primarily depends on the distance from the star. For circular orbits, this distance relates to orbital period through Kepler's third law. Although the planets were discovered using transit timing variation (TTV) method, this doesn't affect our temperature calculations.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L represents the star's luminosity and a is the semi-major axis (equivalent to radius for circular orbits). Since we don't know the star's luminosity, we'll need to express the ratio using orbital periods.

To connect orbital period with semi-major axis, I'll use Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ a³, meaning a ∝ P^(2/3).

With orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the semi-major axes are proportional to (1)^(2/3), (2)^(2/3), (2.5)^(2/3), (3.5)^(2/3), (5)^(2/3).

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be (T4 / T2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T is proportional t

Alright, so I need to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 compared to Planet_2 within this system. The planets have orbital periods with a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. It's noted that they are in orbital resonance, which implies their periods might follow simple integer ratios, yet here they are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This could be a simplification, or the resonances might be more intricate, but that likely isn't crucial for figuring out the equilibrium temperature.

The crucial factor is equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance from the star. Since their orbits are circular, the distance is linked to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Interestingly, the planets were discovered using the TTV method, or transit timing variation method, but I doubt this aspect impacts the calculation of equilibrium temperatures.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L represents the star's luminosity, and a is the semi-major axis, which is equivalent to the radius in circular orbits. Since we don't have the star's luminosity, perhaps we can express the ratio based on orbital periods.

How do we connect the orbital period to the semi-major axis? According to Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So, P² ∝ a³, meaning a ∝ P^(2/3).

With periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the semi-major axes relate proportionally to (1)^(2/3), (2)^(2/3), (2.5)^(2/3), (3.5)^(2/3), (5)^(2/3).

Consequently, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be given by (T4 / T2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), as T is proportional to a^(-1/2).

To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Specifically, Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has a period \( P_4 = 3.5 \).

Using Kepler's third law, which states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), we find the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Therefore, the semi-major axis ratio \( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \) is \( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{2/3} \).

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( a^{-1/2} \). Thus, the temperature ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \) is given by \( \left( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \right)^{-1/2} \).

Substituting the semi-major axis ratio into the temperature ratio formula, we get:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{2/3} \right)^{-1/2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 = \frac{7}{2} \), the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

o 1/sqrt(a) (since T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4), and if L is constant, then T ∝ a^(-1/2)). 

Wait, let me check that again. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Where A is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since they have the same albedo, A is the same, and L and σ are constants for the same star. So T ∝ a^(-1/2). Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). 

But a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = P2^(2/3) and a4 = P4^(2/3). Therefore, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then, T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

So the temperature ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3). 

Given the period ratios: Planet_2 has period 2, Planet_4 has period 3.5. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. Therefore, the ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). 

Simplify 2/3.5: 3.5 is 7/2, so 2 / (7/2) = 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3). 

But the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Wait, so T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). But maybe they want it expressed as a ratio in terms of numbers. Let me compute 4/7 ≈ 0.571, and the cube root of that is approximately 0.83. But since they probably want an exact ratio, maybe expressed as (4/7)^(1/3) or written with exponents. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as 2^(2/3)/7^(1/3). But perhaps the problem expects a simplified fractional exponent? 

Wait, let me check the steps again to make sure. 

1. Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ => a ∝ P^(2/3). 

2. Equilibrium temperature: T ∝ a^(-1/2). 

Therefore, T ∝ P^(-1/3). 

Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). 

Yes, that's correct. So since P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5, which is 7/2, so P4 = 7/2. Therefore, P2 / P4 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7. 

Therefore, T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, if we want to rationalize the denominator or present it differently, but in terms of ratios, it's the cube root of 4/7. 

But maybe the answer expects to write it as (4)^{1/3}/(7)^{1/3} or something. But in the problem statement, they just ask for the ratio, so probably expressing it as the cube root of (4/7), which can be written as \sqrt[3]{4/7} or (4/7)^{1/3}. 

Alternatively, if they want it in terms of exponents with the same base, but 4 is 2² and 7 is prime, so it's 2²/7, so (2²/7)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3}/7^{1/3}. 

But I think either form is acceptable. The problem says "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures", so as long as we present the ratio in the correct order and simplified, that's fine. 

Wait, just to confirm, the ratio is T4 over T2, right? So T4 is the temperature of Planet_4, which is further out (since it has a longer period), so it should be cooler. Since 4/7 is less than 1, its cube root is also less than 1, so T4 is cooler than T2, which makes sense. 

Therefore, the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, if we rationalize the cube roots, but I don't think that's necessary. 

So the answer should be the cube root of (4/7), which can be written as \boxed{\left(\dfrac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between orbital period and equilibrium temperature. 

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**:  
   The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( a^{-1/2} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). 

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   For circular orbits, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). 

3. **Temperature Dependence on Period**:  
   Substituting \( a \propto P^{2/3} \) into the temperature formula gives \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). 

4. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   The ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Given the orbital periods \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \):  
   \[
   \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
   \]

**Answer**:  
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting their orbital periods given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Specifically, Planet_2 has a period of 2 units and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units.

Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (\(P^2 \propto a^3\)), we find that the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\).

The equilibrium temperature \(T\) of a planet is proportional to \(a^{-1/2}\), where \(a\) is the semi-major axis. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \(T_4\) and \(T_2\) is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Substituting the relationship \(a \propto P^{2/3}\), we get:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{2/3}
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{2/3} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting the given periods \(P_2 = 2\) and \(P_4 = 3.5\):

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Wait, let me check that again.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4), where A is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and L is luminosity. Since albedo is the same for both planets, that term cancels out. So, T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4). If we assume the star's luminosity is the same for both planets (same star), then T ∝ a^(-1/2). Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

But since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a2 = P2^(2/3) and a4 = P4^(2/3). Therefore, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then, T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So, the temperature ratio is the cube root of the inverse ratio of their periods.

Given that the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. So, Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units. Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).

Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. Therefore, the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). Which is the cube root of 4/7. Alternatively, 4^(1/3)/7^(1/3). To express this as a ratio, we can write it as ∛(4) : ∛(7), but perhaps rationalizing or approximating? However, the problem asks for the ratio, so likely acceptable to leave it in terms of cube roots.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me verify the steps again.

1. Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So, a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3). Correct.

2. Equilibrium temperature: T ∝ a^(-1/2). So, T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So, yes, the cube root of the period ratio. So, T4/T2 = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So, the ratio is ∛(4/7).

Alternatively, if they want it expressed as a ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, it's T4 : T2 = 1 : ∛(7/4). But the question says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2", so T4/T2. So, the answer is the cube root of (4/7). But perhaps they want it in fractional exponents? Or simplified in another way?

Alternatively, 4/7 is approximately 0.571, and the cube root of that is approximately 0.83, but since they want the exact ratio, we need to present it as ∛(4/7) or 4^{1/3}/7^{1/3}.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me check if I missed any factors.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4). So, if all planets have the same albedo and are around the same star, then T ∝ a^(-1/2). So, the ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). But a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So, (P2/P4)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So, same result. So, yes, the cube root of (P2/P4). So, since P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5, which is 7/2, so P2/P4 is 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So, cube root of 4/7. So, the ratio is ∛(4/7). So, that's the answer.

But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of exponents? Let me check the problem statement again. It says, "what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?" So, T4 over T2. So, the answer is (4/7)^(1/3). To write this as a ratio, it's ∛4 : ∛7. But in the box, we can write it as \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}} or \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{4}{7}}}.

Alternatively, if they want it in terms of exponents with prime factors, 4 is 2² and 7 is prime, so it can't be simplified further. So, the answer is the cube root of 4/7. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed.

Wait, the problem says "equilibrium temperatures", which assumes that the planets have the same albedo, which they do, as per the problem statement. So, albedo cancels out. Also, they are in the same system, so the luminosity L is the same for all. So, the only variable is the semi-major axis. Therefore, the ratio is as calculated. So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.
