To determine how the number of stars changes with distance \( r \) (per unit range of distance), given that the number varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), we use the relationship between parallax and distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)) and perform a variable transformation.

1. **Original Distribution**:  
   The number of stars per unit parallax is given by:  
   \[
   N(\text{plx}) \, d\text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \, d\text{plx}.
   \]

2. **Change of Variables**:  
   Substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), so \( d\text{plx} = -\frac{1}{r^2} \, dr \). The absolute value of the Jacobian determinant is \( \left|\frac{d\text{plx}}{dr}\right| = \frac{1}{r^2} \).

3. **Transformed Distribution**:  
   Substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into \( N(\text{plx}) \):  
   \[
   N(\text{plx}) \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
   \]  
   Multiply by the Jacobian to convert to distance:  
   \[
   N(r) \, dr \propto r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr = r^3 \, dr.
   \]

**Conclusion**:  
The number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^3 \). Thus, the number of stars in the region of the sky varies with distance as:  
\[
\boxed{N(r) \propto r^3}.
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if we have a star with parallax plx, its distance r is 1/plx, assuming plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs. That part I remember from the definition of parallax. 

So the given distribution is N(plx) d(plx) proportional to 1/plx^5 d(plx). But we need to find N(r) dr, the number of stars per unit distance. Since plx and r are related, I need to convert the distribution from parallax to distance. 

In statistics, when you change variables in a probability distribution, you have to account for the Jacobian determinant, which in one dimension is just the absolute value of the derivative of the old variable with respect to the new one. So if we have a function N(plx) d(plx), and we want to express it in terms of r, we need to substitute plx with 1/r and multiply by the derivative of plx with respect to r. 

Let me write that down. If plx = 1/r, then d(plx)/dr = -1/r². The absolute value is 1/r². So N(r) dr = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| dr. 

Given that N(plx) d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 d(plx), substituting plx = 1/r gives N(plx) = 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Then multiply by the Jacobian 1/r², so N(r) ∝ r^5 * 1/r² = r^3. 

Wait, so the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r cubed? That seems like it's increasing with distance, which might make sense if the volume element is growing as r², but here the original distribution is steeper. Let me check again. 

Original distribution: N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^{-5} d(plx}. 

Expressed in terms of r: plx = 1/r, so d(plx) = - (1/r²) dr. Taking absolute value, the relation is N(r) dr = N(plx) * (1/r²) dr. 

So substituting plx = 1/r into N(plx): 

N(plx) = (1/plx^5) = (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. 

Therefore, N(r) dr = r^5 * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr. 

So N(r) ∝ r^3. 

But wait, in a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit distance should go as r², since the volume element is 4πr² dr. So if the original distribution in parallax is steeper, 1/plx^5, which translates to r^5, but then multiplied by 1/r² gives r^3. 

But why is the original distribution given as 1/plx^5? That seems like a very steep decline. Maybe in this specific region, the density of stars isn't uniform? If the number per unit parallax is decreasing as plx^{-5}, then when converted to distance, it's increasing as r^3. 

But let me think again. If the density of stars were constant, then the number of stars at distance r would be proportional to the volume element, which is 4πr² dr. So N(r) dr ∝ r² dr. But here, the given distribution in terms of parallax is different. 

So the key is that the original distribution isn't uniform. The problem states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when we convert that to distance, we have to do the transformation. 

So the steps are:

1. Start with N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^{-5} d(plx).

2. Express plx in terms of r: plx = 1/r.

3. Compute d(plx)/dr = -1/r², so |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r².

4. Substitute into N(r) dr: N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| dr = (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) dr = (r^5) * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr.

Therefore, N(r) ∝ r^3. 

But let me check units to make sure. Parallax in arcseconds, distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/r. If N(plx) is per unit parallax, then when we change variables to distance, the units should match. 

Suppose N(plx) has units of stars per arcsecond (of parallax). Then N(r) has units of stars per parsec. The Jacobian 1/r² has units of (arcsecond)^-1 per parsec. Wait, maybe not. Let's see. 

Actually, plx is in arcseconds, r is in parsecs. So d(plx)/dr = -1/r² (parsecs^-2). But units of plx is arcseconds, r is parsecs. So 1/r is arcseconds (since plx [arcseconds] = 1 / r [parsecs]). Therefore, d(plx)/dr has units of arcseconds / parsec. Wait, no. 

Wait, plx is in arcseconds, r is in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So if r is in parsecs, plx is in arcseconds. Therefore, the derivative d(plx)/dr is d/dr (1/r) = -1/r², with units of arcseconds per parsec. 

Therefore, |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r² (arcseconds per parsec). 

But N(plx) is number per unit parallax (per arcsecond). So N(plx) d(plx) is number per arcsecond * arcsecond = number. 

When changing to r, N(r) dr should also be number. So N(r) dr = N(plx) |d(plx)/dr| dr. 

But substituting, N(plx) is (1/plx^5) per arcsecond. Then N(plx) |d(plx)/dr| dr = (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) dr. But plx = 1/r, so 1/plx^5 = r^5. Then 1/r² * r^5 = r^3. So N(r) dr = r^3 dr. 

Therefore, N(r) is proportional to r^3. 

But in a uniform distribution, N(r) is proportional to r². So this is different. The given distribution in parallax space is steeper, leading to a steeper increase in distance space. 

Wait, but if you have more stars at smaller parallaxes (which correspond to larger distances), then in terms of distance, you have more stars at larger distances. But the original function N(plx) is 1/plx^5, which would mean that as plx decreases (distance increases), the number increases as 1/plx^5. But when converted to distance, that becomes r^5, but multiplied by the Jacobian 1/r², giving r^3. So N(r) ∝ r^3. 

So the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r cubed. 

But let me think if there's another way to see this. Suppose the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N(plx) dplx = k / plx^5 dplx. Then, since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dplx = - plx² dr = - (1/r²) dr. 

Therefore, substituting into N(plx) dplx: 

N(plx) dplx = k / ( (1/r)^5 ) * ( - (1/r²) dr ) = k r^5 * (1/r²) dr = k r^3 dr. 

Ignoring the sign (since we take absolute value), we get N(r) dr = k r^3 dr. 

Yes, that's the same result. So the number density per unit distance is proportional to r^3. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r cubed, so N(r) ∝ r^3. 

But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose at plx = 0.1 arcseconds, r = 10 parsecs. The number of stars there is proportional to 1/(0.1)^5 = 10^5. At plx = 0.2 arcseconds, r = 5 parsecs, number is 1/(0.2)^5 = 3125. So closer stars (smaller r) have higher plx and lower N(plx). Wait, no: 0.1 arcseconds is 10 parsecs, and 0.2 is 5 parsecs. So smaller plx means larger distance. So N(plx) is higher for smaller plx (larger r). So the number of stars increases with distance. 

But when we convert to N(r), we have to account for the fact that a unit interval in plx corresponds to a larger interval in r at larger distances. Wait, no. Actually, the Jacobian accounts for how much "space" in plx corresponds to a unit space in r. Since dr = -1/plx² dplx, so a small dplx at small plx (large r) corresponds to a large dr. Therefore, the number per unit dr is N(plx) * |dplx/dr|. 

But in any case, the calculation seems consistent. So the final answer is N(r) ∝ r^3. 

But just to make sure, let's think about the relation between plx and r. If you have a uniform density of stars, then the number of stars at distance r is proportional to r². But here, the distribution in plx is steeper, so when transformed to r, it becomes steeper than r². Since 1/plx^5 corresponds to r^5, but multiplied by 1/r² gives r^3. So indeed, it's r^3. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as the cube of the distance.

Alright, I need to determine how the number of stars varies with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. I recall that parallax and distance have an inverse relationship. Specifically, for a star with parallax plx, its distance r equals 1/plx, where plx is measured in arcseconds and r in parsecs. This relationship comes directly from the definition of parallax.

The given distribution is N(plx) d(plx) proportional to 1/plx^5 d(plx). However, we want to find N(r) dr, which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Since parallax and distance are related, I need to convert the distribution from one variable to the other.

In statistical analysis, when changing variables in a probability distribution, we must account for the Jacobian determinant, which in one dimension is simply the absolute value of the derivative of the original variable with respect to the new one. So for a function N(plx) d(plx) that we want to express in terms of r, we substitute plx with 1/r and multiply by the absolute value of the derivative of plx with respect to r.

If plx = 1/r, then d(plx)/dr = -1/r². Taking the absolute value gives 1/r². Therefore, N(r) dr = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| dr.

Since N(plx) d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 d(plx), substituting plx = 1/r gives N(plx) = 1/((1/r)^5) = r^5. Then multiplying by the Jacobian 1/r², we get N(r) ∝ r^5 * 1/r² = r^3.

So it appears the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r cubed. This suggests an increase with distance, which might be reasonable considering volume elements grow as r², though the original distribution is steeper. Let me verify this result.

Going back to the original distribution: N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^(-5) d(plx).

Expressing in terms of r: plx = 1/r, so d(plx) = -(1/r²) dr. Taking the absolute value, we have N(r) dr = N(plx) * (1/r²) dr.

So substituting plx = 1/r...

I need to determine how the number of stars changes with distance, given that it varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Parallax and distance are indeed related, with parallax being inversely proportional to distance. For a star with parallax plx, its distance r would be 1/plx, assuming plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs, which is based on the definition of parallax.

The given distribution is N(plx) d(plx) proportional to 1/plx^5 d(plx). Our goal is to find N(r) dr, which is the number of stars per unit distance. Since plx and r are connected, I must convert the distribution from parallax to distance.

In statistics, changing variables in a probability distribution involves accounting for the Jacobian determinant, essentially the absolute value of the derivative of the old variable with respect to the new one in one dimension. With a function N(plx) d(plx) that we want to express in terms of r, we substitute plx with 1/r and multiply by the derivative of plx with respect to r.

Let's write it down. For plx = 1/r, then d(plx)/dr = -1/r², with the absolute value being 1/r². Thus, N(r) dr = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| dr.

So, the number of stars per unit distance appears to be proportional to r cubed. This suggests it increases with distance, which might be reasonable since the volume element increases with r², although the original distribution is steeper. Let me verify again.

Original distribution: N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^-5 d(plx).

Expressed in terms of r: plx = 1/r, and so d(plx) = - (1/r²) dr. Taking the absolute value, the relationship is N(r) dr = N(plx) * (1/r²) dr.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), we need to determine how the number of stars changes with distance \( r \).

1. **Relationship between Parallax and Distance**:
   - Parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(r\)), i.e., \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\) (in parsecs when parallax is in arcseconds).

2. **Change of Variables**:
   - The number of stars per unit parallax is given by \( N(\text{plx}) \, d\text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \, d\text{plx} \).
   - Convert this to a function of distance \( r \). Since \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\), we substitute \(\text{plx}\) with \(\frac{1}{r}\).

3. **Jacobian Determinant**:
   - The differential transformation requires the absolute value of the derivative of \(\text{plx}\) with respect to \( r \):
     \[
     \left| \frac{d\text{plx}}{dr} \right| = \left| -\frac{1}{r^2} \right| = \frac{1}{r^2}
     \]

4. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Substitute \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\) into the original distribution:
     \[
     N(\text{plx}) \, d\text{plx} \propto \left( \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{r} \right)^5} \right) \left( \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr \right) = r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr = r^3 \, dr
     \]

5. **Result**:
   - The number of stars per unit distance \( r \) is proportional to \( r^3 \).

Thus, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as \(\boxed{r^3}\) per unit range of distance.

N(plx): N(plx) = (1/r)^{-5} = r^5. 

Therefore, N(r) = r^5 * (1/r²) = r^3. 

So N(r) ∝ r^3. 

But wait, in a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit distance should go as r², since volume element is 4πr² dr. So if the original distribution in parallax is steeper, 1/plx^5, which translates to r^5, but then multiplied by 1/r², gives r^3. So the number per unit distance is increasing as r cubed. That seems counterintuitive because normally you would expect more stars at larger distances just due to volume, but here it's even more pronounced. 

But let's think about the original distribution. If N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^{-5} d(plx}, that means there are way more stars with small parallaxes (i.e., large distances) than with large parallaxes. So when we convert that to distance, since plx is 1/r, the number of stars per unit distance is increasing with r. 

But let me verify the math again. Let's do it step by step. 

Suppose we have a function f(plx) d(plx) = k / plx^5 d(plx), where k is a constant. 

We want to find the equivalent function in terms of distance r, where r = 1/plx (in parsecs when plx is in arcseconds). 

First, express plx in terms of r: plx = 1/r. 

Then, the differential d(plx) is d(1/r) = -1/r² dr. 

So, substituting into f(plx) d(plx):

f(plx) d(plx) = k / (1/r)^5 * (-1/r² dr) = k r^5 * (1/r²) dr = k r^3 dr. 

Since we take the absolute value of the derivative, the negative sign goes away. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance, N(r) dr, is proportional to r^3 dr. 

So the answer is that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r cubed. 

But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the relation between density and parallax distribution. 

If the number density of stars in space is n(r), then the number of stars in a shell at distance r is 4πr² n(r) dr. So N(r) dr = 4πr² n(r) dr. 

But in this problem, we are given N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^{-5} d(plx). So we need to relate n(r) to N(plx). 

Since plx = 1/r, and N(plx) d(plx) = N(r) dr, which we found to be proportional to r^3 dr. 

But if N(r) dr = 4πr² n(r) dr, then 4πr² n(r) dr ∝ r^3 dr. 

Therefore, n(r) ∝ r^3 / r² = r. 

So the number density n(r) is proportional to r. 

But the problem is asking for N(r) dr, which is the number per unit distance, which is 4πr² n(r) dr. If n(r) ∝ r, then N(r) dr ∝ r^3 dr. 

So that's consistent with the previous result. 

But does this make sense? If the density of stars is increasing with distance (n(r) ∝ r), then the number per unit distance would be 4πr² * r = 4πr³. So that's a steeper increase than the usual 4πr². 

But in the original parallax distribution, we have a very steep decline with plx, which translates to a steep increase with distance. So if the number of stars per unit parallax is dropping as plx^-5, which is a very rapid drop as plx increases (closer stars have larger parallax), but since plx is 1/r, the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as r^3. 

So even though the density of stars is increasing with distance (n(r) ∝ r), the number per unit distance is increasing even more because of the volume factor. 

But in reality, we usually assume that the density of stars is constant or decreasing with distance, so this must be a specific region where the density actually increases with distance, which is unusual. But the problem states "in a specific region of the sky", so maybe in that direction, the stellar density increases with distance, leading to such a distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a selection effect where more distant stars are brighter or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. 

But regardless, based on the given relation N(plx) ∝ plx^-5, the conversion to N(r) ∝ r^3 is correct. 

So the answer should be that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r cubed, so N(r) ∝ r^3. 

**Final Answer**
The number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as \boxed{r^3} per unit range of distance.

Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), we need to determine how the number of stars changes with distance \( r \).

1. **Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The parallax \( \text{plx} \) and distance \( r \) are inversely related: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \).

2. **Jacobian Transformation**: When converting the distribution from parallax to distance, we must account for the Jacobian determinant. The absolute value of the derivative of \( \text{plx} \) with respect to \( r \) is \( \left| \frac{d(\text{plx})}{dr} \right| = \frac{1}{r^2} \).

3. **Substitution and Transformation**:
   - Given \( N(\text{plx}) \, d(\text{plx}) \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \, d(\text{plx}) \).
   - Substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), so \( N(\text{plx}) \propto \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)^{-5} = r^5 \).
   - Multiply by the Jacobian \( \frac{1}{r^2} \): \( N(r) \, dr \propto r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr = r^3 \, dr \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of distance \( r \) is proportional to \( r^3 \).

\[
\boxed{r^3}
\]

N(plx) is proportional to (1/r)^(-5) = r^5. Therefore, N(r) dr ∝ r^5 * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (per unit range of distance) is proportional to r^3. That seems correct. But wait, in a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r², since the volume element in spherical shells is 4πr² dr. So if the distribution is steeper, like r^3, that would imply that the density of stars is increasing with distance. But that seems counterintuitive. If the number of stars per unit parallax is decreasing as plx^-5, which is a very steep decrease, but when converted to distance, it's increasing as r^3. Hmm.

So if we have more stars at smaller parallaxes (larger distances), but the question is how does the number of stars per unit distance change. Let's take an example. Suppose we have a small parallax interval, say from plx to plx + d(plx). The corresponding distance interval is from r = 1/plx to r = 1/(plx + d(plx)) ≈ r - dr, where dr ≈ d(plx)/plx². So the number of stars in that distance interval is N(plx) d(plx) = (1/plx^5) d(plx) = (r^5) * (dr * r²) = r^3 dr. Therefore, N(r) dr = r^3 dr. So yes, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^3. 

But in a uniform distribution, the number per unit distance would be proportional to r². So this distribution is more concentrated towards larger distances. But how is that possible?

So in distance terms, at 10 pc, the number is 10^5 per unit parallax, but the unit parallax corresponds to a distance interval. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the density.

Alternatively, perhaps the original distribution is given as the number per unit parallax, so N(plx) d(plx) is the number of stars between plx and plx + d(plx). To convert this to the number per unit distance, we need to relate d(plx) to dr. Since plx = 1/r, then d(plx)/dr = -1/r², so d(plx) = -dr / r². Therefore, the number of stars between r and r + dr is N(plx) |d(plx)/dr| dr. Since N(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/r gives N(plx) = r^5. Then, |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r². Therefore, N(r) dr = r^5 * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr. So N(r) is proportional to r^3. 

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases with the cube of the distance. That seems to be the result. But in reality, if the density of stars were constant, we would expect N(r) ∝ r², since the volume element is 4πr² dr. So this distribution is steeper, implying that the density of stars is increasing with distance. That could be possible if, for example, we are looking through a galaxy where the stellar density increases with distance in that direction. But regardless of the physical interpretation, the mathematical result here is that N(r) ∝ r^3. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the number of stars per unit distance increases proportionally to r cubed, so N(r) ∝ r^3.

**Final Answer**
The number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as \boxed{r^3} per unit range of distance.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The number of stars per unit distance, \( N(r) \), in the specified region of the sky is proportional to \( r^3 \). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relationship:** The number of stars varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N(\text{plx}) \, d\text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \, d\text{plx} \).

2. **Parallax-Distance Relation:** Parallax and distance (\( r \)) are inversely related: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) (in parsecs for \( \text{plx} \) in arcseconds).

3. **Change of Variables:** To express the distribution in terms of \( r \), substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) and compute the Jacobian (derivative) for the transformation:
   \[
   \left| \frac{d\text{plx}}{dr} \right| = \frac{1}{r^2}.
   \]

4. **Convert Distribution:**
   \[
   N(r) \, dr = N(\text{plx}) \cdot \left| \frac{d\text{plx}}{dr} \right| \, dr = \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \):
   \[
   N(r) \, dr \propto r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \, dr = r^3 \, dr.
   \]

5. **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit distance scales as \( r^3 \).

**Answer:** The number of stars per unit distance increases proportionally to \( r^3 \), so \( N(r) \propto r^3 \).

Substituting N(plx) = (1/plx^5) = r^5, so N(r) dr = r^5 * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr. Therefore, N(r) ∝ r^3.

But wait, in astronomy, the number of stars per unit distance usually involves the volume element, which is 4πr² dr. If the density of stars is constant, then N(r) dr would be proportional to r². But here, the given distribution in parallax space is steeper. So, converting that to distance space gives a different dependence.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

If N(plx) d(plx) ∝ plx^-5 d(plx), then substituting plx = 1/r, so d(plx) = - (1/r²) dr. Therefore, N(r) dr = N(plx) * (1/r²) dr. Since N(plx) is proportional to (1/plx)^5 = r^5, then N(r) dr ∝ r^5 * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr. So N(r) ∝ r^3.

But if the original distribution in parallax is N(plx) ∝ plx^-5, then in terms of distance, it's N(r) ∝ r^3, which is a steeper increase than the volume element. So, this would imply that the number density of stars increases with distance, which is counterintuitive if the actual spatial distribution is uniform. But perhaps in this specific region, the density isn't uniform. The problem states that in a specific region, the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so when converted to distance, it's r^3. Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit distance increases with r^3.

But let me think again. Suppose the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx) is proportional to plx^-5 d(plx). Then, since r = 1/plx, the number of stars with distance between r and r + dr is N(r) dr = N(plx) |d(plx)/dr| dr. Since plx = 1/r, d(plx)/dr = -1/r², so |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r². Therefore, N(r) dr = (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) dr = (r^5) * (1/r²) dr = r^3 dr. Therefore, N(r) ∝ r^3. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^3. So the answer is that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r cubed, so N(r) ∝ r^3.

But let me check with an example. Suppose at plx = 0.1 arcsec, r = 10 pc. The number of stars in a small parallax bin d(plx) around 0.1 is proportional to (0.1)^-5 d(plx). Then, converting to distance, dr corresponds to d(plx) via dr = |d(plx)/ (d plx/dr)|. Since d plx/dr = -1/r², so dr = |d(plx)| * r². Therefore, d(plx) = dr / r². So the number of stars in dr is N(plx) d(plx) = (1/plx^5) * (dr / r²) = (r^5) * (dr / r²) = r^3 dr. So indeed, N(r) dr = r^3 dr. Therefore, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^3. So the answer is N(r) ∝ r^3.

But wait, in reality, if the density of stars is constant, then the number of stars in a shell at distance r would be 4πr² dr * n, where n is the density. So N(r) dr ∝ r² dr. But here, the problem states that in parallax space, the number is ∝ plx^-5, which converts to r^3. So this suggests that the density isn't constant. The density would be N(r) / (4πr²) ∝ r^3 / r² = r. So the density increases linearly with distance. That's possible if, for example, the region being observed has a density that increases with distance. But the problem doesn't specify that; it just gives the distribution in parallax. So according to the given information, the answer is N(r) ∝ r^3.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases with the cube of the distance.
