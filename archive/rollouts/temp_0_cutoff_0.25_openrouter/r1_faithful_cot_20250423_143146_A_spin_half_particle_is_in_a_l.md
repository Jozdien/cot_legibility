To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we use the linearity of expectation values. 

First, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Thus, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

Next, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\). The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) is given by:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Applying \(\sigma_x\) to the state \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we get:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} |\downarrow\rangle
\]
The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
Thus, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33\).

Combining these results, the total expectation value is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx for a spin-half particle that's in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. 

First, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra vector multiplied by the operator multiplied by the ket vector. So, ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. Right. So in this case, the operator is 10σz + 5σx, and the state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. 

Since σz and σx are Pauli matrices, maybe I can compute their expectation values separately and then combine them. Because expectation value is linear, right? So ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. That should simplify things. Let me confirm that. Yes, linearity of expectation values: ⟨aA + bB⟩ = a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩. So that's valid here. 

Alright, so I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately. Let's start with ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is diagonal in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So the expectation value of σz in the state |ψ⟩ is just the modulus squared of the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. 

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization first. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 + ( (√3)/2 )^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Okay, so it's a properly normalized state. Good. 

So, ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2*(+1) + |(√3)/2|^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. 

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. The σx operator is not diagonal in the σz basis. The Pauli matrix σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, I need to calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. 

Alternatively, since σx can be written in terms of outer products. Let me recall that σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. So applying σx to |ψ⟩ would give |↑⟩⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩⟨↑|ψ⟩. 

Let me compute that. First, ⟨↓|ψ⟩ is the coefficient of |↓⟩ in |ψ⟩, which is (√3)/2. Similarly, ⟨↑|ψ⟩ is 0.5. So σx|ψ⟩ = |↑⟩*(√3)/2 + |↓⟩*0.5. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of ⟨ψ| with σx|ψ⟩. 

So that would be (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) multiplied by ( (√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩ ). 

Multiplying this out: 0.5*(√3)/2 ⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3)/2*(√3)/2 ⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3)/2*0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩. 

But ⟨↑|↑⟩ and ⟨↓|↓⟩ are 1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩ are 0. So the cross terms vanish. Wait, but hold on, that can't be right. Because if σx is off-diagonal, then the expectation value should involve cross terms. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. 

Wait, no. The inner product ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↓|↑⟩ is also zero. So the cross terms (the terms with ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩) are zero. But the other terms are 0.5*(√3)/2 *1 + (√3)/2*0.5 *1. 

Wait, let's compute each term step by step. 

First term: 0.5*(√3)/2 * ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 0.5*(√3)/2 *1 = (√3)/4. 

Second term: 0.5*0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0.25*0 = 0. 

Third term: (√3)/2*(√3)/2 * ⟨↓|↑⟩ = (3/4)*0 = 0. 

Fourth term: (√3)/2*0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ = (√3)/4 *1 = √3/4. 

So adding the first and fourth terms: √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2. 

Therefore, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. 

Wait, but √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. 

Therefore, the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. 

But the question says to give the answer up to one decimal place. So that would be approximately -0.7. 

Wait, but let me check my calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩. Let me verify. 

Alternatively, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to express the state as a vector and then apply the matrix. 

The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. So in vector form, that's [0.5; (√3)/2]. 

The σx matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So σx|ψ⟩ is [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ]. 

Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of [0.5, (√3)/2] multiplied by [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ]. 

Which is 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = (0.5*√3)/2 + (0.5*√3)/2 = (√3)/4 + √3/4 = √3/2. 

Yes, same result. So that's correct. 

So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. 

Therefore, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5*1.732)/2 ≈ -5 + (8.66)/2 ≈ -5 +4.33 ≈ -0.67. 

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. 

But wait, let me check if the question specifies any particular rounding rules. It just says up to one decimal place, so -0.67 is approximately -0.7. 

Alternatively, maybe I should keep more decimal places in intermediate steps. Let's see. 

√3 is approximately 1.73205. So √3/2 ≈0.866025. 

So 5*(0.866025) ≈4.330127. 

Then 10*(-0.5) = -5. 

So total is -5 +4.330127 ≈-0.669872. 

So approximately -0.6699, which is -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, and -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. 

Therefore, the answer should be -0.7. 

But let me check once more. Maybe there's a different approach. 

Alternatively, since the state is given as a superposition in the σz basis, perhaps we can write the density matrix and compute the expectation value. 

The density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. So for |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩, 

ρ = [0.5^2, 0.5*(√3)/2; 0.5*(√3)/2, ( (√3)/2 )^2 ] = [0.25, (√3)/4; (√3)/4, 0.75]. 

Then, the operator 10σz +5σx is 10*[[1,0],[0,-1]] +5*[[0,1],[1,0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]. 

So the expectation value is Tr(ρ * [[10,5],[5,-10]]). 

Calculating this trace: 

First element: 0.25*10 + (√3)/4*5 

Second element: (√3)/4*5 + 0.75*(-10) 

Wait, no. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product matrix. 

So let's compute the product matrix ρ * O, where O is [[10,5],[5,-10]]. 

But actually, matrix multiplication for ρ (which is 2x2) and O (2x2) would be another 2x2 matrix. Then the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. 

Alternatively, since ρ is a density matrix, the expectation value is Tr(Oρ). 

Alternatively, compute each element:

The product matrix Oρ is:

First row: 10*0.25 +5*(√3)/4 , 10*(√3)/4 +5*0.75

Second row:5*0.25 + (-10)*(√3)/4 ,5*(√3)/4 + (-10)*0.75

But actually, to compute Tr(Oρ), it's the sum over i,j O_ij ρ_ji. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. 

But since O is 10σz +5σx, we can use linearity again. 

But we already did that earlier. 

Alternatively, let's compute it directly. 

⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ +5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2 ≈-5 + (5*1.732)/2 ≈-5 +4.33 ≈-0.67. 

Same result. 

So, yes, the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. 

Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-0.7}. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

I need to determine the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx for a spin-half particle in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me think about how expectation values are calculated in quantum mechanics.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. In this problem, the operator is 10σz + 5σx, and the state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩.

I can use the linearity property of expectation values to separate the calculation: ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. This will make the computation more manageable. The linearity of expectation values states that ⟨aA + bB⟩ = a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩, which applies here.

Let me first calculate ⟨σz⟩. Since σz is diagonal in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

I should verify that the state is properly normalized. The coefficients squared sum to (0.5)² + ((√3)/2)² = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, confirming normalization.

Therefore, ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|²(+1) + |(√3)/2|²(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ = 10(-0.5) = -5.

Now I need to calculate ⟨σx⟩. The σx operator is...

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx for a spin-half particle in the superposition state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me remember how expectation values function in quantum mechanics.

The expectation value of an operator is found by multiplying the bra vector, the operator, and the ket vector. So, ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. In this situation, the operator in question is 10σz + 5σx, and the state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩.

Since σz and σx are Pauli matrices, I could calculate their expectation values separately and then add them up due to the linearity of expectation value. So, ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. This approach should make things easier. I should verify that. Yes, there's the linearity of expectation values: ⟨aA + bB⟩ = a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩. So it is applicable here.

Alright, I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ individually. I'll start with ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is diagonal in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis. Its eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. Therefore, the expectation value of σz in the state |ψ⟩ is simply the square of the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is provided as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. I'll verify the normalization first. The squares of the coefficients should total to 1. (0.5)^2 + ( (√3)/2 )^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yes, it's a properly normalized state. Excellent.

Thus, ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2*(+1) + |(√3)/2|^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

That was straightforward. Therefore, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, making 10⟨σz⟩ equal to 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, I will proceed to calculate ⟨σx⟩. The σx operator is

In the standard basis, σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, we need to calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let\'s write that out. \n\nFirst, let\'s represent |ψ⟩ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then |ψ⟩ = 0.5*[1; 0] + (√3)/2*[0; 1] = [0.5; (√3)/2]. \n\nThen σx|ψ⟩ would be [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ]. \n\nThen ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩. Since all coefficients are real, it\'s just the transpose. So [0.5, (√3)/2] * [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ] = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5. \n\nCalculating that: 0.5*(√3)/2 = (√3)/4, and the other term is the same, so total is (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. \n\nTherefore, ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866. Then 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. \n\nAdding the two parts together: 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. \n\nWait, but the question says to give the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would be approximately -0.7. But let me check my calculations again to be sure. \n\nFirst, ⟨σz⟩: coefficients squared are 0.25 and 0.75, multiplied by +1 and -1. 0.25 - 0.75 is indeed -0.5. So 10*(-0.5) is -5. \n\nFor ⟨σx⟩, the calculation was [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T. So 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5. Each term is (√3)/4, so total (√3)/2. √3 is approximately 1.732, so 1.732/2 ≈ 0.866. Multiply by 5 gives 4.33. \n\nSo -5 + 4.33 is indeed -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. But let me check if there\'s a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value using matrix multiplication step by step. Let\'s try that. \n\nThe operator is 10σz + 5σx. Let\'s write out the matrix for this operator. \n\nFirst, σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so 10σz is [[10, 0], [0, -10]]. \n\nσx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so 5σx is [[0, 5], [5, 0]]. \n\nAdding them together: 10σz + 5σx = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. \n\nNow, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [0.5; (√3)/2]. \n\nTo compute the expectation value, we need ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩. \n\nSo let\'s compute the matrix multiplication: \n\nFirst, compute (10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩:\n\n[[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [10*0.5 + 5*(√3)/2, 5*0.5 + (-10)*(√3)/2] = [5 + (5√3)/2, 2.5 - 5√3]. \n\nThen take the dot product with ⟨ψ| = [0.5, (√3)/2]:\n\n0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2) + (√3)/2*(2.5 - 5√3). \n\nLet\'s compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5*5 = 2.5; 0.5*(5√3)/2 = (5√3)/4 ≈ (5*1.732)/4 ≈ 8.66/4 ≈ 2.165. So first term total ≈ 2.5 + 2.165 ≈ 4.665. \n\nSecond term: (√3)/2*2.5 = (2.5*1.732)/2 ≈ 4.33/2 ≈ 2.165. Then (√3)/2*(-5√3) = (-5*(√3)^2)/2 = (-5*3)/2 = -15/2 = -7.5. So the second term is 2.165 -7.5 ≈ -5.335. \n\nAdding both terms: 4.665 -5.335 ≈ -0.67. \n\nSo that\'s the same result as before. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. \n\nBut wait, the question says "up to one decimal place". So maybe they want -0.7. But let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it symbolically. Let\'s see:\n\n⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 - |(√3)/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. \n\n⟨σx⟩ = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = (√3)/2. \n\nSo 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3)/2 = -5 + (5√3)/2. \n\nCalculating (5√3)/2: √3 ≈ 1.732, so 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67. \n\nYes, so exactly -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. \n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps expecting an exact value expressed as a decimal. Wait, (√3)/2 is about 0.866, so 5*(√3)/2 is 5*0.866=4.33. So 10σz +5σx expectation is -5 +4.33= -0.67. So to one decimal place, that\'s -0.7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the exact value in terms of √3, but the question says "up to one decimal place", so probably -0.7. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign? Let\'s see. \n\nThe state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. So when calculating ⟨σx⟩, which flips the spin, so σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Therefore, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = same as before. So that\'s correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for expectation value in terms of the components. For a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σz is the difference in probabilities of up and down, and σx is related to the coherence between up and down. \n\nBut I think all steps check out. So the answer should be approximately -0.7. \n\nWait, but let me check if the operator is 10σz +5σx, so coefficients are 10 and 5. So 10*(-0.5) is -5, 5*(√3)/2 is 5*(0.866)=4.33. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67. Rounded to one decimal is -0.7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects more precise calculation. Let me compute √3 more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.73205080757. So 5*(√3)/2 = 5*1.73205080757/2 = 8.6602540378/2 =4.3301270189. Then 4.3301270189 -5 = -0.6698729811.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we use the linearity of expectation values. 

First, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Thus, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

Next, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\). The matrix representation of \(\sigma_x\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\). Applying \(\sigma_x\) to the state vector \(|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}\) gives:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The expectation value is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
Thus, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33\).

Adding the two results together:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

off-diagonal. In the standard basis, σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, we need to calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let's write that out. 

First, let's represent |ψ⟩ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then |ψ⟩ = 0.5*[1; 0] + (√3)/2*[0; 1] = [0.5; (√3)/2]. 

Then σx|ψ⟩ would be [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ]. 

Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩. Since all coefficients are real, it's just the transpose. So [0.5, (√3)/2] * [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ] = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5. 

Calculating that: 0.5*(√3)/2 = (√3)/4, and the other term is the same, so total is (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. 

Therefore, ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866. Then 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33. 

Adding the two parts together: 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. 

Wait, but the question says to give the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would be approximately -0.7. But let me check my calculations again to be sure. 

First, ⟨σz⟩: coefficients squared are 0.25 and 0.75, multiplied by +1 and -1. 0.25 - 0.75 is indeed -0.5. So 10*(-0.5) is -5. 

For ⟨σx⟩, the calculation was [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T. So 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5. Each term is (√3)/4, so total (√3)/2. √3 is approximately 1.732, so 1.732/2 ≈ 0.866. Multiply by 5 gives 4.33. 

So -5 + 4.33 is indeed -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. But let me check if there's a mistake in the calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value using matrix multiplication step by step. Let's try that. 

The operator is 10σz + 5σx. Let's write out the matrix for this operator. 

First, σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so 10σz is [[10, 0], [0, -10]]. 

σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so 5σx is [[0, 5], [5, 0]]. 

Adding them together: 10σz + 5σx = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. 

Now, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [0.5; (√3)/2]. 

To compute the expectation value, we need ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩. 

So let's compute the matrix multiplication: 

First, compute (10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩:

[[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [10*0.5 + 5*(√3)/2, 5*0.5 + (-10)*(√3)/2] = [5 + (5√3)/2, 2.5 - 5√3]. 

Then take the dot product with ⟨ψ| = [0.5, (√3)/2]:

0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2) + (√3)/2*(2.5 - 5√3). 

Let's compute each term:

First term: 0.5*5 = 2.5; 0.5*(5√3)/2 = (5√3)/4 ≈ (5*1.732)/4 ≈ 8.66/4 ≈ 2.165. So first term total ≈ 2.5 + 2.165 ≈ 4.665. 

Second term: (√3)/2*2.5 = (2.5*1.732)/2 ≈ 4.33/2 ≈ 2.165. Then (√3)/2*(-5√3) = (-5*(√3)^2)/2 = (-5*3)/2 = -15/2 = -7.5. So the second term is 2.165 -7.5 ≈ -5.335. 

Adding both terms: 4.665 -5.335 ≈ -0.67. 

So that's the same result as before. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. 

But wait, the question says "up to one decimal place". So maybe they want -0.7. But let me check once more. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it symbolically. Let's see:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 - |(√3)/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

⟨σx⟩ = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = (√3)/2. 

So 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3)/2 = -5 + (5√3)/2. 

Calculating (5√3)/2: √3 ≈ 1.732, so 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67. 

Yes, so exactly -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. 

But let me check if the question is perhaps expecting an exact value expressed as a decimal. Wait, (√3)/2 is about 0.866, so 5*(√3)/2 is 5*0.866=4.33. So 10σz +5σx expectation is -5 +4.33= -0.67. So to one decimal place, that's -0.7. 

Alternatively, maybe they want the exact value in terms of √3, but the question says "up to one decimal place", so probably -0.7. 

But let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign? Let's see. 

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. So when calculating ⟨σx⟩, which flips the spin, so σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Therefore, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = same as before. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for expectation value in terms of the components. For a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σz is the difference in probabilities of up and down, and σx is related to the coherence between up and down. 

But I think all steps check out. So the answer should be approximately -0.7. 

Wait, but let me check if the operator is 10σz +5σx, so coefficients are 10 and 5. So 10*(-0.5) is -5, 5*(√3)/2 is 5*(0.866)=4.33. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67. Rounded to one decimal is -0.7. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects more precise calculation. Let me compute √3 more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.73205080757. So 5*(√3)/2 = 5*1.73205080757/2 = 8.6602540378/2 =4.3301270189. Then 4.3301270189 -5 = -0.6698729811. So approximately -0.6699, which is -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, and -0.7 when rounded to one. 

Yes, so the answer is -0.7. 

But let me check once more if there's a different approach. For example, writing the state as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The expectation values of the Pauli matrices correspond to the components of the Bloch vector. 

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Wait, but the general form of a spin-1/2 state is cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. In this case, the coefficients are real and positive, so φ=0. So θ/2 is the angle such that cos(θ/2)=0.5 and sin(θ/2)=√3/2. Therefore, θ/2=60 degrees, so θ=120 degrees. 

Therefore, the Bloch vector is at an angle of 120 degrees from the z-axis. The expectation value of σz is cos(θ)=cos(120°)= -0.5, which matches our previous result. The expectation value of σx is sin(θ)cos(φ)= sin(120°)*cos(0°)= (√3/2)*1=√3/2≈0.866, which also matches. So then 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2)= -5 + (5√3)/2≈-5 +4.33≈-0.67. 

So that's another way to see it. So the Bloch sphere approach confirms the result. 

Therefore, I think the answer is definitely -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. 

**Final Answer**
The expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we use the linearity of expectation values:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

First, we calculate \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle\):

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Thus, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

Next, we calculate \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\). The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) in the basis of \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) is:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \left(0.5 \langle \uparrow | + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \langle \downarrow | \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} | \uparrow \rangle + 0.5 | \downarrow \rangle \right)
\]

Expanding this product:

\[
0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \langle \uparrow | \uparrow \rangle + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \langle \uparrow | \downarrow \rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \langle \downarrow | \uparrow \rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 \langle \downarrow | \downarrow \rangle
\]

Since \(\langle \uparrow | \downarrow \rangle = \langle \downarrow | \uparrow \rangle = 0\) and \(\langle \uparrow | \uparrow \rangle = \langle \downarrow | \downarrow \rangle = 1\), the cross terms vanish:

\[
0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Thus, \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\), and \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33\).

Adding the two results together:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]

Rounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is:

\[
\boxed{-0.7}
\]

Let me recall that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which in the σz basis is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, since σx can be written in terms of outer products: σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. Applying this to |ψ⟩:

σx|ψ⟩ = |↑⟩⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩⟨↑|ψ⟩. Let's compute each term.

⟨↓|ψ⟩ is the coefficient of |↓⟩ in |ψ⟩, which is (√3)/2. Similarly, ⟨↑|ψ⟩ is 0.5. Therefore, σx|ψ⟩ = |↑⟩*(√3/2) + |↓⟩*(0.5).

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of |ψ⟩ with σx|ψ⟩. So:

(0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * ( (√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩ )

Multiplying this out:

0.5*(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5*0.5⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*0.5⟨↓|↓⟩

Since ⟨↑|↑⟩ = ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1 and ⟨↑|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0, the cross terms vanish. So we have:

0.5*(√3/2)*1 + (√3/2)*0.5*1 = (0.5*√3/2) + (√3/2*0.5) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

Alternatively, since σx is the spin operator along x, and the state is given, maybe there's a more straightforward way. But the calculation above seems correct.

Therefore, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Then 5⟨σx⟩ = 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Adding the two parts together: -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute ⟨σx⟩ again step by step.

Given |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Then σx|ψ⟩ = |↓⟩*0.5 + |↑⟩*(√3/2). Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|)(0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩).

Multiplying term by term:

0.5*0.5⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5*(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*0.5⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩

Again, cross terms are zero. So:

0.5*(√3/2)*1 + (√3/2)*0.5*1 = same as before, √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2. So that's correct. So 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. Let me compute this exactly first.

(5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33. So -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. But maybe the exact value is needed?

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the answer up to one decimal place. Let me check the exact value.

The exact expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. Let me compute (5√3)/2:

√3 ≈ 1.73205, so 5*1.73205 ≈ 8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then subtract 5: 4.330125 - 5 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the answer is -0.7.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of exact fractions and radicals, but since it says "up to one decimal place," I think -0.7 is correct.

But let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign for ⟨σx⟩. Wait, when I calculated ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, the result was √3/2, which is positive. So 5*(√3/2) is positive. Then 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, so total is -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should present the answer as -0.7. But let me check if there's any possible mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another way to compute the expectation value is to represent the state as a vector and the operators as matrices. Let me try that approach to confirm.

The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. In vector form, that's [0.5; (√3)/2]. Let me check the normalization: 0.5² + ( (√3)/2 )² = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Correct.

The operator 10σz + 5σx. Let's write σz and σx as matrices:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So 10σz = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]
5σx = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]
Adding them together: [[10, 5], [5, -10]]

Now, the expectation value is [0.5, (√3)/2] multiplied by this matrix, then multiplied by the vector [0.5; (√3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply the row vector [0.5, (√3)/2] with the matrix [[10, 5], [5, -10]]:

First element: 0.5*10 + (√3)/2*5 = 5 + (5√3)/2
Second element: 0.5*5 + (√3)/2*(-10) = 2.5 - 5√3

Then, multiply this result by the column vector [0.5; (√3)/2]:

(5 + (5√3)/2)*0.5 + (2.5 - 5√3)*(√3)/2

Let me compute each term:

First term: (5 + (5√3)/2)*0.5 = 5*0.5 + (5√3)/2*0.5 = 2.5 + (5√3)/4

Second term: (2.5 - 5√3)*(√3)/2 = 2.5*(√3)/2 - 5√3*(√3)/2 = (2.5√3)/2 - (5*3)/2 = (2.5√3)/2 - 15/2

Now, combine both terms:

2.5 + (5√3)/4 + (2.5√3)/2 - 15/2

Convert 2.5 to 5/2 and 15/2 remains as is.

So:

5/2 + (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 - 15/2

Combine like terms:

(5/2 - 15/2) + (5√3/4 + 5√3/4) = (-10/2) + (10√3)/4 = -5 + (5√3)/2

Which is the same as before. So the exact expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. Numerically, that's approximately -5 + 4.3301 ≈ -0.6699, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we use the linearity of expectation values. 

First, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Thus, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

Next, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\). The operator \(\sigma_x\) in the basis of \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) is given by:
\[
\sigma_x = |\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| + |\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|
\]
The expectation value is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \text{Re}(a \cdot b) = 2 \cdot (0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
Thus, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33\).

Adding these results together:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is:
\[
\boxed{-0.7}
\]

off-diagonal in the σz basis. The Pauli matrix σx is given by:

σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

Therefore, to compute ⟨σx⟩, we need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let's write that out.

First, let's express |ψ⟩ as a column vector. In the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. Therefore, |ψ⟩ is 0.5*[1; 0] + (√3)/2*[0; 1] = [0.5; (√3)/2].

Similarly, σx as a matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So, σx|ψ⟩ would be [[0, 1], [1, 0]] multiplied by [0.5; (√3)/2], which gives [(√3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩. Since all coefficients here are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So, [0.5, (√3)/2] multiplied by [(√3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5.

Calculating that: 0.5*(√3)/2 = (√3)/4, and the second term is the same, so total is (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Alternatively, since σx is the spin operator along x, and the state is given in the z basis, maybe there's another way to compute ⟨σx⟩. But the matrix multiplication approach seems straightforward here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value in terms of the components. For a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(a*b*). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, σx in terms of ladder operators: σx = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ|↑⟩⟨↓|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|↓⟩⟨↑|ψ⟩ = a*b* + b*a* = 2 Re(a*b*). Since a and b are real here, this becomes 2ab. So, 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = 2*(0.5*√3/2) = 2*(√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Which matches the previous result. So, that's a good check.

Therefore, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Then, 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(√3/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Therefore, the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the exact value before approximating. √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3/2 is approximately 0.866. So, 5*(√3/2) is (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33. So, 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, so total is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. So, to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

But let me check if I did the calculation correctly. Let me re-express the state as a vector:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; (√3)/2]. Then, σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so σz|ψ⟩ = [0.5*1; (√3)/2*(-1)] = [0.5; -√3/2]. Then, ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = -0.5. Correct.

Similarly, σx|ψ⟩ = [ (√3)/2; 0.5 ], so ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = √3/2. Correct.

So, 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. Let's compute (5√3)/2. Since √3 ≈ 1.732, so 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33. So, -5 + 4.33 = -0.666... which is approximately -0.6667. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

But wait, the question says "up to one decimal place". So, -0.666... is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Alternatively, if they want truncation instead of rounding, it would be -0.6, but generally, in the absence of specific instructions, rounding is standard. So, -0.7 is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should present the exact value first. Let's see:

The exact expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. To write this as a decimal, √3 ≈ 1.732, so (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 4.33. So, -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.666..., which is approximately -0.6667. So, to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact expression? But the question says "up to one decimal place", so they want a numerical value. So, -0.7.

Wait, but let me check once again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩. Let me verify.

Given |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Then, σx is the operator that flips the spin, so σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Therefore, σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5σx|↑⟩ + (√3)/2σx|↓⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|)(0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩) = 0.5*(√3)/2⟨↑|↑⟩ + 0.5*0.5⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3)/2*0.5⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3)/2*(√3)/2⟨↓|↑⟩.

But ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0. Therefore, the cross terms vanish, and we have 0.5*(√3)/2*1 + (√3)/2*0.5*1 = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = √3/2. So, that's correct. So, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2. So, 5*(√3)/2 ≈ 4.33. So, 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.666..., which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-0.7}.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach. For example, expressing the state as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. The general form of a spin state is cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. Here, there's no phase factor (since coefficients are real and positive), so φ = 0. Therefore, cos(θ/2) = 0.5, so θ/2 = π/3, so θ = 2π/3. Then, the expectation value of σz is cosθ = cos(2π/3) = -0.5, which matches our previous result. Similarly, the expectation value of σx is sinθ cosφ = sin(2π/3)*1 = (√3)/2, which also matches. So, this method confirms the same results. Therefore, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3)/2 = -5 + (5√3)/2 ≈ -5 +4.33≈-0.666..., which is -0.7 to one decimal place. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is -0.7.

**Final Answer**
