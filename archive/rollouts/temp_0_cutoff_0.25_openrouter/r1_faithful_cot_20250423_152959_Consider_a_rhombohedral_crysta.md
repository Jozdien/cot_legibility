To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice. 

The formula for the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane is derived as follows:

1. **Formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice**:
   \[
   d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2 \cos \alpha}{3}}
   \]
   where \( a \) is the interatomic distance (lattice parameter) and \( \alpha \) is the angle between the lattice vectors.

2. **Substitute the given values**:
   - \( a = 10 \) Å
   - \( \alpha = 30^\circ \)
   - \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

3. **Calculate the expression inside the square root**:
   \[
   \frac{1 + 2 \cos 30^\circ}{3} = \frac{1 + 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)}{3} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{3}
   \]

4. **Compute the square root**:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{3}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{1 + 1.732}{3}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2.732}{3}} \approx \sqrt{0.9107} \approx 0.954
   \]

5. **Multiply by the lattice parameter**:
   \[
   d_{111} = 10 \times 0.954 \approx 9.54 \text{ Å}
   \]

Thus, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in the given rhombohedral crystal is \(\boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Hmm, let me recall how interplanar distances are calculated in different crystal systems. 

First, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, for a set of lattice planes (hkl) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula specific to the crystal system. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for d would be different from, say, cubic or hexagonal systems. 

Wait, rhombohedral is a part of the trigonal crystal system, right? So maybe I need to use the formula for the trigonal system. But I should confirm the exact formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice. 

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² + 2(hk)/(ab) cosγ + 2(hl)/(ac) cosβ + 2(kl)/(bc) cosα) / (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ)

But wait, that seems complicated. Is there a simpler version for the rhombohedral system? Let me check.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Hmm, maybe. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors are all of equal length, and the angles between them are equal. So, the lattice parameter a is the length of each edge of the rhombohedron, and the angles between the edges are all α. So, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, that should correspond to the lattice parameter a. So, a = 10 Å, and α = 30 degrees.

So, given that, the formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice can be simplified. Let me look up the formula. Alternatively, since the rhombohedral system can be considered as a special case of the trigonal system, maybe the formula is:

1/d² = ( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) / (a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. Let me recall that in the rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be used to calculate the interplanar distances.

Alternatively, since the crystal is rhombohedral, we can convert the rhombohedral lattice to a hexagonal lattice for easier calculation, because sometimes the hexagonal coordinates are used for trigonal crystals. But maybe that complicates things. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral coordinates is similar to the cubic system but adjusted for the angles. Wait, in cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but that's only when all angles are 90 degrees. For rhombohedral, with angles 30 degrees, it's different.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the general triclinic formula, since rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic with a = b = c and α = β = γ. Let me check the triclinic formula for interplanar spacing.

The general formula for triclinic system is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S13 h l + 2 S23 k l ]

Where V is the volume of the unit cell, and Sij are the elements of the metric tensor. Hmm, this might be a bit involved, but since it's a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor can be simplified.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the metric tensor components would be:

Since a = b = c, and α = β = γ, the metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², and the off-diagonal elements are a² cosα.

So, G = [ [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1 / |G* (hkl)|^{1/2}

Wait, maybe. Let me recall that in crystallography, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the reciprocal lattice. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / |\vec{g}_{hkl}|

where \vec{g}_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

Where V is the volume of the unit cell, V = a1 · (a2 × a3)

In the rhombohedral system, the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3 all have length a, and the angles between any two vectors are α. So, the volume V can be calculated as:

V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = a³ (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)^{1/2}

Wait, let me compute the cross product first. Let's assume the vectors a1, a2, a3 are in 3D space. Let me define them as:

Let’s set a1 along the x-axis: a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 is in the xy-plane, making an angle α with a1. So, a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 has to make an angle α with both a1 and a2. So, the coordinates of a3 can be found by ensuring that the angle between a3 and a1 is α, and the angle between a3 and a2 is also α.

Let’s denote a3 = [c1, c2, c3]

Then, the dot product a1 · a3 = a² cosα = a c1 => c1 = a cosα

Similarly, a2 · a3 = a² cosα = a (cosα c1 + sinα c2)

Substituting c1 = a cosα:

a² cosα = a (cosα (a cosα) + sinα c2 )

Divide both sides by a:

a cosα = a cos²α + sinα c2

Then,

sinα c2 = a cosα - a cos²α = a cosα (1 - cosα)

Thus,

c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

Simplify:

cosα (1 - cosα) / sinα = [cosα - cos²α] / sinα

Hmm, maybe express in terms of sin. Let me recall that 1 - cosα = 2 sin²(α/2), and sinα = 2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2). So,

[cosα - cos²α] / sinα = cosα(1 - cosα)/sinα = cosα * 2 sin²(α/2) / [2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2)] ) = cosα * sin(α/2) / cos(α/2) = cosα tan(α/2)

But maybe this is complicating. Let's just keep it as c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

Now, the third component c3 can be found from the fact that the magnitude of a3 is a. So,

|c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = a²

So,

(a cosα)^2 + [ (a cosα (1 - cosα))/ sinα ]^2 + c3² = a²

Let me compute each term:

First term: a² cos²α

Second term: a² cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α

Third term: c3²

So,

a² cos²α + a² cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α + c3² = a²

Factor out a²:

a² [ cos²α + cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ] + c3² = a²

Let me compute the term in brackets:

cos²α [ 1 + (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ]

= cos²α [ (sin²α + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α ]

But sin²α = 1 - cos²α, so substitute:

= cos²α [ ( (1 - cos²α) + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α ) / sin²α ]

Simplify numerator:

1 - cos²α + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α = 2 - 2 cosα

Thus,

= cos²α [ (2 - 2 cosα) / sin²α ] = cos²α [ 2(1 - cosα) / (1 - cos²α) ]

Since sin²α = 1 - cos²α = (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα), so:

= cos²α [ 2(1 - cosα) / ( (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα) ) ) ] = cos²α [ 2 / (1 + cosα) ]

Therefore, the term in brackets is 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα)

So, going back:

a² [ 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ] + c3² = a²

Therefore,

c3² = a² - a² [ 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ] = a² [ 1 - 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ]

Simplify the expression inside:

1 = (1 + cosα)/(1 + cosα), so:

= a² [ (1 + cosα - 2 cos²α) / (1 + cosα) ]

Factor numerator:

1 + cosα - 2 cos²α = -2 cos²α + cosα + 1

Let me factor this quadratic in cosα:

Let’s set x = cosα, then:

-2x² + x + 1 = - (2x² - x -1) = - (2x² - x -1)

Factor 2x² - x -1:

Looking for two numbers m and n such that m * n = -2 (since 2x² + mx + nx -1) Wait, maybe:

2x² - x -1 = (2x + 1)(x -1 )

Check: 2x*x = 2x², 2x*(-1) = -2x, 1*x = x, 1*(-1) = -1. So, -2x + x = -x. Yes, that works.

Thus,

- (2x +1)(x -1 ) = - (2 cosα +1)(cosα -1 )

Therefore,

c3² = a² [ - (2 cosα +1)(cosα -1 ) / (1 + cosα) ]

Note that (cosα -1 ) = - (1 - cosα), so:

= a² [ - (2 cosα +1)( - (1 - cosα) ) / (1 + cosα) ]

= a² [ (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα) / (1 + cosα) ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me compute this expression step by step.

First, compute (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα):

= 2 cosα (1 - cosα) +1*(1 - cosα) = 2 cosα - 2 cos²α +1 - cosα = (2 cosα - cosα) + (1 - 2 cos²α) = cosα +1 - 2 cos²α

Wait, that's the same as before. So, perhaps this approach isn't simplifying. Maybe plug in the value of α = 30 degrees to compute numerically?

Given that α = 30 degrees, let's compute c3.

First, compute cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute c2:

c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

sinα = sin(30°) = 0.5

So,

c2 = [10 * (√3/2) * (1 - √3/2)] / 0.5

First compute 1 - √3/2 ≈ 1 - 0.8660 ≈ 0.1340

Then,

Numerator: 10 * 0.8660 * 0.1340 ≈ 10 * 0.116 ≈ 1.16

Denominator: 0.5

Thus, c2 ≈ 1.16 / 0.5 ≈ 2.32 Angstroms

Wait, but a is 10 Angstroms, so this seems small. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

1 - cosα ≈ 1 - 0.8660254 ≈ 0.1339746

sinα = 0.5

So,

c2 = [10 * 0.8660254 * 0.1339746] / 0.5

First compute 0.8660254 * 0.1339746:

≈ 0.8660254 * 0.1339746 ≈ 0.116025

Multiply by 10: ≈ 1.16025

Divide by 0.5: ≈ 2.3205 Angstroms

So, c2 ≈ 2.3205 Å

Then, compute c3:

From c3² = a² [ (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα) / (1 + cosα) ]

Compute numerator: (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα)

2 cosα +1 = 2*(0.8660254) +1 ≈ 1.7320508 +1 = 2.7320508

1 - cosα ≈ 0.1339746

Multiply them: 2.7320508 * 0.1339746 ≈ 0.3660254

Denominator: 1 + cosα ≈ 1 + 0.8660254 ≈ 1.8660254

So,

c3² ≈ 10² * (0.3660254 / 1.8660254) ≈ 100 * 0.19615 ≈ 19.615

Therefore, c3 ≈ sqrt(19.615) ≈ 4.43 Angstroms

So, the coordinates of a3 are:

c1 = a cosα ≈ 10 * 0.8660254 ≈ 8.660254 Å

c2 ≈ 2.3205 Å

c3 ≈ 4.43 Å

So, a3 ≈ [8.660254, 2.3205, 4.43] Å

Now, having the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3, we can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3.

First, compute the volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3)

Compute the cross product a2 × a3 first.

Given a2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0] = [8.660254, 5, 0] (Wait, wait, earlier we had a2 defined as [a cosα, a sinα, 0], but in our coordinate system above, a2 was calculated as [8.66, 2.32, 0]? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the initial setup, we set a1 along the x-axis: a1 = [a, 0, 0] = [10, 0, 0]

Then, a2 is in the xy-plane with angle α = 30°, so a2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0] = [10*(√3/2), 10*(1/2), 0] = [8.66025, 5, 0]

Wait, but earlier when we tried to compute a3, we ended up with a3 ≈ [8.66, 2.32, 4.43]. But that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the standard rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors are all of equal length and equal angles between them. So, if we set a1 along the x-axis, a2 in the xy-plane, and a3 in 3D space, such that the angle between any two vectors is α.

But when I tried to compute a3, I might have made a mistake. Let me redo that.

Given a1 = [a, 0, 0]

a2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0]

a3 = [a cosα, a cosα * (1 - cosα)/sinα, c3]

Wait, but perhaps there's a standard way to define the rhombohedral vectors. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the volume V.

The volume V of the rhombohedron is given by:

V = a³ √(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

Let me confirm this formula. For a rhombohedral lattice, the volume can be calculated as the scalar triple product of the vectors a1, a2, a3.

Given that all vectors have length a, and the angle between any two vectors is α, the scalar triple product is:

V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = a³ (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )^(1/2)

Wait, actually, the formula for the volume of a rhombohedron is:

V = a³ √(1 + 2 cosα - 3 cos²α)

Wait, perhaps I need to compute it directly.

Compute a2 × a3 first.

Given a1 = [a, 0, 0]

a2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0]

a3 = [a cosα, a cosα * ( (1 - cosα)/sinα ), c3]

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe use the formula for the volume in terms of the angle α.

Alternatively, since the angle between any two vectors is α, the dot product between a1 and a2 is a² cosα, similarly for a1 and a3, and a2 and a3.

The volume squared is given by the determinant of the metric tensor:

V² = |G| = determinant of the matrix:

[ a²       a² cosα   a² cosα
  a² cosα   a²        a² cosα
  a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]

Compute determinant:

|G| = a² [ a² * a² - (a² cosα)^2 ] - a² cosα [ a² cosα * a² - (a² cosα)^2 ] + a² cosα [ (a² cosα)^2 - a² * a² cosα ]

This seems messy. Let me compute it step by step.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

|G| = a²*(a²*a² - (a² cosα)^2) - a² cosα*(a² cosα*a² - (a² cosα)^2) + a² cosα*((a² cosα)^2 - a²*a² cosα)

Simplify each term:

First term: a²*(a^4 - a^4 cos²α) = a^6 (1 - cos²α)

Second term: -a² cosα*(a^4 cosα - a^4 cos²α) = -a^6 cosα (cosα - cos²α) = -a^6 cos²α (1 - cosα)

Third term: a² cosα*(a^4 cos²α - a^4 cosα) = a^6 cosα (cos²α - cosα) = a^6 cosα (cosα (cosα -1 )) = -a^6 cos²α (1 - cosα)

So, total determinant:

|G| = a^6 (1 - cos²α) - a^6 cos²α (1 - cosα) - a^6 cos²α (1 - cosα)

Factor out a^6:

= a^6 [ (1 - cos²α) - 2 cos²α (1 - cosα) ]

Expand the terms inside:

1 - cos²α - 2 cos²α + 2 cos³α

= 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α

Therefore,

|G| = a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

Thus, the volume V = sqrt(|G|) = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

So, V = a³ √(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

Given that, for α = 30°, let's compute V.

First, compute cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3

= 1 - 9/4 + 2*( 3√3 / 8 )

= (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3 / 8 )

= (-5/4) + (3√3 / 4 )

≈ (-1.25) + (3*1.732)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (5.196)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Therefore, V ≈ a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2216

Given a = 10 Å, V ≈ 1000 * 0.2216 ≈ 221.6 Å³

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V

b2 = (a3 × a1) / V

b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

But calculating these cross products might be tedious. Alternatively, since we have the metric tensor G, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is G^{-1}, and the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1 / sqrt( h² G*11 + k² G*22 + l² G*33 + 2 hk G*12 + 2 hl G*13 + 2 kl G*23 )

But since in rhombohedral system, G is a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements a² and off-diagonal elements a² cosα, the inverse matrix G* will also have a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, since G is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements a² and off-diagonal elements a² cosα, we can compute its inverse.

Let me denote the matrix G as:

[ A   B   B

  B   A   B

  B   B   A ]

Where A = a², B = a² cosα

The inverse of such a matrix can be found using the formula for inversion of a matrix with diagonal elements A and off-diagonal elements B.

The inverse matrix G* will have diagonal elements C and off-diagonal elements D, where:

C = (A + B) / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

D = -B / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

Let me verify this.

The inverse of the matrix:

[ A B B

  B A B

  B B A ]

is given by (1/det) * [ (A² - B²)   -B(A - B)   -B(A - B)

                        -B(A - B)   (A² - B²)   -B(A - B)

                        -B(A - B)   -B(A - B)   (A² - B²) ]

But determinant det = (A - B)^2 (A + 2B)

Therefore, the inverse matrix elements:

Diagonal elements: (A + B) / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

Off-diagonal elements: -B / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

So, yes, as I mentioned.

Therefore, in our case, A = a², B = a² cosα

Therefore, diagonal elements of G*:

C = (a² + a² cosα) / [ (a² - a² cosα)(a² + 2 a² cosα) ) ] = [ a² (1 + cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - cosα) * a² (1 + 2 cosα) ) ] = (1 + cosα) / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

Similarly, off-diagonal elements D:

D = -a² cosα / [ (a² - a² cosα)(a² + 2 a² cosα) ) ] = -cosα / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) )

Therefore, the reciprocal metric tensor components are:

G*11 = G*22 = G*33 = C = (1 + cosα) / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

G*12 = G*13 = G*23 = D = -cosα / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

Therefore, the formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = h² C + k² C + l² C + 2 hk D + 2 hl D + 2 kl D

= C (h² + k² + l²) + 2 D (hk + hl + kl )

Substituting C and D:

= [ (1 + cosα) / (a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ) ] (h² + k² + l²) + 2 [ -cosα / (a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ) ] (hk + hl + kl )

Factor out 1 / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ) ]:

= [ 1 / (a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ) ] [ (1 + cosα)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) ]

Therefore,

1/d² = [ (1 + cosα)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) ] / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

So, solving for d:

d = [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) / ( (1 + cosα)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) ) ]^{1/2}

This is the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Now, plugging in the values for the (111) plane, where h = k = l = 1, and α = 30°, a = 10 Å.

First, compute the numerator inside the square root:

a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα)

a = 10 Å, so a² = 100 Å²

cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute (1 - cosα) = 1 - √3/2 ≈ 1 - 0.8660 ≈ 0.13397

Compute (1 + 2 cosα) = 1 + 2*(√3/2) = 1 + √3 ≈ 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.732

Multiply them: 0.13397 * 2.732 ≈ 0.13397 * 2.732 ≈ 0.366

Multiply by a²: 100 * 0.366 ≈ 36.6

Now, compute the denominator:

(1 + cosα)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl )

h = k = l = 1, so h² + k² + l² = 3

hk + hl + kl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3

Thus,

(1 + cosα)*3 - 2 cosα*3 = 3(1 + cosα - 2 cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)

Compute 1 - cosα ≈ 0.13397

Thus, denominator ≈ 3 * 0.13397 ≈ 0.4019

Therefore,

d = sqrt(36.6 / 0.4019) ≈ sqrt(91.07) ≈ 9.54 Å

Wait, that's interesting. So, the interplanar distance d_{111} is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. But the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. That seems plausible? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator more accurately.

First, compute a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα):

a² = 100

cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

1 - cosα ≈ 0.1339746

1 + 2 cosα = 1 + 2*(0.8660254) ≈ 1 + 1.7320508 ≈ 2.7320508

Multiply (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα):

0.1339746 * 2.7320508 ≈ Let's compute this precisely:

0.1339746 * 2 = 0.2679492

0.1339746 * 0.7320508 ≈ 0.1339746 * 0.7 ≈ 0.093782, 0.1339746 * 0.0320508 ≈ ~0.004297

Total ≈ 0.093782 + 0.004297 ≈ 0.098079

So total numerator: 0.2679492 + 0.098079 ≈ 0.3660282

Multiply by a² = 100: 0.3660282 * 100 ≈ 36.60282

Denominator:

(1 + cosα)(3) - 2 cosα*(3) = 3(1 + cosα - 2 cosα) = 3(1 - cosα) ≈ 3 * 0.1339746 ≈ 0.4019238

Therefore, d = sqrt(36.60282 / 0.4019238) ≈ sqrt(91.07) ≈ 9.54 Å

But wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which is the edge length of the rhombohedron. The interplanar distance for (111) being ~9.54 Å seems a bit close but possible. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, in a cubic system, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a =10 Å. But here, due to the angles being 30°, the interplanar distance is larger, which makes sense because the planes are not as closely packed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the formula. Let me verify the formula again.

The formula derived was:

d = sqrt [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) / ( (1 + cosα)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) ) ]

For the (111) plane, substituting h = k = l =1:

Denominator becomes (1 + cosα)(3) - 2 cosα (3) = 3(1 + cosα - 2 cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)

Thus,

d = sqrt [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) / (3(1 - cosα)) ] = sqrt [ a² (1 + 2 cosα) / 3 ]

Simplify:

d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 )

Wait, this is a much simpler expression! So, for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance simplifies to:

d_{111} = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 )

Let me check this. Because in the previous step, we had:

d = sqrt [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) / (3(1 - cosα)) ]

The (1 - cosα) terms cancel out, leaving:

sqrt [ a² (1 + 2 cosα) / 3 ]

Yes, that's correct. So, the formula simplifies to d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 )

Therefore, substituting α = 30°, cosα = √3/2:

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 ) = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Compute (1 + √3)/3:

1 + √3 ≈ 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.732

Divide by 3: ≈ 0.9107

Take square root: sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Multiply by 10: ≈ 9.54 Å

So, same result as before. Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.

But let me verify this formula with another approach. For example, in a cubic lattice where α = 90°, cosα = 0. Then,

d_{111} = a * sqrt( (1 + 0)/3 ) = a / sqrt(3), which matches the standard result. So that checks out.

If α = 60°, which is the angle for a face-centered cubic lattice, then cosα = 0.5,

d_{111} = a * sqrt( (1 + 2*0.5)/3 ) = a * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816 a, which also makes sense.

In our case, α = 30°, so the interplanar distance is larger than a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å, which is expected because the angle is smaller, so the planes are more spaced out.

Therefore, the answer should be 10 * sqrt( (1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 ) = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

We can rationalize this expression:

(1 + √3)/3 = (2 + 2√3)/6 = (1 + √3)/3

But perhaps we can write it in exact form:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator inside the sqrt by sqrt(3):

sqrt( ( (1 + √3) sqrt(3) ) / (3 * sqrt(3)) ) ) = sqrt( ( sqrt(3) + 3 ) / (3 sqrt(3)) )

But this might not help. Alternatively, compute the exact value:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(2.732 / 3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

So, 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.

But the question might expect an exact form. Let's see:

(1 + 2 cosα)/3 with α = 30°, cosα = √3/2:

(1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 = (1 + √3)/3

Thus,

d = a * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Plugging in a = 10 Å:

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Å

If we want to rationalize or present it differently, but perhaps this is the simplest exact form. Alternatively, compute the numerical value:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt( (1 + 1.73205)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(2.73205/3) ≈ sqrt(0.91068) ≈ 0.9542

Therefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.9542 ≈ 9.542 Å

Rounded to three significant figures, since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å (one significant figure?), but actually 10 Angstroms is two significant figures. Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. If it's 10.0, that's three, but as written, 10 is two significant figures. The angles are given as 30°, which is one significant figure, but angles in crystallography are often taken as exact. Hmm, but maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures, so 9.5 Å. But the exact value is approximately 9.54, which rounds to 9.5 Å (two significant figures) or 9.54 Å (three significant figures). Since the given data is 10 Angstroms and 30 degrees, which could be considered as two significant figures and one significant figure, respectively. But angles are sometimes written as 30° meaning exactly 30, so maybe the answer should be exact. However, the formula gives an exact expression, but the numerical value is approximate.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in terms of exact trigonometric expressions. Let me see.

But the question says "What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?" and the answer is expected in a box, likely a numerical value. Given that, and the approximate calculation gives ~9.54 Å, which is approximately 9.5 Å. But let me check once more.

Wait, another way to think about this: in a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are perpendicular to the body diagonal of the rhombohedron. The interplanar distance would be the distance between consecutive planes along this diagonal. The length of the body diagonal in a rhombohedron can be calculated, and the interplanar distance might be related to that.

The body diagonal vector is a1 + a2 + a3. The length of this vector is |a1 + a2 + a3|.

Compute this length squared:

|a1 + a2 + a3|² = |a1|² + |a2|² + |a3|² + 2(a1·a2 + a1·a3 + a2·a3)

Since |a1| = |a2| = |a3| = a, and a1·a2 = a² cosα, similarly for others.

Thus,

= 3a² + 2*3*a² cosα = 3a²(1 + 2 cosα)

Therefore, the length of the body diagonal is a sqrt(3(1 + 2 cosα))

The interplanar distance d_{111} is the length of the body diagonal divided by the number of planes per unit cell. In a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are spaced by the length of the body diagonal divided by the number of layers, which for a primitive cell is 1. Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} is equal to the length of the body diagonal divided by 1, but wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which in the case of the (111) planes in a rhombohedral lattice would be the length from the origin to the first plane along the body diagonal. However, in a primitive lattice, the interplanar distance is actually the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector in that direction.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to (111) is G = h b1 + k b2 + l b3 = b1 + b2 + b3. The magnitude of this vector is |G|, and d = 1/|G|.

Earlier, we computed |G| and found d ≈ 9.54 Å. Alternatively, since the direct lattice body diagonal is a sqrt(3(1 + 2 cosα)), then the corresponding reciprocal lattice vector would have a magnitude related to that.

But perhaps this is another way to get the same result. Since the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is |G| = 2π/d, but in crystallography, sometimes the reciprocal lattice is defined without the 2π factor. Depending on the convention. But in our previous calculation, we didn't include the 2π factor, so |G| = 1/d.

But regardless, the key point is that the formula we derived earlier gives d = a sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 ), which for α=30° gives approximately 9.54 Å. This seems to be the correct answer.

Therefore, after careful calculation and verification, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounded to two significant figures, it's 9.5 Å. But since 10 Angstroms is given as the interatomic distance (possibly two significant figures), and angles are 30° (exact), the answer should be presented as 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Å, which is exact, or approximately 9.54 Å.

But let me check with another method. Suppose we use the general triclinic formula with the metric tensor.

Given the metric tensor G as before, with a = 10 Å, α = 30°, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is:

G*11 = G*22 = G*33 = (1 + cosα) / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

G*12 = G*13 = G*23 = -cosα / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ]

For (hkl) = (111), the reciprocal metric tensor terms:

1/d² = G*11 (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2 G*12 (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 )

= 3 G*11 + 6 G*12

Substituting G*11 and G*12:

= 3*(1 + cosα)/D + 6*(-cosα)/D

Where D = a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα)

= [3(1 + cosα) - 6 cosα] / D

= [3 + 3 cosα - 6 cosα] / D

= [3 - 3 cosα] / D

= 3(1 - cosα)/D

But D = a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα)

Thus,

1/d² = 3(1 - cosα) / [ a² (1 - cosα)(1 + 2 cosα) ) ] = 3 / [ a² (1 + 2 cosα) )

Therefore,

d = a sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 )

Which is the same formula as before. So, this confirms the result.

Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane is indeed d = a sqrt( (1 + 2 cosα)/3 )

Plugging in the numbers:

d = 10 Å * sqrt( (1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 ) = 10 Å * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

So, the answer is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Depending on the required precision, this can be rounded to 9.5 Å or expressed in exact form.

But the problem says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". If "interatomic distance" refers to the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral lattice is equal to the edge length a. So, a = 10 Å. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Angstroms, which numerically is approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the problem's requirement, but since the given data is 10 (two significant figures) and 30° (exact), the answer should have two significant figures, so 9.5 Å. However, sometimes in crystallography, exact forms are preferred. But the problem might expect the numerical value.

Alternatively, let's compute sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ):

sqrt( (1 + 1.73205)/3 ) = sqrt(2.73205/3) = sqrt(0.91068) = 0.9542

Thus, 10 * 0.9542 = 9.542 Å, which rounds to 9.54 Å if three significant figures are allowed, or 9.5 Å for two. Since 10 is two significant figures, 9.5 Å is appropriate.

But let me check once more for calculation errors. If I compute (1 + 2 cosα)/3 with α=30°:

cos30 = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

1 + 2*0.8660 = 1 + 1.732 = 2.732

2.732 / 3 ≈ 0.9107

sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

10 * 0.954 = 9.54 Å

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane is approximately 9.5 Å.

**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Hmm, let me recall how interplanar distances are calculated in different crystal systems. 

First, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, for a set of lattice planes (hkl) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula specific to the crystal system. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for d would be different from, say, cubic or hexagonal systems. 

Wait, rhombohedral is a part of the trigonal crystal system, right? So maybe I need to use the formula for the trigonal system. But I should confirm the exact formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice. 

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² + 2(hk)/(ab) cosγ + 2(hl)/(ac) cosβ + 2(kl)/(bc) cosα) / (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ)

But wait, that seems complicated. Is there a simpler version for the rhombohedral system? Let me check.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Hmm, maybe. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors are all of equal length, and the angles between them are equal. So, the lattice parameter a is the length of each edge of the rhombohedron, and the angles between the edges are all α. So, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, that should correspond to the lattice parameter a. So, a = 10 Å, and α = 30 degrees.

So, given that, the formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice can be simplified. Let me look up the formula. Alternatively, since the rhombohedral system can be considered as a special case of the trigonal system, maybe the formula is:

1/d² = ( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) / (a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. Let me recall that in the rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be used to calculate the interplanar distances.

Alternatively, since the crystal is rhombohedral, we can convert the rhombohedral lattice to a hexagonal lattice for easier calculation, because sometimes the hexagonal coordinates are used for trigonal crystals. But maybe that complicates things. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral coordinates is similar to the cubic system but adjusted for the angles. Wait, in cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but that's only when all angles are 90 degrees. For rhombohedral, with angles 30 degrees, it's different.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the general triclinic formula, since rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic with a = b = c and α = β = γ. Let me check the triclinic formula for interplanar spacing.

The general formula for triclinic system is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S13 h l + 2 S23 k l ]

Where V is the volume of the unit cell, and Sij are the elements of the metric tensor. Hmm, this might be a bit involved, but since it's a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor can be simplified.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the metric tensor components would be:

Since a = b = c, and α = β = γ, the metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², and the off-diagonal elements are a² cosα.

So, G = [ [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1 / |G* (hkl)|^{1/2}

Wait, maybe. Let me recall that in crystallography, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the reciprocal lattice. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / |\vec{g}_{hkl}|

where \vec{g}_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

Where V is the volume of the unit cell, V = a1 · (a2 × a3)

In the rhombohedral system, the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3 all have length a, and the angles between any two vectors are α. So, the volume V can be calculated as:

V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = a³ (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)^{1/2}

Wait, let me compute the cross product first. Let's assume the vectors a1, a2, a3 are in 3D space. Let me define them as:

Let’s set a1 along the x-axis: a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 is in the xy-plane, making an angle α with a1. So, a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 has to make an angle α with both a1 and a2. So, the coordinates of a3 can be found by ensuring that the angle between a3 and a1 is α, and the angle between a3 and a2 is also α.

Let’s denote a3 = [c1, c2, c3]

Then, the dot product a1 · a3 = a² cosα = a c1 => c1 = a cosα

Similarly, a2 · a3 = a² cosα = a (cosα c1 + sinα c2)

Substituting c1 = a cosα:

a² cosα = a (cosα (a cosα) + sinα c2 )

Divide both sides by a:

a cosα = a cos²α + sinα c2

Then,

sinα c2 = a cosα - a cos²α = a cosα (1 - cosα)

Thus,

c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

Simplify:

cosα (1 - cosα) / sinα = [cosα - cos²α] / sinα

Hmm, maybe express in terms of sin. Let me recall that 1 - cosα = 2 sin²(α/2), and sinα = 2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2). So,

[cosα - cos²α] / sinα = cosα(1 - cosα)/sinα = cosα * 2 sin²(α/2) / [2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2)] ) = cosα * sin(α/2) / cos(α/2) = cosα tan(α/2)

But maybe this is complicating. Let's just keep it as c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

Now, the third component c3 can be found from the fact that the magnitude of a3 is a. So,

|c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = a²

So,

(a cosα)^2 + [ (a cosα (1 - cosα))/ sinα ]^2 + c3² = a²

Let me compute each term:

First term: a² cos²α

Second term: a² cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α

Third term: c3²

So,

a² cos²α + a² cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α + c3² = a²

Factor out a²:

a² [ cos²α + cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ] + c3² = a²

Let me compute the term in brackets:

cos²α [ 1 + (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ]

= cos²α [ (sin²α + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α ]

But sin²α = 1 - cos²α, so substitute:

= cos²α [ ( (1 - cos²α) + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α ) / sin²α ]

Simplify numerator:

1 - cos²α + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α = 2 - 2 cosα

Thus,

= cos²α [ (2 - 2 cosα) / sin²α ] = cos²α [ 2(1 - cosα) / (1 - cos²α) ]

Since sin²α = 1 - cos²α = (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα), so:

= cos²α [ 2(1 - cosα) / ( (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα) ) ) ] = cos²α [ 2 / (1 + cosα) ]

Therefore, the term in brackets is 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα)

So, going back:

a² [ 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ] + c3² = a²

Therefore,

c3² = a² - a² [ 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ] = a² [ 1 - 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ]

Simplify the expression inside:

1 = (1 + cosα)/(1 + cosα), so:

= a² [ (1 + cosα - 2 cos²α) / (1 + cosα) ]

Factor numera

I need to determine the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I have the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all angles α, β, γ equal to 30 degrees.

I should recall how to calculate interplanar distances in different crystal systems. For a rhombohedral crystal, which belongs to the trigonal system, I need a specific formula different from cubic or hexagonal systems.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is:
1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² + 2(hk)/(ab) cosγ + 2(hl)/(ac) cosβ + 2(kl)/(bc) cosα) / (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ)

For a rhombohedral lattice, all lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Å (assuming the interatomic distance equals the lattice parameter), and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

The formula for rhombohedral lattice can be simplified to:
1/d² = ((h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα)) / (a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

Alternatively, I could approach this using the general triclinic formula since rhombohedral is a special case with a = b = c and α = β = γ:
1/d² = (1/V²) [S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S13 h l + 2 S23 k l]

Where V is the unit cell volume, and Sij are the metric tensor elements. In a rhombohedral lattice, the metric tensor G would have diagonal elements of a² and off-diagonal elements of a² cosα:

G = [
  [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
  [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
  [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²]
]

I could also calculate the interplanar spacing using reciprocal lattice vectors:
d_{hkl} = 1 / |g_{hkl}|

Where g_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector for the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are:
b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

With V = a³ (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)^{1/2}

To find the primitive vectors, I could define:
a1 = a [1, 0, 0]
a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

For a3, I need to ensure it makes an angle α with both a1 and a2. If a3 = [c1, c2, c3], then:
c1 = a cosα
c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα
c3² = a² [1 - 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα)] = a² [(1 + cosα - 2 cos²α) / (1 + cosα)]

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The provided information includes the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Let me recall how interplanar distances are computed across various crystal systems.

I must remember that the interplanar distance, d, for a set of lattice planes (hkl) in a crystal lattice is calculated using a formula specific to the crystal system. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for d will differ from that used for, say, cubic or hexagonal systems.

Now, rhombohedral is part of the trigonal crystal system, right? Therefore, the formula for the trigonal system might be applicable here. However, I should verify the exact formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² + 2(hk)/(ab) cosγ + 2(hl)/(ac) cosβ + 2(kl)/(bc) cosα) / (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ)

But this looks complicated. Is there a simpler version for the rhombohedral system? Let me check.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all the lattice parameters a, b, and c are equal, and all angles α, β, and γ are equal. Therefore, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. Here, the interatomic distance is specified as 10 Angstroms. Is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Perhaps. In a rhombohedral lattice, all primitive vectors are of equal length, and the angles between them are equal. This suggests that the lattice parameter a is the length of each rhombohedron edge, and the angles between these edges are all α. Consequently, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, it should be equivalent to the lattice parameter a. Hence, a = 10 Å, and α = 30 degrees.

Given this information, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice can be simplified. Let me find the formula. Since the rhombohedral system can be seen as a specific case of the trigonal system, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = ( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) / (a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) )

I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider another approach. In the rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can also be used to compute interplanar distances.

Alternatively, considering the crystal is rhombohedral, it might be possible to convert the rhombohedral lattice into a hexagonal lattice for easier calculation. That might complicate matters, though. I need to consider this.

Alternatively, the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral coordinates might mirror the cubic system, but with adjustments for the angles. In cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but that's valid when all angles are 90 degrees. For a rhombohedral system with 30-degree angles, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the general triclinic formula would help, since rhombohedral can be considered a special case of triclinic with a = b = c and α = β = γ. Let me check the triclinic formula for interplanar spacing.

The general formula for a triclinic system is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S13 h l + 2 S23 k l ]

Here, V is the cell volume, and Sij are the metric tensor elements. This might be complex, but given that it's a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor can be simplified.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the metric tensor components would be:

Since a = b = c, and α = β = γ, the metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements as a² and off-diagonal elements as a² cosα.

So, G = [ [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
           [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} would be 1 / |G* (hkl)|^{1/2}

In crystallography, interplanar spacing can also be calculated using the reciprocal lattice. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / |\vec{g}_{hkl}|

where \vec{g}_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

Reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

Where V is the unit cell volume, defined as V = a1 · (a2 × a3).

In the rhombohedral system, the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3 all measure a, and the angles between any two vectors are α, allowing the volume V to be expressed as:

V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = a³ (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)^{1/2}

Let's compute the cross product first. Assuming the vectors a1, a2, a3 exist in 3D space, we define them as:

Let a1 align with the x-axis: a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 sits in the xy-plane, forming an angle α with a1, rendering a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

To ensure that angle α exists between a3 and both a1 and a2, the coordinates of a3 must accommodate:

Let a3 = [c1, c2, c3]

Then, under the dot product a1 · a3 = a² cosα = a c1 => c1 = a cosα

Similarly, a2 · a3 = a² cosα = a (cosα c1 + sinα c2)

Substituting c1 = a cosα:

a² cosα = a (cosα (a cosα) + sinα c2)

Dividing each term by a:

a cosα = a cos²α + sinα c2

Thus,

sinα c2 = a cosα - a cos²α = a cosα (1 - cosα)

Therefore,

c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

Simply:

cosα (1 - cosα) / sinα = [cosα - cos²α] / sinα

Rephrasing in terms of sin; recalling 1 - cosα = 2 sin²(α/2) and sinα = 2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2), we obtain:

[cosα - cos²α] / sinα = cosα(1 - cosα)/sinα = cosα * 2 sin²(α/2) / [2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2)] = cosα * sin(α/2) / cos(α/2) = cosα tan(α/2)

To avoid further complications, keep c2 as c2 = [a cosα (1 - cosα)] / sinα

The third component c3 is deduced because the magnitude of a3 equals a:

|c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = a²

So,

(a cosα)^2 + [ (a cosα (1 - cosα))/ sinα ]^2 + c3² = a²

Let’s calculate each part:

First term: a² cos²α

Second term: a² cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α

Third term: c3²

Compiling:

a² cos²α + a² cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α + c3² = a²

Extract a²:

a² [ cos²α + cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ] + c3² = a²

Analyzing inside brackets:

cos²α [ 1 + (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α)/ sin²α ]

= cos²α [ (sin²α + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) / sin²α ]

Using sin²α = 1 - cos²α, substitute:

= cos²α [ ( (1 - cos²α) + 1 - 2 cosα + cos²α ) / sin²α ]

Resume simplification:

1 - cos²α + 1 

Proceed similarly to the previous explanations, remembering the critical components and equations for calculating the interplanar distances. Adjust steps as needed, ensuring coherence with the rhombohedral properties and verify based on known crystallographic tools and equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume V.\n\nThe volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3 )\n\nFirst, compute a2 × a3. Let's write a2 and a3 in coordinates.\n\na2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0]\n\na3 = [a cosα, (a cosα (1 - cosα))/ sinα, c3 ]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a formula for the volume of a rhombohedron.\n\nYes, the volume V of a rhombohedron with edge length a and angles α between edges is:\n\nV = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )\n\nSo, if α = 30 degrees, then cosα = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3*(3/4) = 9/4 = 2.25\n\n(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ (3*1.732)/8 ≈ 5.196/8 ≈ 0.6495\n\nSo, 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299\n\nThus,\n\n1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nSo, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217\n\nBut let's compute it exactly:\n\n1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3\n\nFirst, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4\n\nSo, 1 - 3*(3/4) = 1 - 9/4 = -5/4\n\nThen, 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3)/8 = (3√3)/4 ≈ 1.299\n\nSo, total expression:\n\n-5/4 + (3√3)/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4 ≈ ( -5 + 5.196 ) /4 ≈ 0.196 /4 ≈ 0.049\n\nSo, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217\n\nBut maybe we can keep it symbolic:\n\nV = a³ sqrt( ( -5 + 3√3 ) /4 )\n\nBut perhaps not necessary. Let's note that V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )\n\nNow, going back to the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3 are given by:\n\nb1 = (a2 × a3) / V\n\nSimilarly for b2 and b3.\n\nBut since all vectors and angles are symmetric, the reciprocal lattice vectors will also form a rhombohedral lattice with some parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector |g_{hkl}| is given by:\n\n|g_{hkl}| = sqrt( h² |b1|² + k² |b2|² + l² |b3|² + 2 hk b1·b2 + 2 hl b1·b3 + 2 kl b2·b3 )\n\nBut in the rhombohedral system, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = b, and the angles between reciprocal lattice vectors are equal, say α'. The dot product between b1 and b2 is b² cosα'\n\nBut I need to relate the reciprocal lattice parameters to the direct lattice parameters.\n\nIn general, for any lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy:\n\nb1 · a1 = 2π, b1 · a2 = 0, b1 · a3 = 0\n\nSimilarly for b2 and b3.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe there's a formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.\n\nAfter some research in my mind, I recall that in the rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( A h² + B k² + C l² + D hk + E hl + F kl )\n\nWhere A, B, C, D, E, F are coefficients depending on the angle α.\n\nAlternatively, since all the axes are equivalent, the formula should be symmetric in h, k, l. So, A = B = C, and D = E = F.\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( A (h² + k² + l²) + D (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nNow, to find A and D in terms of α.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula from the metric tensor.\n\nGiven that the direct metric tensor G is:\n\nG = [ [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],\n        [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],\n        [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²] ]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} has elements:\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, the inverse can be calculated, but it's a bit tedious. Let me denote G as:\n\n[ A, B, B;\n  B, A, B;\n  B, B, A ]\n\nWhere A = a², B = a² cosα.\n\nThe inverse of such a matrix can be found using the formula for inversion of a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements A and off-diagonal B.\n\nThe inverse matrix G^{-1} will have diagonal elements C and off-diagonal D, where:\n\nC = (A + B)/[ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]\n\nD = -B / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nThe inverse of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal entries x and off-diagonal y is given by:\n\nIf M = [x y y; y x y; y y x], then M^{-1} = [ (x + y) / det_factor , -y / det_factor , -y / det_factor ; ... ] where det_factor = (x - y)^2 (x + 2y)\n\nBut let me compute the determinant first. The determinant of M is (x - y)^2 (x + 2y)\n\nThen, the inverse can be written as:\n\n1/(det_factor) * [ (x + y)  -y  -y;\n                   -y  (x + y)  -y;\n                   -y  -y  (x + y) ]\n\nSo, in our case, x = A = a², y = B = a² cosα\n\nTherefore, det_factor = (A - B)^2 (A + 2B) = (a² - a² cosα)^2 (a² + 2 a² cosα ) = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα )\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} has diagonal elements:\n\nC = (A + B)/det_factor = (a² + a² cosα) / [ a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ] = a² (1 + cosα ) / [ a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ] = (1 + cosα ) / [ a^4 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. The inverse matrix entries are:\n\nEach diagonal entry is (x + y)/det_factor, but actually, the inverse matrix is (1/det_factor) times the matrix of cofactors. Wait, perhaps my previous assertion is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 symmetric matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute G^{-1} for our specific case.\n\nGiven G = a² [ [1, cosα, cosα]; [cosα, 1, cosα]; [cosα, cosα, 1] ]\n\nLet me denote this as G = a² M, where M is the matrix with 1 on the diagonal and cosα off-diagonal.\n\nThen, G^{-1} = (1/a²) M^{-1}\n\nSo, if I can compute M^{-1}, then G^{-1} is (1/a²) M^{-1}\n\nSo, let's compute M^{-1}\n\nThe matrix M is:\n\n[1      c      c\n\nc      1      c\n\nc      c      1]\n\nwhere c = cosα\n\nThe inverse of M can be found using the formula for a matrix with diagonal entries 1 and off-diagonal entries c. The inverse will have diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries e.\n\nAssume M^{-1} = [d e e; e d e; e e d]\n\nThen, M * M^{-1} = I\n\nSo, computing the first row of M * M^{-1}:\n\n1*d + c*e + c*e = d + 2 c e = 1 (for diagonal)\n\n1*e + c*d + c*e = e + c d + c e = 0 (for off-diagonal)\n\nSimilarly, other rows will give the same equations.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) d + 2 c e = 1\n\n2) e + c d + c e = 0\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\ne (1 + c) + c d = 0\n\nFrom equation 1: d = 1 - 2 c e\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\ne (1 + c) + c (1 - 2 c e ) = 0\n\nExpand:\n\ne (1 + c) + c - 2 c² e = 0\n\nCollect terms with e:\n\ne [ (1 + c) - 2 c² ] + c = 0\n\nSolve for e:\n\ne = -c / [ (1 + c) - 2 c² ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(1 + c) - 2 c² = 1 + c - 2 c²\n\nLet me factor this expression:\n\n1 + c - 2 c² = -2 c² + c +1\n\nThis is a quadratic in c: -2 c² + c +1. Let's factor it:\n\n-2 c² + c +1 = - (2 c² - c -1 ) = - (2 c +1)(c -1 )\n\nTherefore,\n\ne = -c / [ - (2 c +1)(c -1 ) ] = c / [ (2 c +1)(c -1 ) ]\n\nNote that (c -1 ) = - (1 - c )\n\nSo,\n\ne = c / [ (2 c +1)( - (1 - c ) ) ] = - c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nTherefore, e = - c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nNow, from equation 1, d =1 - 2 c e\n\nSubstitute e:\n\nd =1 - 2 c [ - c / ( (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) ] =1 + 2 c² / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nSo, d = [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) + 2 c² ] / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nExpand numerator:\n\n(2 c +1)(1 - c ) + 2 c² = (2 c (1 - c ) +1 (1 - c )) + 2 c² = (2 c - 2 c² +1 - c ) + 2 c² = (c - 2 c² +1 ) + 2 c² = c +1\n\nTherefore, d = (c +1 ) / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nThus, the inverse matrix M^{-1} has diagonal entries d = (1 + c ) / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ] and off-diagonal entries e = -c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} = (1/a²) M^{-1} has elements:\n\nDiagonal elements: (1 + c ) / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nOff-diagonal elements: -c / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nNow, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:\n\n1/d² = [ h² G^{11} + k² G^{22} + l² G^{33} + 2 hk G^{12} + 2 hl G^{13} + 2 kl G^{23} ]\n\nSince G^{11} = G^{22} = G^{33} = d = (1 + c ) / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nAnd G^{12} = G^{13} = G^{23} = e = -c / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l² ) * (1 + c ) / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) * ( -c ) / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) ]\n\nFactor out 1 / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ):\n\n1/d² = [ (1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl ) ] / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) )\n\nTherefore,\n\nd_{hkl} = a sqrt [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) / ( (1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl ) ) ]\n\nThis is the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's check for the case when α = 90°, which should reduce to the cubic system. If α = 90°, then c = cosα = 0. Then,\n\nd_{hkl} = a sqrt [ (0 +1)(1 - 0 ) / ( (1 + 0 )(h² + k² + l² ) - 0 ) ] = a sqrt [ 1 / (h² + k² + l² ) ] = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² )\n\nWhich matches the cubic formula. Good.\n\nNow, plug in the given values. The problem states α = 30°, so c = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. The interatomic distance is a = 10 Å. The plane is (111), so h =1, k=1, l=1.\n\nCompute numerator inside the sqrt: (2 c +1)(1 - c )\n\nFirst, 2 c +1 = 2*(√3/2) +1 = √3 +1 ≈1.732 +1 =2.732\n\n1 - c =1 - √3/2 ≈1 -0.866=0.134\n\nMultiply them: (√3 +1)(1 - √3/2 )\n\nLet me compute symbolically:\n\n(√3 +1)(1 - √3/2 ) = √3*(1) - √3*(√3)/2 +1*(1) -1*(√3)/2 = √3 - 3/2 +1 - √3/2 = (√3 - √3/2 ) + (-3/2 +1 ) = (√3/2 ) + (-1/2 ) = (√3 -1 ) / 2\n\nSo, (2 c +1)(1 - c ) = (√3 -1 ) / 2\n\nNow, the denominator inside the sqrt is:\n\n(1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl )\n\nGiven h =k =l =1,\n\nh² +k² +l² =3\n\nhk + hl + kl =3\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + c )*3 - 2 c *3 =3(1 + c - 2 c )=3(1 -c )\n\nTherefore, denominator inside sqrt is 3(1 -c )\n\nThus,\n\nd_{hkl} = a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 ) / 2 ) / (3(1 -c ) ) ]\n\nBut 1 -c =1 - √3/2, so:\n\n= a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 ) / 2 ) / (3(1 - √3/2 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n3(1 - √3/2 ) =3 - (3√3)/2\n\nBut let's rationalize the expression:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n= a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / ( 2 * 3(1 - √3/2 ) ) ] = a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / (6(1 - √3/2 ) ) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n= a sqrt [ 2(√3 -1 ) / (6(2 - √3 ) ) ] = a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / (3(2 - √3 ) ) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √3 ) to rationalize the denominator:\n\n= a sqrt [ (√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) / (3( (2 - √3 )(2 + √3 ) ) ) ]\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(2 - √3 )(2 + √3 ) =4 -3=1\n\nSo,\n\n= a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) ) / 3 ]\n\nMultiply out the numerator:\n\n(√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) =2√3 + (√3 )^2 -2 -√3 =2√3 +3 -2 -√3 = (2√3 -√3 ) + (3 -2 )=√3 +1\n\nThus,\n\n= a sqrt [ (√3 +1 ) / 3 ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nd_{111} = a sqrt( (√3 +1 ) / 3 )\n\nNow, plug in a =10 Å:\n\nd_{111} =10 Å * sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 )\n\nCompute the numerical value:\n\nFirst, compute (√3 +1 ) /3 ≈ (1.732 +1 ) /3 ≈2.732 /3 ≈0.9107\n\nsqrt(0.9107 ) ≈0.954\n\nTherefore,\n\nd_{111} ≈10 *0.954 ≈9.54 Å\n\nBut let me compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, √3 ≈1.73205\n\n√3 +1 ≈2.73205\n\nDivide by3: ≈0.910683\n\nsqrt(0.910683 ) ≈0.954257\n\nMultiply by10: ≈9.54257 Å\n\nSo approximately 9.54 Å.\n\nBut let's check if the symbolic expression can be simplified further.\n\nWe had:\n\nd_{111} = a sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 )\n\nAlternatively, note that (√3 +1 ) /3 = (2 + √3 ) / (3*(√3 -1 )) * (√3 -1 )\n\nWait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that (√3 +1 ) /3 = 2*( (√3 +1 ) /6 ) = 2*sin(75°)/3 ?\n\nWait, sin(75°)=sin(45°+30°)= (√2/2)(√3/2 +1/2 )= (√6 +√2)/4 ≈0.9659\n\nBut (√3 +1 ) /3 ≈(1.732 +1)/3≈0.9107, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps leave it in exact form.\n\nBut the problem asks for the interplanar distance.

Wait a second. Wait, the numerator is (2c +1)(1 -c ), denominator is 3(1 -c ), so (1 -c ) cancels out, leaving (2c +1)/3. Therefore,\n\nd_{111}=a sqrt( (2c +1)/3 )\n\nWait, this is a much simpler expression!

To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. 

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the lattice parameters**: The interatomic distance (edge length of the rhombohedron) is given as \( a = 10 \) Å, and the angles between the edges are \( \alpha = 30^\circ \).

2. **Formula for interplanar distance**: For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane is given by:
   \[
   d_{111} = a \sqrt{\frac{2 \cos \alpha + 1}{3}}
   \]

3. **Substitute the given values**:
   - \( a = 10 \) Å
   - \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

4. **Calculate the expression**:
   \[
   d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 1}{3}} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{3}}
   \]

Thus, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in the given rhombohedral crystal is:

\[
\boxed{10 \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{3}} \text{ Å}}
\]

otr:

1 + cosα - 2 cos²α = -2 cos²α + cosα + 1

Let me factor this quadratic in cosα:

-2 cos²α + cosα + 1 = - (2 cos²α - cosα - 1) = - (2 cosα + 1)(cosα - 1)

Wait, let me check:

2 cos²α - cosα -1 factors as (2 cosα + 1)(cosα - 1). Let's verify:

(2 cosα + 1)(cosα - 1) = 2 cos²α - 2 cosα + cosα -1 = 2 cos²α - cosα -1. Yes, correct.

So,

- (2 cosα + 1)(cosα - 1) = ( -2 cosα -1 )(cosα -1 ) ?

Wait, no, the negative sign applies to the entire product:

- (2 cosα + 1)(cosα - 1) = (-1)(2 cosα +1)(cosα -1 )

But perhaps it's better to write:

1 + cosα - 2 cos²α = -2 cos²α + cosα +1

Let me write it as quadratic in cosα: -2 (cosα)^2 + cosα +1

Let me compute discriminant: b² -4ac = 1 +8=9

Roots: [ -1 ± 3 ] / (2*(-2)) = (-1 +3)/(-4)=2/-4=-0.5, and (-1 -3)/(-4)= -4/-4=1

So, factors: -2 (cosα + 0.5)(cosα -1 )

But maybe not necessary. Anyway, proceeding:

c3² = a² [ - (2 cosα +1)(cosα -1 ) / (1 + cosα) ]

Note that (cosα -1 ) = - (1 - cosα )

So,

c3² = a² [ - (2 cosα +1)( - (1 - cosα )) / (1 + cosα) ) ] = a² [ (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα ) / (1 + cosα) )

Simplify (1 - cosα)/(1 + cosα) = [ (1 - cosα)^2 / (1 - cos²α) ] = [ (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α ]

But maybe not helpful. Let's just keep it as:

c3² = a² (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα ) / (1 + cosα )

So,

c3 = a sqrt [ (2 cosα +1)(1 - cosα ) / (1 + cosα ) ]

This is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume V.

The volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3 )

First, compute a2 × a3. Let's write a2 and a3 in coordinates.

a2 = [a cosα, a sinα, 0]

a3 = [a cosα, (a cosα (1 - cosα))/ sinα, c3 ]

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a formula for the volume of a rhombohedron.

Yes, the volume V of a rhombohedron with edge length a and angles α between edges is:

V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

So, if α = 30 degrees, then cosα = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Wait, let's compute step by step:

First, cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

So,

1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(3/4) = 9/4 = 2.25

(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ (3*1.732)/8 ≈ 5.196/8 ≈ 0.6495

So, 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299

Thus,

1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

So, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217

But let's compute it exactly:

1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3

First, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4

So, 1 - 3*(3/4) = 1 - 9/4 = -5/4

Then, 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3)/8 = (3√3)/4 ≈ 1.299

So, total expression:

-5/4 + (3√3)/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4 ≈ ( -5 + 5.196 ) /4 ≈ 0.196 /4 ≈ 0.049

So, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217

But maybe we can keep it symbolic:

V = a³ sqrt( ( -5 + 3√3 ) /4 )

But perhaps not necessary. Let's note that V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

Now, going back to the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3 are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V

Similarly for b2 and b3.

But since all vectors and angles are symmetric, the reciprocal lattice vectors will also form a rhombohedral lattice with some parameters.

Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector |g_{hkl}| is given by:

|g_{hkl}| = sqrt( h² |b1|² + k² |b2|² + l² |b3|² + 2 hk b1·b2 + 2 hl b1·b3 + 2 kl b2·b3 )

But in the rhombohedral system, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = b, and the angles between reciprocal lattice vectors are equal, say α'. The dot product between b1 and b2 is b² cosα'

But I need to relate the reciprocal lattice parameters to the direct lattice parameters.

In general, for any lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy:

b1 · a1 = 2π, b1 · a2 = 0, b1 · a3 = 0

Similarly for b2 and b3.

But given the complexity, maybe there's a formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

After some research in my mind, I recall that in the rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( A h² + B k² + C l² + D hk + E hl + F kl )

Where A, B, C, D, E, F are coefficients depending on the angle α.

Alternatively, since all the axes are equivalent, the formula should be symmetric in h, k, l. So, A = B = C, and D = E = F.

Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( A (h² + k² + l²) + D (hk + hl + kl) )

Now, to find A and D in terms of α.

Alternatively, using the general formula from the metric tensor.

Given that the direct metric tensor G is:

G = [ [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
        [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
        [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²] ]

The reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} has elements:

For a 3x3 matrix, the inverse can be calculated, but it's a bit tedious. Let me denote G as:

[ A, B, B;
  B, A, B;
  B, B, A ]

Where A = a², B = a² cosα.

The inverse of such a matrix can be found using the formula for inversion of a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements A and off-diagonal B.

The inverse matrix G^{-1} will have diagonal elements C and off-diagonal D, where:

C = (A + B)/[ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

D = -B / [ (A - B)(A + 2B) ]

Wait, let me verify.

The inverse of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal entries x and off-diagonal y is given by:

If M = [x y y; y x y; y y x], then M^{-1} = [ (x + y) / det_factor , -y / det_factor , -y / det_factor ; ... ] where det_factor = (x - y)^2 (x + 2y)

But let me compute the determinant first. The determinant of M is (x - y)^2 (x + 2y)

Then, the inverse can be written as:

1/(det_factor) * [ (x + y)  -y  -y;
                   -y  (x + y)  -y;
                   -y  -y  (x + y) ]

So, in our case, x = A = a², y = B = a² cosα

Therefore, det_factor = (A - B)^2 (A + 2B) = (a² - a² cosα)^2 (a² + 2 a² cosα ) = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα )

Therefore, the reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} has diagonal elements:

C = (A + B)/det_factor = (a² + a² cosα) / [ a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ] = a² (1 + cosα ) / [ a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ] = (1 + cosα ) / [ a^4 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα ) ]

Wait, no, wait. The inverse matrix entries are:

Each diagonal entry is (x + y)/det_factor, but actually, the inverse matrix is (1/det_factor) times the matrix of cofactors. Wait, perhaps my previous assertion is incorrect.

Alternatively, let's use the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 symmetric matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute G^{-1} for our specific case.

Given G = a² [ [1, cosα, cosα]; [cosα, 1, cosα]; [cosα, cosα, 1] ]

Let me denote this as G = a² M, where M is the matrix with 1 on the diagonal and cosα off-diagonal.

Then, G^{-1} = (1/a²) M^{-1}

So, if I can compute M^{-1}, then G^{-1} is (1/a²) M^{-1}

So, let's compute M^{-1}

The matrix M is:

[1      c      c

c      1      c

c      c      1]

where c = cosα

The inverse of M can be found using the formula for a matrix with diagonal entries 1 and off-diagonal entries c. The inverse will have diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries e.

Assume M^{-1} = [d e e; e d e; e e d]

Then, M * M^{-1} = I

So, computing the first row of M * M^{-1}:

1*d + c*e + c*e = d + 2 c e = 1 (for diagonal)

1*e + c*d + c*e = e + c d + c e = 0 (for off-diagonal)

Similarly, other rows will give the same equations.

So, we have two equations:

1) d + 2 c e = 1

2) e + c d + c e = 0

Let me write equation 2 as:

e (1 + c) + c d = 0

From equation 1: d = 1 - 2 c e

Substitute into equation 2:

e (1 + c) + c (1 - 2 c e ) = 0

Expand:

e (1 + c) + c - 2 c² e = 0

Collect terms with e:

e [ (1 + c) - 2 c² ] + c = 0

Solve for e:

e = -c / [ (1 + c) - 2 c² ]

Simplify denominator:

(1 + c) - 2 c² = 1 + c - 2 c²

Let me factor this expression:

1 + c - 2 c² = -2 c² + c +1

This is a quadratic in c: -2 c² + c +1. Let's factor it:

-2 c² + c +1 = - (2 c² - c -1 ) = - (2 c +1)(c -1 )

Therefore,

e = -c / [ - (2 c +1)(c -1 ) ] = c / [ (2 c +1)(c -1 ) ]

Note that (c -1 ) = - (1 - c )

So,

e = c / [ (2 c +1)( - (1 - c ) ) ] = - c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Therefore, e = - c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Now, from equation 1, d =1 - 2 c e

Substitute e:

d =1 - 2 c [ - c / ( (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) ] =1 + 2 c² / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

So, d = [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) + 2 c² ] / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Expand numerator:

(2 c +1)(1 - c ) + 2 c² = (2 c (1 - c ) +1 (1 - c )) + 2 c² = (2 c - 2 c² +1 - c ) + 2 c² = (c - 2 c² +1 ) + 2 c² = c +1

Therefore, d = (c +1 ) / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Thus, the inverse matrix M^{-1} has diagonal entries d = (1 + c ) / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ] and off-diagonal entries e = -c / [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Therefore, the reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} = (1/a²) M^{-1} has elements:

Diagonal elements: (1 + c ) / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Off-diagonal elements: -c / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Now, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

1/d² = [ h² G^{11} + k² G^{22} + l² G^{33} + 2 hk G^{12} + 2 hl G^{13} + 2 kl G^{23} ]

Since G^{11} = G^{22} = G^{33} = d = (1 + c ) / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

And G^{12} = G^{13} = G^{23} = e = -c / [ a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ]

Therefore,

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l² ) * (1 + c ) / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) * ( -c ) / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ) ]

Factor out 1 / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) ):

1/d² = [ (1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl ) ] / ( a² (2 c +1)(1 - c ) )

Therefore,

d_{hkl} = a sqrt [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) / ( (1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl ) ) ]

This is the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's check for the case when α = 90°, which should reduce to the cubic system. If α = 90°, then c = cosα = 0. Then,

d_{hkl} = a sqrt [ (0 +1)(1 - 0 ) / ( (1 + 0 )(h² + k² + l² ) - 0 ) ] = a sqrt [ 1 / (h² + k² + l² ) ] = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² )

Which matches the cubic formula. Good.

Now, plug in the given values. The problem states α = 30°, so c = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. The interatomic distance is a = 10 Å. The plane is (111), so h =1, k=1, l=1.

Compute numerator inside the sqrt: (2 c +1)(1 - c )

First, 2 c +1 = 2*(√3/2) +1 = √3 +1 ≈1.732 +1 =2.732

1 - c =1 - √3/2 ≈1 -0.866=0.134

Multiply them: (√3 +1)(1 - √3/2 )

Let me compute symbolically:

(√3 +1)(1 - √3/2 ) = √3*(1) - √3*(√3)/2 +1*(1) -1*(√3)/2 = √3 - 3/2 +1 - √3/2 = (√3 - √3/2 ) + (-3/2 +1 ) = (√3/2 ) + (-1/2 ) = (√3 -1 ) / 2

So, (2 c +1)(1 - c ) = (√3 -1 ) / 2

Now, the denominator inside the sqrt is:

(1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl )

Given h =k =l =1,

h² +k² +l² =3

hk + hl + kl =3

So,

(1 + c )*3 - 2 c *3 =3(1 + c - 2 c )=3(1 -c )

Therefore, denominator inside sqrt is 3(1 -c )

Thus,

d_{hkl} = a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 ) / 2 ) / (3(1 -c ) ) ]

But 1 -c =1 - √3/2, so:

= a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 ) / 2 ) / (3(1 - √3/2 ) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

3(1 - √3/2 ) =3 - (3√3)/2

But let's rationalize the expression:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:

= a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / ( 2 * 3(1 - √3/2 ) ) ] = a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / (6(1 - √3/2 ) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:

= a sqrt [ 2(√3 -1 ) / (6(2 - √3 ) ) ] = a sqrt [ (√3 -1 ) / (3(2 - √3 ) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √3 ) to rationalize the denominator:

= a sqrt [ (√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) / (3( (2 - √3 )(2 + √3 ) ) ) ]

Compute denominator:

(2 - √3 )(2 + √3 ) =4 -3=1

So,

= a sqrt [ ( (√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) ) / 3 ]

Multiply out the numerator:

(√3 -1 )(2 + √3 ) =2√3 + (√3 )^2 -2 -√3 =2√3 +3 -2 -√3 = (2√3 -√3 ) + (3 -2 )=√3 +1

Thus,

= a sqrt [ (√3 +1 ) / 3 ]

Therefore,

d_{111} = a sqrt( (√3 +1 ) / 3 )

Now, plug in a =10 Å:

d_{111} =10 Å * sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 )

Compute the numerical value:

First, compute (√3 +1 ) /3 ≈ (1.732 +1 ) /3 ≈2.732 /3 ≈0.9107

sqrt(0.9107 ) ≈0.954

Therefore,

d_{111} ≈10 *0.954 ≈9.54 Å

But let me compute it more accurately.

First, √3 ≈1.73205

√3 +1 ≈2.73205

Divide by3: ≈0.910683

sqrt(0.910683 ) ≈0.954257

Multiply by10: ≈9.54257 Å

So approximately 9.54 Å.

But let's check if the symbolic expression can be simplified further.

We had:

d_{111} = a sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 )

Alternatively, note that (√3 +1 ) /3 = (2 + √3 ) / (3*(√3 -1 )) * (√3 -1 )

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, rationalize:

sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) = sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) = sqrt( ( (√3 +1 ) /2 ) * (2/3) )

But perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, note that (√3 +1 ) /3 = 2*( (√3 +1 ) /6 ) = 2*sin(75°)/3 ?

Wait, sin(75°)=sin(45°+30°)= (√2/2)(√3/2 +1/2 )= (√6 +√2)/4 ≈0.9659

But (√3 +1 ) /3 ≈(1.732 +1)/3≈0.9107, which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps leave it in exact form.

But the problem asks for the interplanar distance. The answer can be presented as 10 * sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) Angstroms, or approximately 9.54 Å.

But let me verify the steps once again to ensure no miscalculations.

We started with the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, derived the expression:

d_{hkl} = a sqrt [ (2 c +1)(1 - c ) / ( (1 + c )(h² + k² + l² ) - 2 c (hk + hl + kl ) ) ]

For the (111) plane, h=k=l=1, so:

Numerator inside sqrt: (2c +1)(1 -c )

Denominator inside sqrt: (1 +c )*3 -2c *3 =3(1 +c -2c )=3(1 -c )

Thus,

d_{111}=a sqrt [ (2c +1)(1 -c ) / (3(1 -c )) ] =a sqrt [ (2c +1)/3 ]

Wait, wait! Wait a second. Wait, the numerator is (2c +1)(1 -c ), denominator is 3(1 -c ), so (1 -c ) cancels out, leaving (2c +1)/3. Therefore,

d_{111}=a sqrt( (2c +1)/3 )

Wait, this is a much simpler expression! How did I not see this earlier?

So, after simplifying, the (1 -c ) terms cancel, so:

d_{hkl}=a sqrt( (2c +1)/3 )

But wait, let's verify:

Original expression:

d_{hkl}=a sqrt [ (2c +1)(1 -c ) / (3(1 -c )) ] =a sqrt [ (2c +1)/3 ]

Yes, because (1 -c ) cancels out. Therefore, the interplanar distance for (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{111}=a sqrt( (2 cosα +1)/3 )

Wow, that's a much simpler formula! So, I must have made a miscalculation earlier when expanding the terms. Let me check again.

Given:

1/d² = [ (1 + c )(h² +k² +l² ) -2c (hk +hl +kl ) ] / [ a² (2c +1)(1 -c ) ]

For (111):

1/d² = [ (1 +c )*3 -2c *3 ] / [ a² (2c +1)(1 -c ) ] = [3(1 +c -2c ) ] / [ a² (2c +1)(1 -c ) ] = [3(1 -c ) ] / [ a² (2c +1)(1 -c ) ] =3 / [ a² (2c +1 ) ]

Therefore, 1/d²=3/(a² (2c +1 )) => d= a sqrt( (2c +1)/3 )

Yes, that's correct. So, the previous more complicated approach had an error in the derivation, but simplifying correctly, we get a much simpler formula.

Therefore, the correct formula is:

d_{111}=a sqrt( (2 cosα +1)/3 )

Given that, plug in a=10 Å, α=30°, cosα=√3/2:

d=10 * sqrt( (2*(√3/2 ) +1 ) /3 )=10*sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 )

Which is the same as before. So, the answer is 10*sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) Å ≈9.54 Å.

But let me compute sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) more accurately.

First, compute √3 ≈1.73205

√3 +1 ≈2.73205

Divide by3:≈0.910683

Square root: sqrt(0.910683 )≈0.95425

Multiply by10:≈9.5425 Å

So approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the required precision, maybe round to two decimal places: 9.54 Å, or even one decimal:9.5 Å. But since the original interatomic distance is given as 10 Å, which is precise, and angles as 30°, which is exact, perhaps we can present the exact value as 10*sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) Å, or rationalize it further.

Alternatively, rationalize the expression sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ). Let me see:

Multiply numerator and denominator inside the sqrt by sqrt(3):

sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) = sqrt( ( (√3 +1 ) / sqrt(3) ) / sqrt(3) )

Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, note that:

(√3 +1 ) /3 = (2 + 2√3 ) /6 = (1 + √3 )^2 / (6 )

Wait, (1 +√3 )^2 =1 +2√3 +3=4 +2√3, which is not 2 +2√3. So, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of trigonometric identities. Let me think.

Let’s set θ = 15°, then tanθ =2 -√3, but not sure. Alternatively, note that cos(15°)= (√6 +√2)/4 ≈0.9659, but not directly helpful.

Alternatively, accept that the exact form is 10*sqrt( (√3 +1 ) /3 ) Angstroms, which is approximately9.54 Å.

Therefore, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane is approximately9.54 Angstroms.

**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{10 \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{3}} \text{ Å}}.

Let me check if there\'s a standard formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombohedral system can be converted to a hexagonal system for easier calculation. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal axes might help. The hexagonal unit cell has a and c parameters related to the rhombohedral a and α.\n\nBut perhaps I should stick to the direct formula. Let me try using the triclinic formula with a = b = c and α = β = γ.\n\nThe volume V of the unit cell is given by:\nV = a³ √(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)\n\nFor α = 30°, let\'s compute that:\ncos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\nV = 10³ √(1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3)\nFirst compute inside the square root:\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.8660)^3\nWait, (0.8660)^2 = 0.75, so 3*(0.75) = 2.25\n(0.8660)^3 ≈ 0.6495\nSo 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299\nSo inside the sqrt: 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\nThus, V ≈ 1000 * √0.049 ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³\n\nNow, the metric tensor Sij for triclinic system is:\n\nS11 = (b² c² sin²α) / V²\nWait, maybe I need to compute the reciprocal metric tensor. Alternatively, use the formula for 1/d² in terms of hkl and the metric tensor.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula from the International Tables for Crystallography. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) / (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]\n\nSo plugging in h = 1, k = 1, l = 1, α = 30°, a = 10 Å.\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n(1 + 1 + 1) sin²30° + 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*(cos²30° - cos30°)\n= 3*(0.25) + 2*3*( (0.75) - 0.8660 )\n= 0.75 + 6*( -0.1160 )\n= 0.75 - 0.696\n= 0.054\n\nDenominator:\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.8660)^3\n= 1 - 2.25 + 2*(0.6495)\n= -1.25 + 1.299\n= 0.049\n\nSo 0.054 / 0.049 ≈ 1.102\n\nThen d = 10 / √(1.102) ≈ 10 / 1.049 ≈ 9.53 Å\n\nWait, but this seems a bit high. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted numerator and denominator. Let me check.\n\nOriginal formula from the interplanar distance for rhombohedral:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]\n\nTherefore, d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 0.049 (from previous calculation)\nDenominator inside sqrt: 0.054 (from previous calculation)\n\nSo d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.9074) ≈ 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å\n\nSo approximately 9.53 Å. But let me check if the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: using reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nFor a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated. The reciprocal lattice parameters a*, b*, c* and angles α*, β*, γ* can be found.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s easier to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\nb1 = (a2 × a3) / V\nb2 = (a3 × a1) / V\nb3 = (a1 × a2) / V\n\nAssuming the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3 have magnitude a = 10 Å, and angles between them α = 30°.\n\nLet me define the vectors:\n\nLet’s choose a1 along the x-axis: a1 = a [1, 0, 0]\n\na2 is in the xy-plane, making an angle α with a1. So a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]\n\na3 has components such that the angle between a3 and a1 is α, and the angle between a3 and a2 is also α. Let\'s find a3.\n\nLet a3 = [c1, c2, c3]\n\nThe dot product a1 · a3 = a^2 cosα = a * c1 => c1 = a cosα\n\nSimilarly, a2 · a3 = a^2 cosα = (a cosα)(c1) + (a sinα)(c2) + 0*c3\n\nBut since c1 = a cosα, substituting:\n\na^2 cosα = a cosα * a cosα + a sinα * c2\n\n=> a^2 cosα = a² cos²α + a sinα c2\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\na cosα = a cos²α + sinα c2\n\n=> c2 = (a cosα - a cos²α) / sinα = a cosα (1 - cosα) / sinα\n\nSimilarly, the magnitude of a3 is a, so:\n\nc1² + c2² + c3² = a²\n\nSubstituting c1 and c2:\n\n(a cosα)^2 + [a cosα (1 - cosα)/sinα]^2 + c3² = a²\n\nDivide both sides by a²:\n\ncos²α + [cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α] + (c3/a)^2 = 1\n\nLet’s compute the second term:\n\n[cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / sin²α\n\n= [cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / (1 - cos²α)\n\n= [cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)]\n\n= [cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 ] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)]\n\n= [cos²α (1 - cosα) ] / (1 + cosα)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\ncos²α + [cos²α (1 - cosα) / (1 + cosα) ] + (c3/a)^2 = 1\n\nFactor out cos²α:\n\ncos²α [1 + (1 - cosα)/(1 + cosα) ] + (c3/a)^2 = 1\n\nCompute the term in brackets:\n\n1 + (1 - cosα)/(1 + cosα) = [ (1 + cosα) + (1 - cosα) ] / (1 + cosα) = 2 / (1 + cosα)\n\nSo:\n\ncos²α * 2 / (1 + cosα) + (c3/a)^2 = 1\n\nThus,\n\n(c3/a)^2 = 1 - [2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ]\n\n= [ (1 + cosα) - 2 cos²α ] / (1 + cosα )\n\n= [1 + cosα - 2 cos²α ] / (1 + cosα )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nLet’s write it as 1 + cosα - 2 cos²α = -2 cos²α + cosα + 1\n\nThis is a quadratic in cosα: -2x² + x + 1, where x = cosα\n\nDiscriminant: 1 + 8 = 9\n\nRoots: [ -1 ± 3 ] / (-4) => (2)/-4 = -0.5 and (-4)/-4 = 1\n\nSo factors: -2x² + x + 1 = -(2x² - x -1) = -(2x +1)(x -1)\n\nBut let me check:\n\n(2x +1)(x -1) = 2x² -2x + x -1 = 2x² -x -1, so yes.\n\nThus,\n\n-2x² + x +1 = - (2x² -x -1) = - (2x +1)(x -1)\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: - (2 cosα +1)(cosα -1) = (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1)\n\nTherefore,\n\n(c3/a)^2 = [ (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1) ] / (1 + cosα )\n\nSo,\n\nc3 = a sqrt[ (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1) / (1 + cosα) ]\n\nFor α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute inside sqrt:\n\n(1 - √3/2)(2*(√3/2) +1) / (1 + √3/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: (1 - √3/2) = (2 - √3)/2\n\nSecond term: (√3 +1)\n\nDenominator: (2 + √3)/2\n\nSo overall:\n\n[ (2 - √3)/2 * (√3 +1) ] / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = [ (2 - √3)(√3 +1) ] / (2 + √3)\n\nMultiply numerator:\n\n(2)(√3) + 2(1) - √3(√3) - √3(1) = 2√3 + 2 - 3 - √3 = (2√3 - √3) + (2 -3) = √3 -1\n\nSo numerator: √3 -1\n\nDenominator: 2 + √3\n\nThus,\n\n(√3 -1)/(2 + √3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\n( (√3 -1)(2 - √3) ) / ( (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ) = (2√3 -3 -2 + √3 ) / (4 -3) = (3√3 -5)/1 = 3√3 -5 ≈ 3*1.732 -5 ≈ 5.196 -5 ≈ 0.196\n\nTherefore,\n\nc3 = a * sqrt(0.196) ≈ 10 * 0.443 ≈ 4.43 Å\n\nSo the components of a3 are:\n\nc1 = a cosα ≈ 10 * 0.866 ≈ 8.66 Å\n\nc2 = a cosα (1 - cosα)/sinα ≈ 10 * 0.866 * (1 -0.866)/0.5 ≈ 10 * 0.866 * 0.134 /0.5 ≈ 10 * 0.866 * 0.268 ≈ 10 * 0.232 ≈ 2.32 Å\n\nc3 ≈ 4.43 Å\n\nSo a3 ≈ [8.66, 2.32, 4.43] Å\n\nNow, compute the volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3)\n\nFirst compute a2 × a3:\n\na2 = [8.66, 5, 0] (Wait, wait, a2 was defined as a [cosα, sinα, 0] = 10*[0.866, 0.5, 0] = [8.66, 5, 0]\n\nWait, earlier I had a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0], so with a=10, cos30≈0.866, sin30=0.5, so a2 = [8.66, 5, 0]\n\nSimilarly, a3 is [8.66, 2.32, 4.43]\n\nCompute cross product a2 × a3:\n\n|i     j     k|\n|8.66  5     0|\n|8.66 2.32 4.43|\n\n= i*(5*4.43 - 0*2.32) - j*(8.66*4.43 - 0*8.66) + k*(8.66*2.32 -5*8.66)\n\n= i*(22.15) - j*(38.36) + k*(20.09 -43.3)\n\n= (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)\n\nThen V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = [10, 0, 0] · (22.15, -38.36, -23.21) = 10*22.15 = 221.5 Å³\n\nWhich matches the previous calculation of V ≈ 221.7 Å³, so that\'s correct.\n\nNow, the reciprocal lattice vectors:\n\nb1 = (a2 × a3) / V = (22.15, -38.36, -23.21) / 221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, compute b2 and b3, but maybe it\'s easier to compute the reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nAlternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector g corresponding to the (hkl) plane is h b1 + k b2 + l b3.\n\nBut since we need the magnitude of g for (111), let\'s compute g = b1 + b2 + b3.\n\nBut to compute this, we need expressions for b1, b2, b3.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for the reciprocal lattice parameters in a rhombohedral system.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:\n\na* = (2π/a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)\n\nAnd angles α* = arccos( (cosα) / (1 + cosα) )\n\nBut this might not be necessary. Let me instead use the metric tensor approach.\n\nThe metric tensor G for the direct lattice is:\n\nG = [\n  [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],\n  [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],\n  [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²]\n]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G.\n\nBut calculating the inverse might be tedious. Alternatively, use the formula for the interplanar spacing:\n\n1/d² = h² a*² + k² b*² + l² c*² + 2 hk a* b* cosγ* + 2 hl a* c* cosβ* + 2 kl b* c* cosα*\n\nBut since in the reciprocal lattice for a rhombohedral system, a* = b* = c* and α* = β* = γ*, we can denote a* and α*.\n\nBut I need to find a* and α*.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters:\n\na* = 2π / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut I need to confirm this formula.\n\nAlternatively, since the volume of the direct unit cell is V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α), then the volume of the reciprocal unit cell is (2π)^3 / V.\n\nBut the reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system would have:\n\na* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut I\'m not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nThe magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g_{hkl} is |g| = 1/d.\n\nFor the (111) plane, g = h b1 + k b2 + l b3 = b1 + b2 + b3.\n\nSo |g| = sqrt( (b1 + b2 + b3) · (b1 + b2 + b3) )\n\n= sqrt( |b1|² + |b2|² + |b3|² + 2 b1·b2 + 2 b1·b3 + 2 b2·b3 )\n\nSince the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = b, and the angles between them are α*.\n\nThe dot product b1·b2 = b² cosα*\n\nSo:\n\n|g|² = 3 b² + 6 b² cosα* = 3 b² (1 + 2 cosα* )\n\nBut we need to find b and α*.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nFrom the direct lattice vectors a1, a2, a3, the reciprocal vectors satisfy:\n\nb1 · a1 = 2π, b1 · a2 = 0, b1 · a3 = 0\n\nSimilarly for b2 and b3.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it\'s better to use the formula for d_{hkl} derived earlier.\n\nEarlier calculation gave d ≈ 9.53 Å. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a cubic system with a = 10 Å, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å. But here, the angles are 30°, which are smaller than 90°, so the planes are more closely spaced? Wait, no. If the angles are smaller, the unit cell is more "compressed", so the interplanar distance might be larger.\n\nWait, in a cubic system, the (111) planes are diagonal. In a rhombohedral system with angles 30°, the spacing might be different.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it\'s about 9.53 Å, which is less than the cubic case. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the formula was applied incorrectly.\n\nWait, in the cubic case, α = 90°, so cosα = 0. Plugging into the formula:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 0 + 0) / ( (1+1+1) * 1 + 2*(1+1+1)*(0 -0) ) ) = a * sqrt(1 / 3) = a / sqrt(3), which matches.\n\nBut in our case, α = 30°, so the denominator inside the sqrt becomes:\n\n(3 * sin²30 + 2*3*(cos²30 - cos30)) = 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) = 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.866)^3 ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nSo d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nBut in cubic, it\'s 5.77 Å, so here it\'s larger. That makes sense because the angles are smaller (30°), so the planes are not as "tilted", leading to larger interplanar distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe visualize the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice. The interplanar distance would depend on how the planes are spaced given the skewed axes.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the (111) planes are perpendicular to the [111] direction. The interplanar distance would be the distance between consecutive planes along [111].\n\nThe length of the [111] vector in direct space is |a1 + a2 + a3|.\n\nCompute this magnitude:\n\n|a1 + a2 + a3|² = (a1 + a2 + a3) · (a1 + a2 + a3) = |a1|² + |a2|² + |a3|² + 2(a1·a2 + a1·a3 + a2·a3)\n\n= 3a² + 2*3*a² cosα = 3a²(1 + 2 cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, this is 3*100*(1 + 2*(√3/2)) = 300*(1 + √3) ≈ 300*(2.732) ≈ 819.6\n\nSo |a1 + a2 + a3| ≈ sqrt(819.6) ≈ 28.63 Å\n\nThe interplanar distance d_{hkl} is the distance between consecutive planes, which is the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Alternatively, in direct space, it\'s the length of the [111] vector divided by the number of planes. Wait, no. The interplanar distance is the spacing between adjacent planes, which can be calculated as 2π / |g|, where |g| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.\n\nBut earlier, we have d = 1/|g|, assuming that the reciprocal lattice vector is defined with 2π factors. Wait, in crystallography, the reciprocal lattice vectors are often defined with a factor of 2π, so |g| = 2π/d. Therefore, d = 2π / |g|.\n\nBut in our previous calculation, we didn\'t include the 2π factor. This might be a source of confusion.\n\nWait, in the direct calculation of reciprocal lattice vectors, the vectors b1, b2, b3 satisfy:\n\nb_i · a_j = 2π δ_ij\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal lattice vector g = h b1 + k b2 + l b3 has a magnitude |g| = 2π / d.\n\nTherefore, d = 2π / |g|\n\nBut in our earlier approach using the formula from the metric tensor, we didn\'t include the 2π factor, so the result was d = 1 / |g|. This suggests that the formula might have been in non-SI units where 2π is absorbed, but in crystallography, the standard definition includes 2π.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me clarify.\n\nIn crystallography, the interplanar spacing d_{hkl} is related to the reciprocal lattice vector by:\n\n|g_{hkl}| = 1/d_{hkl}\n\nBut this is when the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. However, in physics, reciprocal lattice vectors often include a 2π factor, so |g| = 2π/d.\n\nThis discrepancy arises from different conventions. In crystallography, the structure factor uses exp(2πi g · r), so the reciprocal vectors are defined without the 2π factor. In physics, it\'s common to use exp(i g · r), requiring the reciprocal vectors to include 2π.\n\nTherefore, in our case, since we are using crystallographic definitions, the reciprocal lattice vectors do not include the 2π factor, so |g| = 1/d.\n\nTherefore, the previous calculation of d ≈ 9.53 Å is correct under crystallographic conventions.\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s compute |g_{111}| using the reciprocal vectors.\n\nGiven the reciprocal vectors b1, b2, b3, which we approximated earlier as:\n\nb1 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹\n\nBut this was from the cross product divided by V:\n\nb1 = (a2 × a3)/V ≈ (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)/221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, compute b2 and b3.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that the reciprocal lattice of a rhombohedral lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:\n\na* = |b1| = |b2| = |b3|\n\nand angles α* between them.\n\nGiven the direct lattice parameters a = 10 Å, α = 30°, we can compute a* and α*.\n\nThe magnitude of reciprocal lattice vectors:\n\n|b1| = |a2 × a3| / V = |a2 × a3| / V\n\nWe already calculated |a2 × a3| ≈ 221.5 Å² (since V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = 221.5 Å³)\n\nWait, |a2 × a3| = V / |a1| since V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = |a1| |a2 × a3| cosθ, where θ is the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3). But since a1 is orthogonal to a2 × a3 (because a2 × a3 is perpendicular to the plane of a2 and a3, and a1 is in that plane), so θ = 90°, which would imply V = 0, which contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, a1 is not necessarily orthogonal to a2 × a3. The scalar triple product V = a1 · (a2 × a3) is the volume, which is 221.5 Å³. The magnitude of (a2 × a3) is |a2||a3|sinφ, where φ is the angle between a2 and a3, which is α = 30°. So |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 10*10*sin30° = 100*0.5 = 50 Å². But earlier calculation gave |a2 × a3| as part of the cross product resulting in 221.5 Å³ when dotted with a1. Wait, there\'s confusion here.\n\nWait, the cross product a2 × a3 is a vector whose magnitude is |a2||a3|sinφ, where φ is the angle between a2 and a3. Since a2 and a3 have angle α = 30°, |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 100*0.5 = 50 Å². Then the volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = |a1| |a2 × a3| cosθ, where θ is the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3). The vector a2 × a3 is perpendicular to both a2 and a3. Since a1, a2, a3 are in a rhombohedral lattice, the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3) is such that cosθ = V / ( |a1| |a2 × a3| )\n\nBut V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 221.5 Å³\n\nSo cosθ = V / (a * |a2 × a3| ) = 221.5 / (10 * 50) ≈ 221.5 / 500 ≈ 0.443\n\nTherefore, θ ≈ 63.7°\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nHowever, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitudes |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V = 50 / 221.5 ≈ 0.2257 Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| ≈ 0.2257 Å⁻¹\n\nThe angle between reciprocal lattice vectors, say between b1 and b2, is α*, which can be found from:\n\ncosα* = (b1 · b2) / (|b1||b2|)\n\nBut b1 · b2 = (a2 × a3) · (a3 × a1) / V²\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let\'s use the relationship between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nFor a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with:\n\na* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut wait, in crystallography, the 2π is often omitted, so if we are using the crystallographic definition (without 2π), then:\n\na* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nPlugging in a = 10 Å, α = 30°:\n\na* = 1 / (10 * 0.5 * sqrt(0.049)) ≈ 1 / (5 * 0.2217) ≈ 1 / 1.108 ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹\n\nThe angle α* in the reciprocal lattice is given by:\n\ncosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, cosα* = -√3/2 / (1 + √3/2) = (-√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = -√3 / (2 + √3)\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\n-√3 (2 - √3) / ( (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ) = (-2√3 + 3) / (4 - 3) = (-2√3 +3)/1 ≈ (-3.464 +3)/1 ≈ -0.464\n\nThus, α* = arccos(-0.464) ≈ 117.7°\n\nNow, the reciprocal lattice vector g_{111} is the sum of b1, b2, b3. The magnitude squared is:\n\n|g|² = |b1|² + |b2|² + |b3|² + 2(b1·b2 + b1·b3 + b2·b3)\n\nSince |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = a* ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹\n\nAnd b1·b2 = |b1||b2|cosα* ≈ (0.902)^2 * (-0.464) ≈ 0.813 * (-0.464) ≈ -0.377\n\nTherefore,\n\n|g|² = 3*(0.813) + 3*2*(-0.377) ≈ 2.439 - 2.262 ≈ 0.177\n\nThus, |g| ≈ sqrt(0.177) ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹\n\nTherefore, d = 1 / |g| ≈ 1 / 0.420 ≈ 2.38 Å\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result of ~9.53 Å. Clearly, there\'s a mistake here.\n\nWait, this suggests a discrepancy between the two methods. The first method gave ~9.5 Å, the second method using reciprocal lattice parameters gave ~2.38 Å. This inconsistency must be resolved.\n\nThe error likely arises from the definition of reciprocal lattice vectors. If the crystallographic definition excludes the 2π factor, then the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as b_i such that b_i · a_j = δ_ij, not 2π δ_ij. Therefore, the relation between |g| and d is |g| = 1/d.\n\nBut in the second approach, using the reciprocal lattice parameters, we calculated |g| ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹, leading to d ≈ 2.38 Å, which is way too small. However, the first method gave ~9.5 Å. This suggests a miscalculation in the second approach.\n\nLet me re-examine the reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nGiven that the direct lattice has a = 10 Å, α = 30°, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 221.5 Å³\n\nThe reciprocal lattice parameters a* is given by:\n\na* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut if we are using the crystallographic convention without 2π, then:\n\na* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) ≈ 1 / (10 * 0.5 * 0.2217) ≈ 1 / 1.108 ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹\n\nBut then, the magnitude of g_{111} is |g| = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) a*² + 2(hk + hl + kl) a*² cosα* )\n\nFor h = k = l =1:\n\n|g|² = 3 a*² + 6 a*² cosα* ≈ 3*(0.813) + 6*(0.813)*(-0.464) ≈ 2.439 + 6*(-0.377) ≈ 2.439 - 2.262 ≈ 0.177\n\nThus, |g| ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹, so d = 1 / 0.420 ≈ 2.38 Å\n\nBut this is inconsistent with the first method. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The reciprocal lattice parameters in crystallography are defined such that the reciprocal lattice vector g satisfies g · t = integer for any translation vector t of the direct lattice. This means that the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. Therefore, the relation d = 1/|g| holds.\n\nHowever, in our first method, we used the formula:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )\n\nWhich gave d ≈ 9.53 Å\n\nBut according to the reciprocal lattice calculation, d ≈ 2.38 Å. These results are vastly different. This suggests a fundamental error in one of the approaches.\n\nLet me verify with a concrete example. Take the cubic case where α = 90°.\n\nFirst method:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3*0 + 2*0 =1\n\nDenominator: (3*1 + 2*3*(0 -0)) =3\n\nd = a * sqrt(1/3) = 10 / 1.732 ≈5.77 Å, which is correct.\n\nSecond method:\n\na* = 1 / (a *1* sqrt(1 -0 +0)) =1/10 =0.1 Å⁻¹\n\ncosα* = -0 / (1 +0) =0, so α* =90°\n\n|g|² =3*(0.1)^2 +6*(0.1)^2*0=0.03\n\n|g|=sqrt(0.03)=0.1732 Å⁻¹\n\nd=1/0.1732≈5.77 Å, which matches.\n\nSo in the cubic case, both methods agree. Therefore, the error must be in the calculation for α=30°.\n\nLet me redo the second method for α=30°.\n\nGiven a=10 Å, α=30°, V=221.5 Å³\n\na* =1/(10 * sin30° * sqrt(1 -3 cos²30° +2 cos³30°))\n\nsin30°=0.5, cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660\n\nInside sqrt:1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495)=1 -2.25 +1.299≈0.049\n\nsqrt(0.049)≈0.2217\n\nThus, a* =1/(10*0.5*0.2217)=1/(1.1085)≈0.902 Å⁻¹\n\ncosα* =-cos30°/(1 +cos30°)= -0.866/(1 +0.866)= -0.866/1.866≈-0.464\n\nThus, α*≈117.7°\n\nNow, compute |g_{111}|:\n\n|g|²=3a*² +6a*² cosα* =3*(0.902)^2 +6*(0.902)^2*(-0.464)\n\n=3*0.813 +6*0.813*(-0.464)\n\n=2.439 +6*(-0.377)\n\n=2.439 -2.262≈0.177\n\n|g|=sqrt(0.177)≈0.420 Å⁻¹\n\nThus, d=1/0.420≈2.38 Å\n\nBut this contradicts the first method\'s result of ~9.53 Å. However, in the cubic case, both methods agree. Therefore, there must be an error in the first method.\n\nRe-examining the first method:\n\nThe formula used was:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )\n\nBut perhaps this formula is incorrect. Let me check the source.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice (which is a special case of the trigonal system) is indeed:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]\n\nWait, in the denominator of the numerator, is it (cosα - cos²α) or (cos²α - cosα)? Earlier, I had (cos²α - cosα), but in the standard references, it might be different.\n\nAccording to the book "Elements of X-ray Diffraction" by B.D. Cullity, the interplanar spacing for the trigonal system (rhombohedral) is given by:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]\n\nWhich matches the formula I used earlier. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.\n\nBut why the discrepancy with the reciprocal lattice approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the reciprocal lattice calculation. Let\'s re-express the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude.\n\nGiven that in the cubic case, both methods agree, but in the rhombohedral case, they don\'t. Therefore, the mistake must be in the reciprocal lattice calculation for the rhombohedral case.\n\nWait, in the cubic case, the reciprocal lattice vectors are orthogonal, and the calculation is straightforward. In the rhombohedral case, the reciprocal lattice vectors are not orthogonal, and the angles between them are obtuse (α* ≈117.7°), leading to a smaller |g| and thus larger d. But according to the first method, d is larger than in the cubic case, but according to the reciprocal lattice calculation, d is smaller. This inconsistency suggests a miscalculation.\n\nWait, in the cubic case, α=90°, so the reciprocal lattice calculation gives d=5.77 Å, which is correct. For the rhombohedral case with α=30°, the reciprocal lattice calculation gives d≈2.38 Å, which is smaller, but the first method gives d≈9.53 Å, which is larger. This is contradictory.\n\nBut in reality, for a rhombohedral lattice with smaller angles (more acute), the (111) planes should be farther apart, not closer. Therefore, the first method\'s result of ~9.5 Å seems more plausible, while the reciprocal lattice approach giving ~2.38 Å must be wrong.\n\nThis suggests that there\'s an error in the reciprocal lattice calculation. Let me check the reciprocal lattice parameters again.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system can be expressed as:\n\na* = (2π) / (a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut this is when the reciprocal lattice is defined with the 2π factor. If we omit the 2π (crystallographic convention), then:\n\na* = 1 / (a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))\n\nBut in our case, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈221.5 Å³\n\nThe magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors is |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V\n\nEarlier, we calculated |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 100 * 0.5 =50 Å²\n\nThus, |b1| =50 / 221.5 ≈0.2257 Å⁻¹\n\nBut according to the formula a* =1/(a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) ≈0.902 Å⁻¹, which is different.\n\nThis inconsistency indicates a mistake in the assumption about |a2 × a3|.\n\nWait, |a2 × a3| is not simply a² sinα because a2 and a3 are not of length a. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral lattice, all direct lattice vectors have length a. Therefore, |a2| = |a3| =a, and the angle between them is α. Therefore, |a2 × a3| =a² sinα. However, in our specific case, when we computed the cross product a2 × a3, we got a different result. This suggests that the earlier vector definitions of a2 and a3 were incorrect.\n\nAh! Here\'s the mistake. When I defined the vectors a1, a2, a3, I assumed they are of length a and have angles α between them. However, in reality, constructing such vectors requires that each pair has angle α. The way I defined a3 earlier might not satisfy this condition, leading to an incorrect cross product.\n\nTo correctly define the rhombohedral lattice vectors, all pairs of vectors must have angle α. The standard way to define them is:\n\na1 = a [1, 0, 0]\n\na2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]\n\na3 = a [cosα, cosα * (1 - cosα)/sinα, sqrt(1 - 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα)) ]\n\nBut earlier, when calculating c3, we found that this component is approximately 4.43 Å, which for a=10 Å, gives a3 a magnitude of 10 Å. Let\'s verify:\n\n|a3|² = (10*0.866)^2 + (10*0.232)^2 + (4.43)^2 ≈ (8.66)^2 + (2.32)^2 + (4.43)^2 ≈75 +5.38 +19.62≈100.0\n\nYes, so |a3|=10 Å. Therefore, the cross product a2 × a3 should indeed have magnitude |a2||a3|sinα =100*0.5=50 Å². However, when we computed the cross product earlier, we got a different result. This suggests an error in the cross product calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the cross product a2 × a3 with the correct a3.\n\nGiven:\n\na2 = [8.66, 5.0, 0] (since a=10, cos30≈8.66, sin30=5.0)\n\na3 = [8.66, 2.32, 4.43] (from earlier calculation)\n\nCompute a2 × a3:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|8.66 5.0   0|\n|8.66 2.32 4.43|\n\n= i*(5.0*4.43 - 0*2.32) - j*(8.66*4.43 - 0*8.66) + k*(8.66*2.32 -5.0*8.66)\n\n= i*(22.15) - j*(38.36) + k*(20.09 -43.3)\n\n= (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(22.15² + (-38.36)² + (-23.21)²) ≈ sqrt(490.8 + 1471.5 + 538.7) ≈ sqrt(2500) =50 Å²\n\nAh! So the magnitude is indeed 50 Å², which matches |a2||a3|sinα=10*10*0.5=50 Å². Therefore, the earlier calculation of the cross product magnitude was correct, but when we computed V = a1 · (a2 × a3), we got V=221.5 Å³, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V =50 /221.5≈0.2257 Å⁻¹\n\nBut according to the formula a* =1/(a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))≈0.902 Å⁻¹, which is different. This inconsistency arises because the formula for a* assumes a different definition.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for a* is derived for the hexagonal setting of the rhombohedral lattice, not the primitive rhombohedral axes. This is a common source of confusion.\n\nThe rhombohedral lattice can be expressed in terms of a hexagonal unit cell, which has a larger volume. The relationship between the rhombohedral (primitive) and hexagonal (conventional) unit cells is complex. Therefore, the reciprocal lattice parameters might be different depending on the setting.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the safest approach is to trust the first method using the interplanar spacing formula for rhombohedral lattices, which gave d≈9.53 Å, and which correctly reduces to the cubic case when α=90°.\n\nAdditionally, the reciprocal lattice approach might have errors due to miscalculations in the angles or vector components. Given the time invested and the consistency of the first method with the cubic case, I will conclude that the interplanar distance is approximately 9.53 Å.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let\'s cross-validate with another approach.\n\nConsider that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is the distance between adjacent planes in the (hkl) family. For the (111) plane, this can be found by taking the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g_{hkl}.\n\nGiven that the reciprocal lattice vectors are:\n\nb1 = (a2 × a3)/V ≈ (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)/221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, compute b2 and b3:\n\nb2 = (a3 × a1)/V\n\na3 × a1 = |i    j     k|\n          |8.66 2.32 4.43|\n          |10    0    0 |\n\n= i*(2.32*0 -4.43*0) - j*(8.66*0 -4.43*10) + k*(8.66*0 -2.32*10)\n\n= i*0 - j*(-44.3) + k*(-23.2)\n\n= (0, 44.3, -23.2)\n\nDivide by V=221.5:\n\nb2 ≈ (0, 0.2, -0.105) Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, b3 = (a1 × a2)/V\n\na1 × a2 = |i    j    k|\n          |10    0    0|\n          |8.66 5.0   0|\n\n= i*(0*0 -0*5.0) - j*(10*0 -0*8.66) + k*(10*5.0 -0*8.66)\n\n= (0, 0, 50)\n\nDivide by V=221.5:\n\nb3 ≈ (0, 0, 0.226) Å⁻¹\n\nNow, the reciprocal lattice vector g_{111} = b1 + b2 + b3 ≈ (0.1 +0 +0, -0.173 +0.2 +0, -0.105 -0.105 +0.226) ≈ (0.1, 0.027, 0.016) Å⁻¹\n\nThe magnitude of g is sqrt(0.1² +0.027² +0.016²) ≈ sqrt(0.01 +0.0007 +0.000256) ≈ sqrt(0.010956) ≈0.1047 Å⁻¹\n\nTherefore, d =1/0.1047≈9.55 Å\n\nThis matches the first method\'s result of approximately 9.53 Å. Therefore, the correct interplanar distance is about 9.55 Å.\n\nThe earlier mistake in the reciprocal lattice parameters approach was due to using an incorrect formula for a* and α*, likely confusing between different conventions or settings. By directly calculating the reciprocal lattice vectors and summing them for g_{111}, we arrive at the same result as the first method.\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} is approximately 9.55 Å, which rounds to about 9.5 Å. Given the options for significant figures in the problem (interatomic distance given as 10 Å, angles as 30°), the answer should be expressed with two significant figures, so 9.5 Å.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation:\n\nFrom the first method:\n\nd =10 * sqrt(0.049 /0.054) ≈10 * sqrt(0.9074)≈10*0.9526≈9.526 Å\n\nFrom the reciprocal lattice vector calculation:\n\nd≈9.55 Å\n\nThus, the precise answer is approximately 9.5 Å.\n\nHowever, to provide an exact answer, let\'s compute the exact expression:\n\nNumerator: 1 -3 cos²α +2 cos³α =1 -3*(3/4) +2*( (√3)/2 )³ =1 -9/4 +2*(3√3)/8=1 -2.25 + (3√3)/4≈1 -2.25 +1.299≈0.049\n\nDenominator: (h² +k² +l²) sin²α +2(hk +hl +kl)(cos²α -cosα)=3*(1/4) +6*( (3/4) - (√3)/2 )≈0.75 +6*(0.75 -0.866)≈0.75 -0.696≈0.054\n\nThus, d=10*sqrt(0.049/0.054)=10*sqrt(49/54)=10*(7)/(3√6)=70/(3*2.449)≈70/7.347≈9.53 Å\n\nExpressed exactly, it\'s 70/(3√6) Å. Rationalizing:\n\n70/(3√6) =70√6/(3*6)=35√6/9≈35*2.449/9≈85.715/9≈9.524 Å\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.52 Å, which rounds to 9.5 Å.

To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice:

\[
d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{\frac{1 - 3 \cos^2 \alpha + 2 \cos^3 \alpha}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) \sin^2 \alpha + 2(hk + hl + kl)(\cos^2 \alpha - \cos \alpha)}}
\]

Given:
- \(a = 10 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(\alpha = 30^\circ\)
- \(h = 1\), \(k = 1\), \(l = 1\)

First, calculate the trigonometric values:
- \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\)
- \(\sin 30^\circ = 0.5\)

Substitute these values into the formula:

1. **Numerator**:
   \[
   1 - 3 \cos^2 30^\circ + 2 \cos^3 30^\circ

   \[
   = 1 - 3 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3
   \]
   \[
   = 1 - 3 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 2 \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)
   \]
   \[
   = 1 - \frac{9}{4} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 \approx 0.049

2. **Denominator**:

   \[

   \]
   \[

   \]
   \[
   = 0.75 - 0.696 \approx 0.054

3. **Calculate \(d_{111}\)**:
   \[
   d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{0.049}{0.054}} \approx 10 \sqrt{0.9074} \approx 10 \times 0.9526 \approx 9.53 \, \text{Å}
   \]

After verifying with reciprocal lattice vector calculations and ensuring consistency with the cubic case, the interplanar distance is confirmed to be approximately 9.5 Å.

\[
\boxed{9.5 \text{ Å}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me check if there's a standard formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, since the rhombohedral system can be converted to a hexagonal system for easier calculation. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal axes might help. The hexagonal unit cell has a and c parameters related to the rhombohedral a and α.

But perhaps I should stick to the direct formula. Let me try using the triclinic formula with a = b = c and α = β = γ.

The volume V of the unit cell is given by:
V = a³ √(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

For α = 30°, let's compute that:
cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660
V = 10³ √(1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3)
First compute inside the square root:
1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.8660)^3
Wait, (0.8660)^2 = 0.75, so 3*(0.75) = 2.25
(0.8660)^3 ≈ 0.6495
So 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299
So inside the sqrt: 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049
Thus, V ≈ 1000 * √0.049 ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Now, the metric tensor Sij for triclinic system is:

S11 = (b² c² sin²α) / V²
Wait, maybe I need to compute the reciprocal metric tensor. Alternatively, use the formula for 1/d² in terms of hkl and the metric tensor.

Alternatively, use the formula from the International Tables for Crystallography. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) / (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]

So plugging in h = 1, k = 1, l = 1, α = 30°, a = 10 Å.

First compute numerator:
(1 + 1 + 1) sin²30° + 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*(cos²30° - cos30°)
= 3*(0.25) + 2*3*( (0.75) - 0.8660 )
= 0.75 + 6*( -0.1160 )
= 0.75 - 0.696
= 0.054

Denominator:
1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.8660)^3
= 1 - 2.25 + 2*(0.6495)
= -1.25 + 1.299
= 0.049

So 0.054 / 0.049 ≈ 1.102

Then d = 10 / √(1.102) ≈ 10 / 1.049 ≈ 9.53 Å

Wait, but this seems a bit high. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )

Wait, perhaps I inverted numerator and denominator. Let me check.

Original formula from the interplanar distance for rhombohedral:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]

Therefore, d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )

So plugging in the numbers:

Numerator inside sqrt: 0.049 (from previous calculation)
Denominator inside sqrt: 0.054 (from previous calculation)

So d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.9074) ≈ 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å

So approximately 9.53 Å. But let me check if the formula is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: using reciprocal lattice vectors.

For a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated. The reciprocal lattice parameters a*, b*, c* and angles α*, β*, γ* can be found.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V
b2 = (a3 × a1) / V
b3 = (a1 × a2) / V

Assuming the primitive vectors a1, a2, a3 have magnitude a = 10 Å, and angles between them α = 30°.

Let me define the vectors:

Let’s choose a1 along the x-axis: a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 is in the xy-plane, making an angle α with a1. So a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 has components such that the angle between a3 and a1 is α, and the angle between a3 and a2 is also α. Let's find a3.

Let a3 = [c1, c2, c3]

The dot product a1 · a3 = a^2 cosα = a * c1 => c1 = a cosα

Similarly, a2 · a3 = a^2 cosα = (a cosα)(c1) + (a sinα)(c2) + 0*c3

But since c1 = a cosα, substituting:

a^2 cosα = a cosα * a cosα + a sinα * c2

=> a^2 cosα = a² cos²α + a sinα c2

Divide both sides by a:

a cosα = a cos²α + sinα c2

=> c2 = (a cosα - a cos²α) / sinα = a cosα (1 - cosα) / sinα

Similarly, the magnitude of a3 is a, so:

c1² + c2² + c3² = a²

Substituting c1 and c2:

(a cosα)^2 + [a cosα (1 - cosα)/sinα]^2 + c3² = a²

Divide both sides by a²:

cos²α + [cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 / sin²α] + (c3/a)^2 = 1

Let’s compute the second term:

[cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / sin²α

= [cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / (1 - cos²α)

= [cos²α (1 - 2 cosα + cos²α) ] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)]

= [cos²α (1 - cosα)^2 ] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)]

= [cos²α (1 - cosα) ] / (1 + cosα)

So the equation becomes:

cos²α + [cos²α (1 - cosα) / (1 + cosα) ] + (c3/a)^2 = 1

Factor out cos²α:

cos²α [1 + (1 - cosα)/(1 + cosα) ] + (c3/a)^2 = 1

Compute the term in brackets:

1 + (1 - cosα)/(1 + cosα) = [ (1 + cosα) + (1 - cosα) ] / (1 + cosα) = 2 / (1 + cosα)

So:

cos²α * 2 / (1 + cosα) + (c3/a)^2 = 1

Thus,

(c3/a)^2 = 1 - [2 cos²α / (1 + cosα) ]

= [ (1 + cosα) - 2 cos²α ] / (1 + cosα )

= [1 + cosα - 2 cos²α ] / (1 + cosα )

Factor numerator:

Let’s write it as 1 + cosα - 2 cos²α = -2 cos²α + cosα + 1

This is a quadratic in cosα: -2x² + x + 1, where x = cosα

Discriminant: 1 + 8 = 9

Roots: [ -1 ± 3 ] / (-4) => (2)/-4 = -0.5 and (-4)/-4 = 1

So factors: -2x² + x + 1 = -(2x² - x -1) = -(2x +1)(x -1)

But let me check:

(2x +1)(x -1) = 2x² -2x + x -1 = 2x² -x -1, so yes.

Thus,

-2x² + x +1 = - (2x² -x -1) = - (2x +1)(x -1)

So,

Numerator: - (2 cosα +1)(cosα -1) = (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1)

Therefore,

(c3/a)^2 = [ (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1) ] / (1 + cosα )

So,

c3 = a sqrt[ (1 - cosα)(2 cosα +1) / (1 + cosα) ]

For α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute inside sqrt:

(1 - √3/2)(2*(√3/2) +1) / (1 + √3/2 )

Simplify:

First term: (1 - √3/2) = (2 - √3)/2

Second term: (√3 +1)

Denominator: (2 + √3)/2

So overall:

[ (2 - √3)/2 * (√3 +1) ] / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = [ (2 - √3)(√3 +1) ] / (2 + √3)

Multiply numerator:

(2)(√3) + 2(1) - √3(√3) - √3(1) = 2√3 + 2 - 3 - √3 = (2√3 - √3) + (2 -3) = √3 -1

So numerator: √3 -1

Denominator: 2 + √3

Thus,

(√3 -1)/(2 + √3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

( (√3 -1)(2 - √3) ) / ( (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ) = (2√3 -3 -2 + √3 ) / (4 -3) = (3√3 -5)/1 = 3√3 -5 ≈ 3*1.732 -5 ≈ 5.196 -5 ≈ 0.196

Therefore,

c3 = a * sqrt(0.196) ≈ 10 * 0.443 ≈ 4.43 Å

So the components of a3 are:

c1 = a cosα ≈ 10 * 0.866 ≈ 8.66 Å

c2 = a cosα (1 - cosα)/sinα ≈ 10 * 0.866 * (1 -0.866)/0.5 ≈ 10 * 0.866 * 0.134 /0.5 ≈ 10 * 0.866 * 0.268 ≈ 10 * 0.232 ≈ 2.32 Å

c3 ≈ 4.43 Å

So a3 ≈ [8.66, 2.32, 4.43] Å

Now, compute the volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3)

First compute a2 × a3:

a2 = [8.66, 5, 0] (Wait, wait, a2 was defined as a [cosα, sinα, 0] = 10*[0.866, 0.5, 0] = [8.66, 5, 0]

Wait, earlier I had a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0], so with a=10, cos30≈0.866, sin30=0.5, so a2 = [8.66, 5, 0]

Similarly, a3 is [8.66, 2.32, 4.43]

Compute cross product a2 × a3:

|i     j     k|
|8.66  5     0|
|8.66 2.32 4.43|

= i*(5*4.43 - 0*2.32) - j*(8.66*4.43 - 0*8.66) + k*(8.66*2.32 -5*8.66)

= i*(22.15) - j*(38.36) + k*(20.09 -43.3)

= (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)

Then V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = [10, 0, 0] · (22.15, -38.36, -23.21) = 10*22.15 = 221.5 Å³

Which matches the previous calculation of V ≈ 221.7 Å³, so that's correct.

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors:

b1 = (a2 × a3) / V = (22.15, -38.36, -23.21) / 221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹

Similarly, compute b2 and b3, but maybe it's easier to compute the reciprocal lattice parameters.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector g corresponding to the (hkl) plane is h b1 + k b2 + l b3.

But since we need the magnitude of g for (111), let's compute g = b1 + b2 + b3.

But to compute this, we need expressions for b1, b2, b3.

Alternatively, use the formula for the reciprocal lattice parameters in a rhombohedral system.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:

a* = (2π/a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

And angles α* = arccos( (cosα) / (1 + cosα) )

But this might not be necessary. Let me instead use the metric tensor approach.

The metric tensor G for the direct lattice is:

G = [
  [a², a² cosα, a² cosα],
  [a² cosα, a², a² cosα],
  [a² cosα, a² cosα, a²]
]

The reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G.

But calculating the inverse might be tedious. Alternatively, use the formula for the interplanar spacing:

1/d² = h² a*² + k² b*² + l² c*² + 2 hk a* b* cosγ* + 2 hl a* c* cosβ* + 2 kl b* c* cosα*

But since in the reciprocal lattice for a rhombohedral system, a* = b* = c* and α* = β* = γ*, we can denote a* and α*.

But I need to find a* and α*.

Alternatively, use the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters:

a* = 2π / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But I need to confirm this formula.

Alternatively, since the volume of the direct unit cell is V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α), then the volume of the reciprocal unit cell is (2π)^3 / V.

But the reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system would have:

a* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g_{hkl} is |g| = 1/d.

For the (111) plane, g = h b1 + k b2 + l b3 = b1 + b2 + b3.

So |g| = sqrt( (b1 + b2 + b3) · (b1 + b2 + b3) )

= sqrt( |b1|² + |b2|² + |b3|² + 2 b1·b2 + 2 b1·b3 + 2 b2·b3 )

Since the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = b, and the angles between them are α*.

The dot product b1·b2 = b² cosα*

So:

|g|² = 3 b² + 6 b² cosα* = 3 b² (1 + 2 cosα* )

But we need to find b and α*.

Alternatively, use the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice vectors.

From the direct lattice vectors a1, a2, a3, the reciprocal vectors satisfy:

b1 · a1 = 2π, b1 · a2 = 0, b1 · a3 = 0

Similarly for b2 and b3.

But given the complexity, perhaps it's better to use the formula for d_{hkl} derived earlier.

Earlier calculation gave d ≈ 9.53 Å. Let me check if this makes sense.

Alternatively, consider that in a cubic system with a = 10 Å, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å. But here, the angles are 30°, which are smaller than 90°, so the planes are more closely spaced? Wait, no. If the angles are smaller, the unit cell is more "compressed", so the interplanar distance might be larger.

Wait, in a cubic system, the (111) planes are diagonal. In a rhombohedral system with angles 30°, the spacing might be different.

But according to the calculation, it's about 9.53 Å, which is less than the cubic case. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the formula was applied incorrectly.

Wait, in the cubic case, α = 90°, so cosα = 0. Plugging into the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 0 + 0) / ( (1+1+1) * 1 + 2*(1+1+1)*(0 -0) ) ) = a * sqrt(1 / 3) = a / sqrt(3), which matches.

But in our case, α = 30°, so the denominator inside the sqrt becomes:

(3 * sin²30 + 2*3*(cos²30 - cos30)) = 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) = 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054

Numerator: 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.866)^3 ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

So d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

But in cubic, it's 5.77 Å, so here it's larger. That makes sense because the angles are smaller (30°), so the planes are not as "tilted", leading to larger interplanar distance.

Alternatively, maybe visualize the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice. The interplanar distance would depend on how the planes are spaced given the skewed axes.

Alternatively, consider that the (111) planes are perpendicular to the [111] direction. The interplanar distance would be the distance between consecutive planes along [111].

The length of the [111] vector in direct space is |a1 + a2 + a3|.

Compute this magnitude:

|a1 + a2 + a3|² = (a1 + a2 + a3) · (a1 + a2 + a3) = |a1|² + |a2|² + |a3|² + 2(a1·a2 + a1·a3 + a2·a3)

= 3a² + 2*3*a² cosα = 3a²(1 + 2 cosα)

For α = 30°, this is 3*100*(1 + 2*(√3/2)) = 300*(1 + √3) ≈ 300*(2.732) ≈ 819.6

So |a1 + a2 + a3| ≈ sqrt(819.6) ≈ 28.63 Å

The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is the distance between consecutive planes, which is the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Alternatively, in direct space, it's the length of the [111] vector divided by the number of planes. Wait, no. The interplanar distance is the spacing between adjacent planes, which can be calculated as 2π / |g|, where |g| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

But earlier, we have d = 1/|g|, assuming that the reciprocal lattice vector is defined with 2π factors. Wait, in crystallography, the reciprocal lattice vectors are often defined with a factor of 2π, so |g| = 2π/d. Therefore, d = 2π / |g|.

But in our previous calculation, we didn't include the 2π factor. This might be a source of confusion.

Wait, in the direct calculation of reciprocal lattice vectors, the vectors b1, b2, b3 satisfy:

b_i · a_j = 2π δ_ij

Therefore, the reciprocal lattice vector g = h b1 + k b2 + l b3 has a magnitude |g| = 2π / d.

Therefore, d = 2π / |g|

But in our earlier approach using the formula from the metric tensor, we didn't include the 2π factor, so the result was d = 1 / |g|. This suggests that the formula might have been in non-SI units where 2π is absorbed, but in crystallography, the standard definition includes 2π.

This is a critical point. Let me clarify.

In crystallography, the interplanar spacing d_{hkl} is related to the reciprocal lattice vector by:

|g_{hkl}| = 1/d_{hkl}

But this is when the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. However, in physics, reciprocal lattice vectors often include a 2π factor, so |g| = 2π/d.

This discrepancy arises from different conventions. In crystallography, the structure factor uses exp(2πi g · r), so the reciprocal vectors are defined without the 2π factor. In physics, it's common to use exp(i g · r), requiring the reciprocal vectors to include 2π.

Therefore, in our case, since we are using crystallographic definitions, the reciprocal lattice vectors do not include the 2π factor, so |g| = 1/d.

Therefore, the previous calculation of d ≈ 9.53 Å is correct under crystallographic conventions.

But to confirm, let's compute |g_{111}| using the reciprocal vectors.

Given the reciprocal vectors b1, b2, b3, which we approximated earlier as:

b1 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹

But this was from the cross product divided by V:

b1 = (a2 × a3)/V ≈ (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)/221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹

Similarly, compute b2 and b3.

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that the reciprocal lattice of a rhombohedral lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:

a* = |b1| = |b2| = |b3|

and angles α* between them.

Given the direct lattice parameters a = 10 Å, α = 30°, we can compute a* and α*.

The magnitude of reciprocal lattice vectors:

|b1| = |a2 × a3| / V = |a2 × a3| / V

We already calculated |a2 × a3| ≈ 221.5 Å² (since V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = 221.5 Å³)

Wait, |a2 × a3| = V / |a1| since V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = |a1| |a2 × a3| cosθ, where θ is the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3). But since a1 is orthogonal to a2 × a3 (because a2 × a3 is perpendicular to the plane of a2 and a3, and a1 is in that plane), so θ = 90°, which would imply V = 0, which contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, a1 is not necessarily orthogonal to a2 × a3. The scalar triple product V = a1 · (a2 × a3) is the volume, which is 221.5 Å³. The magnitude of (a2 × a3) is |a2||a3|sinφ, where φ is the angle between a2 and a3, which is α = 30°. So |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 10*10*sin30° = 100*0.5 = 50 Å². But earlier calculation gave |a2 × a3| as part of the cross product resulting in 221.5 Å³ when dotted with a1. Wait, there's confusion here.

Wait, the cross product a2 × a3 is a vector whose magnitude is |a2||a3|sinφ, where φ is the angle between a2 and a3. Since a2 and a3 have angle α = 30°, |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 100*0.5 = 50 Å². Then the volume V = a1 · (a2 × a3) = |a1| |a2 × a3| cosθ, where θ is the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3). The vector a2 × a3 is perpendicular to both a2 and a3. Since a1, a2, a3 are in a rhombohedral lattice, the angle between a1 and (a2 × a3) is such that cosθ = V / ( |a1| |a2 × a3| )

But V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 221.5 Å³

So cosθ = V / (a * |a2 × a3| ) = 221.5 / (10 * 50) ≈ 221.5 / 500 ≈ 0.443

Therefore, θ ≈ 63.7°

But this might not help directly.

However, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitudes |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V = 50 / 221.5 ≈ 0.2257 Å⁻¹

Similarly, |b1| = |b2| = |b3| ≈ 0.2257 Å⁻¹

The angle between reciprocal lattice vectors, say between b1 and b2, is α*, which can be found from:

cosα* = (b1 · b2) / (|b1||b2|)

But b1 · b2 = (a2 × a3) · (a3 × a1) / V²

This is getting too complicated. Let's use the relationship between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters.

For a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with:

a* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But wait, in crystallography, the 2π is often omitted, so if we are using the crystallographic definition (without 2π), then:

a* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

Plugging in a = 10 Å, α = 30°:

a* = 1 / (10 * 0.5 * sqrt(0.049)) ≈ 1 / (5 * 0.2217) ≈ 1 / 1.108 ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹

The angle α* in the reciprocal lattice is given by:

cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)

For α = 30°, cosα* = -√3/2 / (1 + √3/2) = (-√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = -√3 / (2 + √3)

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

-√3 (2 - √3) / ( (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ) = (-2√3 + 3) / (4 - 3) = (-2√3 +3)/1 ≈ (-3.464 +3)/1 ≈ -0.464

Thus, α* = arccos(-0.464) ≈ 117.7°

Now, the reciprocal lattice vector g_{111} is the sum of b1, b2, b3. The magnitude squared is:

|g|² = |b1|² + |b2|² + |b3|² + 2(b1·b2 + b1·b3 + b2·b3)

Since |b1| = |b2| = |b3| = a* ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹

And b1·b2 = |b1||b2|cosα* ≈ (0.902)^2 * (-0.464) ≈ 0.813 * (-0.464) ≈ -0.377

Therefore,

|g|² = 3*(0.813) + 3*2*(-0.377) ≈ 2.439 - 2.262 ≈ 0.177

Thus, |g| ≈ sqrt(0.177) ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹

Therefore, d = 1 / |g| ≈ 1 / 0.420 ≈ 2.38 Å

But this contradicts the previous result of ~9.53 Å. Clearly, there's a mistake here.

Wait, this suggests a discrepancy between the two methods. The first method gave ~9.5 Å, the second method using reciprocal lattice parameters gave ~2.38 Å. This inconsistency must be resolved.

The error likely arises from the definition of reciprocal lattice vectors. If the crystallographic definition excludes the 2π factor, then the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as b_i such that b_i · a_j = δ_ij, not 2π δ_ij. Therefore, the relation between |g| and d is |g| = 1/d.

But in the second approach, using the reciprocal lattice parameters, we calculated |g| ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹, leading to d ≈ 2.38 Å, which is way too small. However, the first method gave ~9.5 Å. This suggests a miscalculation in the second approach.

Let me re-examine the reciprocal lattice parameters.

Given that the direct lattice has a = 10 Å, α = 30°, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 221.5 Å³

The reciprocal lattice parameters a* is given by:

a* = (2π) / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But if we are using the crystallographic convention without 2π, then:

a* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) ≈ 1 / (10 * 0.5 * 0.2217) ≈ 1 / 1.108 ≈ 0.902 Å⁻¹

But then, the magnitude of g_{111} is |g| = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) a*² + 2(hk + hl + kl) a*² cosα* )

For h = k = l =1:

|g|² = 3 a*² + 6 a*² cosα* ≈ 3*(0.813) + 6*(0.813)*(-0.464) ≈ 2.439 + 6*(-0.377) ≈ 2.439 - 2.262 ≈ 0.177

Thus, |g| ≈ 0.420 Å⁻¹, so d = 1 / 0.420 ≈ 2.38 Å

But this is inconsistent with the first method. Where is the mistake?

Ah! The reciprocal lattice parameters in crystallography are defined such that the reciprocal lattice vector g satisfies g · t = integer for any translation vector t of the direct lattice. This means that the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. Therefore, the relation d = 1/|g| holds.

However, in our first method, we used the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )

Which gave d ≈ 9.53 Å

But according to the reciprocal lattice calculation, d ≈ 2.38 Å. These results are vastly different. This suggests a fundamental error in one of the approaches.

Let me verify with a concrete example. Take the cubic case where α = 90°.

First method:

Numerator: 1 - 3*0 + 2*0 =1

Denominator: (3*1 + 2*3*(0 -0)) =3

d = a * sqrt(1/3) = 10 / 1.732 ≈5.77 Å, which is correct.

Second method:

a* = 1 / (a *1* sqrt(1 -0 +0)) =1/10 =0.1 Å⁻¹

cosα* = -0 / (1 +0) =0, so α* =90°

|g|² =3*(0.1)^2 +6*(0.1)^2*0=0.03

|g|=sqrt(0.03)=0.1732 Å⁻¹

d=1/0.1732≈5.77 Å, which matches.

So in the cubic case, both methods agree. Therefore, the error must be in the calculation for α=30°.

Let me redo the second method for α=30°.

Given a=10 Å, α=30°, V=221.5 Å³

a* =1/(10 * sin30° * sqrt(1 -3 cos²30° +2 cos³30°))

sin30°=0.5, cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660

Inside sqrt:1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495)=1 -2.25 +1.299≈0.049

sqrt(0.049)≈0.2217

Thus, a* =1/(10*0.5*0.2217)=1/(1.1085)≈0.902 Å⁻¹

cosα* =-cos30°/(1 +cos30°)= -0.866/(1 +0.866)= -0.866/1.866≈-0.464

Thus, α*≈117.7°

Now, compute |g_{111}|:

|g|²=3a*² +6a*² cosα* =3*(0.902)^2 +6*(0.902)^2*(-0.464)

=3*0.813 +6*0.813*(-0.464)

=2.439 +6*(-0.377)

=2.439 -2.262≈0.177

|g|=sqrt(0.177)≈0.420 Å⁻¹

Thus, d=1/0.420≈2.38 Å

But this contradicts the first method's result of ~9.53 Å. However, in the cubic case, both methods agree. Therefore, there must be an error in the first method.

Re-examining the first method:

The formula used was:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ] )

But perhaps this formula is incorrect. Let me check the source.

Upon reviewing, the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice (which is a special case of the trigonal system) is indeed:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]

Wait, in the denominator of the numerator, is it (cosα - cos²α) or (cos²α - cosα)? Earlier, I had (cos²α - cosα), but in the standard references, it might be different.

According to the book "Elements of X-ray Diffraction" by B.D. Cullity, the interplanar spacing for the trigonal system (rhombohedral) is given by:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]

Which matches the formula I used earlier. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.

But why the discrepancy with the reciprocal lattice approach?

Wait, perhaps the error is in the reciprocal lattice calculation. Let's re-express the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude.

Given that in the cubic case, both methods agree, but in the rhombohedral case, they don't. Therefore, the mistake must be in the reciprocal lattice calculation for the rhombohedral case.

Wait, in the cubic case, the reciprocal lattice vectors are orthogonal, and the calculation is straightforward. In the rhombohedral case, the reciprocal lattice vectors are not orthogonal, and the angles between them are obtuse (α* ≈117.7°), leading to a smaller |g| and thus larger d. But according to the first method, d is larger than in the cubic case, but according to the reciprocal lattice calculation, d is smaller. This inconsistency suggests a miscalculation.

Wait, in the cubic case, α=90°, so the reciprocal lattice calculation gives d=5.77 Å, which is correct. For the rhombohedral case with α=30°, the reciprocal lattice calculation gives d≈2.38 Å, which is smaller, but the first method gives d≈9.53 Å, which is larger. This is contradictory.

But in reality, for a rhombohedral lattice with smaller angles (more acute), the (111) planes should be farther apart, not closer. Therefore, the first method's result of ~9.5 Å seems more plausible, while the reciprocal lattice approach giving ~2.38 Å must be wrong.

This suggests that there's an error in the reciprocal lattice calculation. Let me check the reciprocal lattice parameters again.

The reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system can be expressed as:

a* = (2π) / (a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But this is when the reciprocal lattice is defined with the 2π factor. If we omit the 2π (crystallographic convention), then:

a* = 1 / (a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))

But in our case, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈221.5 Å³

The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors is |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V

Earlier, we calculated |a2 × a3| = a² sinα = 100 * 0.5 =50 Å²

Thus, |b1| =50 / 221.5 ≈0.2257 Å⁻¹

But according to the formula a* =1/(a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) ≈0.902 Å⁻¹, which is different.

This inconsistency indicates a mistake in the assumption about |a2 × a3|.

Wait, |a2 × a3| is not simply a² sinα because a2 and a3 are not of length a. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral lattice, all direct lattice vectors have length a. Therefore, |a2| = |a3| =a, and the angle between them is α. Therefore, |a2 × a3| =a² sinα. However, in our specific case, when we computed the cross product a2 × a3, we got a different result. This suggests that the earlier vector definitions of a2 and a3 were incorrect.

Ah! Here's the mistake. When I defined the vectors a1, a2, a3, I assumed they are of length a and have angles α between them. However, in reality, constructing such vectors requires that each pair has angle α. The way I defined a3 earlier might not satisfy this condition, leading to an incorrect cross product.

To correctly define the rhombohedral lattice vectors, all pairs of vectors must have angle α. The standard way to define them is:

a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 = a [cosα, cosα * (1 - cosα)/sinα, sqrt(1 - 2 cos²α / (1 + cosα)) ]

But earlier, when calculating c3, we found that this component is approximately 4.43 Å, which for a=10 Å, gives a3 a magnitude of 10 Å. Let's verify:

|a3|² = (10*0.866)^2 + (10*0.232)^2 + (4.43)^2 ≈ (8.66)^2 + (2.32)^2 + (4.43)^2 ≈75 +5.38 +19.62≈100.0

Yes, so |a3|=10 Å. Therefore, the cross product a2 × a3 should indeed have magnitude |a2||a3|sinα =100*0.5=50 Å². However, when we computed the cross product earlier, we got a different result. This suggests an error in the cross product calculation.

Let me recalculate the cross product a2 × a3 with the correct a3.

Given:

a2 = [8.66, 5.0, 0] (since a=10, cos30≈8.66, sin30=5.0)

a3 = [8.66, 2.32, 4.43] (from earlier calculation)

Compute a2 × a3:

|i    j     k|
|8.66 5.0   0|
|8.66 2.32 4.43|

= i*(5.0*4.43 - 0*2.32) - j*(8.66*4.43 - 0*8.66) + k*(8.66*2.32 -5.0*8.66)

= i*(22.15) - j*(38.36) + k*(20.09 -43.3)

= (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(22.15² + (-38.36)² + (-23.21)²) ≈ sqrt(490.8 + 1471.5 + 538.7) ≈ sqrt(2500) =50 Å²

Ah! So the magnitude is indeed 50 Å², which matches |a2||a3|sinα=10*10*0.5=50 Å². Therefore, the earlier calculation of the cross product magnitude was correct, but when we computed V = a1 · (a2 × a3), we got V=221.5 Å³, which is correct.

Therefore, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |b1| = |a2 × a3| / V =50 /221.5≈0.2257 Å⁻¹

But according to the formula a* =1/(a sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α))≈0.902 Å⁻¹, which is different. This inconsistency arises because the formula for a* assumes a different definition.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a* is derived for the hexagonal setting of the rhombohedral lattice, not the primitive rhombohedral axes. This is a common source of confusion.

The rhombohedral lattice can be expressed in terms of a hexagonal unit cell, which has a larger volume. The relationship between the rhombohedral (primitive) and hexagonal (conventional) unit cells is complex. Therefore, the reciprocal lattice parameters might be different depending on the setting.

Given the complexity, perhaps the safest approach is to trust the first method using the interplanar spacing formula for rhombohedral lattices, which gave d≈9.53 Å, and which correctly reduces to the cubic case when α=90°.

Additionally, the reciprocal lattice approach might have errors due to miscalculations in the angles or vector components. Given the time invested and the consistency of the first method with the cubic case, I will conclude that the interplanar distance is approximately 9.53 Å.

However, to ensure accuracy, let's cross-validate with another approach.

Consider that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is the distance between adjacent planes in the (hkl) family. For the (111) plane, this can be found by taking the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g_{hkl}.

Given that the reciprocal lattice vectors are:

b1 = (a2 × a3)/V ≈ (22.15, -38.36, -23.21)/221.5 ≈ (0.1, -0.173, -0.105) Å⁻¹

Similarly, compute b2 and b3:

b2 = (a3 × a1)/V

a3 × a1 = |i    j     k|
          |8.66 2.32 4.43|
          |10    0    0 |

= i*(2.32*0 -4.43*0) - j*(8.66*0 -4.43*10) + k*(8.66*0 -2.32*10)

= i*0 - j*(-44.3) + k*(-23.2)

= (0, 44.3, -23.2)

Divide by V=221.5:

b2 ≈ (0, 0.2, -0.105) Å⁻¹

Similarly, b3 = (a1 × a2)/V

a1 × a2 = |i    j    k|
          |10    0    0|
          |8.66 5.0   0|

= i*(0*0 -0*5.0) - j*(10*0 -0*8.66) + k*(10*5.0 -0*8.66)

= (0, 0, 50)

Divide by V=221.5:

b3 ≈ (0, 0, 0.226) Å⁻¹

Now, the reciprocal lattice vector g_{111} = b1 + b2 + b3 ≈ (0.1 +0 +0, -0.173 +0.2 +0, -0.105 -0.105 +0.226) ≈ (0.1, 0.027, 0.016) Å⁻¹

The magnitude of g is sqrt(0.1² +0.027² +0.016²) ≈ sqrt(0.01 +0.0007 +0.000256) ≈ sqrt(0.010956) ≈0.1047 Å⁻¹

Therefore, d =1/0.1047≈9.55 Å

This matches the first method's result of approximately 9.53 Å. Therefore, the correct interplanar distance is about 9.55 Å.

The earlier mistake in the reciprocal lattice parameters approach was due to using an incorrect formula for a* and α*, likely confusing between different conventions or settings. By directly calculating the reciprocal lattice vectors and summing them for g_{111}, we arrive at the same result as the first method.

Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} is approximately 9.55 Å, which rounds to about 9.5 Å. Given the options for significant figures in the problem (interatomic distance given as 10 Å, angles as 30°), the answer should be expressed with two significant figures, so 9.5 Å.

But let me check the exact calculation:

From the first method:

d =10 * sqrt(0.049 /0.054) ≈10 * sqrt(0.9074)≈10*0.9526≈9.526 Å

From the reciprocal lattice vector calculation:

d≈9.55 Å

Thus, the precise answer is approximately 9.5 Å.

However, to provide an exact answer, let's compute the exact expression:

Numerator: 1 -3 cos²α +2 cos³α =1 -3*(3/4) +2*( (√3)/2 )³ =1 -9/4 +2*(3√3)/8=1 -2.25 + (3√3)/4≈1 -2.25 +1.299≈0.049

Denominator: (h² +k² +l²) sin²α +2(hk +hl +kl)(cos²α -cosα)=3*(1/4) +6*( (3/4) - (√3)/2 )≈0.75 +6*(0.75 -0.866)≈0.75 -0.696≈0.054

Thus, d=10*sqrt(0.049/0.054)=10*sqrt(49/54)=10*(7)/(3√6)=70/(3*2.449)≈70/7.347≈9.53 Å

Expressed exactly, it's 70/(3√6) Å. Rationalizing:

70/(3√6) =70√6/(3*6)=35√6/9≈35*2.449/9≈85.715/9≈9.524 Å

Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.52 Å, which rounds to 9.5 Å. Given the problem's parameters, the answer should be boxed as:

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9.5 \text{ Å}}

The problem states that α = 30°, so cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, and sinα = 1/2.\n\nGiven that, let\'s compute the denominator terms step by step.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α):\n\nLet\'s compute 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 3*(3/4) = 9/4\n\nThird term: 2*( (3√3)/8 ) = (6√3)/8 = (3√3)/4\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 = (4/4 - 9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (3*1.732)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (5.196)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nSo sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217\n\nThen, sinα = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nSo the numerator in the d_{hkl} expression is a * 0.2217\n\nDenominator is 0.5 * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)*(cosα / (1 + cosα)) )\n\nCompute cosα / (1 + cosα) = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = (√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = √3 / (2 + √3)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\n√3*(2 - √3) / [ (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ] = (2√3 - 3) / (4 - 3) = (2√3 - 3)/1 = 2√3 - 3 ≈ 2*1.732 - 3 ≈ 3.464 - 3 ≈ 0.464\n\nTherefore, cosα / (1 + cosα) ≈ 0.464\n\nSo, the denominator becomes 0.5 * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)*0.464 )\n\nFor the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.\n\nCompute h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nCompute 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2(3) = 6\n\nMultiply by 0.464: 6 * 0.464 ≈ 2.784\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the sqrt is 3 + 2.784 = 5.784\n\nThus, sqrt(5.784) ≈ 2.405\n\nTherefore, denominator ≈ 0.5 * 2.405 ≈ 1.2025\n\nTherefore, d_{hkl} ≈ (a * 0.2217) / 1.2025\n\nGiven that a = 10 Å,\n\nd_{hkl} ≈ 10 * 0.2217 / 1.2025 ≈ 2.217 / 1.2025 ≈ 1.844 Å\n\nBut wait, this seems quite small. Let me check the calculations again for possible errors.\n\nFirst, let\'s recheck the computation of 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α.\n\nGiven α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute 3 cos²α = 3*(3/4) = 9/4 = 2.25\n\nCompute 2 cos³α = 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3/8) = (6√3)/8 ≈ (6*1.732)/8 ≈ 10.392/8 ≈ 1.299\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049, which is correct.\n\nsqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217, correct.\n\nThen, sinα = 1/2, correct.\n\nThen, cosα / (1 + cosα) = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = √3/(2 + √3) ≈ 1.732 / (2 + 1.732) ≈ 1.732 / 3.732 ≈ 0.464, correct.\n\nFor (111):\n\nh² + k² + l² = 3, correct.\n\n2(hk + hl + kl) = 6, correct.\n\nMultiply by 0.464: 6 * 0.464 ≈ 2.784, correct.\n\nSum: 3 + 2.784 = 5.784, sqrt ≈ 2.405, correct.\n\nDenominator: 0.5 * 2.405 ≈ 1.2025, correct.\n\nNumerator: 10 * 0.2217 ≈ 2.217, correct.\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 2.217 / 1.2025 ≈ 1.844 Å.\n\nBut is this reasonable? The interatomic distance is 10 Å, but the interplanar distance for (111) is about 1.8 Å? That seems too small. In cubic systems, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3), which for a = 10 Å would be ~5.77 Å. But here, with angles of 30°, the planes are much closer? That seems counterintuitive. Maybe the formula is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal lattice calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the lattice parameter a. Wait, the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance could refer to the edge length of the rhombohedron, which is the lattice parameter a. So, if the edges are 10 Å, then a = 10 Å. But in that case, the interplanar distance being 1.8 Å seems too small. Maybe the formula is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ) / (1 + 3 cosα )\n\nWait, that doesn\'t seem right. Let me check another source.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) )\n\nBut let\'s test this formula with the given values.\n\nGiven a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111.\n\nCompute numerator: a = 10\n\nDenominator: sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) sin²30 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cos30 - cos²30) )\n\nCompute sin²30 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nSo first term: 3 * 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSecond term: 2*(3)*(cos30 - cos²30)\n\nCompute cos30 = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, cos²30 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nThus, cos30 - cos²30 ≈ 0.8660 - 0.75 = 0.1160\n\nMultiply by 2*3: 6 * 0.1160 ≈ 0.696\n\nTotal denominator: sqrt(0.75 + 0.696) = sqrt(1.446) ≈ 1.202\n\nTherefore, d_{hkl} = 10 / 1.202 ≈ 8.32 Å\n\nThis is more reasonable. So, this formula gives d ≈ 8.32 Å. But where did I get this formula from? It seems different from the previous approach.\n\nWait, this formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) )\n\nBut how was this derived? It seems like a simplified version of the general triclinic formula, adjusted for the rhombohedral symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the correct formula. Let me check the units. The denominator is in terms of sqrt( [dimensionless] ), so the units of d would be in Angstroms, which is correct.\n\nGiven that, with a = 10, and the denominator sqrt(1.446) ≈ 1.202, so d ≈ 10 / 1.202 ≈ 8.32 Å. This seems more plausible than the previous 1.8 Å. So, which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, let\'s check with another approach. Let\'s consider the volume of the unit cell. For a rhombohedron, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α). For α = 30°, compute this:\n\nV = 10³ * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )³ )\n\n= 1000 * sqrt(1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 )\n\n= 1000 * sqrt( (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8 )\n\n= 1000 * sqrt( (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 )\n\n≈ 1000 * sqrt( (-1.25) + 1.299 )\n\n≈ 1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³\n\nNow, the (111) plane. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is related to the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |G| is sqrt(h² b1² + k² b2² + l² b3² + 2hk b1·b2 + 2hl b1·b3 + 2kl b2·b3 )\n\nBut in the rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors have the same angles, but different lengths? Wait, no. The reciprocal lattice of a rhombohedral lattice is also rhombohedral, but with different parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between d-spacing and the unit cell volume. The formula for d-spacing in any crystal system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = V / sqrt( |F| )\n\nWhere |F| is the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors related to the plane. But I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, use the metric tensor approach. For a triclinic system, the general formula is:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² b² c² sin²α + k² a² c² sin²β + l² a² b² sin²γ + 2hk a b c² (cosα cosβ - cosγ) + 2hl a b² c (cosα cosγ - cosβ) + 2kl a² b c (cosβ cosγ - cosα) ]\n\nBut this is very complex. However, in the rhombohedral case, since a = b = c and α = β = γ, this formula simplifies.\n\nLet me substitute a = b = c = 10 Å, α = β = γ = 30°.\n\nFirst, compute V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 221.7 Å³ as before.\n\nNow, compute 1/d²:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² a² a² sin²α + k² a² a² sin²α + l² a² a² sin²α + 2hk a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) + 2hl a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) + 2kl a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst three terms: (h² + k² + l²) a^4 sin²α\n\nNext three terms: 2(hk + hl + kl) a^4 (cos²α - cosα)\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ a^4 sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]\n\nFactor out a^4:\n\n1/d² = (a^4 / V²) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]\n\nBut V² = a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/d² = (a^4 / a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/d² = (1 / a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nThis seems to be the correct formula. Let\'s apply this to our problem.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 10 Å\n\nα = 30°, so cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sinα = 1/2\n\nhkl = 111, so h = k = l = 1\n\nCompute numerator inside the sqrt: (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 0.049 as before\n\nDenominator inside the sqrt: sin²α (1 + 1 + 1) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\n\nCompute sin²α * 3 = (0.25) * 3 = 0.75\n\nCompute 2 (cos²α - cosα) * 3 = 6 ( (3/4) - (√3/2) ) ≈ 6 (0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 6 (-0.116) ≈ -0.696\n\nTherefore, denominator inside sqrt: 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\nTherefore, d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nWait, this is different from the previous results. So, according to this formula, d ≈ 9.52 Å. But this contradicts the previous formula\'s result of ≈8.32 Å. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let\'s compute 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952, so 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å.\n\nBut this is still confusing. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula derived from the triclinic system is:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nBut in our case, the denominator inside the sqrt is sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl)\n\nFor hkl = 111:\n\nDenominator = 3 sin²α + 6 (cos²α - cosα)\n\nWith α = 30°, sin²α = 0.25, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, cos²α = 0.75\n\nTherefore:\n\nDenominator = 3*0.25 + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) = 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α ≈ 0.049\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952\n\nThus, d ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nBut this is different from the previous formula\'s result. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the denominator. Let\'s recheck:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt:\n\nsin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl)\n\n= 0.25 * 3 + 2*(0.75 - 0.866)*3\n\n= 0.75 + 2*(-0.116)*3\n\n= 0.75 - 0.696\n\n= 0.054\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 0.049\n\nSo 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907, sqrt ≈ 0.952, so d ≈ 9.52 Å.\n\nBut this is still conflicting with the other formula. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider the volume approach. The volume of the unit cell is V ≈ 221.7 Å³. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is related to the volume and the area of the (hkl) plane. But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice method. The reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system can be calculated as follows:\n\na* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)\n\ncosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α)\n\nGiven a = 10 Å, α = 30°, compute a*:\n\na* = (2π / 10) * (0.5) / sqrt(0.049) ≈ (0.6283) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.31415 / 0.2217 ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹\n\ncosα* = (0.866 - 0.75) / (1 - 0.75) = 0.116 / 0.25 = 0.464\n\nTherefore, α* = arccos(0.464) ≈ 62.3°\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector magnitude for (111):\n\n|G| = sqrt( (1*a*)^2 + (1*a*)^2 + (1*a*)^2 + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) )\n\n= sqrt( 3a*² + 6a*² cosα* )\n\n= a* sqrt(3 + 6 cosα* )\n\nSubstituting a* ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹ and cosα* ≈ 0.464:\n\nsqrt(3 + 6*0.464) = sqrt(3 + 2.784) = sqrt(5.784) ≈ 2.405\n\nTherefore, |G| ≈ 1.416 * 2.405 ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹\n\nTherefore, d_{hkl} = 2π / |G| ≈ 6.2832 / 3.406 ≈ 1.844 Å\n\nWait, this brings us back to the initial result of approximately 1.84 Å, which conflicts with the other formula\'s result of 9.52 Å. This is a problem. There\'s a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of the reciprocal lattice in the rhombohedral system. Let me check the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters are given by:\n\na* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)\n\nα* = arccos( (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α) )\n\nBut when I calculated a* for a = 10 Å, α = 30°, I got a* ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹, which is correct.\n\nThen, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude for (111) is |G| ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹, so d = 2π / |G| ≈ 1.84 Å. But this seems too small. However, if the direct lattice parameter a is 10 Å, and the reciprocal lattice parameter a* is 1.416 Å⁻¹, then the product a * a* = 10 * 1.416 ≈ 14.16, which is not 2π. In cubic systems, a* = 2π/a, so a * a* = 2π. But in rhombohedral systems, this relation doesn\'t hold directly because the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with different angles.\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is not simply 2π/a, but depends on the angles as well. Therefore, the calculation leading to d ≈ 1.84 Å might be correct, but it\'s counterintuitive because the interplanar distance is much smaller than the lattice parameter. However, in highly oblique lattices, this can happen. For example, in a cubic lattice, the (111) planes are spaced at a/sqrt(3), but if the angles between axes are smaller (like 30°), the planes could be much closer.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider a simple case where α = 90°, which would make the lattice cubic. Then, check if the formula gives the correct result.\n\nIf α = 90°, then cosα = 0, sinα = 1.\n\nCompute the formula:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 0 + 0) / [1*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(0 - 0)(hk + hl + kl) ]) = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²)\n\nWhich is the correct cubic formula. So, for α = 90°, the formula works.\n\nNow, let\'s test with α = 60°, which is another common angle.\n\nFor α = 60°, cosα = 0.5, sinα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nCompute the formula for (111):\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125) = 1 - 0.75 + 0.25 = 0.5\n\nDenominator inside sqrt: 3*(0.75) + 6*(0.25 - 0.5) = 2.25 + 6*(-0.25) = 2.25 - 1.5 = 0.75\n\nTherefore, d = a * sqrt(0.5 / 0.75) = a * sqrt(2/3) ≈ a * 0.816\n\nFor a = 10 Å, d ≈ 8.16 Å. In a face-centered cubic lattice with α = 60°, the (111) spacing would be similar to the cubic case, but here it\'s different. However, this might be correct for a rhombohedral lattice with α = 60°.\n\nBut returning to our original problem with α = 30°, the formula gives d ≈ 9.52 Å, while the reciprocal lattice approach gives d ≈ 1.84 Å. This discrepancy suggests that there\'s a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between the direct and reciprocal space. The reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |G| is inversely proportional to the interplanar distance d, but in the formula derived from the triclinic system, we have d = 2π / |G|. However, in crystallography, the relation is d = 1 / |G|, because the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. Wait, this might be the key.\n\nIn physics, reciprocal lattice vectors often include a factor of 2π, such that G = 2π (h b1 + k b2 + l b3), where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal basis vectors. In crystallography, sometimes the 2π factor is omitted, leading to different expressions. This could explain the discrepancy.\n\nIf in the reciprocal lattice calculation, we omit the 2π factor, then |G| would be 3.406 Å⁻¹, and d = 1 / |G| ≈ 0.293 Å, which is even smaller. But that can\'t be.\n\nAlternatively, if the reciprocal lattice vectors in crystallography are defined with the 2π factor, then |G| = 2π / d. Therefore, d = 2π / |G|. But in our previous calculation, we computed |G| ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹, leading to d ≈ 1.84 Å. However, if the formula from the triclinic system gives d ≈ 9.52 Å, there\'s a factor of roughly 5 difference. This suggests a fundamental error in one of the methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter a is incorrect. The problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance along the edges is the lattice parameter a. However, the nearest neighbor distance might not be along the edge if the angles are acute. For example, in a rhombohedral lattice with α < 90°, the shortest distance between atoms might be along a face diagonal or space diagonal rather than the edge.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. The interatomic distance is defined as the shortest distance between two atoms in the crystal. In a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30°, the edge length is a = 10 Å, but the shortest distance between atoms might not be along the edge. Let\'s verify this.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, each atom has neighbors along the edges of the rhombohedron at distance a, but also neighbors across the faces and through the space diagonal. The distances can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Edge length: a = 10 Å\n\n- Face diagonal: The distance between two atoms connected by a face diagonal. In a rhombohedron, each face is a rhombus with sides of length a and angle α. The length of the face diagonal can be calculated using the law of cosines: d_face = sqrt(a² + a² - 2 a² cosα) = a sqrt(2 - 2 cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, d_face = 10 sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) ≈ 10 sqrt(2 - 1.732) ≈ 10 sqrt(0.268) ≈ 10 * 0.517 ≈ 5.17 Å\n\n- Space diagonal: The distance through the center of the rhombohedron. The space diagonal can be calculated using the formula derived from the vector sum: d_space = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, d_space = 10 sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) ≈ 10 sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ 10 sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 * 2.864 ≈ 28.64 Å\n\nTherefore, the shortest interatomic distance is actually the face diagonal, which is approximately 5.17 Å, not the edge length of 10 Å. This contradicts the problem statement which says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nIf the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Å, then this should be the shortest distance between atoms. Therefore, in this case, the edge length a cannot be 10 Å, because the face diagonal is shorter. Therefore, the given interatomic distance of 10 Å must correspond to the shortest distance, which is the face diagonal. Therefore, we need to adjust the lattice parameter a accordingly.\n\nGiven that the face diagonal is 10 Å, we can solve for a:\n\nd_face = a sqrt(2 - 2 cosα) = 10 Å\n\nTherefore,\n\na = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2 cosα)\n\nGiven α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute denominator: sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) = sqrt(2 - √3) ≈ sqrt(2 - 1.732) ≈ sqrt(0.268) ≈ 0.517\n\nTherefore,\n\na = 10 / 0.517 ≈ 19.34 Å\n\nTherefore, the lattice parameter a is approximately 19.34 Å, not 10 Å. The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which is the face diagonal. Therefore, the edge length a is ~19.34 Å.\n\nThis changes everything. The initial assumption that a = 10 Å was incorrect. The interatomic distance refers to the shortest distance between atoms, which in this case is the face diagonal. Therefore, we need to recalculate the lattice parameter a first.\n\nSo, first, compute a from the given interatomic distance (shortest) of 10 Å.\n\nAs above, a = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2 cosα) = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(2 - √3) ≈ 10 / 0.517 ≈ 19.34 Å\n\nNow, with a ≈ 19.34 Å and α = 30°, compute the interplanar distance d_{111} using the formula derived earlier:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\na ≈ 19.34 Å\n\ncosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sinα = 0.5\n\nh = k = l = 1\n\nCompute numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator inside sqrt: 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) ≈ 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = 19.34 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 19.34 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 19.34 * 0.952 ≈ 18.42 Å\n\nAlternatively, using the reciprocal lattice approach with the corrected a:\n\nCompute V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ (19.34)^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 7234 * 0.2217 ≈ 1603 Å³\n\nCompute reciprocal lattice parameter a* = (2π / a) * sinα / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ (6.283 / 19.34) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ (0.3249) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.1624 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.732 Å⁻¹\n\ncosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α) ≈ (0.866 - 0.75) / (1 - 0.75) ≈ 0.116 / 0.25 ≈ 0.464\n\nCompute |G| for (111):\n\n|G| = a* sqrt(3 + 6 cosα*) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(3 + 6*0.464) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(3 + 2.784) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(5.784) ≈ 0.732 * 2.405 ≈ 1.761 Å⁻¹\n\nTherefore, d = 2π / |G| ≈ 6.283 / 1.761 ≈ 3.57 Å\n\nBut this still conflicts with the previous result of ~18.42 Å. There\'s a clear inconsistency here. What\'s the issue?\n\nWait, if the interatomic distance is the face diagonal (10 Å), then the edge length a is ~19.34 Å. Using the formula from the triclinic system, we get d ≈ 18.42 Å, which is larger than the edge length, which doesn\'t make sense. The interplanar distance cannot be larger than the unit cell dimension. Therefore, this suggests an error in the formula application.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the interplanar distance can indeed be larger than the edge length if the planes are not aligned with the cell edges. However, this is unlikely. The (111) planes in a rhombohedral lattice would typically have a spacing smaller than the unit cell edge.\n\nAlternatively, the confusion arises from the definition of the interplanar distance in non-orthogonal lattices. In such cases, the interplanar distance is the perpendicular distance between the planes, which might not correspond to a direct translation along a crystal axis.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the conflicting results from different methods, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system when the interatomic distance (shortest) is given.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s refer to a standard reference. According to crystallography tables, the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]\n\nTherefore, solving for d:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] )\n\nGiven that, and using the corrected a = 19.34 Å, we can compute d.\n\nCompute numerator: 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator: (3) * (0.25) + 2*(3)*(0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) ≈ 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = 19.34 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 19.34 * 0.952 ≈ 18.42 Å\n\nBut this is larger than the edge length a = 19.34 Å, which is possible if the planes are not aligned with the cell edges. However, this seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and the interplanar distance is indeed close to the unit cell edge length.\n\nAlternatively, if the interatomic distance is along the edge (a = 10 Å), then the face diagonal is shorter, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the problem must define the interatomic distance as the edge length, even if it\'s not the shortest. This is possible if the structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the edges, but with α = 30°, that\'s not the case. Therefore, there\'s ambiguity in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", and given that in a rhombohedral lattice, the edge length is a, and the shortest distance is the face diagonal, there\'s a contradiction. However, if we proceed with the assumption that a = 10 Å (edge length), despite the face diagonal being shorter, then using the formula:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nWith a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111:\n\nd ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nAlternatively, using the reciprocal lattice approach with a = 10 Å, we get d ≈ 1.84 Å. This discrepancy suggests that the problem statement might have an inconsistency, or there\'s a misunderstanding in the parameters.\n\nGiven that the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which in a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30° would imply the edge length a is larger than 10 Å, but this complicates the calculation beyond the scope of a standard problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the interatomic distance is the edge length a = 10 Å, even though it\'s not the shortest distance, and expects the use of the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system.\n\nGiven that, and using the formula:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nWith a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111:\n\nd ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nRounding to two decimal places, approximately 9.5 Å. However, this is still a rough calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the formula from the reciprocal lattice approach, assuming a = 10 Å:\n\nd ≈ 1.84 Å, but this is likely incorrect due to the reciprocal lattice vector calculation including the 2π factor.\n\nGiven the confusion and the potential for different interpretations, the most plausible answer, considering the problem likely expects a straightforward application of the rhombohedral interplanar distance formula with a = 10 Å, is approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the options and standard formulae, the correct answer might be expected to be 10 Å divided by sqrt(3), but adjusted for the angle.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider the possibility that the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30° is calculated similarly to the cubic case but scaled by the angle.\n\nIn cubic, d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a = 10 Å. But with α = 30°, the spacing would be different. However, without a clear formula, it\'s challenging.\n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent and the conflicting results, I think the most reasonable answer based on the triclinic-derived formula is approximately 9.5 Å. However, since this is a rhombohedral system, perhaps there\'s a standard formula that I\'m missing.\n\nUpon further research, I found that in rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane can be calculated using:\n\nd_{111} = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)\n\nGiven a = 10 Å and α = 30°, cosα = √3/2:\n\nd_{111} = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ 10 / sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Å\n\nBut this contradicts previous results. Alternatively, this formula might be applicable for certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, another source suggests that in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα )\n\nFor (111):\n\nd_{111} = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30°) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 3.49 Å\n\nThis result is different from previous calculations but aligns with some sources. However, this formula assumes a different derivation, possibly for a face-centered lattice.\n\nGiven the confusion and multiple formulae, I need to determine which is correct. Let\'s verify with α = 60°, which for a face-centered cubic lattice (which is a rhombohedral lattice with α = 60°), the (111) interplanar distance should be a / sqrt(3). For a = 10 Å, d = 5.77 Å. Using the formula:\n\nd = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*0.5) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3) = 10 / sqrt(6) ≈ 4.08 Å, which is incorrect. Therefore, this formula is not valid for the face-centered cubic case.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula for the face-centered cubic (which is a special case of rhombohedral with α = 60°) is d_{111} = a / sqrt(3), which is 5.77 Å for a = 10. Therefore, the formula d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cosα) is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time I\'ve invested and the lack of a definitive formula, I think the safest answer, considering the problem\'s parameters and assuming the interatomic distance is the edge length a = 10 Å, is to use the triclinic-derived formula:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nd ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nRounding to two significant figures, approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the problem\'s angles and parameters, this seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if the interatomic distance is the face diagonal (10 Å), then a ≈ 19.34 Å, leading to d ≈ 18.42 Å. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, and assuming this is the edge length (despite the shorter face diagonal), the answer is approximately 9.5 Å. However, without clarification, this remains uncertain.\n\nAfter careful consideration and multiple approaches, the most consistent result using the triclinic formula with a = 10 Å is approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the potential for error in assumptions, I will present the answer as approximately 9.5 Å, but I\'m aware of the ambiguity in the problem\'s parameters.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \\boxed{9.5 \\text{ Å}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745448710, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=11041, prompt_tokens=2077, total_tokens=13118, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we need to use the appropriate formula for a rhombohedral lattice. 

Given:
- Interatomic distance (edge length) \( a = 10 \) Å
- Angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- Miller indices (hkl) = (111)

The formula for the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) in a rhombohedral lattice is derived from the triclinic system and is given by:

\[
d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{ \frac{1 - 3 \cos^2 \alpha + 2 \cos^3 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl)(\cos^2 \alpha - \cos \alpha)} }
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( a = 10 \) Å
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)
- \( \sin 30^\circ = 0.5 \)
- \( h = k = l = 1 \)

First, calculate the numerator inside the square root:
\[
1 - 3 \cos^2 30^\circ + 2 \cos^3 30^\circ = 1 - 3 \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) + 2 \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \approx 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 \approx 0.049
\]

Next, calculate the denominator inside the square root:
\[
\sin^2 30^\circ (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2 (1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)(\cos^2 30^\circ - \cos 30^\circ)
\]
\[
= 0.25 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3 \left( 0.75 - 0.866 \right) \approx 0.75 + 6 \cdot (-0.116) \approx 0.75 - 0.696 \approx 0.054
\]

Now, compute the interplanar distance:
\[
d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{ \frac{0.049}{0.054} } \approx 10 \sqrt{0.907} \approx 10 \cdot 0.952 \approx 9.52 \text{ Å}
\]

Rounding to a reasonable significant figure, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane is:

\[
\boxed{9.5 \text{ Å}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Let me check some references.

Upon recalling, the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos²α - cosα) ) )

But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, another formula is:

1/d² = ( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) ) / (a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) )

This seems more plausible. Let me verify the derivation.

Given that the reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system can be complex, but since all angles and edges are equal, perhaps the formula can be simplified.

Alternatively, using the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral. The reciprocal lattice parameters a* and α* can be calculated from the direct parameters a and α.

The reciprocal lattice parameters are given by:

a* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

and

cosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α)

But I need to check this. Alternatively, the volume of the unit cell V is:

V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

Then, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector |G| for the (hkl) plane is:

|G| = sqrt( h² a*² + k² a*² + l² a*² + 2 hk a*² cosα* + 2 hl a*² cosα* + 2 kl a*² cosα* )

But since a* is the same for all axes and angles in reciprocal space are α*, this can be factored as:

|G| = a* sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα* )

Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} = 2π / |G| = 2π / [ a* sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα* ) ]

But since a* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α), substituting:

d_{hkl} = 2π / [ (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα* ) ) ]

Simplify:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sinα * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα* ) ]

But we need to express cosα* in terms of α. From the relation:

cosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α) = [cosα (1 - cosα)] / (1 - cos²α) = cosα / (1 + cosα)

Wait, let's check:

If cosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α)

Factor numerator: cosα(1 - cosα)

Denominator: (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)

Thus, cosα* = [cosα(1 - cosα)] / [ (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα) ) ] = cosα / (1 + cosα)

Therefore, cosα* = cosα / (1 + cosα)

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sinα * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * (cosα / (1 + cosα)) ) ]

This is getting quite involved. Let me see if I can substitute the given values. The problem states that α = 30°, so cosα = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, and sinα = 1/2.

Given that, let's compute the denominator terms step by step.

First, compute sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α):

Let's compute 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3

First term: 1

Second term: 3*(3/4) = 9/4

Third term: 2*( (3√3)/8 ) = (6√3)/8 = (3√3)/4

So,

1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 = (4/4 - 9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (3*1.732)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (5.196)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

So sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217

Then, sinα = 1/2 = 0.5

So the numerator in the d_{hkl} expression is a * 0.2217

Denominator is 0.5 * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)*(cosα / (1 + cosα)) )

Compute cosα / (1 + cosα) = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = (√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = √3 / (2 + √3)

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

√3*(2 - √3) / [ (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ] = (2√3 - 3) / (4 - 3) = (2√3 - 3)/1 = 2√3 - 3 ≈ 2*1.732 - 3 ≈ 3.464 - 3 ≈ 0.464

Therefore, cosα / (1 + cosα) ≈ 0.464

So, the denominator becomes 0.5 * sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)*0.464 )

For the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Compute h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Compute 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2(3) = 6

Multiply by 0.464: 6 * 0.464 ≈ 2.784

Therefore, the expression inside the sqrt is 3 + 2.784 = 5.784

Thus, sqrt(5.784) ≈ 2.405

Therefore, denominator ≈ 0.5 * 2.405 ≈ 1.2025

Therefore, d_{hkl} ≈ (a * 0.2217) / 1.2025

Given that a = 10 Å,

d_{hkl} ≈ 10 * 0.2217 / 1.2025 ≈ 2.217 / 1.2025 ≈ 1.844 Å

But wait, this seems quite small. Let me check the calculations again for possible errors.

First, let's recheck the computation of 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α.

Given α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute 3 cos²α = 3*(3/4) = 9/4 = 2.25

Compute 2 cos³α = 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3/8) = (6√3)/8 ≈ (6*1.732)/8 ≈ 10.392/8 ≈ 1.299

Therefore,

1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049, which is correct.

sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217, correct.

Then, sinα = 1/2, correct.

Then, cosα / (1 + cosα) = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = √3/(2 + √3) ≈ 1.732 / (2 + 1.732) ≈ 1.732 / 3.732 ≈ 0.464, correct.

For (111):

h² + k² + l² = 3, correct.

2(hk + hl + kl) = 6, correct.

Multiply by 0.464: 6 * 0.464 ≈ 2.784, correct.

Sum: 3 + 2.784 = 5.784, sqrt ≈ 2.405, correct.

Denominator: 0.5 * 2.405 ≈ 1.2025, correct.

Numerator: 10 * 0.2217 ≈ 2.217, correct.

Therefore, d ≈ 2.217 / 1.2025 ≈ 1.844 Å.

But is this reasonable? The interatomic distance is 10 Å, but the interplanar distance for (111) is about 1.8 Å? That seems too small. In cubic systems, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3), which for a = 10 Å would be ~5.77 Å. But here, with angles of 30°, the planes are much closer? That seems counterintuitive. Maybe the formula is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal lattice calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the lattice parameter a. Wait, the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance could refer to the edge length of the rhombohedron, which is the lattice parameter a. So, if the edges are 10 Å, then a = 10 Å. But in that case, the interplanar distance being 1.8 Å seems too small. Maybe the formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ) / (1 + 3 cosα )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check another source.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) )

But let's test this formula with the given values.

Given a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111.

Compute numerator: a = 10

Denominator: sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) sin²30 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cos30 - cos²30) )

Compute sin²30 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25

So first term: 3 * 0.25 = 0.75

Second term: 2*(3)*(cos30 - cos²30)

Compute cos30 = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, cos²30 = 3/4 = 0.75

Thus, cos30 - cos²30 ≈ 0.8660 - 0.75 = 0.1160

Multiply by 2*3: 6 * 0.1160 ≈ 0.696

Total denominator: sqrt(0.75 + 0.696) = sqrt(1.446) ≈ 1.202

Therefore, d_{hkl} = 10 / 1.202 ≈ 8.32 Å

This is more reasonable. So, this formula gives d ≈ 8.32 Å. But where did I get this formula from? It seems different from the previous approach.

Wait, this formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cosα - cos²α) )

But how was this derived? It seems like a simplified version of the general triclinic formula, adjusted for the rhombohedral symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps this is the correct formula. Let me check the units. The denominator is in terms of sqrt( [dimensionless] ), so the units of d would be in Angstroms, which is correct.

Given that, with a = 10, and the denominator sqrt(1.446) ≈ 1.202, so d ≈ 10 / 1.202 ≈ 8.32 Å. This seems more plausible than the previous 1.8 Å. So, which one is correct?

Alternatively, let's check with another approach. Let's consider the volume of the unit cell. For a rhombohedron, the volume V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α). For α = 30°, compute this:

V = 10³ * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )³ )

= 1000 * sqrt(1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 )

= 1000 * sqrt( (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8 )

= 1000 * sqrt( (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 )

≈ 1000 * sqrt( (-1.25) + 1.299 )

≈ 1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Now, the (111) plane. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is related to the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |G| is sqrt(h² b1² + k² b2² + l² b3² + 2hk b1·b2 + 2hl b1·b3 + 2kl b2·b3 )

But in the rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors have the same angles, but different lengths? Wait, no. The reciprocal lattice of a rhombohedral lattice is also rhombohedral, but with different parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between d-spacing and the unit cell volume. The formula for d-spacing in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = V / sqrt( |F| )

Where |F| is the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors related to the plane. But I might be misremembering.

Alternatively, use the metric tensor approach. For a triclinic system, the general formula is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² b² c² sin²α + k² a² c² sin²β + l² a² b² sin²γ + 2hk a b c² (cosα cosβ - cosγ) + 2hl a b² c (cosα cosγ - cosβ) + 2kl a² b c (cosβ cosγ - cosα) ]

But this is very complex. However, in the rhombohedral case, since a = b = c and α = β = γ, this formula simplifies.

Let me substitute a = b = c = 10 Å, α = β = γ = 30°.

First, compute V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 221.7 Å³ as before.

Now, compute 1/d²:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² a² a² sin²α + k² a² a² sin²α + l² a² a² sin²α + 2hk a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) + 2hl a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) + 2kl a a a² (cosα cosα - cosα) ]

Simplify each term:

First three terms: (h² + k² + l²) a^4 sin²α

Next three terms: 2(hk + hl + kl) a^4 (cos²α - cosα)

Therefore,

1/d² = (1/V²) [ a^4 sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]

Factor out a^4:

1/d² = (a^4 / V²) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]

But V² = a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

Therefore,

1/d² = (a^4 / a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]

Simplify:

1/d² = (1 / a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)) [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ]

Therefore,

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

This seems to be the correct formula. Let's apply this to our problem.

Given:

a = 10 Å

α = 30°, so cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sinα = 1/2

hkl = 111, so h = k = l = 1

Compute numerator inside the sqrt: (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ 0.049 as before

Denominator inside the sqrt: sin²α (1 + 1 + 1) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)

Compute sin²α * 3 = (0.25) * 3 = 0.75

Compute 2 (cos²α - cosα) * 3 = 6 ( (3/4) - (√3/2) ) ≈ 6 (0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 6 (-0.116) ≈ -0.696

Therefore, denominator inside sqrt: 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054

Therefore, d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Wait, this is different from the previous results. So, according to this formula, d ≈ 9.52 Å. But this contradicts the previous formula's result of ≈8.32 Å. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's compute 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952, so 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å.

But this is still confusing. Let me check the formula again.

The formula derived from the triclinic system is:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

But in our case, the denominator inside the sqrt is sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl)

For hkl = 111:

Denominator = 3 sin²α + 6 (cos²α - cosα)

With α = 30°, sin²α = 0.25, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, cos²α = 0.75

Therefore:

Denominator = 3*0.25 + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) = 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054

Numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α ≈ 0.049

Therefore, sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952

Thus, d ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

But this is different from the previous formula's result. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the denominator. Let's recheck:

Denominator inside sqrt:

sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl)

= 0.25 * 3 + 2*(0.75 - 0.866)*3

= 0.75 + 2*(-0.116)*3

= 0.75 - 0.696

= 0.054

Yes, that's correct.

Numerator inside sqrt: 0.049

So 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907, sqrt ≈ 0.952, so d ≈ 9.52 Å.

But this is still conflicting with the other formula. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, let's consider the volume approach. The volume of the unit cell is V ≈ 221.7 Å³. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is related to the volume and the area of the (hkl) plane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice method. The reciprocal lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system can be calculated as follows:

a* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

cosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α)

Given a = 10 Å, α = 30°, compute a*:

a* = (2π / 10) * (0.5) / sqrt(0.049) ≈ (0.6283) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.31415 / 0.2217 ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹

cosα* = (0.866 - 0.75) / (1 - 0.75) = 0.116 / 0.25 = 0.464

Therefore, α* = arccos(0.464) ≈ 62.3°

The reciprocal lattice vector magnitude for (111):

|G| = sqrt( (1*a*)^2 + (1*a*)^2 + (1*a*)^2 + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) + 2*(1*1*a*² cosα* ) )

= sqrt( 3a*² + 6a*² cosα* )

= a* sqrt(3 + 6 cosα* )

Substituting a* ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹ and cosα* ≈ 0.464:

sqrt(3 + 6*0.464) = sqrt(3 + 2.784) = sqrt(5.784) ≈ 2.405

Therefore, |G| ≈ 1.416 * 2.405 ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹

Therefore, d_{hkl} = 2π / |G| ≈ 6.2832 / 3.406 ≈ 1.844 Å

Wait, this brings us back to the initial result of approximately 1.84 Å, which conflicts with the other formula's result of 9.52 Å. This is a problem. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of the reciprocal lattice in the rhombohedral system. Let me check the relation between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters are given by:

a* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α)

α* = arccos( (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α) )

But when I calculated a* for a = 10 Å, α = 30°, I got a* ≈ 1.416 Å⁻¹, which is correct.

Then, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude for (111) is |G| ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹, so d = 2π / |G| ≈ 1.84 Å. But this seems too small. However, if the direct lattice parameter a is 10 Å, and the reciprocal lattice parameter a* is 1.416 Å⁻¹, then the product a * a* = 10 * 1.416 ≈ 14.16, which is not 2π. In cubic systems, a* = 2π/a, so a * a* = 2π. But in rhombohedral systems, this relation doesn't hold directly because the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with different angles.

Therefore, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is not simply 2π/a, but depends on the angles as well. Therefore, the calculation leading to d ≈ 1.84 Å might be correct, but it's counterintuitive because the interplanar distance is much smaller than the lattice parameter. However, in highly oblique lattices, this can happen. For example, in a cubic lattice, the (111) planes are spaced at a/sqrt(3), but if the angles between axes are smaller (like 30°), the planes could be much closer.

Alternatively, let's consider a simple case where α = 90°, which would make the lattice cubic. Then, check if the formula gives the correct result.

If α = 90°, then cosα = 0, sinα = 1.

Compute the formula:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 0 + 0) / [1*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(0 - 0)(hk + hl + kl) ]) = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²)

Which is the correct cubic formula. So, for α = 90°, the formula works.

Now, let's test with α = 60°, which is another common angle.

For α = 60°, cosα = 0.5, sinα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

Compute the formula for (111):

Numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125) = 1 - 0.75 + 0.25 = 0.5

Denominator inside sqrt: 3*(0.75) + 6*(0.25 - 0.5) = 2.25 + 6*(-0.25) = 2.25 - 1.5 = 0.75

Therefore, d = a * sqrt(0.5 / 0.75) = a * sqrt(2/3) ≈ a * 0.816

For a = 10 Å, d ≈ 8.16 Å. In a face-centered cubic lattice with α = 60°, the (111) spacing would be similar to the cubic case, but here it's different. However, this might be correct for a rhombohedral lattice with α = 60°.

But returning to our original problem with α = 30°, the formula gives d ≈ 9.52 Å, while the reciprocal lattice approach gives d ≈ 1.84 Å. This discrepancy suggests that there's a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the direct and reciprocal space. The reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |G| is inversely proportional to the interplanar distance d, but in the formula derived from the triclinic system, we have d = 2π / |G|. However, in crystallography, the relation is d = 1 / |G|, because the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined without the 2π factor. Wait, this might be the key.

In physics, reciprocal lattice vectors often include a factor of 2π, such that G = 2π (h b1 + k b2 + l b3), where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal basis vectors. In crystallography, sometimes the 2π factor is omitted, leading to different expressions. This could explain the discrepancy.

If in the reciprocal lattice calculation, we omit the 2π factor, then |G| would be 3.406 Å⁻¹, and d = 1 / |G| ≈ 0.293 Å, which is even smaller. But that can't be.

Alternatively, if the reciprocal lattice vectors in crystallography are defined with the 2π factor, then |G| = 2π / d. Therefore, d = 2π / |G|. But in our previous calculation, we computed |G| ≈ 3.406 Å⁻¹, leading to d ≈ 1.84 Å. However, if the formula from the triclinic system gives d ≈ 9.52 Å, there's a factor of roughly 5 difference. This suggests a fundamental error in one of the methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter a is incorrect. The problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance along the edges is the lattice parameter a. However, the nearest neighbor distance might not be along the edge if the angles are acute. For example, in a rhombohedral lattice with α < 90°, the shortest distance between atoms might be along a face diagonal or space diagonal rather than the edge.

Wait, this is a critical point. The interatomic distance is defined as the shortest distance between two atoms in the crystal. In a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30°, the edge length is a = 10 Å, but the shortest distance between atoms might not be along the edge. Let's verify this.

In a rhombohedral lattice, each atom has neighbors along the edges of the rhombohedron at distance a, but also neighbors across the faces and through the space diagonal. The distances can be calculated as follows:

- Edge length: a = 10 Å

- Face diagonal: The distance between two atoms connected by a face diagonal. In a rhombohedron, each face is a rhombus with sides of length a and angle α. The length of the face diagonal can be calculated using the law of cosines: d_face = sqrt(a² + a² - 2 a² cosα) = a sqrt(2 - 2 cosα)

For α = 30°, d_face = 10 sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) ≈ 10 sqrt(2 - 1.732) ≈ 10 sqrt(0.268) ≈ 10 * 0.517 ≈ 5.17 Å

- Space diagonal: The distance through the center of the rhombohedron. The space diagonal can be calculated using the formula derived from the vector sum: d_space = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)

For α = 30°, d_space = 10 sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) ≈ 10 sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ 10 sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 * 2.864 ≈ 28.64 Å

Therefore, the shortest interatomic distance is actually the face diagonal, which is approximately 5.17 Å, not the edge length of 10 Å. This contradicts the problem statement which says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

If the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Å, then this should be the shortest distance between atoms. Therefore, in this case, the edge length a cannot be 10 Å, because the face diagonal is shorter. Therefore, the given interatomic distance of 10 Å must correspond to the shortest distance, which is the face diagonal. Therefore, we need to adjust the lattice parameter a accordingly.

Given that the face diagonal is 10 Å, we can solve for a:

d_face = a sqrt(2 - 2 cosα) = 10 Å

Therefore,

a = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2 cosα)

Given α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute denominator: sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) = sqrt(2 - √3) ≈ sqrt(2 - 1.732) ≈ sqrt(0.268) ≈ 0.517

Therefore,

a = 10 / 0.517 ≈ 19.34 Å

Therefore, the lattice parameter a is approximately 19.34 Å, not 10 Å. The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which is the face diagonal. Therefore, the edge length a is ~19.34 Å.

This changes everything. The initial assumption that a = 10 Å was incorrect. The interatomic distance refers to the shortest distance between atoms, which in this case is the face diagonal. Therefore, we need to recalculate the lattice parameter a first.

So, first, compute a from the given interatomic distance (shortest) of 10 Å.

As above, a = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2 cosα) = 10 / sqrt(2 - 2*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(2 - √3) ≈ 10 / 0.517 ≈ 19.34 Å

Now, with a ≈ 19.34 Å and α = 30°, compute the interplanar distance d_{111} using the formula derived earlier:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

Substituting the values:

a ≈ 19.34 Å

cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sinα = 0.5

h = k = l = 1

Compute numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Denominator inside sqrt: 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) ≈ 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Therefore,

d = 19.34 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 19.34 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 19.34 * 0.952 ≈ 18.42 Å

Alternatively, using the reciprocal lattice approach with the corrected a:

Compute V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ (19.34)^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 7234 * 0.2217 ≈ 1603 Å³

Compute reciprocal lattice parameter a* = (2π / a) * sinα / sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ≈ (6.283 / 19.34) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ (0.3249) * 0.5 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.1624 / 0.2217 ≈ 0.732 Å⁻¹

cosα* = (cosα - cos²α) / (1 - cos²α) ≈ (0.866 - 0.75) / (1 - 0.75) ≈ 0.116 / 0.25 ≈ 0.464

Compute |G| for (111):

|G| = a* sqrt(3 + 6 cosα*) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(3 + 6*0.464) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(3 + 2.784) ≈ 0.732 * sqrt(5.784) ≈ 0.732 * 2.405 ≈ 1.761 Å⁻¹

Therefore, d = 2π / |G| ≈ 6.283 / 1.761 ≈ 3.57 Å

But this still conflicts with the previous result of ~18.42 Å. There's a clear inconsistency here. What's the issue?

Wait, if the interatomic distance is the face diagonal (10 Å), then the edge length a is ~19.34 Å. Using the formula from the triclinic system, we get d ≈ 18.42 Å, which is larger than the edge length, which doesn't make sense. The interplanar distance cannot be larger than the unit cell dimension. Therefore, this suggests an error in the formula application.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the interplanar distance can indeed be larger than the edge length if the planes are not aligned with the cell edges. However, this is unlikely. The (111) planes in a rhombohedral lattice would typically have a spacing smaller than the unit cell edge.

Alternatively, the confusion arises from the definition of the interplanar distance in non-orthogonal lattices. In such cases, the interplanar distance is the perpendicular distance between the planes, which might not correspond to a direct translation along a crystal axis.

Given the complexity of the problem and the conflicting results from different methods, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system when the interatomic distance (shortest) is given.

Alternatively, let's refer to a standard reference. According to crystallography tables, the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) ]

Therefore, solving for d:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] )

Given that, and using the corrected a = 19.34 Å, we can compute d.

Compute numerator: 1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α ≈ 0.049

Denominator: (3) * (0.25) + 2*(3)*(0.75 - 0.866) ≈ 0.75 + 6*(-0.116) ≈ 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Therefore,

d = 19.34 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 19.34 * 0.952 ≈ 18.42 Å

But this is larger than the edge length a = 19.34 Å, which is possible if the planes are not aligned with the cell edges. However, this seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and the interplanar distance is indeed close to the unit cell edge length.

Alternatively, if the interatomic distance is along the edge (a = 10 Å), then the face diagonal is shorter, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, the problem must define the interatomic distance as the edge length, even if it's not the shortest. This is possible if the structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the edges, but with α = 30°, that's not the case. Therefore, there's ambiguity in the problem statement.

Given the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", and given that in a rhombohedral lattice, the edge length is a, and the shortest distance is the face diagonal, there's a contradiction. However, if we proceed with the assumption that a = 10 Å (edge length), despite the face diagonal being shorter, then using the formula:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

With a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111:

d ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Alternatively, using the reciprocal lattice approach with a = 10 Å, we get d ≈ 1.84 Å. This discrepancy suggests that the problem statement might have an inconsistency, or there's a misunderstanding in the parameters.

Given that the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which in a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30° would imply the edge length a is larger than 10 Å, but this complicates the calculation beyond the scope of a standard problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the interatomic distance is the edge length a = 10 Å, even though it's not the shortest distance, and expects the use of the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system.

Given that, and using the formula:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

With a = 10 Å, α = 30°, hkl = 111:

d ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Rounding to two decimal places, approximately 9.5 Å. However, this is still a rough calculation.

Alternatively, if we use the formula from the reciprocal lattice approach, assuming a = 10 Å:

d ≈ 1.84 Å, but this is likely incorrect due to the reciprocal lattice vector calculation including the 2π factor.

Given the confusion and the potential for different interpretations, the most plausible answer, considering the problem likely expects a straightforward application of the rhombohedral interplanar distance formula with a = 10 Å, is approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the options and standard formulae, the correct answer might be expected to be 10 Å divided by sqrt(3), but adjusted for the angle.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility that the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral lattice with α = 30° is calculated similarly to the cubic case but scaled by the angle.

In cubic, d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a = 10 Å. But with α = 30°, the spacing would be different. However, without a clear formula, it's challenging.

Given the time I've spent and the conflicting results, I think the most reasonable answer based on the triclinic-derived formula is approximately 9.5 Å. However, since this is a rhombohedral system, perhaps there's a standard formula that I'm missing.

Upon further research, I found that in rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane can be calculated using:

d_{111} = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)

Given a = 10 Å and α = 30°, cosα = √3/2:

d_{111} = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ 10 / sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Å

But this contradicts previous results. Alternatively, this formula might be applicable for certain cases.

Alternatively, another source suggests that in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα )

For (111):

d_{111} = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30°) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 3.49 Å

This result is different from previous calculations but aligns with some sources. However, this formula assumes a different derivation, possibly for a face-centered lattice.

Given the confusion and multiple formulae, I need to determine which is correct. Let's verify with α = 60°, which for a face-centered cubic lattice (which is a rhombohedral lattice with α = 60°), the (111) interplanar distance should be a / sqrt(3). For a = 10 Å, d = 5.77 Å. Using the formula:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*0.5) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3) = 10 / sqrt(6) ≈ 4.08 Å, which is incorrect. Therefore, this formula is not valid for the face-centered cubic case.

Alternatively, the correct formula for the face-centered cubic (which is a special case of rhombohedral with α = 60°) is d_{111} = a / sqrt(3), which is 5.77 Å for a = 10. Therefore, the formula d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cosα) is incorrect.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of a definitive formula, I think the safest answer, considering the problem's parameters and assuming the interatomic distance is the edge length a = 10 Å, is to use the triclinic-derived formula:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

Plugging in the numbers:

d ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Rounding to two significant figures, approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the problem's angles and parameters, this seems plausible.

Alternatively, if the interatomic distance is the face diagonal (10 Å), then a ≈ 19.34 Å, leading to d ≈ 18.42 Å. But this is speculative.

Given the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, and assuming this is the edge length (despite the shorter face diagonal), the answer is approximately 9.5 Å. However, without clarification, this remains uncertain.

After careful consideration and multiple approaches, the most consistent result using the triclinic formula with a = 10 Å is approximately 9.5 Å. However, given the potential for error in assumptions, I will present the answer as approximately 9.5 Å, but I'm aware of the ambiguity in the problem's parameters.


**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.5 \text{ Å}}.
