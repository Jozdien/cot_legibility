In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would differ from their standard form:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original: **∇ · B = 0**  
   Modified: **∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ**  
   This equation now includes a magnetic charge density (ρₘ), allowing for the existence of isolated magnetic poles.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t**  
   Modified: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ**  
   A magnetic current density term (**Jₘ**) is added, analogous to how electric currents influence the magnetic field in Ampère's Law. This accounts for the effects of moving magnetic charges.

The other two equations—**Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ · E = ρₑ/ε₀)** and **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (∇ × B = μ₀Jₑ + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t)**—remain unchanged, as they describe electric charges and currents, which are unaffected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Okay, so I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would be different in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, let me start by recalling the original Maxwell's equations. There are four of them, right? 

First, Gauss's Law for electricity, which says that the divergence of the electric field is equal to the charge density divided by epsilon zero. Then Gauss's Law for magnetism, which is similar but for the magnetic field, stating that the divergence of B is zero. That one is interesting because it implies there are no magnetic monopoles—so if in this parallel universe they do have isolated poles, this equation must change. 

Then there's Faraday's Law of induction, which relates the curl of the electric field to the time derivative of the magnetic field. And finally, Ampère's Circuital Law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current density plus the displacement current. 

So, the question is, which of these would be different if magnetic monopoles existed? Well, in our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0) is the one that enforces no magnetic monopoles. If there were isolated North or South poles, then the divergence of B would not be zero; instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So that equation would definitely change. 

But what about the others? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. In our current equations, Faraday's Law says that a changing magnetic field creates an electric field, and Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's correction) says that a current or a changing electric field creates a magnetic field. If there were magnetic monopoles, would those equations also need to be modified? 

Wait, I remember that if magnetic monopoles exist, then there's a symmetry between electricity and magnetism. So just as moving electric charges produce magnetic fields, moving magnetic charges would produce electric fields? Or maybe there's an additional term in Faraday's Law or Ampère's Law. 

In fact, I think that if magnetic monopoles exist, then Faraday's Law would have a term for magnetic current. Similarly, Ampère's Law would have a term for magnetic current as well. Wait, no. Let me think again. 

In the standard Maxwell equations, the source terms are charge and current for electric fields. If there are magnetic charges (monopoles), then there would be a magnetic charge density and a magnetic current density. So, Gauss's Law for magnetism would have a term with the magnetic charge density, and Ampère's Law (or maybe Faraday's Law) would include the magnetic current density. 

Wait, actually, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become more symmetric. So, the divergence of E is rho_e / epsilon_0, divergence of B is rho_m (magnetic charge density). Then, the curl of E would be related to the time derivative of B plus the magnetic current, and the curl of H would be the current density plus the displacement current plus the magnetic current? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check. 

In the standard form, Faraday's Law is curl E = -dB/dt. If there are magnetic currents, then maybe there's an additional term here. Similarly, Ampère's Law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps that would add a term to Ampère's Law? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall. 

I think that introducing magnetic charge density (rho_m) would modify Gauss's Law for B, making div B = rho_m. Then, the existence of magnetic current density (J_m) would modify Faraday's Law. Because in the same way that a changing electric field (displacement current) is a source for B, a changing magnetic field or a magnetic current would be a source for E. 

So, Faraday's Law would become curl E = -dB/dt - J_m, maybe? And similarly, Ampère's Law would have a term if there's a magnetic current? Wait, no. Let me think. 

In the standard equations, the sources are electric charges and currents. If you have magnetic charges and currents, then the equations would have terms for both. So, the four equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / something (changed)
3. curl E = -dB/dt - J_m (changed)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e (unchanged except for possible J_m?)

Wait, maybe not. Let me check the units. The units of J_e (electric current density) are charge per area per time. For magnetic current density J_m, it would be magnetic charge per area per time. 

In Faraday's Law, the term -dB/dt has units of (Tesla)/second. The curl of E is (Volt/m)/m = (Tesla*m/s)/m = Tesla/s. So, the units match. If we add a term -J_m, which would be (magnetic charge/(m² s)), but magnetic charge would have units of Weber (since B is Tesla, and divergence of B is Weber/m³, so rho_m is Weber/m³). So J_m is Weber/(m² s) = (Tesla*m²)/(m² s) = Tesla/s. So the units of J_m would be Tesla/s, same as dB/dt. So adding -J_m to -dB/dt would make sense. 

Similarly, in Ampère's Law, curl B has units of Tesla/m. The term mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt has units of (H/m)(F/m)*(V/(m*s)) = (H*F)/(m²) * (V/(m*s)). H is V*s/A, F is C/V = A*s/V. So H*F = (V*s/A)*(A*s/V) = s². Then s²/(m²) * (V/(m*s)) = (s² * V)/(m³ s) )= (s*V)/m³. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, since mu_0*epsilon_0 = 1/c², so mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt has units of (1/(m²/s²)) * (V/m)/s = s²/m² * V/(m*s) = V/(m³). Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to recall that in Ampère's Law, the right-hand side is mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. The units of mu_0 J are (H/m)*(A/m²) = (V*s/(A*m))*(A/m²) = V*s/(m³) = (V/m)/s * s² = Telsa/m. Because Tesla is V*s/m². So Tesla/m is (V*s/m²)/m = V*s/m³. And mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt: epsilon_0 has units F/m = C/(V*m), mu_0 has units H/m = V*s/(A*m). So mu_0 epsilon_0 has units (V*s/(A*m))*(C/(V*m)) = (s*C)/(A*m²). Since C is A*s, so (s*A*s)/(A*m²) = s²/m². Then dE/dt has units (V/m)/s = V/(m*s). So mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt is s²/m² * V/(m*s) = (s*V)/(m³). Which is the same as Tesla/m, since Tesla is V*s/m², so Tesla/m is V*s/m³, which is different from (s*V)/m³. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe my unit analysis is off. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that if magnetic monopoles exist, then both Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law would have additional terms. Specifically, Faraday's Law would include a magnetic current term, and Ampère's Law would include a magnetic charge current term? Wait, no. Let me think again. 

In the standard Maxwell equations, the sources are electric charge and current. If you introduce magnetic charge and current, then you need to add terms to the equations that are analogous. So, for Gauss's Law of magnetism, div B = rho_m. For Faraday's Law, which relates curl E to the time derivative of B, if there's a magnetic current, then maybe there's a term similar to the electric current in Ampère's Law. So, curl E = -dB/dt - J_m. And similarly, Ampère's Law would have a term with the displacement current from the magnetic field? Wait, no. 

Wait, in the standard equations, Ampère's Law is:

curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

If there's a magnetic current J_m, then maybe there's a term in the Ampère's Law? Or is it in Faraday's Law? 

Actually, the symmetry suggests that:

- Electric charge density rho_e contributes to div E.
- Magnetic charge density rho_m contributes to div B.
- Electric current J_e contributes to curl B (Ampère's Law).
- Magnetic current J_m contributes to curl E (Faraday's Law).

So, Faraday's Law would become:

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

And Ampère's Law would become:

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

But wait, in this case, only Faraday's Law and Gauss's Law for magnetism are changed. Ampère's Law remains the same? But that doesn't seem symmetric. Because if you have magnetic currents, then maybe there's a term in Ampère's Law as well. 

Alternatively, maybe the full symmetric equations would be:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

But I need to check the units. Let's see. If div B = mu_0 rho_m, then rho_m has units of magnetic charge per volume. Magnetic charge would have units of Weber (since B is Tesla, and flux is Weber). So rho_m is Weber/m³. The divergence of B is Tesla/m, which is Weber/(m²)/m = Weber/m³. So if div B = mu_0 rho_m, then mu_0 has units of (Weber/(m³)) / (Weber/m³) )? Wait, no. Wait, mu_0 has units of H/m = T·m/A. Weber is T·m², so mu_0 is (T·m/A). So if rho_m is Weber/m³, then mu_0 rho_m is (T·m/A)(Weber/m³) = (T·m/A)(T·m²/m³) = T²·m/A·m²/m³ = T²/(A·m²). That doesn't match the units of div B, which is T/m. So maybe there's a different constant. 

Alternatively, perhaps in SI units, the equations with magnetic charges would be written as:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m / epsilon_0 (but this might not be correct)

Wait, maybe the constants are different. Let me recall that in Gaussian units, the equations are symmetric when including magnetic charges, but in SI units, it's a bit more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to introduce a magnetic charge density rho_m and a magnetic current density J_m, and modify Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. 

In that case, the modified equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)

2. div B = mu_0 rho_m (changed)

3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m (changed)

4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e (unchanged except for possible J_m?)

Wait, but if we want symmetry, maybe Ampère's Law would also have a term with the magnetic current? But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the full set becomes:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m / epsilon_0_m (where epsilon_0_m is the magnetic permittivity)

But in reality, since we don't have magnetic charges, we set epsilon_0_m to infinity or something. But in a universe with magnetic charges, we would have a similar constant. 

But perhaps in SI units, the equations are written with different constants. Alternatively, to maintain symmetry, some authors use a formulation where magnetic monopoles are included by adding terms to Faraday's Law and Gauss's Law for B. 

From what I recall, when magnetic monopoles are theorized, the modified Maxwell's equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = mu_0 rho_m

3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

So, in this case, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Equations 1 and 4 remain the same except that equation 4 still has only the electric current and displacement current. 

But wait, that doesn't seem symmetric. If you have magnetic current, why doesn't Ampère's Law get a term? 

Wait, maybe the symmetry is such that:

- Electric charges produce electric fields (Gauss's Law) and currents produce magnetic fields (Ampère's Law).

- Magnetic charges produce magnetic fields (Gauss's Law for B) and magnetic currents produce electric fields (Faraday's Law). 

So, in this way, Faraday's Law would have the magnetic current term, and Ampère's Law remains with the electric current. 

But that still leaves Ampère's Law without a magnetic term. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe both curl equations have terms from both types of currents. But that might complicate things. 

Wait, let's think about the duality transformation. If you swap E -> cB, B -> -E/c, and similarly swap charges and currents, the equations should remain the same. So, in that case, the presence of magnetic charges would require both Faraday and Ampère's Laws to have additional terms. 

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for a more systematic approach. 

In the standard Maxwell equations:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = 0

3. curl E = - dB/dt

4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, we introduce rho_m (magnetic charge density) and J_m (magnetic current density). Then, analogous to how rho_e and J_e affect E and B, rho_m and J_m would affect B and E. 

So, Gauss's Law for B becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m (similar to div E = rho_e / epsilon_0). 

Then, Faraday's Law, which is curl E = - dB/dt, would get a term due to the magnetic current, similar to how Ampère's Law has a term due to electric current. So:

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

And Ampère's Law, which is curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt, would it get a term from the displacement current of the magnetic field? Wait, no, because displacement current is dE/dt. If there's a magnetic displacement current, maybe? But in standard equations, displacement current is the time derivative of the electric field. 

Alternatively, if we consider duality, the equations would be:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m / epsilon_m

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

curl B = mu_e J_e + mu_e epsilon_e dE/dt

But I think in SI units, the constants are related by c^2 = 1/(mu_0 epsilon_0), so introducing magnetic charges would require introducing a magnetic permittivity and permeability. 

But perhaps in the standard treatment, when adding magnetic monopoles, the equations are written as:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

But then the units might not match. Let's check the units for the modified Faraday's Law. curl E is in Tesla/s (since E is V/m, curl E is (V/m)/m = V/m², and 1 V/m² is equivalent to 1 T/s). The term -dB/dt is in Tesla/s. The term -J_m would need to be in Tesla/s as well. If J_m is magnetic current density, which is magnetic charge per area per time. Magnetic charge has units of Weber (since B is Tesla, and flux is Weber, so magnetic charge would be Weber). So J_m is Weber/(m² s) = (Tesla·m²)/(m² s) = Tesla/s. So yes, the units match. 

Similarly, in the modified Gauss's Law for B, div B = rho_m. div B is Tesla/m, and rho_m is magnetic charge density, which is Weber/m³. Since Weber is Tesla·m², rho_m is Tesla·m²/m³ = Tesla/m. So div B (Tesla/m) equals rho_m (Tesla/m), so units match. 

Therefore, the modified equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)

2. div B = rho_m (changed)

3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (changed)

4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt (unchanged)

But wait, equation 2 in SI units originally is div B = 0. If we set div B = rho_m, then rho_m has units of Tesla/m, which is Weber/m³. But in this case, the equation doesn't have a constant like mu_0 or epsilon_0. Is that correct? 

Alternatively, perhaps equation 2 should be div B = mu_0 rho_m, but then the units would be:

mu_0 has units of T·m/A. rho_m is magnetic charge density, which if measured in Weber/m³, and Weber is V·s = T·m², so rho_m is T·m²/m³ = T/m. Then mu_0 rho_m is (T·m/A)(T/m) = T²/A. But div B is T/m, so that doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps equation 2 is div B = rho_m / epsilon_0, but then units would be (T/m) = (Weber/m³)/ (C/(V·m)) ). Hmm, complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe in this parallel universe, they use different units where the equations are more symmetric. But the question is about which equations are different, not the exact form. 

From the analysis, it's clear that Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0) must change to include the magnetic charge density. Additionally, Faraday's Law of induction would need to include a term for the magnetic current density. The other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law, would remain the same unless there's a need to introduce dual terms, but based on standard modifications for magnetic monopoles, only Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law are altered. 

Therefore, the answer should be that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different. But wait, in our earlier consideration, Ampère's Law remains the same. Let me confirm. 

Yes, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is non-zero (Gauss's Law for B changes), and Faraday's Law gets an additional term due to the magnetic current. Ampère's Law, which in our universe includes the displacement current, doesn't need to change because the displacement current is already accounted for by the time derivative of the electric field. The introduction of magnetic current affects Faraday's Law, not Ampère's Law. 

So, to summarize, in a universe with isolated magnetic poles, two of Maxwell's equations change: Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = rho_m) and Faraday's Law (curl E = -dB/dt - J_m). The other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law, remain the same. 

But wait, some sources say that with magnetic monopoles, both Faraday's and Ampère's Laws get additional terms. Let me think again. 

If we consider duality, swapping electric and magnetic fields, then if there are magnetic charges, the equations should mirror each other. So, just as electric charges produce divergence in E and currents produce curl in B, magnetic charges would produce divergence in B and currents (magnetic currents) produce curl in E. 

Therefore, yes, only Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law are modified. Ampère's Law remains as it is because it deals with electric currents, which are separate from magnetic currents. 

Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different. Specifically, Gauss's Law for magnetism gains a magnetic charge density term, and Faraday's Law gains a magnetic current density term. 

So, the two equations that change are:

1. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ (or some constant times ρₘ)

2. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ

The other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law, remain unchanged.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine which of Maxwell's equations would differ in a universe with magnetic monopoles. Let me first recall the standard Maxwell equations.

The four equations are: Gauss's Law for electricity (divergence of electric field equals charge density divided by epsilon zero), Gauss's Law for magnetism (divergence of B equals zero, implying no magnetic monopoles), Faraday's Law (curl of electric field relates to time derivative of magnetic field), and Ampère's Circuital Law with Maxwell's addition (relating magnetic field curl to current density plus displacement current).

If magnetic monopoles existed, Gauss's Law for magnetism would definitely change. Instead of divergence of B equals zero, it would become proportional to magnetic charge density.

But would the other equations change too? If magnetic monopoles exist, there should be symmetry between electricity and magnetism. Just as moving electric charges create magnetic fields, moving magnetic charges would create electric fields.

This means Faraday's Law would need modification to include magnetic current. And similarly, Ampère's Law might need adjustment for magnetic current as well.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the equations would become more symmetric. The divergence of E would still equal electric charge density divided by epsilon_0, while divergence of B would equal magnetic charge density. The curl of E would relate to both the time derivative of B and magnetic current density, while the curl of H would involve electric current density, displacement current, and possibly magnetic current.

In standard form, Faraday's Law is curl E = -dB/dt. With magnetic currents, this might become curl E = -dB/dt - J_m, where J_m is magnetic current density. Similarly, Ampère's Law (curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e) might include additional terms.

The modified equations might look like:
1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / some constant (changed)
3. curl E = -dB/dt - J_m (changed)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e (possibly changed)

I should verify the units of these terms to ensure consistency.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine which of Maxwell's equations would alter in a parallel universe where magnets feature isolated North or South poles. Let me begin by reviewing the original Maxwell's equations, which are four in number.

First, there's Gauss's Law for electricity, which states that the divergence of the electric field equals the charge density divided by epsilon zero. Then there's Gauss's Law for magnetism, related to the magnetic field, indicating that the divergence of B is zero. This is intriguing because it implies the absence of magnetic monopoles, so in this parallel universe with isolated poles, this equation is bound to change.

Next is Faraday's Law of induction, which connects the curl of the electric field to the time derivative of the magnetic field. Lastly, Ampère's Circuital Law with Maxwell's addition ties the curl of the magnetic field to the sum of the current density and the displacement current.

So, which of these would be different if magnetic monopoles existed? In our reality, Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0) enforces the absence of magnetic monopoles. If isolated North or South poles existed, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero; instead, it would align with the magnetic charge density. Thus, that equation would undoubtedly shift.

But what about the others, like Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law? In the current equations, Faraday's Law indicates that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, while Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's modification) shows that a current or a varying electric field creates a magnetic field. Would these equations require alterations if magnetic monopoles were present?

If magnetic monopoles do exist, there's a symmetry between electricity and magnetism. Just as moving electric charges generate magnetic fields, moving magnetic charges would generate electric fields, potentially introducing additional terms in Faraday's Law or Ampère's Law.

If magnetic monopoles are real, Faraday's Law might have a term for magnetic current, and Ampère's Law might also include a magnetic current term. No, wait. Let's reconsider.

In the existing Maxwell equations, source terms for electric fields are charge and current. With magnetic charges (monopoles), there would be a magnetic charge density and magnetic current density. Thus, Gauss's Law for magnetism would include a term with the magnetic charge density, and perhaps Ampère's Law or Faraday's Law would incorporate the magnetic current density.

In a world with magnetic monopoles, the equations become more symmetrical. So, the divergence of E remains rho_e / epsilon_0, while the divergence of B becomes rho_m (magnetic charge density). The curl of E would relate to the time derivative of B plus the magnetic current, and the curl of H would involve the current density, the displacement current, and possibly the magnetic current.

In the standard form, Faraday's Law is curl E = -dB/dt. With magnetic currents, perhaps an extra term appears here. Similarly, Ampère's Law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If there's a magnetic current, it might add a term to Ampère's Law? Or maybe not. Let’s reassess.

The introduction of magnetic charge density (rho_m) would alter Gauss's Law for B, transforming it to div B = rho_m. The presence of magnetic current density (J_m) would modify Faraday's Law because, akin to how a changing electric field (displacement current) sources B, a changing magnetic field or magnetic current would source E.

Thus, Faraday's Law might become curl E = -dB/dt - J_m. And similarly, Ampère's Law could have a term if there's a magnetic current. No, let’s think again.

In the standard equations, electric charges and currents are the sources. If magnetic charges and currents are present, the equations would include terms for both. Therefore, the four equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = rho_m / a factor (changed)
3. curl E = -dB/dt - J_m (changed)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e (maybe modified with J_m?)

Let me recheck the units. The units of J_e (electric current density) are charge per area per time.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would be modified to account for magnetic charge density (ρₘ) and magnetic current density (Jₘ). Specifically, two of the four Maxwell's equations would change:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original: ∇ · **B** = 0  
   Modified: ∇ · **B** = μ₀ρₘ  
   *Reason*: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term for the magnetic field (**B**), analogous to electric charge in Gauss's Law for electricity.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original: ∇ × **E** = −∂**B**/∂t  
   Modified: ∇ × **E** = −∂**B**/∂t − μ₀**Jₘ**  
   *Reason*: A magnetic current (**Jₘ**) would induce an electric field (**E**), similar to how electric currents generate magnetic fields in Ampère's Law.

The other two equations—**Gauss's Law for Electricity** (∇ · **E** = ρₑ/ε₀) and **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition** (∇ × **B** = μ₀ε₀∂**E**/∂t + μ₀**Jₑ**)—remain unchanged, as they describe electric charge and current interactions, which are unaffected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

**Answer**:  
Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction are modified. The equations become:  
1. ∇ · **B** = μ₀ρₘ  
2. ∇ × **E** = −∂**B**/∂t − μ₀**Jₘ**

time. Similarly, J_m would be magnetic charge per area per time. 

In the standard Faraday's Law, curl E = -dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current, then adding a term proportional to J_m would make sense. Similarly, in Ampère's Law, if there's a magnetic charge, would that affect it? Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe only Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified. Because Ampère's Law is about the sources of the magnetic field, which in our universe are electric currents and displacement currents. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps they would appear in Faraday's Law instead. 

Yes, I think that's right. So, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m (or some constant times rho_m)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

So, equations 2 and 3 would be modified. Therefore, in the parallel universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would be different. 

Wait, but in some formulations, the units might be different. For example, in SI units, the equations have constants like mu_0 and epsilon_0. So, if we include magnetic charge, we need to adjust the equations accordingly. 

Alternatively, in Gaussian units, the equations are symmetric except for factors of c. But regardless, the main point is that two equations change: Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. 

But wait, let me confirm. In our universe, the absence of magnetic monopoles is why div B = 0. If they exist, div B is proportional to the magnetic charge density. Then, for Faraday's Law, in our universe, a time-varying B induces a curl in E. If there are magnetic currents, then even in static conditions, a magnetic current would induce a curl in E. So, yes, Faraday's Law would have an additional term. 

But Ampère's Law, which in our universe includes the electric current and displacement current, would remain the same unless there's a need to include magnetic displacement current? Hmm, maybe not. Because Ampère's Law relates to the sources of the magnetic field, which are electric in nature. Magnetic charges would be sources for B, but their movement (magnetic currents) would be sources for E? 

Wait, maybe there's a duality here. Electric charges produce electric fields, and their movement (currents) produce magnetic fields. Similarly, magnetic charges would produce magnetic fields, and their movement (magnetic currents) would produce electric fields. 

But in Maxwell's equations, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B. If there's a magnetic current, that would be another source term for the curl of E. Similarly, the curl of B is related to the current and the time derivative of E. So, if there's a magnetic current, does that affect the curl of B? Or is it only the electric current? 

I think only the electric current affects the curl of B. The magnetic current would affect the curl of E. So, in that case, only equations 2 (div B) and 3 (curl E) would be modified. Equations 1 and 4 would remain the same. 

Therefore, in the parallel universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction would be different. 

But wait, let me check another source in my mind. I remember that when you introduce magnetic monopoles, you have to modify both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So yes, two equations change. 

So, the answer should be that Gauss's Law for magnetism (which becomes div B = rho_m / some constant) and Faraday's Law (which gains a term for magnetic current) are different. The other two equations, Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law, remain the same. 

Therefore, the equations that are different are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become symmetric with respect to electric and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, two of the four Maxwell's equations are modified:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$  
   Modified:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$$  
   Here, \(\rho_m\) is the magnetic charge density, analogous to electric charge density \(\rho_e\).

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$  
   Modified:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m$$  
   The term \(\mathbf{J}_m\) represents the magnetic current density, accounting for the flow of magnetic monopoles.

The other two equations remain structurally unchanged but may include constants for symmetry:

- **Gauss's Law for Electricity**:  
  $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}$$  
  (No change in form.)

- **Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)**:  
  $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e$$  
  (No additional terms unless dual symmetry is enforced, but typically unchanged.)

**Summary**:  
The equations that differ are **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday's Law**, which now include magnetic charge and current terms. This restores symmetry between electric and magnetic fields in the presence of monopoles.

Magnetic charge would have different units than electric charge. Also, the constants (like mu_0, epsilon_0) would need to be adjusted for symmetry.

In standard equations, the absence of magnetic monopoles leads to divergence of B being zero. Introducing monopoles changes that. Also, if there's a magnetic current, Faraday's Law would have an additional term. Ampère's Law might not need a change unless there's a need for symmetry, but in the standard scenario, Ampère's Law already includes displacement current. However, with magnetic monopoles, perhaps Ampère's Law would also need a term for magnetic current, but I think only Faraday's Law would change. Wait, no—if there's a magnetic current, then the curl of E would relate to the time derivative of B plus the magnetic current. Similarly, the curl of H would relate to the time derivative of D plus the electric current. So Ampère's Law would remain as is, unless there's a magnetic current affecting it. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In the standard Maxwell equations, the sources are electric charge and current. If there are magnetic charges and currents, then the equations would have additional terms. The divergence of B would have a magnetic charge density, and the curl of E would have a magnetic current term. The other equations (div E and curl B) would remain as they are, except perhaps Ampère's Law would have a term for magnetic current if we're considering dual symmetry, but I think traditionally, when introducing magnetic monopoles, only Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified. Let me check.

Yes, typically, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations become:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

So Gauss's Law for B now includes magnetic charge density rho_m, and Faraday's Law includes magnetic current density J_m. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain the same except for possible constants. Wait, but in some formulations, the constants might be adjusted for symmetry. For example, if we want to make the equations symmetric, we might have factors involving mu_0 and epsilon_0 in both electric and magnetic equations. But the main point is that two equations change: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law might not need to change unless there's a magnetic displacement current, but in the presence of magnetic current, Faraday's Law is modified. So the answer would be that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different. Wait, but in the standard modification, Ampère's Law remains as is. Let me confirm.

In the standard Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = rho_m (if we set constants appropriately)

3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m

4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

So yes, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (which originally states div B = 0) and Faraday's Law (which originally states curl E = -dB/dt) are different. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain the same in form, though constants might adjust, but the structure doesn't change. Therefore, the equations that are different are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction.

The term in Faraday's Law would need to have the same units as dB/dt. Let's see: dB/dt has units of T/s. J_m (magnetic current density) would be (Wb/m²)/s. Since 1 T = 1 Wb/m², so J_m has units of T/s. Therefore, adding -J_m to -dB/dt would be dimensionally consistent. So, Faraday's Law would have an additional term.\n\nSimilarly, Ampère's Law, which in standard form is curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. If there's a magnetic current, would that affect Ampère's Law? Wait, Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the electric current and displacement current. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps it would appear in Faraday's Law, not Ampère's. So, only Faraday's Law and Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. But wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So, all four equations would have dual terms. But in reality, since we don't have magnetic monopoles, two equations (Gauss for B and Faraday) don't have source terms. If monopoles exist, then Gauss's Law for B gets a source term, and Faraday's Law gets a current term. Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for E remain the same? Or does Ampère's Law also get a term?\n\nWait, let me recall. The full Maxwell equations with magnetic charges and currents are:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = mu_0 rho_m\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut I need to check the factors. Alternatively, some constants might differ. For example, in SI units, the equations with magnetic monopoles would be:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\n2. div B = rho_m (if we set constants appropriately)\n\n3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m\n\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut the exact form might depend on how the magnetic charge and current are defined. Alternatively, some sources introduce a magnetic charge density and a magnetic current density, leading to modifications in both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So, in that case, two equations would change: Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = rho_m) and Faraday's Law (curl E = -dB/dt - J_m). The other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain the same. Wait, but that seems inconsistent with duality. If you have symmetry, then perhaps Ampère's Law would also have a term. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the standard Maxwell equations, the sources are electric charge and current. If you introduce magnetic charge and current, you need to add terms to the equations that are their duals. The electric field's divergence is due to electric charge, so the magnetic field's divergence would be due to magnetic charge. The curl of E is related to the time derivative of B and the magnetic current, similar to how the curl of H is related to the time derivative of D and the electric current. So, in that case, Faraday's Law (curl E) would get a magnetic current term, and Ampère's Law (curl H) would stay with the electric current term. Wait, but in the standard equations, Ampère's Law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If we have magnetic current, would that affect Ampère's Law? Or is the magnetic current only in Faraday's Law?\n\nAlternatively, if we have magnetic charges, then moving magnetic charges (magnetic current) would produce an electric field, similar to how moving electric charges (electric current) produce a magnetic field. Therefore, Faraday's Law would have a term for the magnetic current, and Ampère's Law would remain as is. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, in the fully symmetric Maxwell equations with magnetic charges, all four equations have terms. Let me check a reference in my mind. The standard extension is:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = mu_0 rho_m\n\ncurl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut the exact coefficients depend on unit conventions. The key point is that Gauss's Law for magnetism gains a term proportional to the magnetic charge density, and Faraday's Law gains a term proportional to the magnetic current density. Ampère's Law remains with the electric current and displacement current. Wait, but in some formulations, Ampère's Law might also include a magnetic displacement current? Hmm, no. Let me think.\n\nIn the absence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\n2. div B = 0\n\n3. curl E = - dB/dt\n\n4. curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt\n\nWith magnetic monopoles, the equations become:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\n2. div B = mu_0 rho_m\n\n3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n\n4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt\n\nSo, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Equation 2 now includes the magnetic charge density, and equation 3 includes the magnetic current density. Equations 1 and 4 remain the same. Therefore, in this scenario, two of Maxwell's equations would change: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction. The other two, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, remain unchanged.\n\nBut wait, some sources might present the equations with different constants. For example, in Gaussian units, the equations look different, but in SI units, the modified equations with magnetic monopoles would have div B proportional to rho_m and curl E with a term involving J_m. Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (originally div B = 0) becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m, and Faraday's Law (originally curl E = -dB/dt) becomes curl E = -dB/dt - mu_0 J_m.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would exhibit a duality between electric and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, two of the four equations would change:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original: ∇ · **B** = 0  
   Modified: ∇ · **B** = μ₀ρₘ  
   Here, ρₘ is the magnetic charge density, analogous to electric charge density (ρₑ). This equation now accounts for the existence of isolated magnetic poles.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original: ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t  
   Modified: ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - μ₀**Jₘ**  
   The term **Jₘ** (magnetic current density) is introduced, reflecting how moving magnetic monopoles generate electric fields, similar to how electric currents generate magnetic fields.

The other two equations—**Gauss's Law for Electricity** (∇ · **E** = ρₑ/ε₀) and **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition** (∇ × **B** = μ₀**Jₑ** + μ₀ε₀∂**E**/∂t)—remain unchanged, as they already describe electric charges and currents. The modifications restore symmetry between electricity and magnetism in Maxwell's framework. 

**Answer**:  
Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified. Specifically:  
- ∇ · **B** = μ₀ρₘ (magnetic charge density).  
- ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - μ₀**Jₘ** (magnetic current density).

Similarly, J_m would be magnetic charge per area per time. The term in Faraday's Law would need to have the same units as dB/dt. Let's see: dB/dt has units of T/s. J_m (magnetic current density) would be (Wb/m²)/s. Since 1 T = 1 Wb/m², so J_m has units of T/s. Therefore, adding -J_m to -dB/dt would be dimensionally consistent. So, Faraday's Law would have an additional term.

Similarly, Ampère's Law, which in standard form is curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. If there's a magnetic current, would that affect Ampère's Law? Wait, Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the electric current and displacement current. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps it would appear in Faraday's Law, not Ampère's. So, only Faraday's Law and Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. But wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So, all four equations would have dual terms. But in reality, since we don't have magnetic monopoles, two equations (Gauss for B and Faraday) don't have source terms. If monopoles exist, then Gauss's Law for B gets a source term, and Faraday's Law gets a current term. Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for E remain the same? Or does Ampère's Law also get a term?

Wait, let me recall. The full Maxwell equations with magnetic charges and currents are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

But I need to check the factors. Alternatively, some constants might differ. For example, in SI units, the equations with magnetic monopoles would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = rho_m (if we set constants appropriately)

3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m

4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

But the exact form might depend on how the magnetic charge and current are defined. Alternatively, some sources introduce a magnetic charge density and a magnetic current density, leading to modifications in both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So, in that case, two equations would change: Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = rho_m) and Faraday's Law (curl E = -dB/dt - J_m). The other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain the same. Wait, but that seems inconsistent with duality. If you have symmetry, then perhaps Ampère's Law would also have a term. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the standard Maxwell equations, the sources are electric charge and current. If you introduce magnetic charge and current, you need to add terms to the equations that are their duals. The electric field's divergence is due to electric charge, so the magnetic field's divergence would be due to magnetic charge. The curl of E is related to the time derivative of B and the magnetic current, similar to how the curl of H is related to the time derivative of D and the electric current. So, in that case, Faraday's Law (curl E) would get a magnetic current term, and Ampère's Law (curl H) would stay with the electric current term. Wait, but in the standard equations, Ampère's Law is curl H = J + dD/dt. If we have magnetic current, would that affect Ampère's Law? Or is the magnetic current only in Faraday's Law?

Alternatively, if we have magnetic charges, then moving magnetic charges (magnetic current) would produce an electric field, similar to how moving electric charges (electric current) produce a magnetic field. Therefore, Faraday's Law would have a term for the magnetic current, and Ampère's Law would remain as is. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, in the fully symmetric Maxwell equations with magnetic charges, all four equations have terms. Let me check a reference in my mind. The standard extension is:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

But the exact coefficients depend on unit conventions. The key point is that Gauss's Law for magnetism gains a term proportional to the magnetic charge density, and Faraday's Law gains a term proportional to the magnetic current density. Ampère's Law remains with the electric current and displacement current. Wait, but in some formulations, Ampère's Law might also include a magnetic displacement current? Hmm, no. Let me think.

In the absence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = 0

3. curl E = - dB/dt

4. curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

With magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = mu_0 rho_m

3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

So, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Equation 2 now includes the magnetic charge density, and equation 3 includes the magnetic current density. Equations 1 and 4 remain the same. Therefore, in this scenario, two of Maxwell's equations would change: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction. The other two, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, remain unchanged.

But wait, some sources might present the equations with different constants. For example, in Gaussian units, the equations look different, but in SI units, the modified equations with magnetic monopoles would have div B proportional to rho_m and curl E with a term involving J_m. Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (originally div B = 0) becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m, and Faraday's Law (originally curl E = -dB/dt) becomes curl E = -dB/dt - mu_0 J_m. Hence, two equations are altered.

But the question is, in the parallel universe, which of Maxwell's equations are different? The original four are:

1. Gauss's Law: div E = rho / epsilon_0

2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = 0

3. Faraday's Law: curl E = - dB/dt

4. Ampère's Law: curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and 3 would change. Equation 2 would have a divergence of B proportional to the magnetic charge density, and equation 3 would include a magnetic current term. Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different.

But wait, let me confirm. If there are magnetic monopoles, then in addition to magnetic charge density (affecting Gauss's Law for B), there can be magnetic current density. The magnetic current density would act as a source for the electric field, similar to how electric current density is a source for the magnetic field. Therefore, Faraday's Law, which relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B, would have an additional term due to the magnetic current. So yes, Faraday's Law would change.

Ampère's Law, on the other hand, deals with the curl of B and the electric current. Since Ampère's Law already includes the electric current and displacement current, unless there's a cross-coupling due to magnetic current, it might not change. Therefore, only equations 2 and 3 are modified.

Hence, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles.
