The compound in question is a di-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (COCH₃) and a halogen (Cl) as substituents, totaling 8 carbon atoms. The **1H NMR data** can be deduced as follows:

1. **Methyl Group (COCH₃):**  
   - The methyl protons adjacent to the carbonyl group are deshielded but experience no splitting due to symmetry.  
   - **Signal:** Singlet at δ ~2.6 (3H).

2. **Aromatic Protons Adjacent to Chlorine (Cl):**  
   - These protons (positions 2 and 6) are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing Cl, appearing as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons.  
   - **Signal:** Doublet (J ≈ 8 Hz) at δ ~7.2–7.5 (2H).

3. **Aromatic Protons Adjacent to Carbonyl (COCH₃):**  
   - These protons (positions 3 and 5) are strongly deshielded by the carbonyl group, also forming a doublet from coupling.  
   - **Signal:** Doublet (J ≈ 8 Hz) at δ ~7.8–8.0 (2H).

**Summary of 1H NMR Data:**  
- δ 2.6 (s, 3H)  
- δ 7.2–7.5 (d, 2H)  
- δ 7.8–8.0 (d, 2H)  

This pattern corresponds to **para-substituted 4-chloroacetophenone**, where the symmetry of the para arrangement results in two distinct doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Let me start by breaking down the information.

First, the compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably a benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total carbon atoms are 8, so the benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) plus two substituents that together have 2 carbons. Wait, but substituents can be more than one carbon each. Wait, 8 total carbons. So 6 in the ring, so two substituents with a total of 2 carbons. That would mean each substituent is either a -Cl, -Br, etc. (halogen) and a carbonyl group. Wait, but a carbonyl is a C=O. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen.

But wait, the FTIR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). But the total carbons are 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. The substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), that's two carbons (the carbonyl is part of the acetyl group: O=C-OCH3? Wait, no. Acetyl is COCH3, which is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So that would be two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a different group. For example, a carboxylic acid (COOH) would be two carbons (COOH has one carbon, but wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon (the carbonyl carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen). Wait, no. The carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is one carbon (the C of COOH). So if one substituent is -COOH (carboxylic acid), that's one carbon, and the other substituent is a halogen. Then total carbons would be 6 + 1 + 0 = 7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't work. So maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester group. An ester group is like COOR. If R is a methyl group, then the ester would be OCOCH3. That's two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So that would add two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen. So total carbons 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a ketone (like a propanoyl group?), but wait, a ketone is R-CO-R. If the substituent is a ketone attached to the benzene ring, like acetophenone, which is a benzene ring with a COCH3 group. That's two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen. So that would fit the 8 carbons.

So the structure is likely a para or ortho or meta substituted benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen (like Cl or Br). Now, the NMR data would depend on the substituents' positions and their effects on the aromatic protons.

First, let's consider the substituents. The carbonyl group (COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), and the halogen (let's say Cl) is also an EWG, but depending on the position, they can direct the substituents. But since the question is about NMR, the key points are the chemical shifts and splitting patterns.

In a di-substituted benzene ring, the protons' chemical shifts depend on the substituents' positions. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two EWGs, the remaining protons would be deshielded. But if the substituents are meta or ortho, the patterns would differ.

But let's think about the possible structures. Let's assume the substituents are para. So, for example, para-chloroacetophenone. The structure would be Cl-C6H4-COCH3. In this case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the protons adjacent to the Cl and the COCH3, and the protons opposite. Wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would have Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4. Then the remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. But in para substitution, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl and COCH3, and positions 3 and 5 are meta to both substituents? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it mentally.

If the substituents are para, then each substituent is in the para position relative to the other. So the ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 3 (if meta) or position 4 (para). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's number the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (next to Cl at 1) and 3 and 5 (next to COCH3 at 4). Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). So the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5). But wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the remaining protons are in two equivalent pairs. For example, in para-xylene, the protons are all equivalent as two triplets. But when the substituents are different, like Cl and COCH3, the symmetry is broken, so the protons adjacent to each substituent would have different chemical shifts.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3. Then the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and adjacent to COCH3 (positions 4 and 5), but this might lead to more complex splitting.

But perhaps the key is that the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about the deshielding effects. The COCH3 group is a strong EWG, so the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded (upfield or downfield?). Wait, EWGs cause deshielding, moving the chemical shift to higher ppm. For example, nitro groups are strong EWGs and cause adjacent protons to be around 8.5 ppm. Similarly, a carbonyl group would deshield adjacent protons, leading to higher ppm. Halogens also deshield; Cl is an EWG, so adjacent protons would be deshielded (higher ppm).

So if the substituents are para, the protons adjacent to Cl and COCH3 would each be in different environments. Let's say the protons next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded by Cl, and those next to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded by the carbonyl. The protons in positions 4 and 1 are the substituents themselves. Wait, no, substituents are at 1 and 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). So each of these pairs would be equivalent due to the para symmetry. So in the NMR, we might see two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to Cl and another for those adjacent to COCH3. The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to doublets. Alternatively, if there's more splitting due to coupling with other protons, maybe more complex.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3. Then the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and adjacent to COCH3 (positions 4 and 2?), no, wait. If substituents are at 1 and 3, then the adjacent positions would be 2,6 (for 1) and 2,4 (for 3). Wait, that's overlapping. So position 2 is adjacent to both substituents? That can't be. Wait, no. If substituent A is at 1, adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Substituent B at 3, adjacent positions are 2 and 4. So position 2 is adjacent to both A and B. Then position 4 is adjacent to B, and position 6 is adjacent to A. Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. This would lead to more complex splitting, possibly with each proton in a unique environment, but maybe some equivalence.

But in any case, the para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet, while meta might lead to more peaks. However, the question is about the correct NMR data. Let's think about typical shifts.

The carbonyl group (COCH3) adjacent to the ring would cause the adjacent protons to be around δ 7.8-8.5 ppm, similar to acetophenone, where the protons ortho to the acetyl group are around δ 7.8-8.0. The halogen (Cl) adjacent protons would be around δ 7.0-7.5, depending on the substituent. Wait, chlorobenzene's protons are around δ 7.0-7.4. But if the Cl is adjacent to another EWG, maybe the shift is higher.

Alternatively, let's look up typical shifts. In acetophenone (benzene with COCH3), the ortho protons are around δ 7.8-8.0, the meta around δ 7.4-7.5, and the para (if substituted) would be similar to meta. But in our case, if the substituents are para, then the protons adjacent to Cl and COCH3 would each have their own shifts.

Wait, but in the case of para-substituted benzene with two different EWGs, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be deshielded. For example, in 4-chloroacetophenone (Cl at para to COCH3), the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded by Cl, and those adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded by the carbonyl. So in the NMR, we would expect two doublets: one at higher ppm (for COCH3 adjacent) and one slightly lower (for Cl adjacent). The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to each pair being a doublet. Let's say the COCH3 adjacent protons (positions 3 and 5) are more deshielded (higher ppm) than the Cl adjacent ones (positions 2 and 6). But I need to check typical values.

In acetophenone, the ortho protons to the acetyl are around δ 7.8-8.0, meta around 7.4-7.5. In chlorobenzene, the protons are around δ 7.0-7.4. If the Cl is para to the acetyl, then the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be similar to chlorobenzene's ortho protons, maybe δ 7.2-7.5, and the protons adjacent to acetyl (positions 3 and 5) would be like acetophenone's ortho, δ 7.8-8.0. So in the NMR, we might see two doublets: one around δ 7.9 and another around δ 7.3, each integrating to 2H. Additionally, the COCH3 group's methyl protons would be a singlet around δ 2.6 (since it's next to a carbonyl, which deshields the methyl, but in acetophenone, the methyl is around δ 2.6 as a singlet because there's no splitting).

Wait, but the total number of protons in the aromatic region would be 4H (2H each for the two doublets). The methyl group would be 3H as a singlet. But wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene (6C) + COCH3 (2C) + Cl (0C) = 8C. So that's correct. The molecular formula would be C8H7ClO (if Cl is the halogen). Wait, benzene is C6H6. Replacing two Hs with substituents: COCH3 (which is -O-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, acetophenone is C6H5-C(=O)-CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 2 (C=O and CH3) = 8 carbons. Then adding a Cl as another substituent would require replacing another H, making the formula C8H6ClO. But the problem states the compound has 8 carbons in total. Wait, wait, the problem says "a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total." So the total carbons are 8, which includes the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring is 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons. So one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group with one carbon (like -CHO, aldehyde) and the other substituent is a halogen (no carbons). But wait, -CHO is a carbonyl (aldehyde) with one carbon. Then total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7. Not enough. Alternatively, the carbonyl is part of a ketone, like -COCH3 (two carbons). Then substituents are -COCH3 (two carbons) and -Cl (0 carbons), totaling 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. That works. So the compound is chlorobenzene with an acetyl group (COCH3) as the other substituent.

So the structure is 4-chloroacetophenone (para-substituted) or 3-chloroacetophenone (meta), etc. The NMR would depend on substitution pattern.

Assuming para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's say the protons adjacent to the acetyl (positions 3 and 5) are at higher ppm (δ ~7.8-8.0) as a doublet, and those adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) at δ ~7.2-7.5 as another doublet. The methyl group in acetyl would be a singlet around δ 2.6.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting might be more complex. For example, in 3-chloroacetophenone, the substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). Then the adjacent protons would be positions 2,6 (Cl) and 2,4 (COCH3). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to both Cl and COCH3. So the proton at position 2 would be adjacent to both substituents, leading to a different shift. Then positions 4 and 6 would each be adjacent to one substituent. This would result in three distinct sets of protons: position 2 (adjacent to both), position 4 (adjacent to COCH3), and position 6 (adjacent to Cl). But in reality, due to symmetry, maybe positions 4 and 6 are equivalent? No, in meta substitution, there's no symmetry. So each proton would be unique, leading to more peaks. But that's complicated, and the question is likely expecting a para substitution where there are two doublets.

Additionally, the coupling constants can help. In para-substituted benzene, the protons adjacent to each substituent are para to each other, so their coupling might be different. Wait, no, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. The protons adjacent to each substituent would be ortho to that substituent and meta to the other. So their coupling constants would be J ~8 Hz for ortho coupling. But in the case of two substituents, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the two sets of protons are each a doublet of doublets, but that's getting too detailed. The answer choices (which we don't have, but the user wants us to deduce) might include options with two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl.

Another possibility is that the substituents are ortho. In that case, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 2. Then the adjacent protons would be positions 3 and 6 (for substituent 1) and positions 1 and 3 (for substituent 2). Wait, that's overlapping. This would lead to complex splitting, but again, the question might be looking for a simpler case.

Given that the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, the halogen is directly attached to the ring. The carbonyl is also directly attached or part of a substituent. Since the total carbons are 8, the substituents must be -X (halogen) and -COCH3. So the compound is either para, meta, or ortho substituted.

Assuming para, the NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl. Let's check typical values:

- For acetophenone (C6H5COCH3), the aromatic protons are: ortho to COCH3 at δ ~7.8-8.0 (doublet), meta at δ ~7.4-7.5 (triplet), and para (if present) similar to meta. But in para-substituted acetophenone with another group, say Cl, the ortho protons to Cl would be around δ 7.2-7.5.

So in 4-chloroacetophenone, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho to Cl, so δ ~7.2-7.5, and those adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho to COCH3, δ ~7.8-8.0. Each pair would be a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent proton. The coupling constant between adjacent protons (J) is typically around 8 Hz. So each pair would be a doublet with J=8 Hz. The integration would be 2H each. The methyl group from COCH3 would be a singlet at δ ~2.6.

So the NMR data would show:

- A singlet at δ ~2.6 (3H, COCH3)
- Two doublets in the aromatic region: one around δ 7.8-8.0 (2H) and another around δ 7.2-7.5 (2H)

Additionally, there might be a peak for the proton(s) that are para to both substituents, but in para-substituted benzene with two groups, the remaining protons are in two pairs. Wait, no. In para-substituted with two groups, the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Wait, if substituents are at 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3), then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3. So those four positions each have protons, split into two pairs. So two doublets for 2H each.

Therefore, the correct 1H NMR data should include two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group. The actual chemical shifts would depend on the exact substituents, but the key points are the presence of these signals.

Another possibility is that the carbonyl is part of an ester group, like OCOCH3. For example, methyl benzoate has the ester group (COOCH3), which is two carbons (the carbonyl and the methoxy). If the substituents are Cl and OCOCH3, then the same logic applies. The methyl group in the ester would be a singlet around δ 3.9, and the aromatic protons would have similar shifts as before. But the problem states a carbonyl group, which is present in both ketones and esters.

But the question mentions a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So either a ketone or ester would work. However, the methyl group in the ketone (COCH3) is a singlet at δ ~2.6, while in the ester (OCOCH3), the methyl is at δ ~3.9 as a singlet. The problem doesn't specify which, but the total carbons must be 8. If it's an ester, the substituents would be OCOCH3 (two carbons) and Cl, totaling 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. So possible.

But the question is about the NMR data. Let's compare:

If the substituent is COCH3 (ketone):

- Aromatic protons adjacent to COCH3: δ ~7.8-8.0 (doublet)
- Aromatic protons adjacent to Cl: δ ~7.2-7.5 (doublet)
- Methyl: δ ~2.6 (singlet, 3H)

If substituent is OCOCH3 (ester):

- Aromatic protons adjacent to OCOCH3: might be slightly different, but still deshielded. For example, in methyl benzoate, the ortho protons are around δ 8.0-8.1.
- Methyl in ester: δ ~3.9 (singlet, 3H)

But the problem states the compound has 8 carbons. Let's check:

For acetophenone derivative (Cl and COCH3): 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. Correct.

For methyl ester (Cl and OCOCH3): 6 + 3 (OCOCH3 has three carbons? Wait, OCOCH3 is -O-CO-OCH3? No, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So OCOCH3 is -O-CO-CH3. So that's two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl. So 6 + 2 (OCOCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. Correct.

Wait, OCOCH3 is three atoms (O, CO, CH3), but in terms of carbons, it's two: the carbonyl carbon (from the COO) and the methyl carbon. So yes, two carbons. So both ketone and ester substituents would work. However, the methyl chemical shift would differ.

But the problem mentions a carbonyl group, which is present in both. However, the ester also has an oxygen, but the question doesn't mention anything about oxygen besides the carbonyl. The IR would show the carbonyl stretch (around 1700 cm⁻¹) and the aromatic-halogen bond (around, say, 500-800 cm⁻¹ for C-Cl). The ester might have a C-O stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the problem doesn't mention that, so we can't differentiate.

Assuming it's a ketone (COCH3), the methyl is at δ 2.6. If it's an ester (OCOCH3), methyl at δ 3.9. The question asks for the correct NMR data, so we need to see which makes sense.

But the problem states "di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total." So the two substituents must account for 2 carbons. Both COCH3 and OCOCH3 are two carbons. So either is possible. However, the ester group (OCOCH3) would have an oxygen, but the problem doesn't specify oxygen count. The question is about NMR, so the key difference is the methyl shift.

If the answer options include a singlet at δ 2.6, that's the ketone. If at δ 3.8-4.0, that's the ester. But since the problem doesn't give options, I have to assume. But maybe the intended answer is the ketone, as acetophenone is a common structure.

So putting it all together, the 1H NMR would have:

- A singlet at δ ~2.6 for the COCH3 methyl (3H)
- Two doublets in the aromatic region: one upfield (δ ~7.2-7.5, 2H) adjacent to Cl, and one downfield (δ ~7.8-8.0, 2H) adjacent to COCH3.

Additionally, there might be coupling between the aromatic protons. For example, each pair of protons adjacent to substituents would be coupled to their neighboring protons. In para-substituted, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) are each next to position 1 (Cl) and position 3 or 5. Wait, in para substitution, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). Each of these protons would be adjacent to two other protons. For example, proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3. Proton at position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and position 4 (COCH3). So the coupling would be between adjacent protons, leading to a doublet of doublets? But in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the symmetry might reduce the splitting.

Wait, maybe in para substitution, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and each is adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3. Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent, each adjacent to position 4 (COCH3) and position 2 or 6. So each of these protons would couple with two neighboring protons, leading to a doublet of doublets. But due to equivalence, maybe they appear as a doublet. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

In a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the remaining protons are in two pairs. Each pair is adjacent to one substituent and across from the other. For example, in 4-chloroacetophenone, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl and across from COCH3. The protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 and across from Cl. Each of these pairs would experience different electronic environments, hence different chemical shifts.

The coupling between adjacent protons (ortho coupling) is typically around 8 Hz. So each proton in positions 2 and 6 would couple with the proton at position 3 and position 1 (but position 1 is Cl, so only coupling with position 3). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3. But position 1 is Cl, so no proton there. So proton at position 2 couples only with position 3. Similarly, proton at position 3 couples with position 2 and position 4 (COCH3, no proton). So proton at position 3 only couples with position 2. Therefore, each of the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be a doublet due to coupling with position 3 and 5, respectively. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to draw it:

Positions:

1: Cl

2: H (adjacent to Cl and position 3)

3: H (adjacent to COCH3 and position 2)

4: COCH3

5: H (adjacent to COCH3 and position 6)

6: H (adjacent to Cl and position 5)

So protons at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to Cl and another H (positions 3 and 5). Protons at 3 and 5 are each adjacent to COCH3 and another H (positions 2 and 6). So each H at 2 and 6 couples with H at 3 and 5, respectively. But due to the ring's symmetry, protons 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. So each pair (2/6 and 3/5) would form a doublet, each split by their adjacent proton. So the H at 2 couples with H at 3, and H at 3 couples with H at 2 and H at 4 (but H at 4 is COCH3, no proton). Wait, no, position 4 is COCH3, so no H there. So H at 3 only couples with H at 2. Similarly, H at 5 couples with H at 6. Therefore, each H in the pair 2/6 would be a doublet due to coupling with 3/5, and vice versa. But since 2/6 are equivalent and 3/5 are equivalent, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The coupling constant J would be the same for both doublets, around 8 Hz.

So the aromatic region would have two doublets, each 2H, with J=8 Hz, at different chemical shifts. The methyl group would be a singlet.

Therefore, the correct 1H NMR data would include:

- δ 2.6 (s, 3H) for the COCH3 methyl
- δ 7.2-7.5 (d, 2H) for the protons adjacent to Cl
- δ 7.8-8.0 (d, 2H) for the protons adjacent to COCH3

This matches the expected pattern for para-substituted acetophenone with a chlorine substituent.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Let me start by breaking down the information.

First, the compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably a benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total carbon atoms are 8, so the benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) plus two substituents that together have 2 carbons. Wait, but substituents can be more than one carbon each. Wait, 8 total carbons. So 6 in the ring, so two substituents with a total of 2 carbons. That would mean each substituent is either a -Cl, -Br, etc. (halogen) and a carbonyl group. Wait, but a carbonyl is a C=O. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen.

But wait, the FTIR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). But the total carbons are 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. The substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), that's two carbons (the carbonyl is part of the acetyl group: O=C-OCH3? Wait, no. Acetyl is COCH3, which is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So that would be two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a different group. For example, a carboxylic acid (COOH) would be two carbons (COOH has one carbon, but wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon (the carbonyl carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen). Wait, no. The carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is one carbon (the C of COOH). So if one substituent is -COOH (carboxylic acid), that's one carbon, and the other substituent is a halogen. Then total carbons would be 6 + 1 + 0 = 7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't work. So maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester group. An ester group is like COOR. If R is a methyl group, then the ester would be OCOCH3. That's two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So that would add two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen. So total carbons 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a ketone (like a propanoyl group?), but wait, a ketone is R-CO-R. If the substituent is a ketone attached to the benzene ring, like acetophenone, which is a benzene ring with a COCH3 group. That's two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen. So that would fit the 8 carbons.

So the structure is likely a para or ortho or meta substituted benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen (like Cl or Br). Now, the NMR data would depend on the substituents' positions and their effects on the aromatic protons.

First, let's consider the substituents. The carbonyl group (COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), and the halogen (let's say Cl) is also an EWG, but depending on the position, they can direct the substituents. But since the question is about NMR, the key points are the chemical shifts and splitting patterns.

In a di-substituted benzene ring, the protons' chemical shifts depend on the substituents' positions. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two EWGs, the remaining protons would be deshielded. But if the substituents are meta or ortho, the patterns would differ.

But let's think about the possible structures. Let's assume the substituents are para. So, for example, para-chloroacetophenone. The structure would be Cl-C6H4-COCH3. In this case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the protons adjacent to the Cl and the COCH3, and the protons opposite. Wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would have Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4. Then the remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. But in para substitution, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl and COCH3, and positions 3 and 5 are meta to both substituents? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it mentally.

If the substituents are para, then each substituent is in the para position relative to the other. So the ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 3 (if meta) or position 4 (para). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's number the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (next to Cl at 1) and 3 and 5 (next to COCH3 at 4). Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). So the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5). But wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the remaining protons are in two equivalent pairs. For example, in para-xylene, the protons are all equivalent as two triplets. But when the substituents are different, like Cl and COCH3, the symmetry is broken, so the protons adjacent to each substituent would have different chemical shifts.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3. Then the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and adjacent to COCH3 (positions 4 and 5), but this might lead to more complex splitting.

But perhaps the key is that the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about the deshielding effects. The COCH3 group is a strong EWG, so the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded (upfield or downfield?). Wait, EWGs cause deshielding, moving the chemical shift to higher ppm. For example, nitro groups are strong EWGs and cause adjacent protons to be around 8.5 ppm. Similarly, a

I need to determine the appropriate 1H NMR data for a compound with a di-substituted benzene ring containing a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR analysis shows both a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Beginning with structure analysis, I have a benzene ring (6 carbons) with two substituents that must account for 2 additional carbon atoms. Given the FTIR data, one substituent must contain a carbonyl group while the other is a halogen. Since halogens don't contribute carbon atoms to the total count, the carbonyl-containing group must provide 2 carbon atoms.

Several possibilities exist for the carbonyl group: an acetyl group (COCH₃) has 2 carbons (one carbonyl carbon and one methyl carbon), which combined with the benzene ring (6 carbons) and a halogen (0 carbons) gives the required 8 carbon atoms. Similarly, a methyl ester group (COOCH₃) would also provide 2 additional carbons. A ketone structure like acetophenone (with COCH₃ attached to the benzene) would also fit the carbon count.

Therefore, the likely structure is a benzene ring with an acetyl group (or similar 2-carbon carbonyl group) and a halogen such as chlorine or bromine. The substituents could be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions.

For the NMR interpretation, I need to consider how these substituents affect the aromatic protons' chemical shifts. Both the carbonyl group and halogen are electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), which generally deshield adjacent protons, pushing their signals to higher ppm values.

In a para-substituted configuration (substituents at positions 1 and 4), the remaining aromatic protons would form two sets of equivalent protons: those adjacent to the halogen (positions 2 and 6) and those adjacent to the carbonyl group (positions 3 and 5). These would have different chemical shifts due to the different electronic effects of the two substituents.

If the substituents are meta to each other (positions 1 and 3), a more complex splitting pattern would result as the symmetry is reduced and the protons experience different electronic environments.

The electron-withdrawing nature of both substituents would cause deshielding of the adjacent protons, moving their signals to higher ppm values in the NMR spectrum.

I need to determine the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound comprising a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR analysis indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Let's analyze this information.

The compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, likely a benzene ring. Being di-substituted implies it has two substituents. With a total of 8 carbon atoms, the benzene contributes 6 carbon atoms, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents. Each substituent might have more than one carbon. However, considering 8 total carbons, we deduce that the ring's carbon count remains 6, with the substituents summing up to 2 carbons in total. One substituent might be a halogen like -Cl or -Br, while the other could be a carbonyl group. A carbonyl is a C=O, so one substituent might be a carbonyl-containing group and the other a halogen.

The FTIR confirms a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond's presence. This suggests one substituent is a carbonyl group (such as a ketone, aldehyde, or ester) and the other a halogen (like Cl, Br, or I). The benzene ring has 6 carbons, with the substituents contributing 2 carbons. If one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (COCH3), it includes two carbons: the carbonyl and the methyl carbon. Thus, the acetyl group provides two carbons. The remaining substituent, a halogen, adds no carbon. Therefore, the carbons total 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8, which is consistent.

Alternatively, suppose the carbonyl is part of another group, like an ester (COOR). If the ester has a methyl group as R, it forms OCOCH3, adding two carbons. Accompanied by a halogen, this again results in a total of 8 carbons, matching the structure requirement.

Another possibility is the presence of a ketone, say, a propanoyl group. A ketone connected to the benzene, akin to acetophenone, with a COCH3 group contributes two carbons, complemented by a halogen substituent, satisfying the 8-carbon condition.

Thus, the likely structure is a para, ortho, or meta-substituted benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen (Cl or Br). In NMR analysis, the positions of the substituents will influence the aromatic protons' signals.

The substituents' influence needs consideration. The carbonyl group (COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), as is the halogen (like Cl), although their substituent positions alter the aromatic protons' chemical shifts and splitting patterns.

In a di-substituted benzene, the protons’ chemical shifts depend on the relative positions of the substituents. In para substitution with both being EWGs, the protons are usually deshielded. If the substituents are meta or ortho, the effects will vary.

Assume para substitution, such as in para-chloroacetophenone, with the structure Cl-C6H4-COCH3. Here, the aromatic protons consist of two sets: adjacent to Cl and COCH3, and the protons across. In para substitution, the substituents are on opposite sides. The arrangement features Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4, leaving the remaining protons in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, and 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3. Therefore, the aromatic protons exist in two equivalent pairs.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the distances vary. The protons next to Cl at positions 2 and 6, and those next to COCH3 at 4 and 5, might exhibit complex splitting.

However, when the substituents are para, there are two equivalent sets of protons, influenced by deshielding effects. COCH3, being a strong EWG, deshields, shifting chemical shifts upfield or downfield, for example, placing nitro-adjacent protons around 8.5 ppm. Similarly, the COCH3 group’s EWGs deshield nearby protons.

So the ring would have two sets of protons: two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5).

Alternatively, if there's coupling between adjacent protons, maybe more splitting.\n\nWait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the protons adjacent to each substituent are not equivalent.

For example, each proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3. The proton at position 2 would couple with the proton at position 3 (which is adjacent to COCH3). Similarly, the proton at position 3 would couple with protons at positions 2 and 4 (but position 4 is the COCH3, so no proton there). Wait, the COCH3 is at position 4, so position 4 is substituted, so the adjacent positions are 3 and 5. So the proton at position 3 is adjacent to COCH3 and to protons at positions 2 and 4 (but position 4 is substituted). So the proton at position 3 would couple with the proton at position 2 and possibly position 4 (but position 4 is a substituent). So maybe the proton at position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4 (substituent), so coupling only with position 2. Similarly, the proton at position 2 is adjacent to Cl (position 1) and position 3. So the coupling would be between 2 and 3, leading to a doublet of doublets?

So each of these protons (2 and 6) would couple with the proton at position 3 (for position 2) and position 5 (for position 6?), but this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to think of the para-substituted case as having two sets of protons: those adjacent to Cl and those adjacent to COCH3, each as doublets due to coupling with their neighboring protons.\n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are meta to each other, the splitting might be more complex. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl), position 4 (adjacent to COCH3 at 3), and position 5 (adjacent to COCH3 at 3 and maybe another substituent). Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 3, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), position 4 is adjacent to COCH3 (position 3), and position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. This might lead to more complex splitting patterns with multiplets.\n\nBut the question is about the correct NMR data. The options aren't given, but the user expects me to deduce the correct data. So I need to think about typical shifts for aromatic protons adjacent to EWGs.\n\nFor example, protons adjacent to a nitro group (a strong EWG) are around 8.5 ppm. A carbonyl group like COCH3 (as in acetophenone) causes the adjacent protons to be around 7.8-8.0 ppm. A chlorine substituent would cause adjacent protons to be around 7.0-7.5 ppm, depending on the position and other substituents.\n\nWait, in chlorobenzene, the protons are around 7.0 ppm. In acetophenone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are around 7.8-8.0 ppm (as in the case of acetophenone's para position). Wait, acetophenone has a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. The ring protons ortho to the carbonyl are deshielded and appear around 7.8-8.0 ppm, the meta protons are around 7.4-7.5 ppm, and the para proton (if present) would be around 7.5 ppm. But in acetophenone, the para position is the methyl group, so the ring has three substituents: the carbonyl at position 1, and the methyl at position 4 (if para), but acetophenone is actually a mono-substituted benzene with the COCH3 group, so the ring has protons at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The ortho protons (2 and 6) are deshielded and appear around 7.8-8.0 ppm, the meta protons (3 and 5) around 7.4-7.5 ppm, and the para proton (4) around 7.5 ppm. But in our case, the compound is di-substituted with Cl and COCH3.\n\nAssuming para substitution, the protons adjacent to Cl would be at positions 2 and 6, and those adjacent to COCH3 at positions 3 and 5. The chemical shifts would be higher for the protons next to COCH3 (around 7.8 ppm) and lower for those next to Cl (around 7.2 ppm, since Cl is less deactivating than a carbonyl). Then, each set would be a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent protons. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl) would each couple with the protons at 3 and 1 (but position 1 is Cl, so only coupling with position 3). Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 (adjacent to COCH3) would couple with protons at 2 and 4 (position 4 is COCH3, so only coupling with position 2). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to visualize:\n\nIn para-substituted Cl and COCH3:\n\nPositions 1: Cl\n\nPosition 4: COCH3\n\nPositions 2 and 6: adjacent to Cl (position 1)\n\nPositions 3 and 5: adjacent to COCH3 (position 4)\n\nEach proton at position 2 is adjacent to Cl (position 1) and to position 3.\n\nProton at position 3 is adjacent to COCH3 (position 4) and to position 2 and 4 (but position 4 is substituent).\n\nSo the coupling would be between 2 and 3, and between 3 and 5? Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each proton is adjacent to two others. For position 2: adjacent to 1 (Cl) and 3. So proton 2 couples with proton 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4 (COCH3), so couples with proton 2 and 4 (but 4 is a substituent, so no proton there). So proton 3 only couples with proton 2. Similarly, proton 5 is adjacent to 4 (COCH3) and 6. Proton 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1 (Cl). So proton 6 couples with proton 5. Proton 5 couples with 6 and 4 (substituent), so only couples with 6.\n\nTherefore, the protons at 2 and 6 (each adjacent to Cl) would each be coupled to their neighboring protons (3 and 5, respectively). But since positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, the coupling would result in each set being a doublet. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be split by their adjacent proton (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. Similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 would each be split by their adjacent protons (2 and 6), also leading to a doublet. However, because of the symmetry, these would be two doublets each integrating to 2H.\n\nSo the NMR might show two doublets: one at higher ppm (around 7.8 ppm) for the protons adjacent to COCH3, and another at lower ppm (around 7.2 ppm) for the protons adjacent to Cl. Each doublet would integrate to 2H.\n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex. For example, in meta-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3, there might be three sets of protons with different chemical shifts. But the total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (which is two carbons), totaling 8. So the structure is benzene (6C) + Cl (0C) + COCH3 (2C) = 8C.\n\nAnother possibility is that the carbonyl is part of an ester group, like OCOCH3, which would also be two carbons. But the chemical shifts would be similar to the ketone.\n\nAdditionally, the methyl group in COCH3 would show up as a singlet around 2.6 ppm (if it's an acetyl group), integrating to 3H. The halogen (Cl) doesn't affect the proton NMR directly, except through its effect on the aromatic protons.\n\nSo putting it all together, the 1H NMR would have:\n\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets, each integrating to 2H, one at higher ppm (7.8 ppm) adjacent to COCH3, and another at lower ppm (7.2 ppm) adjacent to Cl.\n\n- A singlet for the methyl group in COCH3 at around 2.6 ppm (3H).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the correct 1H NMR data for the compound. Since the options aren't provided, I need to describe the expected signals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that would lead to different coupling. However, para is more likely for di-substituted rings with two EWGs because they are meta directors, but when both are EWGs, they might end up para to each other. Wait, actually, substituents that are meta directors would tend to be in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. The directing effects: an EWG is meta-directing. So if you have two EWGs on the ring, the second substituent would enter meta to the first. But if the first substituent is already present, the second would go meta. But in a di-substituted ring, the positions depend on the directing effects of both groups.\n\nWait, but in this case, the two substituents are a carbonyl group (EWG) and a halogen (also EWG). Both are meta directors. So when you have two meta-directing groups, they tend to be meta to each other. So the substituents would be in meta positions. Therefore, the structure would be meta-chloroacetophenone.\n\nIn that case, the aromatic protons would be in three different environments. Let's see: substituents at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). Then the protons at positions 2 (adjacent to Cl), 4 (adjacent to COCH3), 5 (adjacent to COCH3), and 6 (adjacent to Cl). Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3), then:\n\n- Position 2 is adjacent to Cl (1) and to position 3 (COCH3). So proton 2 is between Cl and COCH3.\n\n- Position 4 is adjacent to COCH3 (3) and position 5.\n\n- Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6.\n\n- Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and Cl (1).\n\nThis seems complicated. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, but position 2 is also adjacent to COCH3. Proton 4 is adjacent to COCH3. Proton 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. This might lead to more complex splitting patterns with multiplets.\n\nIn this scenario, the protons would not be equivalent, leading to more signals. For example:\n\n- Proton 2: adjacent to Cl and COCH3, so highly deshielded, maybe around 8.0 ppm.\n\n- Proton 6: adjacent to Cl and position 5, so around 7.2 ppm.\n\n- Proton 4: adjacent to COCH3 and position 5, around 7.8 ppm.\n\n- Proton 5: adjacent to 4 and 6, maybe around 7.5 ppm.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. The key is that meta substitution would lead to more complex splitting and possibly more signals, whereas para substitution would lead to two doublets.\n\nBut given that the total carbons are 8, and the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (which is two carbons), the structure is likely para-substituted, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group.\n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are ortho, but that's less likely because two EWGs would not favor ortho substitution.\n\nSo, summarizing, the 1H NMR should show:\n\n- Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, with chemical shifts around 7.2 ppm (adjacent to Cl) and 7.8 ppm (adjacent to COCH3).\n\n- A singlet at around 2.6 ppm for the methyl group (3H).\n\nAdditionally, there might be coupling between the aromatic protons. For para substitution, each proton is adjacent to one other proton (since the substituents are across from each other), leading to each set being a doublet. For example, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would each couple with the protons at positions 3 and 5 (which are adjacent to COCH3). Wait, but in para substitution, positions 2 and 6 are each adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3 or 5. So proton 2 is adjacent to Cl (1) and proton 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to proton 2 and COCH3 (4). So proton 2 would couple with proton 3, leading to a doublet. Similarly, proton 3 would couple with proton 2 and possibly others? No, because proton 3 is adjacent to COCH3 (no proton there), so only couples with proton 2. Therefore, each of the protons adjacent to Cl (2 and 6) would be a doublet due to coupling with their single neighbor (3 and 5, respectively), and the protons adjacent to COCH3 (3 and 5) would also be doublets due to coupling with 2 and 6. However, because of the symmetry, the two protons adjacent to Cl (2 and 6) are equivalent and would appear as one doublet integrating to 2H, and the two adjacent to COCH3 (3 and 5) would be another doublet integrating to 2H.\n\nTherefore, the aromatic region would have two doublets, each with 2H, at different chemical shifts. The methyl group from the acetyl would be a singlet at ~2.6 ppm (3H).\n\nSo the correct 1H NMR data would include these features. Since the question is multiple choice (I assume), the answer would be the one with two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445531, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4045, prompt_tokens=1586, total_tokens=5631, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The compound in question is a di-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a halogen atom as substituents, totaling 8 carbon atoms. The structure is likely **para-chloroacetophenone** (Cl-C₆H₄-COCH₃), where the benzene ring (6 carbons) is substituted with a chlorine atom (0 carbons) and an acetyl group (COCH₃, 2 carbons). The **1H NMR data** for this compound is as follows:

1. **Aromatic Protons**:
   - **Two doublets** are observed due to the para-substitution pattern:
     - **Protons adjacent to the chlorine (positions 2 and 6)**: These are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing Cl, appearing as a doublet at **δ ≈ 7.2–7.5 ppm** (integration: 2H). The splitting arises from coupling with the protons at positions 3 and 5.
     - **Protons adjacent to the acetyl group (positions 3 and 5)**: These are strongly deshielded by the carbonyl group, appearing as a doublet at **δ ≈ 7.8–8.0 ppm** (integration: 2H). The splitting is due to coupling with the protons at positions 2 and 6.

2. **Methyl Group (COCH₃)**:
   - A **singlet** at **δ ≈ 2.6 ppm** (integration: 3H), as the three equivalent protons on the methyl group are not split by neighboring protons.

**Summary of 1H NMR Data**:
- δ 7.2–7.5 ppm (2H, doublet, aromatic protons adjacent to Cl).
- δ 7.8–8.0 ppm (2H, doublet, aromatic protons adjacent to COCH₃).
- δ 2.6 ppm (3H, singlet, methyl group in COCH₃).

This pattern is consistent with the para-substitution of the electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and COCH₃), which create distinct environments for the aromatic protons and result in the described splitting and chemical shifts.

carbonyl group would deshield adjacent protons, leading to higher ppm. Halogens also deshield; Cl is an EWG, so adjacent protons would be deshielded as well.

So if the substituents are para, the protons adjacent to Cl and COCH3 would each be in different environments. Let's say the protons next to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded by Cl, and those next to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded by the carbonyl. The remaining protons (positions 4 and 6? Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3), then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3. Wait, but position 4 is the COCH3, so adjacent positions are 3 and 5. So the ring would have two sets of protons: two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and two protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5). Each of these sets would be equivalent due to symmetry. So in the NMR, we might see two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. Alternatively, if there's coupling between adjacent protons, maybe more splitting.

Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the protons adjacent to each substituent are not equivalent. Wait, no. If the substituents are para, then the ring has a plane of symmetry through the para axis. So positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each pair would have different chemical shifts because they're adjacent to different substituents.

So in the NMR, we would expect two doublets (each integrating to 2H) if the coupling is between adjacent protons. For example, each proton at position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3. The proton at position 2 would couple with the proton at position 3 (which is adjacent to COCH3). Similarly, the proton at position 3 would couple with protons at positions 2 and 4 (but position 4 is the COCH3, so no proton there). Wait, the COCH3 is at position 4, so position 4 is substituted, so the adjacent positions are 3 and 5. So the proton at position 3 is adjacent to COCH3 and to protons at positions 2 and 4 (but position 4 is substituted). So the proton at position 3 would couple with the proton at position 2 and possibly position 4 (but position 4 is a substituent). So maybe the proton at position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4 (substituent), so coupling only with position 2. Similarly, the proton at position 2 is adjacent to Cl (position 1) and position 3. So the coupling would be between 2 and 3, leading to a doublet of doublets? But if the substituents are para, maybe the coupling leads to specific patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the protons at positions 2 and 6 are each adjacent to Cl and to the proton at position 3 and 1 (but position 1 is Cl). So each of these protons (2 and 6) would couple with the proton at position 3 (for position 2) and position 5 (for position 6?), but this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to think of the para-substituted case as having two sets of protons: those adjacent to Cl and those adjacent to COCH3, each as doublets due to coupling with their neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta to each other, the splitting might be more complex. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl), position 4 (adjacent to COCH3 at 3), and position 5 (adjacent to COCH3 at 3 and maybe another substituent). Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 3, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), position 4 is adjacent to COCH3 (position 3), and position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. This might lead to more complex splitting patterns with multiplets.

But the question is about the correct NMR data. The options aren't given, but the user expects me to deduce the correct data. So I need to think about typical shifts for aromatic protons adjacent to EWGs.

For example, protons adjacent to a nitro group (a strong EWG) are around 8.5 ppm. A carbonyl group like COCH3 (as in acetophenone) causes the adjacent protons to be around 7.8-8.0 ppm. A chlorine substituent would cause adjacent protons to be around 7.0-7.5 ppm, depending on the position and other substituents.

Wait, in chlorobenzene, the protons are around 7.0 ppm. In acetophenone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are around 7.8-8.0 ppm (as in the case of acetophenone's para position). Wait, acetophenone has a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. The ring protons ortho to the carbonyl are deshielded and appear around 7.8-8.0 ppm, the meta protons are around 7.4-7.5 ppm, and the para proton (if present) would be around 7.5 ppm. But in acetophenone, the para position is the methyl group, so the ring has three substituents: the carbonyl at position 1, and the methyl at position 4 (if para), but acetophenone is actually a mono-substituted benzene with the COCH3 group, so the ring has protons at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The ortho protons (2 and 6) are deshielded and appear around 7.8-8.0 ppm, the meta protons (3 and 5) around 7.4-7.5 ppm, and the para proton (4) around 7.5 ppm. But in our case, the compound is di-substituted with Cl and COCH3.

Assuming para substitution, the protons adjacent to Cl would be at positions 2 and 6, and those adjacent to COCH3 at positions 3 and 5. The chemical shifts would be higher for the protons next to COCH3 (around 7.8 ppm) and lower for those next to Cl (around 7.2 ppm, since Cl is less deactivating than a carbonyl). Then, each set would be a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent protons. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 (adjacent to Cl) would each couple with the protons at 3 and 1 (but position 1 is Cl, so only coupling with position 3). Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 (adjacent to COCH3) would couple with protons at 2 and 4 (position 4 is COCH3, so only coupling with position 2). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to visualize:

In para-substituted Cl and COCH3:

Positions 1: Cl

Position 4: COCH3

Positions 2 and 6: adjacent to Cl (position 1)

Positions 3 and 5: adjacent to COCH3 (position 4)

Each proton at position 2 is adjacent to Cl (position 1) and to position 3.

Proton at position 3 is adjacent to COCH3 (position 4) and to position 2 and 4 (but position 4 is substituent).

So the coupling would be between 2 and 3, and between 3 and 5? Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each proton is adjacent to two others. For position 2: adjacent to 1 (Cl) and 3. So proton 2 couples with proton 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4 (COCH3), so couples with proton 2 and 4 (but 4 is a substituent, so no proton there). So proton 3 only couples with proton 2. Similarly, proton 5 is adjacent to 4 (COCH3) and 6. Proton 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1 (Cl). So proton 6 couples with proton 5. Proton 5 couples with 6 and 4 (substituent), so only couples with 6.

Therefore, the protons at 2 and 6 (each adjacent to Cl) would each be coupled to their neighboring protons (3 and 5, respectively). But since positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, the coupling would result in each set being a doublet. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be split by their adjacent proton (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. Similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 would each be split by their adjacent protons (2 and 6), also leading to a doublet. However, because of the symmetry, these would be two doublets each integrating to 2H.

So the NMR might show two doublets: one at higher ppm (around 7.8 ppm) for the protons adjacent to COCH3, and another at lower ppm (around 7.2 ppm) for the protons adjacent to Cl. Each doublet would integrate to 2H.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex. For example, in meta-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3, there might be three sets of protons with different chemical shifts. But the total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (which is two carbons), totaling 8. So the structure is benzene (6C) + Cl (0C) + COCH3 (2C) = 8C.

Another possibility is that the carbonyl is part of an ester group, like OCOCH3, which would also be two carbons. But the chemical shifts would be similar to the ketone.

Additionally, the methyl group in COCH3 would show up as a singlet around 2.6 ppm (if it's an acetyl group), integrating to 3H. The halogen (Cl) doesn't affect the proton NMR directly, except through its effect on the aromatic protons.

So putting it all together, the 1H NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, each integrating to 2H, one at higher ppm (7.8 ppm) adjacent to COCH3, and another at lower ppm (7.2 ppm) adjacent to Cl.

- A singlet for the methyl group in COCH3 at around 2.6 ppm (3H).

But wait, the question is about the correct 1H NMR data for the compound. Since the options aren't provided, I need to describe the expected signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that would lead to different coupling. However, para is more likely for di-substituted rings with two EWGs because they are meta directors, but when both are EWGs, they might end up para to each other. Wait, actually, substituents that are meta directors would tend to be in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. The directing effects: an EWG is meta-directing. So if you have two EWGs on the ring, the second substituent would enter meta to the first. But if the first substituent is already present, the second would go meta. But in a di-substituted ring, the positions depend on the directing effects of both groups.

Wait, but in this case, the two substituents are a carbonyl group (EWG) and a halogen (also EWG). Both are meta directors. So when you have two meta-directing groups, they tend to be meta to each other. So the substituents would be in meta positions. Therefore, the structure would be meta-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in three different environments. Let's see: substituents at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). Then the protons at positions 2 (adjacent to Cl), 4 (adjacent to COCH3), 5 (adjacent to COCH3), and 6 (adjacent to Cl). Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3), then:

- Position 2 is adjacent to Cl (1) and to position 3 (COCH3). So proton 2 is between Cl and COCH3.

- Position 4 is adjacent to COCH3 (3) and position 5.

- Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6.

- Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and Cl (1).

This seems complicated. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, but position 2 is also adjacent to COCH3. Proton 4 is adjacent to COCH3. Proton 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. This might lead to more complex splitting patterns with multiplets.

In this scenario, the protons would not be equivalent, leading to more signals. For example:

- Proton 2: adjacent to Cl and COCH3, so highly deshielded, maybe around 8.0 ppm.

- Proton 6: adjacent to Cl and position 5, so around 7.2 ppm.

- Proton 4: adjacent to COCH3 and position 5, around 7.8 ppm.

- Proton 5: adjacent to 4 and 6, maybe around 7.5 ppm.

But this is getting too speculative. The key is that meta substitution would lead to more complex splitting and possibly more signals, whereas para substitution would lead to two doublets.

But given that the total carbons are 8, and the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (which is two carbons), the structure is likely para-substituted, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group.

Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, but that's less likely because two EWGs would not favor ortho substitution.

So, summarizing, the 1H NMR should show:

- Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, with chemical shifts around 7.2 ppm (adjacent to Cl) and 7.8 ppm (adjacent to COCH3).

- A singlet at around 2.6 ppm for the methyl group (3H).

Additionally, there might be coupling between the aromatic protons. For para substitution, each proton is adjacent to one other proton (since the substituents are across from each other), leading to each set being a doublet. For example, the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would each couple with the protons at positions 3 and 5 (which are adjacent to COCH3). Wait, but in para substitution, positions 2 and 6 are each adjacent to position 1 (Cl) and position 3 or 5. So proton 2 is adjacent to Cl (1) and proton 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to proton 2 and COCH3 (4). So proton 2 would couple with proton 3, leading to a doublet. Similarly, proton 3 would couple with proton 2 and possibly others? No, because proton 3 is adjacent to COCH3 (no proton there), so only couples with proton 2. Therefore, each of the protons adjacent to Cl (2 and 6) would be a doublet due to coupling with their single neighbor (3 and 5, respectively), and the protons adjacent to COCH3 (3 and 5) would also be doublets due to coupling with 2 and 6. However, because of the symmetry, the two protons adjacent to Cl (2 and 6) are equivalent and would appear as one doublet integrating to 2H, and the two adjacent to COCH3 (3 and 5) would be another doublet integrating to 2H.

Therefore, the aromatic region would have two doublets, each with 2H, at different chemical shifts. The methyl group from the acetyl would be a singlet at ~2.6 ppm (3H).

So the correct 1H NMR data would include these features. Since the question is multiple choice (I assume), the answer would be the one with two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group.

The coupling patterns would depend on the substituents' positions. For example, in the para arrangement, each set of equivalent protons (ortho to each substituent) would split into doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons. Integration would show two sets of protons in a 2:2 ratio.

Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, the symmetry is lower, leading to more complex splitting patterns, possibly with multiplets. However, the para arrangement is more likely due to steric hindrance in the ortho position between the substituents.

The methyl group in the acetyl substituent (COCH₃) would appear as a singlet around δ 2.6 ppm, as there are no adjacent protons to split the signal. The aromatic protons would show two doublets in the range of δ 7.5-8.5 ppm, depending on the substituents' electron-withdrawing strength. For example, a chlorine substituent (strong EWG) would cause a higher shift than a bromine (weaker EWG compared to Cl).

In summary, the correct 1H NMR data should include a singlet for the methyl group in the acetyl substituent and two doublets for the aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H, with chemical shifts in the deshielded region. The exact ppm values would depend on the specific substituents and their positions, but the general pattern would align with this analysis.

The compound is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (COCH₃) and a halogen (Cl). The ¹H NMR data is as follows:

1. **Methyl Group (COCH₃):**  
   - **δ 2.6 ppm (singlet, 3H)**  
   The methyl group attached to the carbonyl is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl, appearing as a singlet due to no neighboring protons.

2. **Aromatic Protons Adjacent to Chlorine (ortho to Cl):**  
   - **δ 7.5 ppm (doublet, 2H, J = 8 Hz)**  
   These protons are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing chlorine atom. The doublet arises from coupling with the adjacent aromatic proton (meta to Cl).

3. **Aromatic Protons Adjacent to Carbonyl (ortho to COCH₃):**  
   - **δ 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H, J = 8 Hz)**  
   These protons experience stronger deshielding from the carbonyl group, shifting them further downfield. The doublet results from coupling with the adjacent aromatic proton (meta to COCH₃).

**Summary of ¹H NMR Data:**  
- δ 2.6 (s, 3H)  
- δ 7.5 (d, 2H, J = 8 Hz)  
- δ 8.0 (d, 2H, J = 8 Hz)  

This pattern is consistent with **para-chloroacetophenone** (Cl-C₆H₄-COCH₃), where the para substitution leads to two distinct doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group.

Chlorine, being an EWG, also deshields adjacent protons. The exact shifts depend on the substituent's nature and position.

In acetophenone derivatives, the aromatic protons adjacent to the acetyl group typically resonate around δ 7.8-8.0 ppm. The protons adjacent to Cl in chlorobenzene are around δ 7.0-7.5 ppm. However, when both substituents are present, their combined effect must be considered.

In para-substituted acetophenone with Cl, the two protons adjacent to Cl and the two adjacent to COCH3 would each form doublets. The coupling between the protons would lead to a doublet of doublets, but in para substitution, the protons are across from each other, so their coupling might be different. Alternatively, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in 4-chloroacetophenone, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) and 3 and 5 (ortho to COCH3) would each form doublets. The coupling between adjacent protons (J ~8 Hz) would split each into doublets. The integration would show two doublets each integrating to 2H. The methyl group (COCH3) would be a singlet around δ 2.6 ppm.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting pattern would be more complex. For example, in 3-chloroacetophenone, the substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3). The protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) and adjacent to COCH3 (positions 2 and 4) would lead to overlapping signals. However, this might result in a more complex multiplet.

Alternatively, ortho substitution (positions 1 and 2) would lead to different splitting. The protons adjacent to substituents would be in positions 3 and 6 (for Cl at 1 and COCH3 at 2), leading to different coupling patterns.

But considering the total carbons, the substituents must be such that the carbonyl is part of a group with one carbon (like COCH3) and the halogen (Cl) as another. So, the structure is likely para-substituted with Cl and COCH3.

In the NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. For example, in para-chloroacetophenone, the protons adjacent to Cl (ortho) would be deshielded and appear as a doublet around δ 7.5-7.8 ppm, and those adjacent to COCH3 (ortho) would be more deshielded, perhaps around δ 7.9-8.1 ppm. Each of these would integrate to 2H. The methyl group (COCH3) would be a singlet around δ 2.6 ppm. Additionally, if there are any other protons, but in this case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3, so the methyl is the only non-aromatic proton.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta position, the aromatic protons would split into more complex patterns. For example, two doublets of doublets or a triplet. However, para substitution is more likely to produce two distinct doublets.

Another possibility is that the substituents are a nitro group and a halogen, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, so nitro is not present. The carbonyl must be part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Since the total carbons are 8, and the ring is 6, the substituents must account for 2 carbons. An aldehyde (CHO) would only add one carbon, but then the other substituent would need to be a halogen (Cl), totaling 6 + 1 + 0 = 7 carbons, which is insufficient. Therefore, the carbonyl is likely part of a ketone (COCH3) or an ester (OCOCH3). Either way, the substituent would add two carbons.

Assuming COCH3 (acetyl group), the structure is Cl-C6H4-COCH3. The NMR would show:

- A singlet for the methyl group (3H) at δ ~2.6 ppm.

- Two doublets for the aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to Cl (ortho) and COCH3 (ortho) would each be a doublet. For example, in para substitution, the two ortho protons to Cl would be equivalent and couple with the adjacent protons, and similarly for the COCH3. The coupling constant between adjacent aromatic protons is typically around 8 Hz. So, each set would be a doublet. The chemical shifts would be higher for the protons adjacent to the stronger EWG. The COCH3 is a stronger EWG than Cl, so the protons adjacent to COCH3 would be more deshielded (higher ppm). For example, the COCH3-ortho protons might be around δ 8.0 ppm, and the Cl-ortho protons around δ 7.5 ppm. Each as a doublet integrating to 2H.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta position, the coupling might lead to more complex splitting. But para substitution is more straightforward and common for di-substituted rings with two EWGs.

Therefore, the correct 1H NMR data would include:

- A singlet integrating to 3H at δ ~2.6 ppm (COCH3).

- Two doublets in the aromatic region: one around δ 7.5 ppm (2H, J=8 Hz) and another around δ 8.0 ppm (2H, J=8 Hz).

Additionally, there might be a peak for the para-substituted protons, but in para substitution, the remaining protons (meta to substituents) would be equivalent. Wait, no. In para substitution, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent protons are positions 2,6 (ortho to Cl) and 3,5 (ortho to COCH3). Each of these pairs would be equivalent. The protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would each couple with their adjacent protons (positions 1 and 3 for position 2, and positions 5 and 1 for position 6). But since substituents are at 1 and 4, the coupling would be between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. However, in para substitution, the protons at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to Cl (position 1) and next to position 3 and 5, which are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). Therefore, each of these protons (2 and 6) would be adjacent to Cl and next to a proton adjacent to COCH3. Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 and next to protons adjacent to Cl. This would lead to each set (2,6 and 3,5) being split into doublets. For example, proton 2 is adjacent to Cl and next to proton 3 (adjacent to COCH3). The coupling between 2 and 3 would be J=8 Hz, leading to a doublet. Similarly, proton 3 is adjacent to COCH3 and next to proton 2 (adjacent to Cl), also leading to a doublet. Therefore, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts would differ based on the substituent's electron-withdrawing effect. The COCH3 group is a stronger EWG than Cl, so the protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (around 8.0 ppm), while those adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be around 7.5 ppm. Each as a doublet with J=8 Hz.

The methyl group (COCH3) would be a singlet at δ ~2.6 ppm. There are no other protons in the molecule, so the NMR would have three signals: two aromatic doublets and one methyl singlet.

Therefore, the correct 1H NMR data should include:

- δ 2.6 ppm (s, 3H) for the methyl group.

- δ 7.5 ppm (d, 2H, J=8 Hz) for the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl.

- δ 8.0 ppm (d, 2H, J=8 Hz) for the aromatic protons adjacent to COCH3.

This matches the expected pattern for para-substituted benzene with two electron-withdrawing groups. Other substitution patterns (ortho or meta) would result in different splitting patterns. For example, ortho substitution would lead to more complex coupling, possibly a doublet of doublets, and meta substitution might lead to two different coupling constants. However, para substitution is the most straightforward and likely scenario here.
